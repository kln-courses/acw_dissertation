H. I. H. Stewart1 When more than thirty years ago a friend suggested to me that, if I was planning to visit Greece in the Long Vacation, I might seek out an archaeologist by the name of Lord William Taylour at a Catholic Hall of Residence in Cambridge, I confess to having had some undergraduate hesitation about approaching so elevated a person. Little did I then imagine that I should be about to make a friend for life, even less that thirty years later my daughter would be making a similar journey with him and finding, just as I and so many others had done, new horizons opening in the company of this delightful and remarkable man. On paper, Billy Taylour had a career of almost fictional improbability, especially when set against the pattern of the time. He was born in 1904, the younger son of the head of a great Anglo-Irish family and of one of the most legendary ladies of the Edwardian stage. Though he had developed a deep interest in archaeology while still at Harrow and was enthused by the great discoveries in Egypt after the First World War, instead of going to university he was directed much against his will to a Wall Street banking house, a post made tolerable for him only by the opportunities it gave him for indulging his love of music at the New York Opera. Returning later to London he then ran the financial side of an interior decorating business (a much more adventurous occupation for one of his background than it would be today), until War service led him to the Mediterranean and in due course to the rank of Captain in the Derbyshire Yeomanry. After the War he was at last in a financial position to pursue the great interest of his life. In 1946 he went up to Trinity College, Cambridge, as a freshman at the age of forty-two to read archaeology under such distinguished figures as Professor Grahame Clark and the late Dr Glyn Daniel, both of whom have remarked that they were somewhat daunted (needlessly, of course) at the prospect of teaching a pupil older than themselves. During the latter half of his life he was to become one of the most respected archaeologists of his generation, joining that select company of those who have made major discoveries at Agamemnon's city of Mycenae. In his apprentice years he worked with such renowned figures as Katherine Kenyon in Tripolitania, Alan Wace at Mycenae and Carl Biegen at Pylos, where he helped to uncover the best preserved of all the Mycenaean palaces. After Wace's death he took over direction of the work of the British team at Mycenae on the lower slopes within the citadel. But his own seasons at Mycenae in the 1950s and 1960s were much more than the completion of another's work: for in addition to the structural features that emerged, he not only found the first fragmentary Linear B clay tablets to come from the citadel of Mycenae itself and frescoes of remarkable quality and interest, but also a room full of extraordinary figurines and pottery snakes that have been a topic of lively debate ever since and have opened up new ideas about religion and cult in the Mycenaean age. In recent years most branches of research, in the humanities no less than the sciences, have become increasingly specialised and academic and in consequence their leading exponents, perhaps inevitably, have become more competitive. Billy Taylour, as a scholar of independent means and without concern for a formal career, belonged to a different tradition. If he did not feel the same urgency to publish as his professional colleagues, his disinterested approach was undoubtedly a critical factor in obtaining permits to continue excavation at a time when tourism was rapidly developing and the Greek authorities were increasingly concerned to retain direct control of their most important archaeological sites. His love of Greece, his grasp of its language, his ability to get on with people, his humour, his courtesy, his modesty - these were some of the qualities that gained him welcome from his Greek hosts at every level. Billy was happiest when directly engaged in the business of excavation, and, in the judgement of everyone, he was exceptionally good at it. His excavations, and the whole expeditions to Greece of 1 Editor's note: the following address was read at the Memorial Service for Lord William Taylour held on 28 April 1990 in the Chapel of Trinity College, Cambridge. XXV</page><page sequence="23">xxvi B. H. I. H. STEWART which they were part, were meticulously planned and conducted with a precision that surely owed something to his military experience. He was a person of great self-discipline and led his team of helpers and workmen by example. He always had time to guide and encourage his younger colleagues and was generous in sharing credit. He himself had amazing physical stamina, working long hours each day, bare-headed under the blazing sun, and generally preferring to use a break in the middle of the day for a brief siesta rather than for taking lunch. I wonder whether any excavator has ever made better use of the time and resources at his disposal. Although Billy Taylour's archaeological reputation was more that of the practical excavator than the critical prehistorian, he nonetheless produced some notable publications. His Ph.D. thesis on Mycenaean pottery from Italy, published in 1958, immediately became a standard work of reference. A few years later he was persuaded by Glyn Daniel - persuaded, one has to say, somewhat reluctantly - to write a book about the Mycenaeans, a well-balanced and thoroughly sane account of a subject that has not always enjoyed such reliable treatment. This was the work by which he became most widely known, particularly after the second edition included his own famous discoveries from the cult area at Mycenae. It is good to know that through the Mediterranean Archaeological Trust, which he set up and funded to support his work in Greece, a more detailed record of the excavations on which he embarked in his final years, under the title Well Built Mycenae, is being taken forward by his colleagues. Perhaps it was because Billy had less enthusiasm for writing than for digging that the formal honours did not come his way. He never sought such things, but as an amateur in a highly professional field he did welcome reassurance that his work was appreciated, and it is sad that in those days neither his college nor his university felt moved to recognise his very unusual achievements. It is impossible to think of Billy for more than a moment without recalling his tremendous love of life and his sense of humour. No one who travelled out to Greece or back with him is ever likely to forget the experience. At the wheel of his Land Rover he would drive like a maniac, never apparently daunted by the prospect of a head-on collision, although somehow he never had one. On one occasion, when travelling at great speed and stopped by the Italian police, he quickly reminded his passengers that none of them understood a word of Italian and, after a period of evident incomprehension, asked everyone to produce their passports. The traffic policeman wisely gave up. Another time he had a marvellous row with a Yugoslav hotelier in Ohrid who charged him double the tariff quoted the night before and made it worse by saying that there was a surcharge for non- Communists. But it was equally typical of Billy, as one of his companions has related, that one evening in Italy, when they found a drunken peasant who had fallen from his scooter and injured himself, Billy bundled both peasant and scooter in the back of the Land Rover on the knees of his passengers and took him to his home many miles away in a remote village. Billy's journeys were rarely without such unexpected incidents, and the itinerary itself was always most carefully arranged so as to include maximum opportunities for sightseeing. Ancient sites, Byzantine monasteries, Renaissance palaces, Baroque churches and, of course, visits to Bayreuth for Wagner if possible - all these came within the amazing range of Billy's knowledge and interest, in which he would invite us to share. Not far beneath the surface, however, there was a profound and serious side. Many of Billy's younger travellers have commented on the way he exercised a formative influence on their lives. One of his friends, from an Oriental country where such things are perhaps more sharply perceived, has remarked on the internal force he posessed. Without any excess of piety, he was a holy man and a person of deep integrity. In the words of the Chairman of the Royal Fine Art Commission, Norman St John Stevas, who knew him at St Edmund House, he was 'a very good Catholic in a balanced kind of way ... he would attend Mass in the Chapel not every day, but every other day. Somehow this sums him up for me. There was nothing of the fanatic in that quizzical makeup.' As Treasurer of the University Catholic Association for many years, he helped Mgr. Alfred Gilbey to turn Fisher House into a place where the Catholic chaplaincy in Cambridge flourished and where non-Catholics also found a welcome. For his long and self-effacing service to the Catholic church, he was in due course made a Knight Commander of the Order of St Gregory the Great. He had a traditionalist view of his church and of public affairs; he had high principles and old-fashioned standards. No one could have been more suited to have presided, as he did for more than 30 years, over the Strafford Club, dedicated in the words of its toast 'to the Immortal Memory of Thomas Wentworth, ist Earl of Strafford', whom he saw as a victim of his sense of public duty. And I might add that no one but Billy could have managed to look so distinguished on these occasions in a brown velvet dinner jacket. We all have our special memories of Billy. Mine is of arriving at St Aubyns, before a Strafford dinner perhaps, coming into a drawing room that still possessed a hint of the interior decorator of the 1930s, Billy stretched out in his armchair, a new book on the Aegean Bronze Age on his lap, a plate</page><page sequence="24">A MEMOIR OF THE LATE LORD WILLIAM TAYLOUR xxvii of cucumber sandwiches beside him, and Das Rheingold pouring out of the hi-fi by the window. Behind him, and with its own little watering can, was an exotic plastic plant of which he was immensely proud and a cocktail shaker containing Martini of unimaginable ferocity, and all the while watching him across the room the smiling beauty of Sir William Orpen's portrait of the mother he loved so much. One of his colleagues at Mycenae recalls how, when news of her imminent death came through, he left immediately for home without changing. Each year thereafter, on the anniversary, he had a Mass said for her soul in the tiny chapel of the Panagia on the ridge above the Treasury of Atreus and then brought down to distribute to all present the ceremonial cake of grain, honey and spices that might have come straight from the pages of Homer. As with the warriors of the Iliad and the Nibelungs of Wagner, there was something of an epic quality about Billy himself. He made his last working trip to Greece in 1988 at the age of 84. In the previous year or so, for the first time, he had begun to feel weary and to make his final plans. He spoke contentedly of how he had visited Headfort, the great house of his childhood; it was no longer in the family, but there was still a place on a small island where he would be laid to rest beside his parents and his brother. There are not many who have looked towards death with such serenity. At a great age and after so full a life, the sudden news in December still came as a blow; for I think we had all come to regard him as indestructible. But so in truth he is, and today we rejoice that he lives on in the hearts of his family and his countless friends. And when the time came, true to form, he left immediately for home, without changing.</page><page sequence="25">Fig. i. Map of Laconia and Kythera.</page><page sequence="26">Introduction R.Janko 1. THE SELECTION OF THE SITE AND THE EXCAVATIONS OF 1959-63 nàç) ôè Aaxcovíôa yaiav àÀiGxécpavov TTTOÀíeBQOv I i^ov 'along the Laconian coast they reached the sea-girt town' Homeric Hymn to Apollo 410-11 The British interest in Laconia goes back to the great archaeologist Alan Wace. In 1909, publishing sherds from the inland site of Geraki, the Geronthrae of antiquity (see fig. i), he wrote: 'till further finds of early objects are made in Laconia it is useless to discuss further these sherds from Geraki in detail, for they have no context. But the exploration of Helos, when it comes, will probably throw more light on this subject'.1 The only previous work in the region was that of Tsountas at Vapheio.2 In the light of the finds from Ayios Stephanos, the sherds from Geraki can now be seen to represent all the wares and phases of the local MH pottery, including what we call Dark Burnished (incised), Dull Painted, Matt Painted, Lustrous Decorated and Polychrome Minoan wares. The recent Dutch excavations there have revealed a multi-period settlement with burials; this resembles Ayios Stephanos, except that occupation started in the Final Neolithic and ceased towards the end of the MH period.3 A third important site in the area that has been investigated is Pavlopetri, on the coast to the south-east near Neapolis (see fig. i). Pavlopetri now lies largely under the sea, but once controlled the isthmus of the former promontory Elaphonisos (the Onugnathus of antiquity) and the rich agricultural plain of modern Neapolis. Pavlopetri was the object of a survey by a British team in 1968,4 which revealed evidence of occupation and burials throughout the Bronze Age, from EH II to LH IIIB; it has remained something of an 'archaeological riddle'.5 Because of its location and its different state of preservation, Pavlopetri sheds light on Ayios Stephanos almost as much as Ayios Stephanos illuminates it in its turn. In 1959 Laconia was almost a terra incognita. Hardly any prehistoric sites had been excavated, and nowhere had finds been made attesting occupation throughout the Bronze Age except at Amyclae (see fig. i), a few km south of Sparta. Lord William Taylour chose to investigate Ayios Stephanos because the pioneering extensive survey by Helen Waterhouse and Richard Hope Simpson had recently revealed that it was one of the largest and most promising Bronze Age settlements in the region.6 Since they had found sherds from all three of the main phases of the Bronze Age lying on the surface, he hoped to establish a stratified sequence of prehistoric pottery for Laconia. Since the site lies near the main sea-route from western Crete and Kythera to the mainland, and merely 6 km south-east of Psephi (see fig. i), the only source of the ornamental stone called lapis lacedaemonius, which was used in Crete, he also hoped to establish how Minoan influences were transmitted to the Greek mainland, especially in pottery decoration and fabric. Last but not least, his wish to discover the whereabouts of Helos, mentioned as 'a town by the sea' by Homer in the Catalogue of Ships,7 also contributed to his decision to excavate at Ayios Stephanos. Aegean archaeology would be much the poorer were its devotees ever to forget that their discipline began in a romantic fascination with the Homeric epics. It has been proposed that Carl Biegen first found the site of Ayios Stephanos. Blegen's diary records a visit to Monemvasia: 1 Wace iQOQ-10, 7K. 2 Banou iqq6, q. 3 Weingarten et al. ìqqq. 4 Harding et al. 1969. 5 Banou 1996, 127. 6 Taylour 1972, 205, citing Waterhouse and Hope Simpson 1060, 07-102. 7 Iliad u 584.</page><page sequence="27">2 R. JANKO On the way back we stopped at several places to oxyderk8 for prehistoric sites. We found one such site just w of the village of Skala on a low green hill to the w of the road. On the hill are the ruins of a small Byzantine church. The hill is surrounded by the streams from a great kephalari which rises at the village of Skala. The name by which the hill is known is Souroukla. I collected a good number of sherds on the hill - apparently Early Helladic &amp; Middle Helladic &amp; some Mycenaean as well. 9 MH, late Mycenaean - perhaps LH IIIB - and Geometric sherds found at Souroukla are now in the American School of Classical Studies at Athens; there is no EH material.10 However, this site is not Ayios Stephanos, which has no Geometric material and is not surrounded by streams from the springs at Skala. Instead, Souroukla must be identical with Ayios Nikolaos,11 where MH and LH IIIA-B sherds (kylix bases and a stirrup jar) have been found.12 The Medieval chapel of Ayios Nikolaos lies north of the road on 'a knoll c. 6 m high', between branches of the streams of the Vasilopotamos river which bubbles up west of Skala in a group of springs.13 Instead, Ayios Stephanos may perhaps have been the 'low hill seawards from Stefaniá' where Biegen is reported to have found Mycenaean sherds.14 But the credit for discerning the importance of the site properly belongs to Richard Hope Simpson and Helen Waterhouse. Taylour describes it as follows: Ayios Stephanos ... is about 45 km. SSE. of Sparta and distant just under two km. from the sea. At one time it undoubtedly was a promontory jutting out into the sea . . . The site is a flat-topped hill, the habitable part of which covers an area of roughly 45,000 square metres. It is steep on the north and east. To the west it links up with the foothills of the Taygetus range. In recent years the hill has been used for pasturage, but at one time it was almost certainly cultivated and the plough has done a lot of damage to the underlying walls and burials.15 As we will see in §4, the elevation of the hilltop has not been precisely ascertained, but it rises some 30-40 m above the plain (plate 1 0), which is itself 2-3 m above sea-level. It lies 'at the eastern end of a limestone spur projecting from the barren range of hills on the southwest edge of the plain'.16 The sole modern village nearby is the hamlet of Souli, with Stephaniá to the north. For the geographic and geo-archaeological characteristics of Ayios Stephanos and the surrounding region see Chapters 13 and 14 §1 below. No detailed survey of the site was undertaken before excavations began in 1959, under the auspices of the British School at Athens and with the permission of the Greek Archaeological Service. However, the excavation records and Hope Simpson's sketch map (fig. ii) reveal that low terrace walls divided the hilltop into small fields, with an upper and a lower oblong terrace running along the south edge of the plateau across what was to be Areas Beta and Lambda; a roughly diamond-shaped field occupied the top of the hill. The area had been used for arable cultivation, especially of wheat, and for pasturing sheep and goats after the harvest until sowing. The hilltop supported a few olive trees: a massive specimen on its south-east brow, with good views except to the north-west, was to provide shade for the base-camp of the dig, and there were one or two more near the western edge where the rock drops down abruptly to the chapel of St Stephen, after which the site is named. The north and north-eastern slopes of the hill were too steep for cultivation; Waterhouse and Hope Simpson detected signs of ancient walling in two places along the northern slope.17 The remains of walls that they observed in two locations on the south slope, with a suggested bastion in between, were probably the foundations of a Medieval building, possibly Structure Lambda VII, upon which modern terrace walls had been built. The possible ruins of a house that they noted on the south side of the plateau were probably those of another Medieval building. The south and south-eastern slopes had been cultivated; the flat expanses at the foot of the hill were densely planted with rows of olive trees with room to sow wheat in the rows between. The draining of the marshes below the site, however, greatly reduced its relative agricultural value, and by 1959 the plateau had long ceased to be cultivated: it was covered with a dense undergrowth of sage-bush and tall maquis on the plateau and tall grasses on the slopes, and was used only for grazing. In 1990 the plateau was ploughed.18 It has since been enclosed with fences and turned into an artificially irrigated orange-grove, which must have damaged the site and will make any future excavation more difficult.19 8 'Oxyderk' is a wonderful neologism derived from ancient Greek ò^uÔ8Qxr|ç, 'sharp-eyed'; Oxyderkô is an epithet for Athena in Pausanias n 24.2. 9 21 November 1021, quoted by Coulson 1992, 89 n. 11. 10 Coulson 1QQ2, 8q-Ql. 11 See fig. 13.2 and Banou 1996, 54 n. 86. 12 Hope Simpson 1981, 106. 13 Cf.

The first two seasons of digging, for four weeks each in 1959 and i960, were concentrated on the flat top of the hill (see fig. iii). The excavators laid out trenches in many parts of the site, cleared considerable areas down to bedrock and found numerous walls and burials, together with pottery and small finds from most of the periods represented. However, the hilltop turned out to have been heavily eroded, and little soil remained. Accordingly, when excavations recommenced in 1963 for eight weeks, deep stratified deposits were sought and found to the south and south-west of the summit in two Areas, Beta and Gamma (see fig. iv). During the excavations of 1959-63 a total area of c. 696.7 m2 was dug. Even so, as is clear from the publication of these excavations,20 the dating of the EBA and MBA phases could be understood only in general terms, the Medieval phase passed unrecognised, and the architecture often remained obscure. 20 Taylour 1972.</page><page sequence="29">4 R. JANKO 2. THE EXCAVATIONS OF 1973-77 The excavations described in this volume cover three seasons, 1973, 1974 and 1977. The 1973 and 1977 seasons were full seasons of approximately seven weeks, of which six were taken up with excavation. The same routine was planned for 1974, but in that year excavation had to be suspended on two occasions on account of the crisis in Cyprus; in total, excavation lasted for only four weeks. The unevenness in the type and number of plans and sections in this volume was caused in part by this disruption, since many vital drawings were never made or were only sketches. Even the renewal of the excavations in 1973 was fraught with difficulty, as Taylour himself recorded in a draft of this introduction (the annotations are mine): It was decided to resume the excavations as a result of the still unanswered questions that the three previous seasons had raised. At the start of excavations in 1973 it was intended that the Gamma trenches dug in 1959 and those of the Beta Area, which was last excavated in 1963,21 would be investigated further. Since that time the site had become completely overgrown by scrub of a jungle- like nature, and the outlines of the old trenches were no longer identifiable. Three test trenches, named Epsilon, Zeta and Eta, were dug to locate them. These attempts proved to be unsuccessful, and it was not until the arrival of the architect, M. J. Goalen, some three weeks later that the position of the old trenches was precisely established. However, the test trenches had produced much interesting material, and in spite of the fact that the old trenches had in the meantime been identified, it was decided to continue their excavation. It was not, however, possible to investigate them further in subsequent seasons because of the requirement to requisition, and pay for, the land where we wished to carry out future excavations; the cost of including these exploratory trenches within the requisitioned area would have been prohibitive. Although two of the test trenches were only a few metres away from one another, they produced surprisingly different results. In Area Epsilon the pottery was predominantly LH, with very little Medieval, and M H levels only appeared at a depth of 2 m. In Area Zeta the Medieval levels were well represented, and after their removal one was almost immediately among MH structures that were found to rest on EH strata, including walls of that period. Area Eta was c. 26 m. distant from the other two. Here MH strata were found almost immediately below the surface. There was very little Medieval or Mycenaean, but good EH pottery and one wall of that period were discovered at no great depth and just above the rock. During these three seasons the excavation was based at the Hotel Alsos in Skala. During all that time we had the able advice and assistance of Mr George Steinhauer, Ephor of Laconia, to whom I owe a deep debt of gratitude. I also had the help of people of other nationalities as well as my own. In 1973 there was a strong American contingent that included Professor Jeremy Rutter, as he became shortly afterwards, and his wife Sally, who worked on the drawing of small finds. Other American participants were Mr John Younger, Mr David Parshall, who joined me again in 1974, and Mr Bax Barton. Dr Ingrid Strom from Copenhagen assisted us part of the time. My own countrymen included Dr Anthony F. Harding, Mrs Regina Halden, Miss Frances Gleave (now Mrs Rolfe Kentish), Mr Edmund Bennett and Mr William McGeachen. Mr Martin Goalen officiated as architect both in 1973 and 1974, when Mrs Karen Goalen joined us. Mr John Bintliff was with us part of the time. Towards the end of the dig, visits were made by Professor George Rapp, Professor Oliver Dickinson and Dr Roger Howell, who gave us useful advice on the MH pottery. The 1973 campaign covered the latter part of June, the whole of July and a few days in August. The summer that year was exceptionally hot. There were two heat waves, of which the first was the worst, the temperature reaching 1 12o F in the shade on one day, when excavation had to be temporarily suspended. Not more than seven workmen were employed as a rule; Vassilis Koumandaros was in charge of them.22 The area chosen for excavation was the southern part of the crest of the hill, and in particular the area of the trenches Gamma 1, 1959, and of Beta 1963 (see fig. iv). A new trench, Lambda 1, was opened by Dr Harding to the w of Beta 6/1; during eleven days of digging, further rooms to the w of the complex building first located in 1963 in the 21 Taylour 1072, 253-61. 22 In 1963, experienced workmen had to be brought from Mycenae, because the locals had no particular expertise. In 1973 John Younger brought three workmen from Knossos to help train those from Stephaniá: these were Antonis Zidionakis, Antonis Kritsalakis and Georgios Vassilakis, known as Barba Georgo. In 1974 and 1977 the supervisor was Vassilis Kriezis. The workmen included P. Agraniotis, P. Angelopoulos, A. Athanassakos, P. Diamantakos, Ch. Dimitriou, Vasiliki Gouvousi, Ph. Karelas, V. Katsianis, Ch. and Th. Konstantarakos, I. Kordias, N. and S. Koumandaros, E., Ph., V. G. and V. I. Kriezis, G. Madalas, A. and D. Mylonakos, S. Pavlakos, V. Photakos, S. Sanidas and N.

Another trench, Area Nu, was started under Professor Rutter to the s of Gamma 1, 1959. This revealed two rooms of a house of the Transitional Period MH III/LH I. In 1974 I again had the efficient cooperation of Professor Rutter, assisted by Mr David Parshall, and Dr Harding as trench supervisors, but, with the exception of Frances Gleave, the other members of the team were new. Once more I was glad to have several Americans in my party. Through the courtesy of the Center for Field Research, Massachusetts, I had the services of Mrs Kay Stein. I was joined by Dr Merle Langdon of the American School of Classical Studies and Ms Deborah Wince of the University of Cambridge and Wisconsin. Other new members were Mr Warwick Burton, Mr Richard Janko, Mr Sebastian Rahtz and Mr Guy Sanders. Mr Stamatis Verendis, representing the Ministry of Culture, spent some time with us. We had a visit from Professors John Kraft and Stanley Aschenbrenner, and at the end of the season from Dr Harriet Blitzer and Dr Vance Watrous. In spite of the troubled international background, which was responsible for the suspension of digging on more than one occasion, some progress in excavation was possible. Two cist burials were uncovered in the Beta Area. The clearance of the two-room house in Area Nu was completed; it was to form the subject of Dr Rutter's publication The Transition to Mycenaean.23 The relationship of the newly uncovered rooms in trench Lambda 1 to the building of 1963 was clarified. An innovation was the introduction, at the suggestion of Professor Rutter, of a water-sieve, which was generously loaned to us by the American School.24 The 1977 season lasted six weeks, of which five were spent digging. Once more a large team participated, four members of which were American: the indispensable Jerry Rutter, Miss Jan Motyka (Mrs Sanders to be), Mr Bruce Follansbee and Mr Roger Ulrich. Frances Gleave, Richard Janko and Guy Sanders again joined us; Frances was responsible for the drawing of small finds. The new recruits were Mr Peter Wright, who efficiently managed the complicated Area Beta, Mr Charles Bennett, Mr Andrew Howe Brown, Miss Sarah Croney, Mr David Hart, Mr Nicholas Richardson and Miss Nadia Charalambidou from Cyprus. Mr Rolfe Kentish acted as architect, and several of the plans are his work. A new trench was opened up in Area Lambda, which exposed the piers of a vaulted Medieval building, possibly a farmhouse. In Area Nu the apse of a late MH I building was revealed under the two rooms of the MH/LH Transitional Period. A water-sieve was in operation during the season as before. During the later excavations a further area of c. 251.6 m2 was dug; thus the total area excavated at Ayios Stephanos was c. 948.2 m2. Of this total, 899.1 m2 or 94.8% lay within the 91m contour on fig. iii, with the remaining 49.1 m2 lying between that contour and the 82 m contour. The area within the 91m contour is 14,695 m2 in extent, of which 6.1% was excavated. The area within the 95 m contour is 7,850 m2, of which 768.6 m2 or 9.8% was dug. The plateau itself, as defined by the 100 m contour, is 2,190 m2 in area, of which c. 348.0 m2 or 15.9% was excavated. Thus, except on the plateau itself, the site was sampled rather than systematically cleared. Nor were its immediate surroundings the object of any further survey, with the result that, if there was a separate cemetery, its location remains unidentified. The excavations did not prove that Ayios Stephanos was Homeric Helos. Indeed, Bronze Age Helos probably lay on the eastern side of the plain. Taylour's trial excavations of 1959 confirmed that Asteri-Karaouzi opposite Ayios Stephanos was occupied until LH IIIC Middle and again in the Protogeometric period. However, this site was too denuded by erosion to merit further investigation.25 Since a sustantial alluvial delta already existed during the Bronze Age, it has been proposed that Bronze Age Helos lies under recent alluvium near the modern village of that name.26 However, any such settlement would have had to have been built on sandy or swampy land near the ancient mouth of the Eurotas, and we do not know whether the Mycenaeans would have inhabited such a flood- prone location. The theory that Mycenaean Helos lay at Skala,27 i.e. at Ayios Nikolaos, rests only on the attractiveness of the location on a hill between two rivers. In fact the regional capital was probably 23 Rutter and Rutter 1076. 24 Only selected baskets of soil were wet-sieved. The procedure increased the recovery of lithic fragments, but was very disappointing in terms of organic remains; in this respect simple flotation is now known to yield better results, since fragile carbonised material is destroyed when it is stirred with stones and earth in the sieve. All other baskets of soil were dry-sieved using a 1 x 1 cm mesh; this was the standard procedure in the earlier excavations also. According to the catalogue compiled by E. B. French and Clarissa de Waal, the residue from flotation is now stored in Apotheke B' of Sparta Museum in box 100, with samples and dry residue from 1974 in boxes 96-7, the same from 1977 in box 98, and soil samples and residue from 1959-60 in box 00. 25 Tavinnr 1 n^*? 9^9-0 26 Kraft, Aschenbrenner and Rapp 1077, 04.7. 27 Banou 1996, 93-4.</page><page sequence="34">8 R. JANKO south-east of Asteri at Ayios Strategos, which had the only known tholos tomb in South Laconia. This question is discussed further below.28 Despite the limitations of the work at Ayios Stephanos, Taylour's aim of establishing a set of ceramic sequences for the prehistoric pottery of the south-eastern Péloponnèse was splendidly fulfilled by the publication of results from the 1973-74 excavations in Area Nu / Gamma 1 by Rutter and Rutter 1976. In the present volume, these results are somewhat modified and the chronological range is further extended. Areas Zeta and Eta, dug down to bedrock in 1973, yielded deep stratified deposits of the highest importance for the EBA and MBA sequence. Despite the difficulties inevitable in the understanding of a multi-period tell site, the renewed excavations and subsequent study have revolutionised our understanding of the succession of the ceramic phases at Ayios Stephanos, which are now known to span the entire Bronze Age, from EH I to LH IIIC Early, with the exception of EH III, which is hardly known in Laconia. A Medieval phase, reliably dated from numismatic evidence, has also been recognised. Although there were few truly spectacular finds, save for the Linear A inscription 6154, this clarification of the site's evolution in ceramic and architectural terms, especially when taken together with geo-archaeological studies of the surrounding region, sheds much light on the history of Laconia throughout the Bronze Age and again in the Medieval era, and fully justifies the enterprise that began in 1959. Further excavation at the site would add significantly to our knowledge, although its history now seems very clear. One would like clarification of the date of fortifications on the north slope, and of the transition from EH to MH. But for the Mycenaean period at least it would be more valuable to see excavations at sites that might yield archives of texts in Linear B, such as the LH IIIA capital at Palaiopyrgi or Ayios Vasilios. 3. THE HISTORY OF THIS PUBLICATION Study seasons, though less glamorous than digging, are essential to the success of any excavation; so is the formation of a stable team of collaborators, since the days when any single archaeologist could hope to publish a major site unaided are long gone. In this case, unfortunately, the composition of the team tended to fluctuate. In 1976 students from the University of Cambridge resided in Sparta to sort the water-sieve residues and to photograph the finds; our work coincided with a visit by Dr Larry Angel to study the human remains. We enjoyed the memorable hospitality of Mrs Strato Mérou in Oraias Elenis Street. During 1978-83 further study was undertaken with the help of students from the Universities of Cambridge, Birmingham and St Andrews; Billy Taylour himself was often in Nauplia working on the finds from the Citadel House at Mycenae. From 1979 our base was the charming dig-house of the excavations at the Menelaion, formerly a kapheneion, in the lovely village of Aphyssou across the Eurotas from Sparta, with mice running along the ceilings of canna reed and house martins nesting above the door. I must record our gratitude to Hector Catling, then Director of the British School, that we were able to live and work there, and to store materials there. Liz Hutton and Lilo Picornell began and Anna Poelstra-Tragá completed the drawing of the small finds, and David Reese studied the shells and animal bones. Oliver Dickinson visited us on two occasions and clarified our understanding of the ceramic sequence. David Aston led the work on classifying the sherds and baskets and finding joins among them. He and I worked on the sections and I drafted the first stratigraphie analyses.29 Throughout the 1980s Billy continued to work on the project with his typist Mrs Black, alongside his commitment to publishing the excavations at Mycenae. He meticulously organised the photographs, continued to correspond with various specialists, toiled with Rolfe Kentish on the plans and oversaw the work of experts on the pottery, which was undertaken during the mid 1980s. He drafted Chapters 1 and 3 on the architecture, relying, as was his custom, both on his own notebooks and on those of the various trench-masters. He began to write Chapter 2 on the burials, and oversaw the drawing of the small finds. In 1987 Lisa French assisted him in organising this volume, helped him to contact specialists who would publish the small finds and arranged for the late Teresa Wallace to help with word-processing; this publication owes Teresa a great debt for her diligence and accuracy, and it was she who largely compiled the bibliography. Sadly, Billy was not to live to see it completed. In the summer of 1989, in the beautiful living-room of his house in Great Shelford, he told me that he had not long to live and asked me to edit his volume for him. I only half-believed him, since I too had come to regard him as indestructible, but agreed to undertake what I knew would be an enormous 28 See Chapters 13 §3 (vi) and 14 §4 (iii). 29 Those who took part in one or more seasons included David Aston, Amaryllis Campbell, Liz Hutton, Humphrey and Susan James, Catherine Meiklejohn, Rachel Montagu, Erin Obodiac, Lilo Picornell, Angela Sheldon and David Stuttard.</page><page sequence="35">INTRODUCTION §4 9 task (it proved even harder than I imagined). He died a few months later, and is buried on an island in the estate of his beloved Headfort House in Ireland. After Billy's passing, Lisa French and the late Lyle Eveillé (1945-2005) sorted and distributed his archaeological papers to those who were to edit them. During 1990-94, whenever I could return to Cambridge from California, I organised the excavation archive, beginning to reconcile his different drafts and to fill the many lacunae. In the light of the expert reports on the pottery, I reanalysed the stratigraphy, reconciling the earlier with the later excavations where they overlapped, compiled the repertory of stratigraphie contexts (now on the CD) and circulated it to all the contributors. I gave instructions for the revision of the plans, sections and figures, few of which were ready for publication, and I drafted many from scratch. The conditions of my academic post in England, to which I returned in 1994, were such that I was able to work on the project only spasmodically, but the next several years saw the creation of this introduction, all the tables and the conclusion, the constant revision of the whole, and the production of the expert reports on the small finds. Lucinda Reeves helped me to organise the plates and assisted in other ways. However, the project was greatly retarded by the slowness with which the drawings progressed, and above all by the loss of the master-copies of many essential tracings and the accompanying instructions while they were in the care of an assistant. The advent of image-enhancing technology enabled the lost information to be reconstructed from poor photocopies, once Martin Goalen rejoined the project in 1999 and brought into it Diane Fortenberry. She produced the missing plans, sections, and illustrations of small finds; he disentangled the locations of the trenches and undertook the very difficult task of matching the plans of the earlier excavations against those of the later ones, using the cad programme Nemetsche VectorWorks and Adobe Photoshop. Diane most efficiently copy-edited the manuscript, astutely suggested invaluable organisational changes and liaised with its far-flung authors. New refinements to the chronology of the MH pottery necessitated extensive revisions in 2003-04. My research assistants at the University of Michigan, Jeremy Hartnett, Jane Rempel and Seth Button, were a tremendous help; Jane was the first reader of Chapters 1-3, and her sharp eye caught many errors and obscurities. Finally, Elizabeth Lombardo, Cat Lyon and Eroi Ahmed digitised and edited the illustrations; their help too was indispensable. One consequence of the long history of this volume is that its various chapters were written over many years. The first to be finished was Penelope Mountjoy's study of the Mycenaean pottery in 1988; others did not send in theirs until a decade or more later, either for reasons of their own or because their work was only commissioned after Billy's death.30 A given chapter should not be criticised for not seeming fully up-to-date. In a volume such as this, it is inevitable, albeit unjust, that 'the last shall be first and the first shall be last', to use a Biblical phrase of which Billy was fond. I beg readers to make the necessary allowances. 4. THE STRUCTURE AND CONVENTIONS OF THIS VOLUME Billy left behind the following plan for this publication: An account of the 1973-77 excavations is given first. Each section is devoted to a specific area of the excavation, starting with the test trenches Epsilon, Zeta and Eta, followed by the main Areas Beta, Lambda and Nu. The account of the Bronze Age strata in each Area is self-contained. It includes the architectural background and lists of the whole pots and small finds recovered there. This is followed by a section on the burials, which, as in previous campaigns, frequently interrupted the routine excavation of the settlement, and by separate accounts of the EH and Medieval strata. After that comes a discussion of the pottery according to the ceramic periods Early, Middle and Late Helladic, and Medieval, each of which is contributed by the appropriate authority. This is followed by accounts of the Bronze Age small finds, including the chipped stone, the Medieval small finds, the human bones, animal bones and other organic remains. In putting the volume together, I have tried to preserve as much as I could of what Billy had written, quirky though his style can be. However, in consultation with Diane Fortenberry, I reorganised Chapter 1 on a reverse chronological basis rather than according to the sequence in which layers were excavated, since this is clearer; to reorganise it into forwards chronological order would have entailed changes that went far beyond his intentions. I transferred the EH material back into the accounts of the Areas where it was found, because this clarifies discussion of the transition to MH. I suppressed a 30 Chapter 13 was added too late to put it where it belongs, i.e. with this Introduction.</page><page sequence="36">io R. JANKO system of Periods, analogous to those at Lerna, that Billy had introduced at a late stage, because this would have confused the reader. For the sake of convenience, undifferentiated LH I- II pottery will continue to be designated 'Early Mycenaean'. Since the results of the excavations of 1959-63 have been published,31 they are normally reconsidered only in the concluding summary (Chapter 14) and there only in broad terms. Some ceramic items then found are republished in the light of new knowledge in Chapters 5-6 below, and the figurines from all seasons are presented for the first time in Chapters 8 and 10. On the other hand, the pottery from Area Nu / Gamma 1 of 1973-74 is already available.32 Only a few pieces from it, selected by the relevant experts, are re-evaluated in Chapters 5-6, but a revised account of the stratigraphy and architecture of this Area appears in Chapter 1 . However, where parts of the same strata were dug in both the earlier and the later excavations, as in trenches Beta 1, Beta 3 and Beta 12, the stratigraphy of the earlier seasons is reinterpreted in Chapter 1 . Understanding the old excavations and reconciling them with the new proved to be very difficult, as is typified by the difficulty over the bench mark (see below). One problem is that the personnel in charge of the various Areas continually fluctuated in both the earlier and the later excavations, with the golden exception Area Nu / Gamma 1 . This has resulted in differences in the recording; the accuracy and level of detail in the trench notebooks and pottery notebooks varies greatly. But the gravest obstacle to interpreting the records of the earlier seasons lies in the understandable inadequacy of the descriptions of the pottery that was found, most of which was not kept. Thus the term 'Matt Painted' was used to denote both Dull Painted, which went out of use at the end of MH II, and true Matt Painted, which replaced it in MH III. Lustrous Decorated pottery was often mistaken for Mycenaean; when the excavators note a few nondescript monochrome 'Mycenaean' sherds, the layer is often MH and may even be MH I. Finally, the phases of EH and MH were not understood at all, and LH IIIC Early was not distinguished from LH IIIB. The record-keeping during the excavations does not permit the level of quantification achieved at, for instance, the contemporaneous excavations at Nichoria in Messenia. Thus, for instance, the amount of spoil per excavation unit was not recorded. Hence no statistical analysis of feature sherds and shapes in each ware per kilogram of recovered pottery could be undertaken for this volume, although some of the pottery notebooks would allow further quantification, like the statistical seriation-analysis undertaken in Appendix 1. Small finds including lithics, animal bones and shells were carefully recovered, but their distribution and frequency has not been quantified as systematically as one might wish. Nor was much scientific analysis undertaken during the excavation. Afterwards, although many samples were examined, others were misplaced and not analysed. No modern data sets, e.g. of fauna in the locality, were compiled for comparative purposes. No grid was imposed on the site during the excavation, and this could not be done after the event. Instead, the site was divided into excavated Areas. An Area, e.g. Area Epsilon, is labelled with a Greek capital letter. An Area comprises at least one trench, designated with a Greek capital letter and an Arabic numeral, e.g. trench Lambda 1 ; in turn, a trench may be subdivided into sectors labelled with lower-case Greek letters. Balloon photography was not used to record the site. Walls, which are shown hatched in the sections, are designated by two lower-case letters in bold face, e.g. wall nc. Where the sections show walls in elevation, these are labelled 'projected'. Where two or more walls can be assigned to an intelligible structure, I have given this a name that includes that of the Area, e.g. Structure Nu IL Most walls were never removed. It proved difficult to date such walls, since there seem to be no differences in techniques of construction that can be used as dating criteria. Numbers shown in circles in the stratigraphie sections refer to 'baskets', which was the term for units of excavated earth and/or stone; in the catalogues these are preceded by a hatch sign, e.g. # 26. These units correspond to greatly variable volumes of excavated material. An index of baskets, arranged by Area, is supplied on the CD (the Repertory of Stratigraphie Contexts); this contains cross-references to the inventoried finds from each basket. The term 'context' is used to mean the latest ceramic period present in substantial amounts in a given basket, which is presumably the date when it was deposited; the term 'pot range' indicates the range of datable ceramic material from the basket. The term 'contamination' is reserved to indicate that material from a different unit was accidentally mixed in during the excavation; in the excavation records, however, it often means only that a single unit contained material of different dates, for whatever reason. In addition to the basket numbers, many excavators also assigned numbers for 'Levels'. However, the stratigraphy was usually so complex and hard to comprehend that these numbers rarely correspond 31 Taylour 1972. 32 Rutter and Rutter 1976.</page><page sequence="37">INTRODUCTION §4 11 to reality. Accordingly, they are ignored in this volume. The extreme compaction and dryness of the soil made the colours of the strata very hard to distinguish unless water for spraying the section was laboriously hauled to the top of the hill. Moreover, the prevalence of sloping layers on the sides of the hill and of deposits of wash made interpretation during the excavation even more difficult. It was only by means of the drawing of sections that the layers could be reliably recognized. Layers distinguished in the sections are referred to as 'strata' or 'layers' in the text. Similar caveats apply to the terms 'floor' and 'floor deposit'. These terms are normally used in the text only where the existence of a floor is supported by the discovery of pots complete enough to be registered during the excavation, of sherds lying flat on a surface, of slabbed surfaces, or of several small finds. Cleanly swept floors of beaten earth were numerous, but the soil was generally so compacted that the existence of many such floors is impossible to confirm; some excavators, rightly or wrongly, distinguished numerous floors, others few. Floors are identified by their original number and date, in the form 'Floor 25 of 1963'. In the case of the burials, the original numbers have been altered: on the site these were numbered in the form 'burial 1, 1974', but there is now a continuous numeration for each Area, e.g. Beta Burial 28, with the number in bold face. When a given Area was first excavated in 1959-63, the numerical sequence of burials continues that of Taylour 1972. All elevations in this volume are calculated from the 'New Bench Mark' shown on fig. iii, which is abbreviated to 'BM' and is arbitrarily deemed to be 100 m above the present sea-level; thus '-6.00 m BM' means '6 m below the bench mark'. The height of the bench mark was not exactly determined. There was originally a triangulation-point on a rock at the highest point on the hill, which is marked on the map of the Hellenic Military Geographical Service of 1992 as 43 m above sea-level; this map labels the hill and the adjacent saddle Agrilovoúni, but omits the chapel and offers a very inaccurate plan of the contours. It is reproduced in fig. 13.4. However, the plain at the base of the hill should be at most 3 m above sea-level;33 if this is assumed to be the height of the drainage-channel on fig. iii, the hilltop is in fact c. 38 m above sea-level, and fig. ii shows the hilltop as only slightly higher than 35 m. The triangulation point became the bench mark for the 1959-63 seasons; it lay at the highest point on the hill, between trenches Alpha 4 and Alpha 5 (see fig. ii), and its location is marked as 'Old BM' on fig. iii. Unfortunately this original bench mark was apparently moved between 1963 and 1973 during military exercises. Its disappearance contributed to the initial failure to locate the old trenches when the brush was cleared in 1973. Accordingly, a different bench mark was used during the later excavations. This later bench mark is just to the north-east of Area Alpha; this is marked as 'New BM' on fig. iii. It is believed to have lain approximately 0.925 m below the earlier one, on the basis of contradictory measurements which reveal that the difference lay somewhere between 0.70 and 1.17 m. The discrepancies probably arose because the points of measurement were not precisely the same, and in particular because walls whose elevations were established using both systems could easily have lost a stone or two from their tops during the intervening years. Taylour 1972 uses the earlier bench mark, but Rutter and Rutter 1976 and the present volume use the later one, 0.925 m below the earlier. Thus the new bench mark is now deemed to be at 100.000 m above sea-level, and the old one at 100.925 m. In this volume elevations based on the earlier bench mark are all expressed as depths below the later datum; users of Taylour 1972 and of the archive of the earlier excavations will need to adjust all elevations in those sources by 0.925 m. For example, if an elevation is given in Taylour 1972 as 96.50 m, its old depth was 3.50 m. below 100 (or -3.50); one must then adjust it by 0.925 m, so that the new depth is -2.575 m- ^ut one must again stress that the exact difference is only known approximately. The architecture, stratigraphy and burials are measured in metres unless otherwise stated. The dimensions of pottery and other small finds are given in centimetres unless otherwise noted, fig(s), plate(s) and table(s) refer to those in the present volume, whereas 'fig.', 'plate' and 'table' denote those in other works. Each object included in this volume has been assigned a publication number in bold type, ranging from 1 to 10113; not a^ numbers are used, since successive Chapters from Chapter 5 onwards begin with the next thousand. Numbers in the form HS 291 refer to pottery and small finds published in Taylour 1972; those such as R266 denote pottery published in Rutter and Rutter 1976. Numbers in the form 73-314 are original excavation numbers, which were used in both the earlier and the later campaigns of digging. The prefix indicates the year of the excavation, in the above case 1973, and the suffix the object, with different series of numbers for pottery and small finds for each Area; these are keyed to entries in the control-books or to the small find cards. A concordance 33 See Chapter 13 §4 (ii) below.</page><page sequence="38">12 R. JANKO of excavation numbers and publication numbers is provided on the CD. The tables, Appendices, Repertory of Stratigraphie Contexts and Concordances will also be found on the CD supplied inside the back cover. Every small find and registered pot retained from the excavations is marked with its excavation number, preceded by 'HS'; this prefix stands for 'Hagios Stephanos', whereas objects marked 'AS' are from Asteri, excavated in 1959. Sherds retained from the site are marked 'HS', followed by a Greek letter to denote the Area and a number within a circle to denote the stratigraphie unit ('basket') in which it was found. The materials retained from the earlier and later excavations are stored in Apotheke B' in the Archaeological Museum in Sparta. Lisa French catalogued and reorganised them with the help of Clarissa de Waal; a computerised index is kept at the British School at Athens, where the archive of the excavations will also be deposited.34 5. ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS In addition to all those who are thanked above, I wish to express my appreciation to audiences at lectures I gave to the Mycenaean Seminar at the Institute of Classical Studies in London, to the local chapter of the American Institute of Archaeology in Chapel Hill, and to the Aegean Symposium at the Institute of Fine Arts in New York. I am grateful to the librarians of the Faculty of Classics at Cambridge for storing the archive in 1989-94 and for space to work on the project in 1992-93, and to the Institute of Classical Studies in London for similar kindness in 1997-98. I owe thanks for various kinds of help to Gary Beckman, Phil Betancourt, Bill Cavanagh, Cyprian Broodbank, Nicolas Coldstreamt, Joost Crouwel, Katie Demakopoulou, Chrysanthi Gallou, George Huxley, Bobby Koehl, Chris Kraft, Olga Krzyszkowska, Daniel Pullen, Colin Renfrew, Margaret Root, Jeremy Rutter, Anthony Snodgrass, Malcolm Wiener and John Younger. The credits for the illustrations are given on p. viii; it has not always been possible to establish which member of the team drew some of the objects. Eroi Ahmed designed the plates and contributed much other help. At earlier stages while Billy was in charge this project was supported by grants from the University of Cambridge (the Henry Arthur Thomas Fund), the University of Oxford (the Craven Fund), the University of Durham, the British Academy, the British School at Athens Management Committee (Seager Fund), Educational Expeditions International and Trinity College, Cambridge. The project was greatly assisted by the kindness of successive Ephors of Laconia, George Steinhauer and Theodoros Spyropoulos. For the stage of its gestation for which I was responsible, I am profoundly grateful to the Trustees of the Mediterranean Archaeological Trust, and in particular to Gina Clifford-Holmes, for steady financial support over many years. I am also grateful to the University of Michigan for most generously funding a graduate research assistant during my service as Chair of the Department of Classical Studies, and to the University's Undergraduate Research Opportunity Program, which gave me an undergraduate assistant for two years. In addition I thank the Mediterranean Archaeological Trust, the Office of the Vice-Provost for Research and the College of Literature, Science and the Arts of the University of Michigan for subventions that enabled this volume to appear. The research and compilation of this manuscript for this final publication was made possible by the Shelby White - Leon Levy Program for Archaeological Publications, to which I am most grateful. Without the support, for which I am much indebted, of the Publications Committee of the British School at Athens, and in particular of Bill Cavanagh, previous editor of this Series, this volume could not have appeared. The final version has been much improved by the comments, corrections and critiques of an anonymous reader and of the Series Editor, Olga Krzyszkowska. Type-setting and design was undertaken by Rayna Andrew. I am most grateful for their skill, knowledge and dedication. Finally, I must thank all the authors of this volume for their extraordinary patience and ready cooperation during its long preparation. Most archaeological publications take too long to see the light of day, but some do so later than others; however, later is better than never. An archaeological project is the work of many hands and minds: I gratefully acknowledge here all those, many unnamed and even unknown to me, who helped to bring this volume to the completion which Billy had so fervently desired. 34 I have included this information here as follows: for the location of soil samples and dry residue, see n. 24 above; for the human remains, table 12.7; for the faunal remains, my introduction to Chapter 12 §2; for the flora, n. 24 above; for the OES samples, my introductory note to Appendix 2; for the kept sherds, the 'Repertory of stratigraphie contexts and kept sherds', and for the whole pots and small finds, the 'Concordance of excavation numbers to publication numbers and museum boxes', which are on the CD.</page><page sequence="39">Chapter i The Bronze Age architecture and stratigraphy W. D. Taylourf and R. Janko [Editor's note: W. D. Taylour drafted much of Chapter 1, treating the stratigraphy in the order in which it was uncovered. As was explained in the Introduction, this has been standardised into reverse chronological order. Throughout, substantive editorial additions are set within square brackets. These were finalised in 2004.] 1. AREA EPSILON 1973: MIDDLE TO LATE HELLADIC (figs. 1.1-1.8) (i) Introduction Situated on the se slope of the hill, this Area, together with Area Zeta, 5 m to its w, was laid down with the purpose of locating the Beta trenches of 1963 and, more particularly, Beta 3 of 1959. This purpose was not realised, for the reason stated in the Introduction §2 above. It was only after many days of excavation that the original 1963 trenches were discovered by chance, over 25 m nnw of Area Epsilon, in the thick scrub that had engulfed them during the intervening years (see fig. iv). However, as these trial trenches by that time were producing promising and valuable information, it was decided to continue exploration of them until the end of the season. Both were at first called Beta. Area Epsilon in the beginning consisted of two parallel trenches with a n-s axis that were ultimately combined into a 4 x 4 m square orientated according to the points of the compass. The slope of the terrain was downwards from nw to se. At a later stage the Area was slightly enlarged in its ne corner to retrieve an important pottery deposit that showed up there (fig. 1.1). This meant creating a dog-leg extension that also served to uncover more of the walls that had made their appearance in this part of the Area. The Area was finally 20.9 m2 in extent. For the sake of convenience, as elsewhere in this volume, the periods represented in this trench will be described in descending order, to conform with the sequence in which they were excavated, and 'the last shall be first'. No recognisable structures of the Medieval period were uncovered. However, a circular depression about 55 cm in diameter, Pit A, was sunk 1.8 m s of the n end of the earlier wall kc against its w face and at least 1.3 m deep into the Bronze Age layers (fig. 1.2 and plate ib). This was found to be a Medieval rubbish pit: see Chapter 3 §5 below. The single burial from this Area is described in Chapter 2 § 1 below. (ii) Late Helladic IIIC Early During this period, walls ka, kb, kc and kd were in use (plates 1 b-2 b). Walls ka and kb were in echelon with a ne-sw axis (fig. 1.2). Near the sw end of wall kb, wall kc branched off due s. From the same point opposite to the n face of wall kb, wall kd proceeded to the nw and at right angles to kb. Both wall kb and wall kc were unusually broad, having a width of 60 cm as against the more normal thickness of 45 cm. [The details of these walls are given in tables 1.1-1.2. They were all built and disused within this period. Wall ka contained LH IIIC Early sherds, some of them worn, and overlay a stratum containing the LH IIIC Early kylix 3143; this layer can be seen in section in figs. 1.3, 1.4 and 1.7. Walls ka and kd formed the se corner of a building, Structure Epsilon I, the interior of which, marked as sector gamma on fig. 1.1, fell almost entirely outside the Area. Walls kb and kc, each at least 3 m long, likewise formed the nw corner, marked as sector beta on fig. 1.1, of another building of the same phase, Structure Epsilon IL The two buildings almost touched at their corners.] As in the other chronological periods, the small finds are not instructive and add next to nothing to our knowledge of the Area. [The small finds, listed in table 1.3, show that there were once floor levels associated with these structures, but none survived. !3</page><page sequence="40">14 W. D. TAYLOURt AND R.

The pottery was washed down the slope from nw to se and must have accumulated rapidly to a depth of 50 cm or more, mixed with tumble from wall ka to the s of the latter wall; the slope lines are clearly visible in section in figs. 1.3-1.7.] (iii) Late Helladic IIIA-IIIB From the point of view of pottery, LH IIIA2 Early was the most important phase in this Area. [Wall ke was destroyed at that time, and walls kf and kg may have been (see fig. 1.8). A major pottery deposit is associated with this destruction. This will be discussed first.] A pottery deposit datable to LH IIIA2 Early was uncovered in the ne sector of the original 4 x 4 m trench. Walls ka and kb at first seemed to be associated with it, but in fact are later.1 In the space enclosed by walls kd, kb and the n baulk (fig. 1.2), an area of packed stones was revealed at a depth of c. -5.97 m BM; this was interpreted as a floor. It was decided to extend the excavation to pursue the situation further, and an L-shaped extension was created to the ne of the Area. A large group of LH IIIA2 vases, dispersed in the ne and se parts of this extension, was then discovered at elevations which ranged from -5.82 to -5.88 m BM at its E end. These are vases 3040, 3043, 3048-3051, 3091, 3108 and fragments of 3082a, listed in table 1.4. The excavator suspected a floor at this depth, which corresponds to stratum 3 on fig. 1.5, and flat schist slabs were noted at the top of the level. At c. -5.94 m BM there were found the vase 3112 and pieces of 3043 and 3051. Six more vases were uncovered in the ne corner of the extension, at a level that began at around -6.00 m BM, marked as stratum 4 1 See §1 (ii) above.</page><page sequence="44">i8 W. D.

These are 3027, 3033, 3038, 3067, 3114 and further fragments of 3082a. Two other vases appeared still lower down, namely 3079 at -6.22 m and 3042 at -6.32 m BM. Many pieces of 3027 and of the kylix 3041 were found in widely dispersed levels (see table 1.4). All the vases were discovered in the extension, with the exception of 3041, the fragments of which were mostly found in sector alpha (see fig. 1.2). Nearly all the pottery consisted of drinking vessels. There were no fewer than nine kylikes; other vases were a krater (mixing bowl), two ladles and five cups, bowls or platters. Closed vessels comprise an alabastron and a piriform jar. How does one explain the fact that all these pots, with the exception of the kylix 3041, were discovered in a small area approximately 3.0 x 1.5 m square? No evidence of violent destruction was apparent. One explanation, advanced by R. Janko and supported by P. A. Mountjoy in Chapter 6 §1 (iii) below, is that the pottery drifted in as wash from higher levels in the nw. [The pottery in this homogeneous deposit, published as 3027-3121 below, is often badly worn, and many joins were found between sherds from different depths. In addition, the excavators recorded pronounced slope- lines in the section of the extension (see fig. 1.5). The ground evidently descended about 70 cm from the nw to the se corner. The deposit was up to 50 cm thick in the E part of the trench, but only about 10 cm deep in the w, where, however, it is attested by a fragment of the kylix 3041.

It follows that the Area was unoccupied during most of LH IIIA2-IIIB. A few small finds, including a saddle quern, came from the layers of wash; these too are listed in table 1.4.] At the NW end of the later wall kc, against its outer surface, there was a circular depression 50 cm in diameter, Pit B, which was not excavated to any depth (fig. 1.2 and plate 1 b). It was far too large for a post-hole, and its function remains unknown. [It contained sherds of LH IIIA2 date, and was probably hollowed out by the torrent that deposited the wash of this period following the collapse of the LH IIIA2 buildings described below.] Walls ke, kf and kg proved hard to date (fig. 1.8 and table 1.5). Wall ke, in the e baulk, contained a late MH sherd, but this is merely a terminus post quern for its construction. [Wall ke also contained a</page><page sequence="46">2O W. D. TAYLOURt AND R. JANKO Fig. 1.8. Area Epsilon. Plan of Middle Helladic III and LH I-IIIA2 phases, showing location of sectors and sections (figs. 1.3-1.7). monochrome sherd that is either EH II or Mycenaean. P. A. Mountjoy rightly notes that the bottom of wall ke was level with the LH IIIA2 Early basket 69, which seems to provide a terminus ante quern. This implies that wall ke was both built and destroyed within LH IIIA2 Early: see fig. 1.6 stratum 8. [The room s of wall ke was in use until LH IIIA2 Early, when the building of which it formed part was destroyed by fire; the section, fig. 1.6, shows that a thin layer of ash (marked as stratum 7) ran up to the stump of wall ke and evidently resulted from its destruction. The kylix 3069, dated to LH IIIA2 Early, came from this destruction. Layers of wash then settled over the remains of the building. Both the wash deposit of LH IIIA2 Early pottery in the ne of the Area and that in Pit B no doubt arrived at the same time, and came from the destruction of another building or buildings nearby, perhaps in the same fire.] Wall kf was in the w part of the Area. [There appears to have been a LH IIIA2 Early plaster floor in sector alpha, and it is possible that this was associated with wall kf; this floor is visible in section in fig. 1.7, where it is marked as stratum 5. If so, wall kf is contemporary with wall ke.] The section between walls ke and kf could not be investigated as it was occupied by the later wall kc (see plates 1 c and 2 b). Thus it appears that there were two approximately parallel walls with a NE-sw axis, the fronts of which faced nw to counteract the pressure of earth from the downward slope of the terrain; in other words, they served as terrace walls. Wall kg was exposed at a lower level immediately to the n of the later wall kb; it runs ne-sw and is parallel to wall ke (plate 2 a). [P. A. Mountjoy suggests that walls ke and kg were contemporary with each other, the difference in height being owed to the slope. Thus walls ke, kf and kg all seem to be LH IIIA2 Early. [After the LH IIIA2 destruction the Area seems to have been left largely unoccupied for a while. LH IIIB is sparsely represented by sherds 3122-3134. Although four sherds are dated to Transitional LH IIIB 2-LH IIIC Early (3168, 3170, 3193-3194), this period cannot be distinguished from LH IIIC Early stratigraphically.2 One might have expected that the Area was reoccupied at this time, but the LH IIIC Early kylix rim 3143 from under wall ka proves that that wall was built during LH IIIC Early itself and no earlier.] 2 Mountjoy 1999, 1 36.</page><page sequence="47">THE BRONZE AGE ARCHITECTURE AND STRATIGRAPHY §2 21 (iv) Late Helladic I-II [A thin Early Mycenaean level, 20-25 cm deep, was present in the w part of the Area, where it overlay the MH layer described in §1 (v) below (fig. 1.7, stratum 6). The Early Mycenaean level had not yet been reached in the se corner when the excavation was concluded.] A deposit of Early Mycenaean pottery about 1 2 cm thick was uncovered in the ne corner of the Area, with a shell of Cerastoderma Edule naturally pierced at the umbo (9273). This deposit, which comprised baskets 75 and 88 and includes sherds 3001-3010, is shown in section in figs. 1.3 and 1.5, where it is stratum 5; it is datable to LH IIA Early. It lay under the large deposit of LH IIIA2 Early vases referred to in §1 (iii) above. [It is not clear whether either of these deposits derives from the building destroyed in LH IIIA2 Early.] (v) Middle Helladic I Early to Middle Helladic III As excavation proceeded, after the Mycenaean walls of various periods had been exposed, a mixed MH III stratum was eventually reached in the w part of the Area, s of the later wall ka (figs. 1.1 and 1.7). The obsidian bladelet 7284 and MH III-LH I sherds 1019-1034 came from this context. Under it lay two pure MH I strata some 50 cm deep. The upper layer contained sherds 1006-1018, MH I Late in date, including the marked sherd 1015 from a polychrome Lustrous Decorated jar, together with the naturally pierced Glycymeris shell 9255. Lower still there was a stratum containing the MH I Early sherds 1001-1005 with a few EH II sherds. However, no architectural features were recognised. The only other MH find was a stray spool, 6037, in a LH IIIC Early level. Bedrock was nowhere reached. A grave, Epsilon burial 1, was cut into the level that contained much MH I Late pottery (see fig. 1.7, strata 7-9), but it is doubtful whether the incumbent, a male, can be dated any earlier than MH III. [The pottery points to a dating to MH III Late.3] 2. AREA ZETA 1973: EARLY TO LATE HELLADIC (figs. 1.9-1.14) (i) Introduction Area Zeta was located just n of a modern terrace wall on the se slope of the hilltop, the part of the site that is nearest to the spring. It is c. 20 m ese of Area Beta and 5 m w of Area Epsilon, on a slightly different N-s alignment (see fig. iv). The terrain sloped down slightly from nw to se. The first trial trench in this Area, Trench 1, was 3.75 m by 1 m on a N-s axis, 3mW of the w baulk of Area Epsilon, with its s baulk 1 m to the s of the s baulk of that Area. It was quickly abandoned when it was found to yield Medieval pottery. A second one, Trench 2, was started 3 m to the w of it, with dimensions 4.5 m (n-s) x 1 m. Later this trench was extended to the w on two occasions, and the ultimate size of Area Zeta was 4.5 m (n-s) x 5.5 m, i.e. 24.75 m2 (FIG- 1-9)- The Area was the most complicated one of the whole site. This limited space yielded no fewer than twenty different walls, and it has not always been easy to establish to which period each of these belongs. The periods represented by the pottery are Medieval, LH, MH and EH II Late. There are Roman and possibly Hellenistic small finds as well, apparently the only ones from this site. These come from surface levels at the w edge of this Area.4 By far the greatest number of sherds was MH I, and as three complete pots of that date were found at a fairly high level and just below the Medieval strata, the majority of the walls must be attributed to that period or earlier. In an effort to establish a relationship between the various walls and their dates, they have been plotted in fig. 1.10, according to levels taken on their preserved heights and at their bases when this was recorded, fig. 1.10 includes a pottery section of the whole Area; for a detailed pottery section of the lowest levels in sector beta (W.), where greater depths were reached, see fig. 1.11. From this information plans of the walls at different periods have been prepared (figs. 1.12-1.14). In most cases it is quite clear that walls on the same level are contemporary, but others, such as wall ib, could have been in use in more than one phase, and many of the walls were certainly reused in Medieval times. The remains of the Medieval period, including a hearth, trodden floor (Floor 1) and pit below it, are described in Chapter 3 §2 below, with fig. 3.1. The six burials from this Area are described in Chapter 2 §2 below. 3 See Chapter 2 §1 below. 4 See Chapters 3 § 1 and 1 1 § 1 1 below.</page><page sequence="48">22 W. D. TAYLOURt AND R. JANKO Fig. 1.9. Area Zeta. Plan showing location of walls, sectors and section (fig. 1.11). (ii) Late Helladic IIIC Early Walls ic, id and ie are either late Mycenaean or Medieval (see fig. 1.9 and table 1.6). Their elevations are marked in fig. 3.1. LH sherds of all phases, from Early Mycenaean to LH IIIC Early, occurred quite frequently (see sherds 3198-3221). However, it has been assumed that most of these sherds were washed down by winter rains from higher ground to the N, and no walls could definitely be associated with them. Wall ic is in the nw part of the Area. It is slightly off-axis in relation to the other walls and does not fit into any plan. The infant or child burials 1 and 2 were discovered in this sector (see fig. 1.9 and Chapter 2 §2 below). [Later sherds found among the MH II- III material from these graves, namely LH IIA in the case of Zeta burial 1 and LH IIIA2 in that of burial 2, probably represent the dates of these interments. Therefore, although wall ic contained MH II- III sherds, it must be LH IIIA2 or later, since it overlay burial 2.] Walls id and ie both have ne-sw axes and are parallel to one another. Wall id, whose course is marked with dotted lines on fig. 1.9, contained LH IIIA2 sherds. Its sw end overlay the pots 1122- 1123 and 1140, dating from MH I Late (plate 2 c). Wall ie was a one-course wall built of fairly large stones; it overlay and cut the earlier wall if. When dismantled, wall ie contained pottery of LH III date. This is not decisive, and these walls could be Medieval. They cannot antedate LH IIIC Early, since the levels underneath them contain some sherds of that date. An infant burial, Zeta burial 3, was uncovered near the se flank of wall ie, and the pottery associated with it, though fragmentary, was LH IIIA2 to IIIC Early. [These three walls were all built, in the editor's view, in LH IIIC Early, and have been assigned to Structure Zeta IV. They were apparently reused in the Medieval phase. All were subsequently removed in order to excavate earlier levels. [A small deposit of LH IIIC Early pottery overlay the earlier wall ig and ran s to wall id, covering the corner of the room made by the earlier walls ig and ih; this included sherds 3211, 3213-3214 and 3220. As will be seen in §2 (iv) below, these walls are MH I, and the MH I pots 1122-1123 and 1140 overlay them. Levels with LH IIIC Early disturbance, mixed with much MH II material, go down some 35 cm in the s part of the Area, sectors beta and zeta; I suspect that there was a LH IIIC Early pit, perhaps dug to rob stone from the se face of the earlier wall ip. The pure LH III levels had disappeared in the central part of the Trench, owing to the Medieval reoccupation. The LH IIIC building activity in its turn destroyed any Early Mycenaean levels.</page><page sequence="49">THE BRONZE AGE ARCHITECTURE AND STRATIGRAPHY §2 23 ü JL CO S o C/5 C/3 Ï to O co a" "u I o Oh U 1 'co a J ci et &lt; 6 ó</page><page sequence="50">24 W.

Area Zeta. Plan of MH II- III phase. (iii) Middle Helladic II-III [Four walls are assigned to this period, namely walls ia, ib, if and ii: see fig. 1.12 and table 1.8. Walls ib and if contained MH II-III sherds when they were removed. Walls ia and ii were left in situ. Wall ia is abutted by wall ib, and the nw part of wall if abuts wall ii. They are all assigned to a building called Structure Zeta III.] Wall if and the sw part of wall ib lay under the Medieval floor and pit. The ne part of wall ib had been used as the basis of another wall by the later settlers, who probably used the foundations of wall ia for a similar purpose, since the style of construction with smaller stones is the same. Another wall of this period with ne-sw axis, wall ii, was found to underlie the ne end of the later wall id on the same axis, although wall ii lay c. 10 cm nw of the line of wall id and extended further ne than did wall id. Walls ia, ib, if and ii turned out to have been built in MH II-III, and probably in MH II, but it was not easy to reconstruct their plan. Tentative suggestions are as follows. In the se part of the Area, the se sections of walls if and ia were joined by wall ib, giving a large room with nw-se axis. In the central part a reconstruction is more problematic. Wall ii formed a corner with wall if, and the sw end of wall ii was aligned with the end of wall if. With the nw sections of walls if and ia, and with wall ib to the E, it appeared to form a small room. [The nw part of wall if, between walls ii and ib, was insubstantial, being only one course high with no ne face. It appears to have been either a threshold to a corridor or, more probably, a step at the mouth of an alley that lay between walls ii and ib. This passage ran ne and then made a right-angled turn to the nw. If it was an alley, wall ii in fact belonged to an adjacent building. In either case, the space sw of wall if (sector beta) may then be identified as an open courtyard or street. Confused traces of floor deposits may be represented by the seven sherds of 1163, which were found nw of the line of the later wall id (sectors epsilon/gamma), and by pots 1166 and 1173, found SE of wall ib (sector zeta). The MH II-III pottery is published as 1154-1190 below; however, the wares characteristic of MH III are absent, and most of this material seems to be MH II. The sherds from the pure MH II basket 78, namely 1154, 1164, 1168, 1180-1182 and 1187-1190, are from just above the level sw of the base of wall if and may supply the date of its construction.] The finds of this period are listed in table 1.9. There is no indication from them as to what activities were undertaken in this Area at any time during the MH period.</page><page sequence="52">26 W. D. TAYLOURt AND R. JANKO (iv) Middle Helladic I, Third Phase (Middle Helladic I Late) For the walls and finds of this period see fig. 1.13. A building was found in the w of the Area, though only its E corner was uncovered, as represented by walls ig and ih, which bonded with each other and lay immediately under LH IIIC Early levels. This building is Structure Zeta II (see table 1 . 10). A number of new walls were also exposed in the ne part of the Area, namely walls ij, ik, il, im, ip, iq and ir. These all belonged to another building, Structure Zeta I (see table 1.13). [Both buildings, and the two pottery deposits associated with their destruction, are dated by C. Zerner to the last of the three phases of MH I that she distinguishes in this Area. The deposit associated with Structure Zeta II will be taken first.] MH I pot fragments were found by wall ih that were part of a larger deposit under the later wall id, which had to be dismantled to recover the remaining pieces. These were vases 1122-1123, 1136 and 1140. [They were badly disturbed except where they had been protected by wall id lying over them (plate 2 c). They were found in a red stratum, probably consisting of burnt mudbrick, which ran over, and on both sides of, wall ih. They comprise a pinch-pot, two jars and a rounded bowl (table 1.11). This deposit of pottery is clearly from the destruction level of Structure Zeta IL Very many of the sherds had been burnt after firing, presumably during this destruction. The deposit proves that walls ig and ih were destroyed in the last phase of MH I. Other finds of this period were made in a yellowish-brown unburnt stratum ne of the building; these are included in table 1.11.] In the central part of the Area, sw of Structure Zeta I, another pottery deposit came to light. It was at a depth some 60 cm lower than that found by wall ih. This second deposit was constituted by vases 1108, 1117 and 1150 (table 1.12). [These vessels, shown in situ in fig. 1.13 and plate 2 d, comprise a jar, a jug and a pithos. Assigned by C. Zerner to the same date as the first deposit, they represent destruction debris from the burning of Structure Zeta I. They were found in an ashy layer that sloped down from E to w and was met by layers of stones fallen from wall ih, sloping down from w to E. This pottery lay between the heavy tumble to the w and ash to the E, with traces of burning in the form of red material, probably burnt mudbrick, at a depth of -5.92 m BM. The ash ran under some of the sherds that lay to the E. Although these vases were found close to those associated with Structure Zeta II and are of the same date, there are no joins to link the two deposits.] Structure Zeta I had the same axis as the later walls ib and if above it, i.e. nw-se, but in other respects it bore no relation to them. The plan as revealed appears to show two long rooms in line, which were labelled Rooms 3 and 4 (see fig. 1.13, table 1.13 and plate 3 a). Wall il formed the sw boundary to both rooms. The depth of its base is not recorded. The nw and sw walls ir and il of Room 3 were clearly defined, and so also was the se wall ik that it shared with Room 4. The ne wall im of Room 3 was rather nondescript except for its se end. Most of wall im was built of large stones; its top course sloped down towards the ne, and its sw face was very irregular. Was it a retaining wall? Its well-built se end, however, was of entirely different construction and has been called wall iq. Two courses wide and built of field stones of moderate size, it does not seem to have been contemporary. It may have been reused from an earlier structure.5 An entrance to Room 3 seems to have been located in wall ir, though this is not certain. In plate 3 a the room is shown filled by a baulk that divided off two sectors of excavation at that time. A trodden floor, Floor 3, was found in Room 3. Room 4 had three well-preserved walls, namely walls ij, ik and il, the last named being an extension of the sw wall of Room 3. Wall ij bonded with wall ik. They, and walls ir/il/ik, were the only walls to do so in the two rooms. Another wall, ip with nw-se axis, appeared to belong to Room 4. Very little of wall ip could be uncovered because it was so near the s baulk. No floor was observed in Room 4; if such a floor existed there, it would probably have been at the same level as in Room 3. The entrance to Room 4 would seem to have lain between the se end of wall il and wall ip. [The stone plotted to the nw of wall ip in fig. 1.13 may have been the base of the door-post. [The pottery, published as 1089-1153 below, reveals that Structure Zeta I was erected during the third phase of MH I and destroyed by fire within this same phase, with debris falling down the slope to fill the open space to the sw of it; this destruction fill included the MH I Late pots listed in table 1.12. The adjacent building represented by walls ig and ih, Structure Zeta II, was surely destroyed in the same fire, since it is overlain by the MH I Late pots listed in table 1.11. The fact that the latter pottery deposit lay 60 cm above the former can be explained if the ground sloped down from nw to se, just as it does at present. [It accords with this interpretation that, to the se of wall ih but at a lower level, underneath the burnt stratum, there was a red-brown unburnt layer, baskets 96, 97 and 98 (see the pottery section, 5 See §2 (v) below.</page><page sequence="53">THE BRONZE AGE ARCHITECTURE AND STRATIGRAPHY §2 27 Fig. 1.13. Area Zeta. Plan of MH I Late (third) phase, showing location of sectors and finds in destruction debris. fig. 1.11), which contained the barbotine sherd 1124. Only near the s baulk and to the E was there any ash at this level. Zeta burials 4 and 5 were interred in this layer, and were presumably coeval with it.6 This stratum was apparently contemporary with the building and use of Structures Zeta I and II, and may have represented the surface of a yard situated between them. It covered most of the top of the earlier wall io.7] (v) Middle Helladic I, Second Phase (Middle Helladic I Early) Walls in, io and iq are assigned to this phase (table 1.14). Wall in, running parallel to the MH I Late wall ij with NW-SE axis, underlay the whole interior of Room 4 (see fig. 1.13). It was at a slightly lower level than the surrounding walls ij, ik and il, and seems to have been part of an earlier edifice. Its top would have acted as part of the floor of Room 4. [Wall in was never cleared. Both wall in and wall iq, similar in construction to each other, and with their tops at roughly the same elevation as that of wall io, probably belonged to the second phase of MH I, as the excavator, J. G. Younger, suggested. Wall in was on the same alignment as wall io and could have met it at right angles; perhaps both belonged to the same complex. All three walls lay at a lower level than - and wall iq was reused in - walls ij, ik and im of the last phase of MH I (fig. 1.13).] After a depth of about one metre had been attained throughout Area Zeta, it was possible to excavate only in the sw central part of the Area, the rest of it being occupied by MH walls. This sector, called sector beta w, was defined by wall io, by the later wall il and by a n-s baulk 2.7 m from the w baulk of Area Zeta; for the section see fig. 1.11 and for the plan see fig. 1.14. Since sector beta w was completely free of any structures, it was possible to dig down uninterruptedly through c. 1.4 m to the bedrock, which was c. 2.3-2.4 m below ground surface. From the very beginning of this operation there was evidence of burning. The first c. 80 cm of digging in this limited space passed through a fill from a nearby destruction, dated to the second phase of MH I. [From a depth of c. -6.07 m BM, level with the top of wall io, the burnt layer filled the whole sector, sloping down towards the s. This thick stratum of fine yellow earth with much carbon and ash comprised three distinct sub-strata, which are proved to have been contemporaneous h See Chapter 2 §2 below. 7 See §2 (v) below.</page><page sequence="54">28 W. D. TAYLOURt AND R. JANKO by the existence of numerous joins between the sherds that they contained. C. Zerner has dated the sherds found in these strata, 1054-1088, to the second of the three phases of MH I which she recognised in Area Zeta. The layers of fill contained the Micaceous Minoan flowerpot 1085 at their top and the Dull Painted cup 1066 at their bottom, as well as two marked Lustrous Decorated sherds, 1077 and 1081, and obsidian blade 6124.] The upper courses of a powerful wall with ne-sw axis, wall io, soon came to light. It was preserved to its full height. Its top was level with the uppermost stratum of the destruction fill. Wall io does not seem to have been related to the MH I Late walls described in §2 (iv) above, and, as can be seen in the section in figs. 1 . 10-1 . 1 1 , its top was below the known base levels of the other walls. Its full height of just under 1 m on its se face was revealed when sector beta w was excavated to the bedrock. Only this se face could be cleared (see plate 3 b). This face was carefully constructed of well-laid large field stones for its lowest three courses and smaller ones, well fitted, for the six upper courses. The façade was packed with rubble made up of much smaller stones up to a depth of c. 60 cm where measurable. The thickness of this wall extended nw as far as the line of the later wall ih. The top layer of this packing was raked at a downward inclination of 1 in 7 from se to nw, so that the rear part was some 20 cm lower than the front (plate 3 c-d). The reason for this is not clear. [The excavator called the wall 'ramp-like', and it was probably meant to hold back the earth to the nw. The wall had a 14% horizontal inclination to the ne, apparently following the original slope of the terrain.] Part of wall io was removed in a successful attempt to find its nw face. Its width at its ne end was ascertained as 70 cm, but its nw flank was buried in the baulk under the later wall ih. Although only EH II sherds were found in wall io, the stratigraphy shows that it must have been in use during the middle phase of MH I. [At its ne end the lowest course of wall io lay directly on bedrock and on a red layer, dug with basket 110, which is dated to EH II Late (see fig. 1.11). The section proves that wall io was constructed no later than the start of the second phase of MH I; at the end of this phase the terrace of which it had formed the back was filled in with destruction debris. The debris must have come from a fire in an adjacent building involving wall io; the latter was perhaps a terrace- wall supporting an apsidal long-house with its entrance to the sw, like that in Area Eta.8 The style of construction of wall io resembles that of wall nh, which belongs to the MH I apsidal building Structure Nu I.] (vi) Middle Helladic I, First Phase (Middle Helladic I Earliest) [Two walls in sector beta w, together with an associated deposit of pottery, appear to belong to a yet earlier phase of MH I. These are walls is and it, together perhaps with the lowest three courses of wall io described above. For the plan of this sector see fig. 1.14 and for its section see fig. 1.11.] At its ne end, wall io abutted at right angles and for almost its full height against another wall, wall is (plates 3 c-d, 4 a). One course of wall io passed over the top of wall is, which was massive and heavily built. [As Jane Rempel noted, it follows that wall is was still standing to this height when the upper courses of wall io were built. Wall is was constructed of large stones on a nw-se axis. It was removed with basket 1 1 2 and was found to contain only EH II sherds. It rested partly on bedrock and on pure EH II Late strata: see fig. 1.11. Hence it was constructed either in EH II Late or, more plausibly, in MH I Early. It was originally at least 1 m high, with its top just below that of wall io. Its upper courses seem to have been robbed out, except where it ran under wall io; thus the stones were robbed either after or during the construction of wall io. Its E end was completely destroyed before it reached the point where it would have abutted the boulders of a possible wall, wall iu, which, if it was a wall, was EH in date.] To the sw, wall io rested on what appeared to be a footing, called wall it, consisting of a single course of large stones loosely set in a hard layer of reddish earth and rubble. Wall it, of very crude construction, rested on bedrock. Wall it must be earlier than wall io. [Wall it existed only to the sw; only its se face was exposed. It was approximately at right angles to wall is.] As the end of the excavation was approaching, the digging became more hectic. The lowest layer of the second phase of MH I, baskets 106 and 107, was followed by c. 10 cm of soil, basket 108, in which pottery of a still earlier phase of MH I, sherds 1035-1053, was found. [The pottery of this first phase is as early as any MH I material from the entire site, as R. Ho well recognised in 1973. However, according to C. Zerner, this phase is not much earlier than the destruction fill that lies above it. Basket 108 also contained large quantities of EH II pottery, including Cream Slipped sherds. J. G. Younger 8 See §3 (v) below.</page><page sequence="55">THE BRONZE AGE ARCHITECTURE AND STRATIGRAPHY §2 29 Fig. 1.14. Area Zeta. Plan of sector beta (w), showing EH II Late and MH I Early (first and second) phases. assigned 354 sherds to EH and 268 to MH, excluding fragments of pithos. Apart from sherds, no other objects were found in basket 108. [The hard red surface which formed the top of basket 108 lay against the third and highest course of large field stones which constitute the lowest part of wall io. Basket 108 was apparently used to excavate two different strata. In the N and nw of the sector, a hard, dark red layer sloped down towards the se and lay directly under basket 106; its colour seemed to indicate burning. This layer contained much pottery, with sherds that could be made up into large pieces but not into whole vessels, together with the bones mentioned below. Elsewhere in the sector the soil of basket 108 was dark brown, hard and stony, with rubble and carbon. This soil lay at the depth of the lower two courses of large field stones in wall io.] A pile of baby bones was bagged and a few skull fragments from the nw part of the sector were also collected; they were badly burnt. This is burial Zeta 6. [This infant lay within the dark red layer at the top of basket 108. In the N and nw corner, close to wall io, this layer yielded fragments of a large coarse vessel, finer than the pithos, with fragments of burned infantile bone; these were at depths of -6.84 to -6.94 m BM, scattered over an area 15 cm across. Immediately below the bones, fragments of a large pithos were found next to wall io running into the earth beneath it at a depth of -6.95 m BM. Unfortunately the sherds of neither vessel were kept, as each was too incomplete to be made up; the excavator, J. G. Younger, deemed their fabrics MH. One could interpret this situation as an interment that employed two large pieces from different pots as a makeshift pithos-burial, with one piece over and the other under the body; in any case, they must be MH I. However, since cremation is unknown at this date, the reason why these bones were burnt remains mysterious. Q. G. Younger denied that the red stratum in basket 1 08 represented burning; as he noted, red soil, a natural product of the slow leaching of the local limestone, is typical of EH levels at the site. He held that basket 108 was associated with the destruction and levelling of wall is, which would be EH, and with the building of walls it and io in the first phase of MH I. The first MH inhabitants would have demolished wall is in order to rob stone when they built wall it and then wall io; they would have dumped its red EH fill, mixed with early MH I pottery and bones or burials, over the pre- existing dark brown soil derived from the EH II occupation and subsequent abandonment. However, this theory does not explain the burnt bones.</page><page sequence="56">3O W. D. TAYLOURt AND R. JANKO [A rival interpretation, advanced by W. D. Taylour during the excavation, is that both the red soil and the charred bones represent intense burning that resulted from the destruction of a building by fire, while the dark brown soil would have accumulated during its occupation. The fire would have claimed the life of the infant, which was then buried in the ruins between the broken vases. This is a more dramatic interpretation and may therefore seem less plausible, but it has the advantage that it better matches the evidence, as it accounts for the fact that the bones of burial Zeta 6 were burned. On this hypothesis, walls is and it would have been built in the first phase of MH I and destroyed at the end of that phase; wall io was bedded into the ruins after the fire, with wall is being robbed in order to supply stones for its construction. A third possibility is that burial Zeta 6 is EH, but was exposed on the surface by erosion which had occurred while the site was abandoned; if the first MH settlers cleared the site by burning the maquis, this would explain why the bones were charred.] (vii) Early Helladic II Late Below the MH destruction levels in the sw central part of the Area, sector beta w, an unburnt stratum containing only EH II sherds was reached just above the bedrock, which lay some 35 cm further down at -7.32 m BM (see the section, fig. 1.11). This stratum was dug with baskets 109 and 1 10. In the w half of the sector the earth was extremely red with no stones, but it was white in the e; there was very little pottery at all in the lowest levels. No floors were detected. The plan, fig. 1.14, shows three walls possibly of this period, namely walls is, it and iu, although there is doubt about the existence of the last named. Their bases were embedded in the extremely red soil. Together these walls form a corner of a possible room (see table 1.15). [Walls is and it were described above,9 where it was suggested that they were in fact built during the first phase of MH I.] Wall iu consisted of three very large blocks, roughly in line, that occupied the se corner of this part of the trench. They are shapeless and perhaps just boulders on the surface of the bedrock, like the large and smaller stone near the foot of wall is (plate 3 d). [These boulders were partly covered by the EH II and earliest MH I basket 108, partly by the MH I Early basket 107. The EH II stratum ran among them. The incorporation of bedrock into EH architecture would be paralleled in Area Eta: see §3 (vii) below. [Like basket 108 above, which yielded pottery of the earliest MH I phase as well, this stratum contained a range of EH II fabrics, including both Yellow Mottled and Cream Slipped: for the latter ware see sherds 131 and 136-137. The presence of both these wares dates this layer to EH II Late, after Cream Slipped pottery had come into use.10 The EH II sherds from pure levels are 15, 22, 34-35. 48, 60-62, 67, 71, 75-77. iS1* i^-itf, !48, i54-*55&gt; *% 171^ *76&gt; l89&gt; iQ1"1^ 199, 200, 202, 204-205, 214 and 220. Basket 108 contained many further EH II sherds, viz. 18-20, 72, 78, 80, 83, 94-95, 101, 163, 166 and 177-178. Unfortunately, no whole pot could be made up from any of them. They may well represent a dump rather than an occupation layer. This stratum also yielded several or many obsidian blades, but their quantity and nature were not recorded; a very large fossil shell is mentioned as coming from these layers. An EH II terracotta whorl, 5001, was found in a surface level. [The red soil reported at the top of basket 108, the lowest stratum with MH sherds, possibly derives from the destruction of a building by fire. However, as was noted in §2 (vi) above, this burning probably occurred early in MH I rather than in EH II. It appears that Area Zeta, and the site in general, was abandoned during the EH III phase.11] 3. AREA ETA 1973: EARLY TO LATE HELLADIC (figs. 1.15-1.22) (i) Introduction This Area lay c. 26 m away from Areas Epsilon and Zeta. As it was opened in an attempt to locate the old Gamma trenches of 1959, it was at first known as Area Gamma. [Area Eta was only c. 10 m se of Area Alpha, excavated in 1959-63 (see fig. iii). In Area Alpha there was little evidence for Mycenaean occupation, and most of the walls were EH and MH, but with little depth or stratigraphy;12 there were two building phases within the EH period. The situation was similar in Area Eta. Here the greater 9 See §2 (vi). 10 See Appendix i . 11 See Chapter 14 §2 (iii) below. 12 Taylour 1972, 239-40.</page><page sequence="57">THE BRONZE AGE ARCHITECTURE AND STRATIGRAPHY §3 31 Fig. 1.15. Area Eta. Plan showing location of walls and sections. depth of the deposits and the exemplary recording of the excavation byj. B. Rutter eventually permitted a much clearer interpretation.] The original trench was 6 m (n-s) x i m and was known as Test Trench I. It was roughly divided into a N and a s sector. Later, a second trench, Test Trench II, was started to the E with dimensions 6 m (n-s) x 2.5 m. This too was divided into n and s sectors. A 50 cm baulk was left between Trench I and Trench II. Finally, Test Trench III was opened to the n of Trenches I and II measuring 4 m (e-w) x 1.5 m. A 50 cm baulk separated it from I and II. Thus ultimately, after removal of the baulks, Area Eta measured 8 m (n-s) x 4 m, i.e. 32 m2 (see fig. 1.15). The terrain had a gradual downward slope from NW to se, and this seems to have been the slope from the earliest times. [Medieval activity is attested by surface sherds and a very deep pit by the E baulk of Trench II, full of stones and mixed pottery dug almost to bedrock, perhaps in order to rob stones for construction.13 This pit was so deep that it cut the EH II wall do at its se end (see figs. 1.15 and 1.22). The micaceous jar 1324, from the upper fill of the cist grave Eta burial 15, was at first conjectured to be Medieval or 13 See Chapter 3 §5 below.</page><page sequence="58">32 W. D. TAYLOURt AND R.

A report of a possible Geometric sherd with multiple zigzags, found in a mixed surface level of Trench II, has not been confirmed and finds no parallel elsewhere on the site; the piece was probably a MH sherd with chevrons.] For the 15 burials and associated finds from Area Eta see Chapter 2 §3 below. (ii) Late Helladic I-IIIC Early Almost immediately below the surface the outline of walls started to appear (fig. 1.15 and plate 4 b- c). Apart from the walling of the cist tomb in the N part of the Area, Eta burial 15, which is dated by the LH ILA pots 1321-1324 and by the LH ILA sherds 3223 and 3225-3227, there were no walls that could definitely be attributed to a LH date, though pottery of the period was found throughout the upper levels, ranging from Early Mycenaean to LH IIIC Early. [See sherds 3222-3233 below. The LH I Vapheio cup 3222 came from the surface in the N of the Area, but Eta burial 13 in the same locality is LH IIIC Early in date.] Mycenaean sherds were concentrated at the n end of the Area, in the narrow space between the lines of two walls, walls di/dr and dk, the dating of which is problematic. Wall di/dr appeared to be a single terrace wall which ran for c. 3.8 m on a ne-sw axis. Its sw section, wall di, was reused as the se wall of the cist tomb Eta burial 15, as is shown in plate 4 c. Its top course of three large stones overlay three to four irregular courses of smaller stones in a double row; its SE face rested on earth, and its lowest course, only one stone wide, rested on bedrock. The ne section, called wall dr, consisted of a double row of large stones with a core of smaller stones. It originally had at least two courses, as stones to the nw and se appear to have fallen from the wall. [Wall di lay just under the modern surface (plate 5 d). For its specifications see table 1.16. Since the cist walls dl and dn abutted it, the sw</page><page sequence="59">THE BRONZE AGE ARCHITECTURE AND STRATIGRAPHY §3 33 Fig. 1.17. Area Eta. Pottery section e-w across central part of Area, looking north (see fig. 1.15, B-IT). section antedates the cist, which was built in LH IIA Early. This section cut not only the MH I wall dh but also, perhaps, wall dk, which was probably MH III, as will be shown in § 3 (iii) below. The ne section, wall dr, is probably of the same date, i.e. LH I, but its base was at the same level as the MH II- III cobbled surface to its N. The plan, fig. 1.15, shows that it abutted wall di. [The assorted LH finds are catalogued in table 1.17. Some probably derive from disturbed graves. Burials 13 and 15 are definitely LH, and there is also a little Mycenaean material in the contexts of burials 5 and 7-8, which may date these interments;14 their locations are marked in fig. 2.2. The two bird askoi 1319-1320 probably each represent a disturbed LH III infant burial. The presence of Mycenaean graves suggests that the Area was an open space throughout this period.] (iii) Middle Helladic II-III [There were two walls of this period, namely walls dk and dp.] Wall dk, with a ne-sw axis, was built over the ne end of the MH I Early wall dj (see fig. 1.15 and plates 4 b and 5 d). It did not appear to be connected with the MH I Late walls dg and dh but was at the same level as they were. It was only 1.5 m long, consisted of a double row of medium to large stones and was some four stones long on each side. It was only one course high and was cut at both ends. [Wall dk was possibly cut at the ne by wall di/dr, which was LH I in date.15 Its sw end appeared to have been dug or eroded away. As wall dk was off-axis in relation to walls dg and dh, which are MH I Late, and it overlay the line of the MH I Early wall dj, it should date from MH II-III. When 14 See Chapter 2 §3 below. 15 See §3 (ii) above with plate 4 c.</page><page sequence="60">34 W. D. TAYLOURt AND R. JANKO Fig. li 8. Area Eta. Pottery section e-w across s part of Area, looking north (see fig. 1.15, C-C). removed, it proved to contain MH II- III sherds, but these could not be dated more precisely; it was probably MH III (see table 1.18). It overlay a stratum containing MH II material with a few small Mycenaean or perhaps Lustrous Decorated pieces; any Mycenaean material must be intrusive, as the excavator suggested.] Wall dp in the nw sector had a wnw to ese axis; for its details see table 1 . 1 8. It extended for 1 .65 m from the w baulk before it was cut by the cist of the Early Mycenaean burial 15. Only the ne face was fully cleared; it consisted of five medium-to-large stones in a single course. Several stones in a parallel line to the sw may have formed the sw face of the wall. [Wall dp must have been MH II. This wall, together with the paved area at its base, was overlain by a stratum that was MH II- III or more probably pure MH II, i.e. basket 55. This stratum contained sherds 1288-1315, together with the small kantharos 1288a, the obsidian bladelet 6129 and the end-scraper 6143. The exact find spots of these items are unknown. Below the base of wall dp there began a MH I layer, basket 58, as can be seen from fig. 1.19.] To the N of wall di and the cist of Eta burial 15 a level contained MH II pottery. At a higher elevation, a cobbled area occupied the ne corner of the Area; this was probably one of many M H roads recognised during the excavation of the site. [The cobbles of Street Eta I were not removed, and excavation ceased at this depth in this corner.] (iv) Middle Helladic I Late [A clear and consistent picture has emerged from a study of the pottery from the complex levels in this trench. Most of the MBA occupation levels date from the second and final phase of MH I in the Area, as C. Zerner argues below;16 the excavator had dated this phase to MH II. This pottery corresponds to the final phase of MH I in Area Zeta. An undersized charcoal sample (P-2571) from a stratum of this period yielded a radiocarbon date of 2075 bc ±725. 17 In this MH I Late building phase, walls dg and dh formed the corner of a building, Structure Eta I, which was also called Room 1 .] 16 See Chapter 5 §5 (iii). 17 See Appendix g §3.</page><page sequence="61">THE BRONZE AGE ARCHITECTURE AND STRATIGRAPHY §3 35 Fig. 1.19. Area Eta. Pottery section nnw-sse across Area, looking east (see fig. 1.15, D-D'). Walls dg and dh bond, a single block neatly forming the exterior cornerstone of each wall: see plate 4 b and ¿with fig. 1.15 and table 1.19. Together they form a corner that pointed due w; the other sides of the building have been quarried or eroded away. Wall dg is the better preserved of the two. It passes over the earlier wall dj, a long wall with the ne-sw axis. It consists of two courses, except for the last metre of its surviving length, when it is preserved in one course only. The lower course is made up of two rows of roughly rectangular stones with flattened faces towards the exterior. The interior between the two faces took up little space and was mostly filled with earth. Above these is a layer of smaller stones that may have been bonded with mud to form the foundation of a mudbrick wall above it. Wall dh is of similar construction. It is only partly preserved at its ne end, which has been cut by wall di of the cist of the Early Mycenaean burial 15. It is slightly off-axis in relation to wall di. [It was hard to determine which pottery and small finds were associated with the use of Structure Eta I, because several later burials were made within the angle of its walls. The finds are listed in table 1.20. The pottery ascribed to this phase comprises sherds 1237-1287. Most of the complete vessels were found outside Structure Eta I, in an area some 60 cm to the nw of wall dh and some 1.5 x 1.0 m in extent (figs. 1.15-1.16, at left, and plate 5 a). These were the kantharos 1237, the very worn bowl 1247 and the cooking pot 1279. This context also yielded the terracotta whorl 6032 and spool 6044, and the Mycenaean bird askos 1320.

[The Lustrous Decorated jug 1265, large parts of which were recovered from the same sector, provides a link with the finds from inside Structure Eta I, since several sherds of this vessel were also found in the corner of walls dg and dh. The floor here survived in an area extending some 2.25 m E from the interior of this corner; it also yielded the cooking pot 1318, the body of a large closed vase (1251a), which could not be reconstructed and was not kept, the bone pin-head 6002 and the un worked pig's tusk 9164. [A wash line was visible in the section sloping from the tops of walls dg and dh downwards to the s, as is seen in fig. 1.20. This wash line consisted of many small stones and pithos fragments on top of the destruction level (stratum 4), and represents the erosion of the debris from the collapse of the building. South of wall dg it was overlain by a further deposit of finer earth, stratum 3, of the same colour. [Both the pottery deposit from within Structure Eta I and that nw of wall dh were found in a dark greyish-brown level about 14 cm deep, seen in fig. 1.20 at left and centre (stratum 4), and in fig. 1.21 (stratum 2). This layer clearly represents the destruction of the building. In addition to the pottery it contained fallen stones, some of them burnt, and at its base slabs of reddish-yellow smoothed mud 'plaster' or daub (fig. 1.20, stratum 5); these had reed impressions on the opposite side measuring 1.2 and 0.6-0.7 cm wide. This was probably roofing material, using canes from the giant canna reed Arundo donax, now called kalámia. The ceiling or roof could have been made of smoothed mud resting on canes, which in turn rested on beams. For a contemporary example from Area Nu see plate 17 b.</page><page sequence="64">38 W. D. TAYLOURt AND R. JANKO Clay resting on canes was used for roofing in LH II Nichoria,18 and canes were probably employed for pitched roofs in the Dark Age there.19 They are still used in Laconia for ceilings, as in 19th century houses at Aphyssoú near Sparta. For the daub to have survived, the building must have burned down. This destruction level lay over a light brownish-grey stratum some 24 cm thick (fig. 1.20, stratum 6), which is dated to MH I Early and itself overlies wall dj of that phase. [The pottery found nw of wall dh seems to have been badly shattered but not burned. The presence of sherds of the Lustrous Decorated jug 1265 both inside and outside the building confirms that the areas either side of wall dh were in use at the same time. A thin layer of fine white clay in the western section of Trench I, n of the corner formed by walls dg and dh (fig. 1.21, stratum 6), may represent the contemporary floor surface here.] Another closed vessel, the Dull Painted jar 1255, was found in a rather more complete state than those mentioned above; its relation to them is perplexing. Its neck and upper body were found inside Structure Eta I, resting against the ne face of wall dg, with its neck pointing towards the corner (plate 1 8 d) . Some pieces were found in a vertical position against that wall, with burnt bone in the vicinity. Sherds from its belly were scattered further to the E, disturbed by the later burials 1 and 7 (see fig. 2.2). [This vessel was found within the dark greyish-brown destruction-level above the layer of flat pieces of tan-coloured daub which were observed throughout Structure Eta I (fig. 1.20, stratum 4 above stratum 5). The excavator at first associated jar 1255 with one of the pithos burials, Eta burial 1, which were later made within this room, and subsequently with another interment, Eta burial 7, although the mouth of the jar seemed too narrow for it to have contained either infant. However, C. Zerner doubts whether jar 1255 belonged with burial 7; this latter interment is in fact Mycenaean.20 Zerner proposes rather that the jar dates Structure Eta I,21 and the fact that the jar is burnt supports this view. But if this jar belongs with the pottery deposit from this building, it is puzzling that daub from its fallen superstructure lay under the jar, and the closed vase 1251a lay below this stratum. The explanation is surely that jar 1255 was on the roof when the building caught fire, and fell into Structure Eta I when its ceiling collapsed. The recovery of sherds of the Lustrous Decorated jug 1265 from both inside Structure Eta I and to the nw might have the same cause, although there is no record that these sherds were burnt. The carbon- 14 sample of charcoal P-2571 was found in the extreme se part of the Area in a stratum of this phase.22] Wall dq was a single row of five medium-to-large stones that lay i. 25 cm above the dividing line between EH and MH, which was the floor associated with the MH I Early wall dj. [Wall dq runs from wsw to ene for c. 1.6 m until it appears to be cut by the later wall di where the latter forms part of the cist of the LH I burial 15; its alignment differs slightly from that of wall di. Its date must be MH I Late, since it underlies basket 3, which represents the MH I Late destruction, but is at a higher level than the MH I Early wall dj. The function of wall dq is unknown.] In the narrow space between wall dh and the earlier wall dj no fewer than five infant or child burials were uncovered, viz. burials 4, 7 and 9-11 (see fig. 2.2). Another four, viz. burials 1-3 and 8, were found close by on top of the earlier wall dj and belong to the same group. There seem to be two phases of infant or child burials in this area near walls dh and dg. Burials 4 and 9-11 were at a lower level than 1-3, 7 and 8. [The former set of burials were well below the bases of walls dh and dg and were presumably intramural interments below the floor associated with these walls, as J. B. Rutter suggested. These were all below the layer of daub with reed impressions, probably from the collapsed roof of Structure Eta I, whereas the latter burials were above this level. Hence the former group of infants was interred while the building was still in use. However, the latter group was buried afterwards, some of them during Mycenaean times.23] (v) Middle Helladic I Early [The MH I Early phase in Area Eta involved wall dj with an associated surface to its nw that rested directly on EH II strata. For details of the wall see table 1.21. The pottery of this phase is sherds 1191-1236.] Wall dj, the principal wall in this Area, stretched diagonally for c. 5 m across the Area from sw to ne, finishing about a metre short of the ne section of the later wall di/dr, which cut across its path (see fig. 1.15 and plate 4 b-c). It was the earliest of the MH walls in this Area. In its central sw section, 18 Rapp 1978, 227. 19 Coulson 1983, 31. 20 See Chapter 2 §3 below. 21 See Chapter 5 §5 (iii) below. 22 See Appendix 9 §3. 23 See §3 (ii) above.</page><page sequence="65">THE BRONZE AGE ARCHITECTURE AND STRATIGRAPHY §3 39 wall dj was crossed by the later wall dg (plate 4 ¿); wall dg made a corner with wall dh at its nw end (plate 4 d)y so that the latter ran in a ne direction at a slight angle to wall dj. A third wall in this sector, wall do, which was at right angles to wall dj on its se flank, had no connection with it either, and is even earlier; it is, in fact, EH II.24 Wall dj appears to have been built along the s edge of a sudden drop in the bedrock; the nw face lay consistently 10-15 cm above bedrock, whereas the se face was 50 cm above it. The wall nowhere consisted of more than two courses and was largely built of rather small stones in two rows with even smaller ones in the core. In general, larger stones were used on the nw face and again on the se face at the sw end. The base of its nw face sloped down somewhat to the sw. The floor associated with dj occupied the triangle made by wall dj, the later wall dg and the w baulk. This floor, like wall dj itself, rested directly on EH material. The most interesting faunal evidence recovered from any of the earliest levels on the site was the deer bones found in this Area in both EH and MH I layers.25 [The interpretation of wall dj is not immediately obvious. Its great length suggests that it was either simply a terrace wall, or else part of the side wall of one of the very large apsidal houses that existed at Ayios Stephanos during MH I, like Structure Nu I26 and Structure Alpha III, found in Area Alpha during the earlier excavations, which is known to have been some 1 1-14 m long.27 If it was the wall of such a building, the interior probably lay to the nw, since on this side of the wall the excavator recognised a clear division between the light brownish-grey earth, dated to MH I Early, and a dark greyish-brown stratum beneath it, dated to EH II Late (fig. 1.20, strata 6 and 8). A light grey level of fine clay, visible in the western section of Trench I N of wall dj, may be the associated floor level (fig. 1.21, stratum 7). In the sw part of this sector the excavator suspected a floor because considerable parts of two MH I vessels, neither of which had a complete profile, seemed to rest on a surface associated with wall dj (see plate 5 b). To the se of wall dj, on the other hand, he found no clear transition between EH II and MH I, only mixed levels varying in thickness from 50 cm ne of the EH wall do to at least 30 cm sw of it, as if the ground had been churned up by cultivation or by the feet of animals penned up in an enclosure. However, the only large fragment of MH I Early pottery, the rim of the coarse rounded bowl 1277, comes from the lowest excavated level SE of wall dj in the extreme sw of the Area, shown at the left in figs. 1.18 and 1.20. There are few finds that definitely belong to this phase rather than to the underlying EH II. The paucity of these finds, listed in table 1.22, suggests either that wall dj was a terrace wall after all, or that the building to which it belonged was carefully cleaned out before the succeeding phase of construction. [As in Area Zeta, there was a transition directly from EH II Late to MH I Early, with no intervening EH III phase. Except in the extreme s of the Area, this transition was explored all the way s from the later wall di to well beyond the MH I wall dj. North-west of wall dj the transition was clearly visible as a change in soil colour, where the excavator suspected the presence of a MH I Early floor, as was noted above. But in the sectors ne and sw of the EH II wall do and se of the MH I Early wall dj, the transitional layer consists of about 5 cm of reddish-brown earth, baskets 25 and 29, with a mixture of EH II Late and MH I Early sherds, together with material from the Medieval pit. The reddish-brown earth was presumably decayed mudbrick; there was also stone tumble, no doubt from wall do. The building of which it was part was apparently abandoned; there was no sign of burning. From this evidence, limited and tenuous as it admittedly is, it certainly seems possible that Ayios Stephanos was unoccupied for a time, and perhaps for several centuries, during the troubled transition from the EBA to MBA. An undersized sample of charcoal from this transitional stratum sw of the line of the later wall dg (sample P-2570) yielded a calibrated radiocarbon date of 2375 bc ±525, which may correspond to EH II Early.28] (vi) Early Helladic II Late Where penetration was made to the bedrock, EH II sherds were usually found at Ayios Stephanos, but in only two Areas, Zeta and Eta, were actual architectural remains of the period uncovered. Area Eta was a comparatively shallow trench, and pure EH levels were reached at 0.80 m below the surface; bedrock appeared at a depth of 1.3 m. An EH II occupation layer came to light in the east- central part of the Area (fig. 1.15). A possible floor of this period was recognised in the south-central part of the Area in the space enclosed by the later walls dj and dg to the sw of wall do, which is EH 24 See §§3 (vi)-(vii) below. 25 See Chapter 12 §2 and Appendix 8 (d) below. 26 See §8 (x) below. 27 Taylour 1972, 240-1 with 210 fie. 3. 28 See Appendix 9 §2.</page><page sequence="66">4O W. D. TAYLOURt AND R. JANKO II. On this floor lay the good part of the Urfirnis saucer 31 (plate 5 c). Another floor was recognised to the ne of wall do (plate 5 d) . More of these levels extended nw on the further side of wall dj and passed under the later wall dh. [Statistical analysis of the pottery29 has confirmed the realisation of the excavator, J. B. Rutter, that the EH levels were not all of the same date. In fact, they comprise two phases of EH II in addition to EH I.30 The later phase of EH II is characterised by the presence of Cream-Slipped ware as well as that of Yellow Mottled ware, which was used in both phases of EH II but not during EH I. The EH II layers are associated with wall do. They appear in the schematic sections (figs. 1.16-1.17 and 1.19), and in section in figs. 1.20-1.22. Although wall do continued in use to the end of this period, it was apparently built during EH II Early, and is therefore described in §3 (vii) below. [In the extreme s of the Area, pure EH levels had not been reached when excavation ceased (see fig. 1.18). However, EH II Late sherds are present in the mixed baskets 38 and 54, a layer at least 30 cm thick. To the N, in the vicinity of Eta burial 15 (see fig. 2.2 below), any level of this date has been destroyed in the construction of the LH I cist; but in the extreme N of the Area, sherds of this date were recorded in the mixed basket 58, although pure EH levels were not reached. NW of the later wall dj, however, an area some 5 x 1 m in extent yielded sherds and perhaps a few small objects, but no whole EH pots; the only one to be registered was the T-rim shallow bowl 217. Almost all the small finds that might derive from this phase came from strata mixed with MH I material; only the floor sw of wall do was undisturbed. A considerable number of fragmentary pots and small finds were discovered throughout the sectors that were cleared, with the possible exception of the sector lying ne of wall do, where only sherds were found. Their abundance shows that we are dealing with occupation debris both inside the building sw of wall do and on the bedrock to its w and nw. The objects dating from the second phase of EH II are listed in table 1.23. The EH deposits also yielded the bones of sheep or goat, pig and ox, the last two with butchery marks in some cases.31] (vii) Early Helladic II Early [The earlier phase of EH II, characterised by the presence of Yellow Mottled ware but the absence of Cream-Slipped ware, is attested over all the sectors that were cleared down to bedrock, except sw of wall do, where EH II Late material overlies EH I directly and is apparently mixed with it. EH II Early sherds are found, if we go in a clockwise direction (see fig. 1.15), in (a) in the whole triangular sector between the later walls di and dj, i.e. nw of the sudden rise in the bedrock mentioned above; (b) the lowest stratum on bedrock under the LH IIA cist, Eta burial 15; and (c) the corner to the ne of wall do and to the se of the later wall dj, i.e. the area below and to the se of the rise in the bedrock, over the EH I deposit in basket 68. The layers of this date are visible in the sections, figs. 1.16-1.17 and 1.19-1.21. The area cleared was approximately (a) 5 x 1 m, (b) 1.5 x 0.75 m and (c) 1.5 x 1.5 m, giving a total area of 8.375 m2-] Among the profusion of later walls in the Area, the only one that could be identified as EH II was wall do, which ran nw-se for some 1.15m, starting from the se, where it was cut by the deep Medieval pit mentioned above,32 to the point where it disappeared at the nw under the MH I Early wall dj. Wall do did not reappear nw of wall dj, probably because the bedrock rose rather suddenly at that point (figs. 1.15 and 1.19). The excavator, J. B. Rutter, was of the opinion that the wall may have purposely been built perpendicularly to the line of the sharp fall in the bedrock. The wall had one course only. It consisted of a double row of stones with a core of small stones. The width of the wall was 50-55 cm. [For wall do see fig. 1.15, plate 5 ¿-¿/and table 1.24. Since the base of wall do was at the same level as the bottom of basket 67, which is dated to EH II Early, its construction should belong to this period. However, wall do continued in use until the end of EH II at the site.] A strainer of EH II date, 218, was recovered from underneath the later wall dh, between the later walls di and dj. [Several other EH II Early vases were found both to both N and s: the sauceboat 190 lay under the cist of Eta burial 15, just above the bedrock, and the large bowl 216 and EM import 222 were on the bedrock at a similar depth, underneath or to the s of the later wall dg. Also, the 'wishbone' handle fragment 219, from an EH I- II 'frying pan', was found in the Medieval pit (fig. 1.22) which was cut almost to bedrock through the EH levels ne of wall do, and which contained EH I and EH II sherds; the handle undoubtedly originated within these levels.] Quantities of obsidian bladelets, namely 5030-5033, 5038-5039, 5042 and 5043-5045, were found with this EH II pottery, as well as the small pierced phyllite disc 5025. 29 See Appendix i . 30 See §§3 (vii)-(viii) below. 31 See Chapter 12 §2 and Appendix 8 below. 32 See §3 (i).</page><page sequence="67">THE BRONZE AGE ARCHITECTURE AND STRATIGRAPHY §3 41 Fig. 1.22.

He observed of basket 28 that 'the incised fragments and the burnished may indicate an early phase of EH II or even EH I ... Sherds in a heavy burnished fabric, red and brown in colour - this looks like EH F. He noted of basket 31 that 'burnished ware comprises a very large percentage of the total and this is either early EH II or somewhere in EH F.33 A. MacGillivray also recognised EH I material in these two baskets (sherds ib, 3-11 and 13). A statistical seriation study34 confirms this conclusion, since it shows that Yellow Mottled ware had not yet come into use during EH I. Baskets 28 and 31 contain EH I, although in these cases it is mixed with EH II Late. However, basket 68, which has neither Yellow Mottled nor Cream-Slipped pieces, should date from EH I as well, and has no later admixture. On it Rutter had already commented: 'remarkable are (i) the complete absence of Yellow Mottled [ware] and (ii) the high percentage of coarse burnished pieces; it is hard to escape the conclusion that this is an earlier phase of EH . . . than that of baskets 65 and 66.' This small corpus of EH I pottery constitutes the earliest known occupation at the site. [The EH I occupation was spread over a smaller area than that of EH II Early. The EH I assemblage is not associated with any structure, since it was found at a depth below that of the base of wall do, which was c. -2.2 m BM (see figs. 1.16-1.17, 1.19, 1.22). Wall do must therefore be EH II in date. The EH I surface is nestled against that steep rise in the bedrock from se to nw along which the MH I wall dj would later be built (fig. 1.15). The extent of the EH I deposit to the ne of wall do was about 1.5 x 1.5 m, i.e. 2.25 m2, with a depth of light yellowish-brown deposit, basket 68, some 14 cm thick. To the sw of wall do as far as the later wall dg, the area cleared was a little larger, some 1.5 x 2.0 m in extent, i.e. 3 m2. The strata over bedrock, baskets 28 and 31, were 40-60 cm deep; these contained a mixture of sherds of EH I and EH II Late, with a floor of the latter date on top, as was shown by the presence of the complete EH II vessel 31. In the sw corner of the Area, in the corner formed by the later walls dg and dj, the requisite depth was not attained, but the presence of several sherds of 33 J. B. Rutter, pottery notebook. 34 See Appendix i .</page><page sequence="68">42 W. D. TAYLOURt AND R. JANKO burnished ware in baskets 38, 54 and 70 may imply that the EH I occupation extended further to the sw. Meanwhile, se of the sudden rise in the bedrock, the EH I layer sloped gently down from ne to sw, which explains its greater depth to the s. Up the hill nw of the rise in the bedrock, beyond the line of the later wall dj, EH I deposits were not encountered; an EH II Early layer rested directly on the bedrock. However, the presence of sherds of burnished ware in the lowest stratum excavated in Trench III, basket 58 containing MH I pottery, suggests that an EH I level lay below the point at which excavation ceased in the extreme N of the Area. [The finds from the EH I surface are listed in table 1.25; they consist entirely of obsidian objects, including the cortical flake 5041, except for two flakes of white and red chert that were not retained. A number of lumps of obsidian and a flake with part of the stone's weathered cortex were also found but not kept. It is clear that the production of obsidian tools was taking place on this surface. The excavator observed that 'a feature characteristic of the EH levels here is the very small amount of bone and skull compared to what comes out of the overlying MH strata'. The phalanx of a hare was recovered from basket 68, proving that this species was then hunted.35] 4. AREA BETA 3, 8, 9 AND 10, 1974-77: EARLY TO LATE HELLADIC (figs. 1.23-1.33) (i) Introduction [This Area, which for convenience is called Area Beta 1974-77, combines Trenches Beta 3, 8, 9 and 10, which were originally distinct. Area Beta 1974-77 lay directly to the ne of Area Beta of 1959-63, which comprises trenches Beta 1-2 and 4-7. In the latter Area the original trenches Beta 1 and 2 were expanded with trenches Beta 5 to its s, Beta 7 to its N, Beta 4 and 6 to the w, and Beta 1 1 and 1 2 to the sw (fig. iv).36 At its e edge, Area Beta 1959-63 is separated from Area Beta 1974-77 by a baulk of only 0.5 m; at its w edge, it is contiguous with Area Lambda of 1973-74. Since parts of trench Beta 1 of 1959 and of trenches Beta 12A and 12B of 1963 share much stratigraphy and architecture with Area Lambda, these trenches are discussed in the account of Area Lambda/Beta 12.37 The rest of Area Beta of 1959-63 is not republished in this volume, except that in Chapter 14 below a few minor reinterpretations have been ventured where the evidence permits. [Area Beta 1974-77 was tilted downwards from ne to sw. For a plan of it, showing the trenches, sectors, LH IIA-IIIAi walls and sections, see fig. 1.23, and for the main sections see figs. 1.24-1.26. Its se corner was the first to be excavated, since an E-w trench of 5 x 1.5 m was originally dug as trench Beta 3 in 1959, 5 m to the e of trench Beta 2; for the location see figs, ii-iv.38 One burial was published,39 but there were so many walls that the architecture and stratigraphy seemed incomprehensible.40 The renewal of excavation and an improved understanding of the ceramic sequence have allowed us to interpret the finds from trench Beta 3 and to republish them here.] In 1974 the unexcavated zone between Beta 3 and the old Area Beta was investigated in trench Beta 8, which was 50 cm w of Beta 3 and 4 x 4 m in extent. It was separated from the old Beta 2 to the w by a 50 cm baulk. The zone to the n of trench Beta 3 was explored in trench Beta 9, which was 50 cm N of Beta 3 and was 5 x 5 m in size. Trench Beta 10 lay to the N of trench Beta 8 and w of Beta 9, separated from each of these by a 50 cm baulk; it was 4 m (e-w) x 2.5 m in extent. In 1977 the whole of Beta 3/8/9/10 was combined by removing the baulks between them; the resultant Area was 7 m (n-s) x 9.5 m in extent, i.e. 66.5 m2. Most of the work was accomplished in 1977, since the 1974 season was curtailed.41 There were four burials from Area Beta 3/8/9/10 in 1974 and ten in 1977, if we count robbed cists, as well as one in 1959. For a full account of these and the finds associated with them see Chapter 2 §4 below. (ii) Late Helladic IIIA2-IIIC Early The removal of the Medieval levels involved the destruction of the Medieval walls: compare the LH IIA-IIIAi plan (fig. 1.23) with that of the Medieval period (fig. 3.2). [A late Mycenaean level 35 See Chapter 12 §2 with Appendix 8 (e) below. 36 This Area is shown in Taylour 1972, 231 fig. 15. 37 See §5 below. 38 The plan drawn by the excavator, R. Hope Simpson, appears in Taylour 1972, 206 fig. 2. 39 Tavlour 1072, 2^2. 40 Tavlour 10,72, 2^%. 41 For the extensive Medieval levels throughout the Area see Chapter 3 §3 below, with fig. 3.2.</page><page sequence="69">THE BRONZE AGE ARCHITECTURE AND STRATIGRAPHY §4 43 Fig. 1.23.

Plan showing sectors, sections (figs. 1.24-1.26), elevations (figs. 1.27, 1.29-1.30) and LH IIA-IIIAi walls, with LH IIIAi pottery and finds. was present se of the Medieval wall ee in the se corner (fig. 1.25 stratum 5), which yielded many fragments of deep bowls, the bone awl 7001 and the greenstone polisher 7254. The presence of such a layer in the SW and South- Central Sectors will be discussed shortly. Elsewhere, if such levels once existed, they were presumably eroded or terraced away, since the Medieval buildings in the nw and ne directly overlay LH I- II levels: see fig. 1.26 at right, and the left edge of fig. 1.25, where the stratigraphy continues leftward without change or any features for a further 3 m all the way to the ne corner of the Area. The excavator in 1974, M. K. Langdon, was surely right to suspect that the later Mycenaean layers were deliberately removed.] The principal evidence for occupation in LH IIIC Early was in the south-central part of the Area. However, it is not clear whether there were any walls of this date. A monochrome kylix base (not kept), probably of LH IIIC Early, was the latest sherd found with earlier pottery in the foundation trench dug for wall eb, and might seem to date that wall. The nw end of wall eb made use of an earlier structure: this stretch of wall turned out to be a step (Step I) at the end of an alley laid out in LH IIA, as is explained below.42 However, wall eb was certainly in use in the Medieval period, along with walls ea and ec, which were entirely Medieval constructions. 42 See §4 (iii) (a) below.</page><page sequence="70">44 W.

D. TAYLOURt AND R. JANKO [Further study of the stratigraphy confirms that wall eb too was built in the Medieval period. In the SW Sector, below the wash-line that marked the Medieval abandonment, there was a triangular area of brown soil and rubble, called the 'rubble floor' (fig. 1.24 stratum 7); this overlay another possible floor level ('the light brown floor') with a supposed pit beneath (fig. 1.24 stratum 9). The Medieval wall ea cut through both layers into the LH IIIAi fill below (fig. 1.24 stratum 12). In the South- Central Sector a reddish brown layer (fig. 1.24 stratum 4) overlay light brown earth (fig. 1.24 stratum 8). All four layers produced a great deal of LH IIIA2, LH IIIB, Transitional and LH IIIC Early pottery (33i6-338oa). LH IIIC Early sherds were present throughout, but LH IIIA2 pieces were common too, both at the top and at the base of all four strata. The finds included substantially complete vessels of various dates: the LH IIA beaked jug 3253 and cup 3287a, the LH IIIA2 coarse basin 3326, the LH IIIB hydria 3342, the LH IIIC Early collar-necked jar 3357 and kylix 3380 and the 'souvlaki dish' 3380a. A grain of wheat also survived (9285). This sector produced many other finds, listed in table 1.26. [One might deduce that these numerous finds and the whole pots came from a LH IIIC Early floor associated with wall eb, since all these finds were made to the w of it. Indeed, the reddish brown layer (fig. 1.24 stratum 4) appears to run up to wall eb, whereas the light brown stratum 8 runs under that wall. On this interpretation stratum 4 would have been the floor, whereas stratum 8 would have been fill dumped to level off the ground for the construction of wall eb. However, the presence of Medieval as well as LH IIIA2 material in both strata weakens this hypothesis. The floor of the room delimited by walls ea and eb must have been badly disturbed by the Medieval occupation. Further w, however, there was no such disturbance. Thus it seems best to regard both strata as material resulting from a single episode of dumping mixed earth and rubble from the demolition of a building that was first used in LH IIIA2 and abandoned in LH IIIC Early; this dumping would have taken place during LH IIIC Early. Within the confines of Structure Beta VI, both strata of this fill suffered Medieval disturbance. If this interpretation is correct, it follows that wall eb is Medieval, except for its reuse of the LH IIA step at its N end. The fact that it had a foundation trench, like the Medieval walls in both this Area and Area Lambda 3/4, supports this dating.] Below these layers there appeared what was initially thought to have been a curved wall, to which the title of wall ev was given. These stones could give the impression of belonging to a collapsed building. However, its walls were not well defined, and to judge by fig. 1.24, the section of the s baulk, it does not seem to have had impressive foundations. A lot of pottery but no complete vases were found in the triangular space formed by this feature. When its stones were removed, the latest pottery found in them, sherd 3323, was LH IIIA2, which suggests that it dates from that time or later. [The excavator in 1977, P. Wright, proposed that this feature was a building put up in LH IIIA2 and demolished during LH IIIC Early, when the lower stratum described above overlaid its ruins. However, the editor prefers to interpret it as a triangular dump of loose stone thrown into the bottom of a dip into which more earth and stones were then tipped. This material may even have come from later Mycenaean buildings in the north of the Area that were terraced away at the start of the Medieval phase by the builders of Structures Beta V and VI.43] The NE Sector (see fig. 3.2 and plate 6 d) was bounded to the sw by wall ef, to the nw by wall eg and by the N and e baulks. [Since neither wall was removed and no occupation-levels associated with them were identified, the dating of these walls and the associated bench fh is uncertain. W. D. Taylour regarded them as Bronze Age walls built in LH IIIAi or later but reused in Medieval times. However, they match the Medieval plan so well that they are now interpreted as entirely Medieval constructions.44 If so, the later Bronze Age levels must have been entirely removed in this sector, so that these walls, which would, like the other Byzantine walls, have had foundation trenches, appeared to be adjacent to MH III and Early Mycenaean strata.] Only stray LH IIIA2 sherds were found elsewhere, which may imply that the rest of this Area was then deserted. It is likely that other potsherds of this period are attributable to wash. [The ostrich eggshell 9214 found in the NW Sector probably came from LH II-IIIA strata that were disturbed by Medieval construction. One cannot exclude the possibility that there was Medieval terracing there also, or that the eggshell was a Medieval import.] Two interments date from LH IIIA2 or later, namely Beta burials 22 and 26.45 43 See Chanter s §* below. 44 See Chapter 3 §3 with fig. 3.2 below. 45 See Chapter 2 §4 below.</page><page sequence="75">THE BRONZE AGE ARCHITECTURE AND STRATIGRAPHY §4 49 (iii) Middle Helladic III Late to Late Helladic IIIAi At this time the Area sloped down from ne to sw, whereas later it sloped from nw to se. [This period falls into two phases. The later is LH IIA to LH IIIAi (fig. 1.23), with a detailed plan of the remarkable LH IIA forge in the SE Sector (fig. 1.28); this is preceded by MH III Late to LH I (fig. 1.31). Since there was a considerable overlap between them in the architecture, they are taken together, sector by sector.] (a) THE SW AND CENTRAL SECTORS [After several other interpretations had been suggested, study of the stratigraphy has revealed that these sectors were both occupied by a large courtyard throughout this time. The edges of this yard measured at least 5.6 x 5.6 x 5.2 m, and its total area was certainly over 30 m2; its boundaries to the s and sw are unknown, as they lie beyond the baulks. It went through three architectural stages, as will be shown below. It was possibly laid out in MH III Late or LH I. During LH IIA a stepped and gated alley, Street Beta IV, leading down to the courtyard was constructed, and the courtyard itself was paved with slabs, over which earth accumulated. In LH IIB one corner of it, here called the Central Sector, went out of use. In LH IIIAi a bench was added; but shortly afterwards, and still within LH IIIAi, the entire terrace fell into disuse. For the details of these walls see table 1.27.] In the SW Sector the nw end of the Medieval wall eb (fig. 3.2) made use of an earlier structure. This stretch of wall, 1.4 m in length, was of different construction from the rest of it to the se. It was better built and had two extra courses for its foundation. Also, as is seen in plate 6 a, it appeared to bond with another wall, wall ed. During the removal of wall eb the situation was clarified. It was seen that the lowest course of the nw end of that wall - the better-built part referred to above - constituted a broad step, Step I, onto a small terrace roughly 1.2 m square, bounded by two walls, walls ed and es, on the nw and another wall, wall eo, on the se (see fig. 1.23). At the nw end of this step a short wall er against wall ed may have acted as an anta supporting one side of a gateway. At the ne end of this small terrace was a second step, Step II, up to a road, Street Beta IV, which, flanked by walls eo and es, led gently upwards in a north-easterly direction. These steps yielded the LH IIA sherds 3246 and 3282, which date their construction and therefore also date that of wall ed, since the lower step, Step I, bonds with it. [Street Beta IV varied between 0.6 and 1.1 m in width. Since wall ed lies at an elevation above two successive LH IIA floors (see fig. 1.27), it must have been built later in LH IIA or even at the start of LH IIB.] Wall eo formed the se flanking wall of the roadway. This wall was called wall fe N of the line of the earlier wall fc, and ek where it passed over two earlier walls, ej and fc. The nw flank of the roadway was formed by another wall, wall es. [Wall ed ran to the sw of wall es on a similar alignment. Indeed wall ed continued for a further 3.35 m to the sw into trench Beta 2 of 1959, where it was called wall gh. At its end it formed a right angle with wall ha, which had a nw-se axis and ran 1 m se into trench Beta 5 of i960. Since Steps I and II and wall ed are all dated to LH IIA or soon after, walls eo and es were built at this same time, together with the anta er (fig. 1.23). Thus major construction was undertaken during LH II, which entailed the building of the steps, alley-walls and gateway.] Although wall ed cannot antedate LH IIA, the short wall ew that abutted against it must have been a little later, since it had only two courses, whereas wall ed continued in depth below these. [Wall ew contained LH II and possibly LH IIIAi sherds, and was overlaid by a LH IIIAi level. It was a stone bench facing se, presumably with a view of the sea towards Kythera. Two LH IIIAi vessels, the dipper 3306 and the kylix 3313, were found in the ne angle formed by the bench ew and wall ed against which it had been built, as if left there someone who had been sitting on the bench and drinking wine (plate 6 c), just as the dipper 3305 was found with the goblet 3314 by Step I. Together with a krater, the dipper and kylix or goblet evidently formed a standard drinking-set, and these four vessels were perhaps all abandoned on the same occasion.] The Central Sector, at first called 'Room A, was a rectangular space defined on two sides by the double walls ep/ey and ej/fc. The combination of walls is unusual: a double wall, ej/fc with roughly nw-se axis in the n part, made a corner with another pair of walls, ep/ey with approximate ne-sw axis, as is seen in plate ja-b. The latter pair of walls continued sw and disappeared into the s baulk. [All these walls were in existence before the LH II remodeling. The lower courses of walls fc and ej passed under wall eo, i.e. the boundary of the alley (see fig. 1.31). The upper course of wall ej bonded with wall ep, and that of wall ey bonded with wall fc. However, the remaining courses of wall ej went much deeper than the base of wall ep, which might seem to suggest that it was built before wall ep. Not enough of wall fc was exposed to establish whether it went as deep as wall ey.</page><page sequence="76">5O W. D. TAYLOURt AND R. JANKO Fig. 1.27. Area Beta 3/8/9/10, SW sector. Elevation of baulk under wall ed, looking north-west (see figs. 1.23, 1.31 and 1.32, D-D'). Wall ey ran just under the ne face of the wall ex, and seems not to have extended beyond it; instead, it turned to the nw to become wall fc. It follows that wall ex is later than wall ey.] Walls ej/fc certainly seem to have been terrace walls built against the tilt of the Area, which sloped from ne to sw; the double thickness was intended to support the terraces behind. As none of these walls was removed, their dating is not clear. Wall ep overlay walls em and fb, which are both MH III Early. Wall ey overlay wall em, but was overlaid by the LH IIB floor in the SE Sector.46 [The history of these walls is hard to establish with certainty. The double wall comprising ej and fc was built at a different time from the MH III Early terrace wall em, since this is on a different axis. Just as wall em was built on the terrace to the sw cut back into a MH II stratum, so the double wall was erected in order to enlarge this same terrace. This must have happened after wall em fell into disuse. The base of wall ej may just have been reached when excavation ceased at -3.08 BM; this too was in a MH II stratum, but walls ej/fc too may have been built in a cutting. At a date after MH III Early but no later than LH II A Early, walls ep and ey were built at right angles to walls ej and fc, in order both to strengthen these walls and to demarcate another terrace to the se. We can be sure that earlier levels were destroyed when this latter terrace was created, because the LH IIA forge discussed below47 is cut into MH I destruction debris (see fig. 1.24 strata 14-15 and 19). This will also explain why MH III levels were found at a higher elevation in the NE Sector behind wall ex. As part of these works, walls ej and fc were each strengthened by the addition of an upper course that was bonded with the new walls ep and ey. The use of this building technique does not indicate that the lower courses of walls ej and fc were built during an earlier phase; on the contrary, it makes it likely that the entire construction was undertaken at the same time. In short, walls ej, ep, ey and fc were all built at the same time in order to double the size of the terrace formed by the previous terrace-wall em. However, it is not clear exactly when this was done; it was within the period MH III Late to LH I.] In the sw part of this Area, under the later triangle of stones called ev, several lines of slabs were uncovered (fig. 1.23). One skirted wall ed on its se flank and came up from the sw, while the other approached from the se. Another line of schist slabs, called wall eq, ran nw-se along the line of the se approach. Several slabs turned perpendicular gave the appearance initially of robbed burials, called Burials 3-4 of 1977. An animal's jawbone and the green hammer-stone or grinder 7273 lay on this surface. No human remains were found upon the removal of these slabs, which from the pottery date to LH IIIAi. Mention should be made of another line of slabs called wall eu parallel to the line of slabs eq and only 70 cm distant from it to the ne. Like the slabs eq, the line called eu consisted only 46 See §4 (iii) (c) below. 47 See §4 (iii) (c).</page><page sequence="77">THE BRONZE AGE ARCHITECTURE AND STRATIGRAPHY §4 51 of one course and was of one stone's breadth. After a length of i .7 m it turned due s, disappearing into the s baulk (plate 6 b). [Further slabs were found in the Central Sector. Yet more slabs, extending eq to the se, were discovered in the w end of Beta 3 in 1959. Their removal yielded LH I and LH IIIAi sherds. The various lines of slabs represent the remnants of paving that covered most of the courtyard.] Everywhere the slabs were embedded in hard mud-packed or stony surfaces overlaid with light- coloured earth or plaster. This floor appears as Floor 1 in plan in fig. 1.23 and in section in fig. 1.24 (stratum 12). When the sw terrace was abandoned five LH IIIAi pots lay on its surface: the two dippers 3305-3306, the kylix 3313, the goblet 3314 and the basin 3315. Pots 3305 and 3314 were discovered sw of Step I. It is difficult to explain their position there unless Floor 1 was finally abandoned in LH IIIAi. Other LH IIIAi objects were found both further sw and to the ne of the Step at roughly the same level. [The numerous finds from Step I and from this surface, including the bronze tweezers 7013, are listed in table 1.28; their approximate find-spots are shown on fig. 1.23. The se corner of the terrace yielded the steatite conulus 7232, unless this is LH IIIC Early in date, the possible saddle- quern 7277 and the circular stone polisher or pommel of white marble HS 316.48 [Floor 1 was at an elevation of c. -2.67 to -2.73 BM, i.e. at the same depth as the base of wall ed, and some slabs were bedded under that wall (fig. 1.27). This suggests that the slabs were laid at an advanced stage of LH II A or slightly later and continued in use until some point during LH IIIAi. The LH IIA fill immediately below Floor 1 at the level of the base of wall ed contained a number of finds: these included the LH I Vapheio cup 3240, the bone point 7004, the whorl 7042, which was discovered in the se corner of the sector, the female figurine head 7086, the lapis lacedaemonius cobble 7279 and the obsidian barbed and tanged projectile point 7333. These finds, included in table 1.29, must be from the earliest use of the courtyard.] From the pottery found within it, the SW Sector appears to have been continuously occupied from MH III onwards: see figs. 1.24, strata 16-17, fig. 1.26 at left and fig. 1.27. The occupation deposits, which regularly mixed MH III Late with LH IIA sherds, accumulated to a depth of over 50 cm. [The deposits below the elevation of the base of wall ed are best seen in fig. 1.27. Just below this elevation there was a floor of pink and white plaster at a depth of -2.84 BM (the base of stratum 16 in fig. 1.24); this floor extended c. 1.5 m e and 1.3 m n from the point where wall ed entered the w baulk; dated to LH IIA, it yielded several finds. These were the Minoan vessel 1468, the whorl 6016, the chert sickle element 6137 and the lapis lacedaemonius denticulate blade 6142. Its s edge was cut by an oblong pit (not shown) which measured 85 cm E-w x 46 cm n-s and 15 cm deep, and which lay partly under the LH IIIAi bench ew; its bottom was at -3.05 BM. This was called 'Cist 4', but it was not a grave. Found empty, it may have served for storage or perhaps for metallurgical purposes, though burning is not recorded; the MH I metallurgical pits in Area V at Nichoria are of similar size and shape.49 To the N (fig. 1.27), this plaster floor stopped exactly above the N face of a possible slab wall at a lower elevation; was the latter a step? Below the plaster floor, at a depth of -3.01 BM, a hard-packed stony floor extended throughout the sector (fig. 1.24, base of stratum 17, = fig. 1.26, stratum 10); there was a hearth with white ash, stones and mudbrick in the sw corner of the Area. The stony floor may have belonged to LH I (sherds 3235, 3237). [Below the stony floor there was another floor, this time made of yellow clay in the sw corner (see fig. 1.26, base of stratum 13), but of white plaster to the N. Here it sloped up to what appears from the section to have been a stepped threshold or perhaps a wall made of slabs, which were subsequently incorporated into the stony floor (fig. 1.27). These slabs are reported to have continued into the trench, but no plan of them was made. If they did form a wall, the use of slabs is similar to the construction of the contemporary walls ht and le in Area Lambda/Beta 12.50 The finds from these levels are listed in table 1.29.] Within the Central Sector the range of pottery was MH III Early to LH IIB. [The finds from the Mycenaean levels in this sector, also listed in table 1.29, included the LH I Vapheio cup 3239 and LH IIB rounded alabastron 3292, which was associated with other LH I-IIB sherds. Five pierced shells (9265-9267, 9272, 9278) represent the remains of a necklace. The corner formed by this sector was then simply an extension of the courtyard that lay to the sw. The absence of LH IIIAi finds, which were so plentiful elsewhere in this terrace, suggests that this corner went out of use in LH IIB rather than in LH IIIAi like the rest of the courtyard. Perhaps this corner of it had become overgrown with dense vegetation such as a fig tree.] 48 Taylour 1072, 260 with pl. 42f.i. 49 Cooke and Nielsen 1978, 211. 50 See §5 (v) below.</page><page sequence="78">52 W. D. TAYLOURt AND R. JANKO Several infant burials were found to the s and sw of the slabs eq; there were also burials to the n of them. The Central Sector contained three burials without grave goods, those of two infants, viz. Beta burials 31 and 34, and of a child aged about seven years, burial 27. They are unlikely to be any earlier than LH IIA or LH IIIAi. [The courtyard was obviously a convenient locale for infant burials.51 A fourth interment, Beta burial 28, a cist built into the top of the MH III Early wall em, confirms that the latter wall had long since gone out of use. This tomb contained three vessels, LH IIB or possibly LH IIIAi in date, published as 3289-3291 below.] (b) THE NE SECTOR The NE Sector (see fig. 1.31 and plate 6 d), to the ne of walls ej and fc, was bounded to the se by wall ex. Walls fc and ej were probably MH III Late to LH I. There were no other features in the entire sector, which may have been left empty. The fill was mostly LH I- II, and in most of the sector excavation ceased at this level. From this period comes the LH IIA cup 3259; the only other find was a bone point 7003. This sector contained three cist graves: a large one for an adult, Beta burial 25, a smaller one for an infant, Beta burial 23, and a third for a small child against the ne flank of wall ex, Beta burial 29. They are unlikely to be any earlier than LH IIA-IIIA1.52 (c) THE SE SECTOR The SE Sector was defined by the parallel walls ep/ey to the nw, by wall ex to the ne, and by the e and s baulks (fig. 1.28). This sector constituted a large room or terrace, 'Room B', the se and sw walls of which, if they existed, lay outside the excavated area. This terrace had minimum interior dimensions of 3.5 x 3.3 m and an area of at least 1 1 .9 m2. [This terrace was cut into earlier levels when that to the sw was remodelled in LH IIA. The date of wall ex, which was not removed, presents great difficulties and will be discussed shortly. As we saw above,53 wall ey is datable between MH III Late and LH I; for details see table 1.27.] By LH IIB wall ey would not have been visible, as it was hidden by a plaster floor at the base of the se face of wall ep (see fig. 1.24, stratum 13); this floor, which was c. 10 cm thick, passed directly over wall ey and occupied the entire sector. Associated with the floor were the monochrome goblet 3268 and the unpainted goblet with high-swung handle 3281. The date of these vessels is LH IIA, but the deposit was in fact LH IIB: for parts of the two LH IIB monochrome ring-handled cups 3295-3296, of which the complete profiles are preserved, also came from this ambience. [Since the vases were recovered in pieces their exact find-spots are undetermined. The floor also yielded the MH I Dark Burnished flask 1327, which is a cast-up from the destruction level below. Since this floor was at an elevation just above the base of wall ex, the wall itself would appear to have been in use during LH IIB: see fig. 1.25. However, other arguments suggest that wall ex was Medieval, and that, as elsewhere in this sector, Medieval walls were cut into Bronze Age levels without any detectable foundation trench.] After the removal of the LH IIB floor in this sector, at a depth some 25 cm further down and within LH IIA levels, a layer consisting of large quantities of pure ash was encountered c. 5-10 cm thick; this was most copious in the area marked 'hearth' on the plan, fig. 1.28, with plate 7 b. The ash is also shown below stratum 14 in fig. 1.24 and stratum 10 in fig. 1.25; it is also marked on figs. 1.29-1.30. In the ash was found part of the clay crucible 6063, with a few pieces of arsenical tin bronze still adhering to it. Its exact find-spot is not known. This important discovery establishes that bronze-working was carried out in this sector. [It follows that at this time the terrace was open to both the sky and the sea, which supplied the on-shore breezes ideal for metallurgy. The layer of ash yielded the biconical terracotta button HS 303.54 [The fact that the LH IIB plaster floor ran over the top of wall ey shows that during LH IIA ey functioned as a bench some 40 cm above the contemporary floor right along the nw side of the terrace. This was confirmed by P. Wright's observation that the space between the top of wall ey and the se face of wall ep had been filled in with small stones. The removal of the layer of ash, which was over hard brown earth, showed that the terrace had a several extraordinary features (see the plan, fig. 1.28). First, the stump of the MH III Early terrace wall em projected between 5 and 15 cm above the contemporary ground surface at right angles to bench ey, forming part of the floor; its top was at an 51 See Chapter 2 §4 below with fig. 2.4. 52 See Chapter 2 §4. 53 See §4 (iii) (a). 54 Taylour 1972, 260 with pls. 42c!, 42e top.</page><page sequence="79">THE BRONZE AGE ARCHITECTURE AND STRATIGRAPHY §4 53 Fig. 1.28. Area Beta 3/8/9/10, SE sector. Plan of LH IIA forge. elevation of -2.96. At the base of the ash near the nw corner was a platform of mudbrick with its upper surface at an elevation of -3.01 BM. Starting from near this platform, a vertical line of burned mudbrick or mud-plaster c. 7 cm in thickness traversed the whole N part of the terrace, following an irregular curved line: this is shown on fig. 1.28. If we can assume that the terrace was bounded by wall ex or a predecessor of that wall on the same axis, perhaps built of mudbrick (which would be why no wall is visible in the section, fig. 1.30), this feature enclosed an area approximately 1.6 m long by 70 cm wide. Before its existence was recognized it was removed down to its base, which lay directly upon the mudbrick of the underlying MH I destruction layer. Its height of c. 15 cm was determined because it was visible in section where it entered the E baulk: see fig. 1.26. Its top was at about -2.97 to -3.01 and its bottom at -3.12 BM or below. Hence its volume was c. 0.17 m3. It was burned orange on its inner edge, i.e. towards the ne, black in the middle and dark red on its outer edge. This installation is best interpreted as the front edge of a large but shallow basin or pool. It was not a grate for the fires that resulted in the layer of ash, since its lip would have restricted the supply of air for combustion and in any case the ash was concentrated outside it to the s. Instead, it must have been used to contain liquid, presumably water for cooling and quenching. [A stone structure was apparently connected with this basin. The top of this structure was at an elevation of -2.91 BM and its base at -3.16. Visible in elevation in the baulk left under wall ex (see fig. 1.30 and plate 8 ¿z), it consisted of three courses of stones down and three stones across with a gap</page><page sequence="80">54 W. D.

The stones of its base projected into the terrace. Unfortunately this structure was not investigated further. The simplest interpretation is that it was a built drain, with the base of the channel through which the liquid flowed located at an elevation of -3.00. This elevation corresponds almost exactly to that of the lip of the basin described above, which was at -2.97 to -3.01. Hence the drain was not employed to empty the basin, but either to serve as an overflow pipe or to fill it with rainwater, or perhaps for both purposes. We saw above that the LH IIB floor mentioned above appears to have run up to the face of wall ex. The fact that the face of this drain is exactly aligned with that of wall ex above it would seem to suggest that wall ex was itself part of this installation. However, the base of the wall is above the level of the top of the basin, and to the w of the drain it rested on earth (the situation to the E of the drain is unclear). Hence the drain seems to have been buried in earth rather than built under a wall. Such a drain is paralleled at Nichoria.55 If this argument is correct, wall ex was built in the Medieval period. It is said to have bonded with wall ef, which is also assigned to the latter period. [In addition to the pool and the drain, a stone hearth was located to the sw of the basin (fig. 1.28). This was built at an elevation of -3.1 1 BM against the stump of wall em. Its N side was delimited by a flat stone at -3.01 BM, at approximately the level of the lip of the basin; like the stump of wall em 55 McDonald, Dickinson and Howell 1992, 765.</page><page sequence="82">56 W. D. TAYLOURt AND R. JANKO itself, this would have functioned as a working surface for the activities carried on at the hearth. The discovery of the crucible 6063 in the layer of ash above shows that this elaborate installation was a forge where arsenical tin bronze was melted and worked. The hearth was used for melting the metal, using crucibles and charcoal that was fanned by the on-shore breezes and by blowpipes of canna reed or bellows of leather and wood. Terracotta nozzles from these, i.e. tuyères, of the same date were found elsewhere on the site (7052a and HS 311). The basin offered a convenient supply of water for anealing the metal and perhaps for cooling the tips of blowpipes made of the canna reed Arundo donax, which could also have been used in order to achieve the i3oo°C necessary for melting copper.56 The stone benches and surfaces were used for work of various kinds. Until the fire which left the ash, the workshop was kept tidy, and almost none of the valuable metal was left behind. Table 1.30 lists the whole pots and other finds from this sector. The MH I destruction levels, which are discussed below,57 lay immediately under the remains of the smithy.] (d) THE NW SECTOR [A house involving wall en and an associated floor, with a road to the s of it bounded by wall et, had existed in the nw corner of the Area from MH II onwards. The house had two successive floor levels during MH III Late to LH I (fig. 1.26 strata 1 1-12). Both the road and the house were covered with fill that contained LH ILA sherds (fig. 1.26 strata 7a-b, 8), at which time they were obviously derelict. The contemporary wall et, which formed the s side of the road, went out of use at the same time. This abandonment was connected with the building of the alley, Street Beta IV, just to the e. The house was subsequently covered with LH IIB fill (fig. 1.26 stratum 6).] (iv) Middle Helladic II to Middle Helladic III Early Important architectural features in Area Beta can be attributed to MH II and MH III Early. For the plan of these phases see fig. 1.32. (a) THE SW AND CENTRAL SECTORS In the SW Sector there was found the ne corner of a building, Structure Beta III, which appears to have been founded by MH III Early at the latest and went out of use during that period. It consisted of wall fd, which had a nne to ssw axis and made a right angle at its nne end with wall fb; the latter wall proceeded in an ese direction and disappeared under wall ep (see table 1.31 and plates 7 ¿and 8 a). Mention is made by the excavator of a possible bench against the interior of fb and a 'smoothed floor surface' at -2.96 BM inside the house, i.e. to the sw of wall fb. These features were in the bonded corner made by walls fd and fb. [Almost immediately below the LH I clay floor in the SW Sector there was another slab floor at an elevation of c. -3.20 BM, again with a hearth by the w baulk: see figs. 1.24 (base of stratum 18), 1.26 (stratum 14) and 1.27. Although the slabs of this floor contained MH II sherds, it appears to have been used from MH III Early, although the fill above it also contained some LH I material. E of the hearth were found the whorl 6034, the base of a pithos and two stone grinders (these were not kept). A further grinder lay to the N. As this paving was separated from the MH III Early wall fd by the later cist of burial 32, its relation to that wall remains obscure. The terracotta pottery-anvil 6077 was found under the slabs. Excavation ceased at this depth.] A well-constructed wall, em, three courses high and with a nw-se axis, formed the boundary between the SW and Central Sectors. Its presumed nw continuation under the surface of the LH I courtyard was not cleared. Wall em was found to continue into the SE Sector, where it was called wall ez; this same wall was called gq when first excavated in Beta 3, 1959. The top of wall em lay next to the LH IIA hearth associated with the bronze-working industry (see fig. 1.28), but the wall did not extend southeastwards for the full length of the area. [The se end of wall em was probably robbed out during the construction of the LH IIA forge. The wall was built in MH III Early, because it was associated with a thin black layer of this date at c. -3. 1 2 BM. This stratum started just above the base of wall em and sloped down slightly until it reached the nw face of wall fb. This represents the contemporary surface; it yielded the chert denticulate blade 6141. In addition, the foundations of wall em lay above the level of another MH III Early stratum, where the terracotta whorl 6035 was found. A MH II stratum, with an elevation of -3.08 BM, lay to 56 Cooke and Nielsen 1978, 210-11. 57 See §4 (iv) (d).</page><page sequence="83">THE BRONZE AGE ARCHITECTURE AND STRATIGRAPHY §4 57 Fig. 1.32. Area Beta 3/8/9/10. Plan of MH II and MH III Early phases, showing location of sections (figs. 1.24-1.26) and elevations (figs. 1.27, 1.29 and 1.30). the N of the wall and above the level of its base. This suggests that wall em was a terrace wall. Since walls em and fb were parallel and they both ran under the probably LH IIA wall ep, they were probably built and disused at the same time. The base of wall em was at a higher level than that of wall fb, but this can be explained by the slope of the hill. Together, these walls may well have formed the ne and sw sides of an alley running nw-se into the s baulk, called Street Beta III. This alley, 1.25m wide, would have been contemporary with the road in the NW Sector named Street Beta II, which was of similar width.58 After Street Beta III and the buildings adjacent to it went out of use in MH III Early, the entire Area was profoundly reshaped by the laying out of the courtyard that was to endure until LH IIIAi. Below the black layer was a surface of small packed stones at -3.24 BM, still with MH III Early sherds. Excavation ceased at this level to the s of wall em, and at -3.08 BM to its n.] In the SW Sector there was a larger concentration of burials than elsewhere in the Area, viz. burials 30, 32 and 34. [A cist built against wall fd produced a LH I-IIA bichrome Matt Painted sherd, which was probably associated with burial 32, and the MH I Late egg cup 1334, which was presumably a cast-up. All three interments postdate this phase.] 58 See §4 (iv) (c) below.</page><page sequence="84">58 W. D. TAYLOURt AND R. JANKO (b) THE NE SECTOR In the NE Sector (see fig. 1.32 and plate 6 ¿), MH III sherds were found to the n of the later wall ex. No MH walls were uncovered in this sector. During excavation, traces of ash deposits that appear to be MH III Early were encountered in the NE Sector e of the LH IIA wall eo. [This layer of ash was dug with basket 131. It yielded the complete Lustrous Decorated jug 1379. However, hardly any of the pottery could be dated, and digging ceased at or slightly above this depth throughout the sector.] (c) THE NW SECTOR In the NW Sector, at an oblique angle to, and on the nw side of, the walls ed and es that flanked the LH IIA-IIIAi roadway (Street Beta IV), there was a road, Street Beta II, leading to higher ground in the ene (see the plans, figs. 1.31-1.32, and the section, fig. 1.26). It was bounded by two walls, wall en on the nw and wall et on the se. It was, in fact, a continuation of a road uncovered in the earlier excavations and referred to as a cobbled area.59 Street Beta II was first recognised in the N end of Beta 12 A, whence it may have linked up at right angles with the 'Pebbled Road', Street Nu I, that ran N-s in Area Nu. Street Beta II continued eastward through the n ends of Beta 1 1 and Beta 7/2/5, excavated in 1959-63. It is fairly certain that walls gg and hg in the last-mentioned area were the continuation of wall et. Wall et to the s, according to the pottery found with it, was MH II, and the road may conceivably have been used at the same date. As it proceeded up the incline, the road may have turned and changed its direction north-eastwards. On its se flank it was cut by wall es, which is therefore later, and this agrees with the date of LH IIA that was attributed to es as the nw wall of the stepped roadway. [The pottery found in Street Beta II is, as one might expect, mixed, including LH I-IIA (see fig. 1.26, strata 7a~7b and 15). The fragmentary LH IIA goblet 3284 was found in its fill of gravel and stones, and the fine Yellow Minyan strainer 1427, dated to LH I- II, probably came from the same context. The road and both the walls that delimited it went out of use in LH IIA when the stepped alley was built.] Wall en, with a wsw to ene axis, was part of a MH building, Structure Beta II, of which no other walls were found. If these still exist, they lie in the baulks. There was a threshold built against the s side of wall en, indicating the entrance from the roadway at that point (see fig. 1.32 and table 1.32). A quantity of animal bones was found on the part of the road flanking the wall. Just E of the threshold, traces of mudbrick were noticed on the interior (n) side of wall en. Beyond this, against the wall, on a floor of hard brown earth, lay a deposit of three pots, viz. the two bowls 1343 and 1346 and the cup 1344. Table 1.33 lists the finds from this sector. [The three vessels are dated to MH II; the MH III sherd 1345 is from the same context. This confirms that walls en and et were built in MH II; they continued in use, with the street between them, until LH I or LH IIA Early. Excavation ceased at these levels.] (v) Early Helladic II to Middle Helladic I [The periods before MH II are represented only in SE Sector: see the plan, fig. 1.33, the sections, figs. 1.24-1.25 and 1.29-1.30, and plate 8 a-c. The earliest levels here proved hard to comprehend. However, the stratigraphy has been clarified by combining information recovered in a rapid excavation of 1977 with that derived from a deeper sounding in the South-Central Sector of Beta 3, which was ably excavated and recorded by R. Hope Simpson in 1959 (see the sections, figs. 1.24-1.25, with plate 8 c). This sounding, an area restricted by later walls and only c. 0.7 x 1.5 m in extent, was dug s of the later wall em and e of the later walls ep/ey.] Below the LH IIA levels of pure ash and burned mud that indicated bronze-working,60 mudbrick overlying the the top of a wall, called wall fa, was encountered; the mudbrick was widely associated with burning. Wall fa, of rather crude construction, lay in the se corner of the Area (fig. 1.33). It was on a slightly different axis from that of the MH III Early wall em. At its w end this wall had large stone facings and a rubble core. [This style of constuction resembles that of wall dj in Area Eta, which was built in MH I Early. Wall fa had a nw-se axis. At first only a piece of it 1.3 m long was exposed near the E baulk; its w continuation seemed to have been robbed out for a depth of at least 40 cm, 59 Taylour 1972, 256 with 231 fig. 15. 60 See §4 (iii) (c) above.</page><page sequence="85">THE BRONZE AGE ARCHITECTURE AND STRATIGRAPHY §4 59 Fig. 1.33.

But in fact another segment, i .4 m in length, still existed by the w edge of the sector under the later wall ey. Hence the wall ran for a total distance of 2.7 m. At its nw end its base had not been reached when, at an elevation of -3.49 BM, the excavation ceased; for this reason only some tumble overlying its w end could be drawn. When its se portion was first discovered in trench Beta 3 of 1959 it was called wall gp, and when its w end was found this was named wall fg. For the specifications of this and the other MH I walls see table 1.34. [Wall fa was buried under a destruction level with carbonised timbers, tumble and mudbrick. This is shown as stratum 12 in fig. 1.25, and also appears in figs. 1.29-1.30 and in plate 8 a. This level consisted of 10-20 cm of decomposed mudbrick over a thin burnt layer with traces of white ash on its surface. The burnt layer was mostly c. 2 cm in depth but was as deep as 8 cm in the nw corner of the sector. At the nw end of wall fa the thin burnt layer came to a halt 3 cm above its ne face (see fig. 1.29). From this point the thin burnt layer sloped down to the N, which confirms that it derived from the destruction of the building to which wall fa belonged, Structure Beta I. Two carbonised posts or beams, marked A and B on fig. 1.33, were found. The charcoal from post A, sample P-2961, yielded</page><page sequence="86">6o W. D. TAYLOURt AND R.

Outside the wall to the s there was a layer of brown pebbly earth, interpreted as a road, Street Beta I: this layer appears in fig. 1.24 as stratum 19.] From the burnt stratum N of wall fa came the small handmade pot 1337, and from lower down in the same stratum the small 'thimble' pot 1342. [The pottery from this destruction, dated to MH I Late, is published as 1325-1342 below. The Dark Burnished flask 1327, found in this sector in a later context, must be a cast-up from these levels. The obsidian blade 6130 also came from this layer. The greenstone polisher 6114 was found s of wall fa. For details see table 1.35.] [The deepest levels in this Area were attained in the sounding of 1959 s of the later wall em. The top of another wall, wall gr, appeared at an elevation a 60 cm below that of the top of wall fa (fig. 1.33). Wall gr ran slightly off-axis under the s flank of wall em. Like wall fa, wall gr had a roughly NW-SE axis. However, it was made of small stones and was of rougher construction than the other walls (see plate 8 c). The sherds adjacent to it, in a layer of very hard reddish earth about 25 cm deep, were regarded by the excavator as early MH. Given that the layer above was MH I Late, this pottery was surely MH I Early. Such may have been the date of wall gr, but it is also possible that it was EH II. The presence in the same stratum of small quantities of EH II pottery proves that there was occupation in or near this sector. From the lowest 25 cm of very hard brown earth no sherds at all were recovered.

AREA LAMBDA 1 / BETA 12, 1973-74, WITH BETA 1, 1959, AND BETA 12, 1963: MIDDLE TO LATE HELLADIC (figs. 1.35-1.45) (i) Introduction This Area was chosen in 1973 in order to explore the territory immediately to the w of the Beta trenches dug in the earlier excavations.62 A modern terrace wall lay across the middle of trench Lambda 1 and the N part of the adjacent Beta trenches 1 2 and 1 1 . Very little Medieval pottery was found in the surface levels, no doubt because it had been washed lower down the slope, which was tilted steeply downwards from n to s. Another modern terrace wall lay across the N part of Area Lambda 2. For a schematic plan of the relationships between these trenches see figs, iv and 1.34. The first trench opened was trench Lambda 1 of 1973. This was a trench with N-s axis 6 x 3 m in extent to the w of trenches Beta 1 and Beta 12 A, which were excavated in 1959 and 1963, when the baulk between them was also removed (see the plan, fig. 1.35, and for sections see figs. 1.38-1.39 and 1.44-1.45). In 1974 the 1.5 m wide baulk dividing trench Lambda 1 from the old trenches Beta 12A (n) of 1963 and Beta 1 of 1959-63 was taken down. For the plan see fig. 1.35, and for sections see figs. 1.39 and 1.4 1.63 This was called the Lambda 1 / Beta 12 baulk; together, Lambda 1 and Lambda 1 / Beta 12 baulk were 27.45 m2 in area- Removal of the topsoil and the earth beneath it revealed a confusing number of walls, the outline of which was at first difficult to trace because stones from their collapse covered or surrounded them. The n part of the baulk between the 1963 trenches Beta 12A and Beta 12B, with the Beta 1/12 baulk lying directly to the n of it on both sides, was also dug; for the plan see fig. 1.35 and for the section fig. 1.40. Finally, the top of the baulk between trenches Beta 12B and Beta 1 1 to the E of it was partly cleared (see fig. 1.35; for the section see fig. 1.42). [The steep slope from ne to sw, evident both now and in antiquity, rendered the stratigraphy and architecture extremely hard to interpret. Walls had been eroded away completely, with sloping layers of wash visible in all the N-s sections, making it difficult to use the relative elevations of the surviving wall bases as a criterion for dating them. No cuttings were ever detected, yet several must have existed. It turned out that the n-s baulks had been located exactly above the most important N-s walls, walls hm, Im, lq and lr; this accident of excavation had rendered the plan incomprehensible until the baulks were dug in 1974. Their removal, though limited in extent, greatly clarified the architectural phases in the upper levels over a wider area, transforming our understanding even of relatively distant parts of trenches Beta 1 and Beta 11.] At this stage in the excavation it was possible to distinguish the plan of what appeared to be two successive complexes of rooms. These were given numbers: Rooms 1-4 for the later set and Rooms 5-12 for the earlier (see figs. 1.36 and 1.43 respectively). However, it was also clear from the context of the pottery found in excavating the walls that not two but several LH phases were represented. [The earlier walls, which formed Rooms 5-12, belonged to MH III Late and went out of use in LH ILA Early. However, some of the later walls, which formed Rooms 1, 2 and 4, were datable to LH IIIC Early, whereas walls mj, la, lp and gc that defined Room 3 belonged to LH IIA and continued in use until LH IIIAi. During LH IIIAi they were replaced by walls lb and lo and then by the set of walls were in use in LH IIIC Early. Room 3 was reused in this final phase. [Because of the international crisis of 1974, the excavation of this Area was abruptly concluded when the uppermost MH layers had only just been reached; no early MH layers were attained, let alone the bedrock. Several walls were not properly drawn, some sections have had to be reconstructed from sketches, and digging ceased at arbitrary levels. However, the excavations of 1963 had shown that there is a great depth of stratigraphy in this Area, almost 2.5 m from the modern surface; some reinterpretation of these deeper levels is attempted below,64 but the results are far from certain. It is not clear why their excavation was not resumed in 1977. A further trench, Area Lambda 2, was opened in 1974 to the N of trench Lambda 1. Since its architecture and stratigraphy have few links with those of this Area, this trench is described separately.65] For an account of the burials from this Area see below.66 In trench Lambda 1, three burials were uncovered within Room 10: Lambda burials 2 and 3 were MH III, and burial 1 was LH IIIA2. In 1974, 10 further burials were uncovered, or 1 1 if we count the infant remains that were left in situ at the N end of wall gc at the end of 1963 season, i.e. burial Beta 21.67 The latter excepted, nearly all 62 Taylour 1972, 253-61. 63 The latter adapts Taylour 1072, 2^ a fie. 27. 64 See §5 (vi). 65 See §6 below. 66 Chapter 2 §5. 67 This is included in Chapter 2 §5 (i).</page><page sequence="88">62 W.

From the surrounding sherds they are almost all datable to LH IIIAi; the earlier ones are burial Beta 21 and burial Lambda 4. None had any grave goods. [Burial Beta 20 is now dated to LH IIIC Early.] (ii) Late Helladic IIIC Early The latest building phase in this Area is dated to LH IIIC Early. For details of the walls of this phase, which form Structure Lambda VI, see table 1.36. The rooms assigned to this period are numbered 1, 2, 3 and 4, but only in the case of Room 4 did all four walls survive (see fig. 1.36). In the Lambda 1 / Beta 1 2 baulk, between the earlier walls lo in the centre and Id in the s of the Area, a wall with N-s axis, wall lm, was revealed. This formed the boundary between Room 1 , in trench Lambda 1 , and Room 2 to the E. Wall lm was approximately on the alignment of wall lo but did not touch it. On the N flank of wall lm lay wall hu, with E-w axis. The e end of wall hu, found in 1963, can be seen in figs. 1.35-1.36 and plate 8 d. Its middle section was taken down in 1963 and its w continuation now came to light in the baulk. [Wall hu, which was abutted by wall lm, once formed the n wall of Room 1 to the w of wall lm; its w end has disappeared together with the remainder of Room 1, presumably through erosion (see fig. 1.36 and plate 9 a). Since LH IIIAi sherds were found among its stones when wall hu was removed, Rooms 1 and 2 must be LH IIIAi or later. Floor 18 of 1963, associated with wall gc and containing LH II-IIIAi pottery, ran under wall hu.] Another new wall running from nnw to sse, wall lq, was uncovered in the Beta 12A / Beta 12B baulk. This wall was somewhat off-axis in relation to wall lm. These two walls were connected by wall hu (plate 9 a). The n end of wall lq was not continuous with the rest, but abutted it and ran for a short distance until it made a bonded corner with wall ga. Here it was preserved to a height of six courses. Wall lq formed the E wall of Room 2 and the w wall of Room 4 to the E of it. [When wall lq was taken down it turned out to contain sherds of the LH IIIC Early amphoriskos 3593, the rest of which was found in pieces in the make-up of Floor 5 of Room 4. It follows that it was built in LH IIIC Early and not before - not even in the Transitional phase that preceded. Since wall lq bonded with wall hu and the latter is abutted by wall lm, it follows that all three were constructed during LH IIIC Early.] Wall ga, uncovered in 1959 and 1963, is the n wall of Room 4 (fig. 1.36). Wall hq abutted wall lq near the s end of the latter wall, on its E flank. Wall hq formed the s wall of Room 4; it was uncovered but not completely drawn. Finally, the n-s wall hm closed Room 4 to the e. The Beta 1 1/12B baulk was partly cleared to reveal the full extent of wall hm (plate 9 b). The w face of wall hm had been uncovered in 1963: its elevation appears in fig. 1.42.68 There was an obvious doorway in its se corner, where wall hm came to a stop before it reached wall hq. The position of the entrances to the other rooms was not clear. Details of the architecture indicate that there were at least two stages of construction. The abutment within the N end of wall lq referred to above shows that the latter and wall ga formed a later addition; the join takes place just N of the point where wall hu makes a right angle with wall lq. This implies that Room 2 was built before Room 4 and that walls ga and hm were added later. [Since wall ga overlay the 1963 basket 135, which is stated to have contained 'LH IIIB' sherds, a description that is likely to mean 'LH IIIC Early', it is probable that walls ga and hm were also constructed within LH IIIC Early. Hence it follows that this entire complex was built at that time; the lack of LH IIIA2 and LH IIIB occupation layers confirms that this was indeed the case. No construction dating from LH IIIA2 or LH IIIB can be distinguished. [The s wall of Room 2 constitutes a problem. The excavator of 1974, A. F. Harding, held that the s wall of both Room 1 and Room 2 was formed by a reuse of the earlier wall Id and its continuation wall ht, found just below the surface at the s end of the Area. However, wall lm stopped short of wall Id, as appears in fig. 1.35 and plate 9 a. Moreover, the LH IIIC Early slabbed Floor 10 of 1963, which was identical with Floor 4 of 1974, as will be shown below, ran over the top of wall ht, the slabbed surface of which was incorporated into the LH IIIC Early floor (see fig. 1.41). As is seen in fig. 1.37, pieces of pithos and other finds lying on that floor were found over wall ht just under the modern surface both in 1963 and in 1974. Moreover, wall lq appeared to run over wall ht and lay above wall lr (see plate 9 b). It follows that the s part of Floor 4 and the s wall of Room 2 have both been eroded away completely, exposing the LH I-IIA levels beneath.] Both Room 2 and Room 4 had extensive floors of beaten earth made up with stone slabs. These are Floor 4 of 1974 in Room 2 to the w (plates 8 d, 9 0, 9 ¿/and 10 a), and Floor 5 of 1974 in Room 4 to 68 This adapts Taylour 1972, 256 fig. 29.</page><page sequence="92">66 W. D.

The latter was at a higher level than the former, as it began higher up the slope. [Both floors represent the occupation of Rooms 2 and 4. They evidently followed the downward gradient of the hill from ne to sw. However, they were both extremely disordered, with many of their slabs at crazy angles. This explains why neither was recognised as such in 1963, when the N and s parts of the sloping Floor 4 of 1974 were termed Floors 9 and 10 respectively and were interpreted as two separate floors running horizontally one above the other.69 Enough LH IIIC Early pottery was found to date both floors to that period. They were abandoned at the same time, within LH IIIC Early, as P. A. Mountjoy's study of the pottery has revealed.70 Both floors were rich in finds. The finds from Room 2 to the w are listed in table 1.37, and those from Room 4 to the e are listed in table 1.38. The floors and the finds from them are planned together in fig. 1.37.] Although pottery in the form of sherds was plentiful, only a few complete vases could be registered. Among the finds from Room 2 to the w, the undecorated cup 3596 is LH IIIC Early, but the ladle 3562 is datable to LH IIIA2. [Other LH IIIC Early vessels found in 1963 derive from the centre of Floor 4 in Room 2 to the w. These are the amphoriskos 3701 and the straight-sided alabastron 3704; the latter was found where this floor ran over the earlier wall ht. From the same floor came the unpainted shallow bowl HS 106, which was tentatively dated to LH I- II.71 But since its shape is 69 Taylour 1972, 254-5 witn %• 27- Because of the slabs, parts of this floor were also dug in 1963 as 'walls' hs, q and u; thus 1963 baskets 84, 87, 88, 109, 1 14, 127 and 137 also pertain to this floor. 70 See Chapter 6 §5 (ii) (h) below. 71 Taylour 1972, 258 with fig. 33.</page><page sequence="93">THE BRONZE AGE ARCHITECTURE AND STRATIGRAPHY §5 67 FS 295, this vase too must be LH IIIC Early.72 The mug HS in is LH IIIA-IIIC Early.73 However, a micaceous jar that is definitely LH I-IIA in date, 1774 with light-on-dark decoration, was also found in Room 2. The presence of this earlier vessel over Floor 4 must be attributed to abundant LH I- II wash that came down onto the ruins, covering both Floor 4 and Floor 5 after Rooms 2 and 4 had been abandoned and their N and E walls had collapsed. This wash was not distinguished during the excavations, but there can be no doubt as to its presence.] From Room 4 came two vessels dated to LH IIIC Early, the plain deep bowl 3597, which was half- preserved, and the amphoriskos 3593. [Other pots from this room were found during the earlier excavations, dug using 1959 basket 3 and 1963 baskets 110, 115-117, 119, 140, 142 and 145. These came from the centre and ne corner of Floor 5, in the angle formed by walls ga and hm, the stumps of which had no doubt protected it from erosion. They were the amphoriskos 3700, the globular stirrup jar 3707, the deep bowl 3738 and the lid HS 122,74 all datable to LH IIIC Early, and the LH IIIB amphora 3694. Two other vessels from Room 4, the LH IIA monochrome goblets 3667 and 3670, must be attributed to the LH I- II wash which came down over both Room 2 and Room 4 after their abandonment; compare the LH I micaceous jar 1774 in Room 2 mentioned above. To the N of Room 4, in the Beta 6/1 baulk, was found the LH IIIC Early collar-necked jar 3703.] These rooms appear to have been workshops. In Room 2, a grain of wheat (9286) survived, together with various spinning and weaving implements and stone tools, as listed in table 1.37. The saddle- quern 7276 was found next to the skeleton of a dog, as is shown in fig. 1.37 and plate ioû, and there were a number of other stones ready to be fashioned into tools, which were not kept. In Room 4 to the E there were also a variety of stone tools (see table 1.38). Two pounders and a polisher (7250-7252) were found on or over the slabs of Floor 5. Fragments of sheet bronze (7016- 7017), metallurgical residue (7053a) and charcoal suggest that metal-working took place near wall lq. [The presence of crucible 7053 confirms this hypothesis. The terracotta nozzle HS 311, probably a tuyère once attached to a reed-cane blowpipe for metal-working, came from the eroded s part of Floor 5*,75 this resembles the possibly LH I item 7052a from Area Lambda 3, and could have come from a level ofthat date. The stone tools, including the pestle HS 315 and perhaps the 'incised' stone HS 326,76 may also have been used for this purpose.] In Room 1 in trench Lambda 1 , to the w of Rooms 2 and 4, the upper levels produced a quantity of sherds of LH I- II and LH IIIA but also some LH IIIC Early. This pattern seemed to conform to what had been found in 1963 in Area Beta 12A to the E. [Nothing survived of the LH IIIC Early floor levels that one might have expected to find in this sector. In fact, there is no solid evidence that Room 1 was occupied during this phase, except for the fact that the stump of wall hu creates a presumption that the area to its s and to the w of wall lm was enclosed by walls. The most substantial stratum over the Early Mycenaean walls consisted of a fill, containing worn LH I-IIA material with some fresh LH IIIA2-IIIB sherds, which was also seen to the N in Area Lambda 2 (see fig. 1.47). The LH IIIC Early layers must have been eroded away, since both trenches are at the extreme sw edge of the hilltop. The Early Mycenaean walls in the s part of trench Lambda 1 lay almost immediately under the surface, which shows that erosion was still taking place when excavations commenced. [Two LH IIIC Early floors in trench Beta 1, Floors 13 and 14 of 1963, ran over the top of the LH II-IIIAi wall gc within Room 3 (see fig. 1.40 strata 4 and 6). Both floors ran up to the base of the LH IIIC Early wall hu and were contemporary with its use (see fig. 1.41 strata 4 and 5). The LH IIA Floor 3 of 1974, which lay at an elevation 30 cm above that of Floor 13 of 1963 in the w half of Room 3, must have been partly cut away by later terracing. Although the easternmost stone of wall lp projected from the w baulk of the trench Beta 1, the wall stopped abruptly at that point, which accords with this hypothesis. In the strata of LH IIIC Early material mixed with LH I- II wash that lay above Floor 13 of 1963 (fig. 1.40 strata 2 and 4) were found the LH IIIA-B phi-type figurine 7071, twelve pounders including the lapis lacedaemonius pounder HS 31377 and the greenstone example 7253, an obsidian blade and some animal bones.

In this N sector a series of walls emerged, in some cases perhaps associated with stamped floors. These walls could not in 1973 be integrated with those in trench Beta 12A of 1963. Two walls appeared just below the surface at right angles to one another. In the ne part of trench Lambda 1 , wall lb with E-w axis appeared to cut an earlier wall la at its s end and ran roughly parallel to the later wall hu further s. Wall lb continued a short distance into the Lambda 1 / Beta 1 2 baulk before making a short return to the s; the return is called wall lo (see fig. 1.36). [Wall lb contained a sherd from a LH IIIAi kylix, 3557; this seems to date its construction. This LH IIIAi phase is represented only by walls lb and lo, called Structure Lambda V. These walls are described in table 1.40. Terracing or severe erosion, or even both, was prevalent here. Thus the other two sides of Structure Lambda V to the w and s totally disappeared, and its nw corner too. J. Rempel suggested that the LH II-IIIAi Floor 1 of 1973 may have been associated with it. To the s of wall lb, among tumbled stones which lay over Floor 1 and were with 1973 basket 14 (fig. 1.45), was the stone socket 7277a containing remnants of a doorpost which had been destroyed by fire; this was not in situ, since it was found upside down. The monochrome bowl 3569 was found in Room 1, w of the later wall lm; this is dated to LH IIIA2 Early or before, but is probably to be associated with Lambda burial 7. The presence here of numerous LH IIIAi burials80 suggests that most of this sector remained an open space during this time. [It is remarkable that this phase and the preceding one are represented in each case only by the inner wall of a structure built into the hill. The outer walls, facing the sea, have vanished. This cannot be a result of recent erosion, since a subsequent LH III phase was built upon the remains. It would seem that the walls of each phase were terraced away or slid down the hill before the next phase was built, still within the LH III period.] (iv) Late Helladic IIA-IIIAi Early [The following walls and floors are assigned to this phase: walls mj, la, lp and gc with Floors 18 and 19 of 1963, Floors 1 and 3 of 1973 and Floor 3 of 1974.] In trench Lambda 1 wall la, with n-s axis, occupied the n end of the E baulk. In the n of the Lambda i/Beta 12 baulk wall lp, with e-w axis and built of large, rough blocks, abutted onto wall la (fig. 1.36). [The e end of wall lp only projected a stone or two into trench Beta 1 of 1959; as in the baulk, it lay directly under the surface. Its continuation further e had disappeared; this had presumably been removed by stone-robbing or, more probably, swept away by erosion. Walls la and lp are seen in plate 10 c. Another wall with n-s axis, wall mj, appeared in the w baulk of trench Lambda 1 at approximately the same depth as wall la. To judge by its elevation (fig. 1.38), it may have formed the w side of a room bounded to the E by wall la, with the LH IIIAi Floor 3 of 1973 in between.] In trench Beta 6 of 1963, underlying the w flank of the later wall ga at a lower level, at the point where it joins the N end of wall lq of the same date, was the short wall gc (plate 10 d). Wall gc ran N- s for a distance of 1.25 m, but petered out to the s before it reached Beta 12 A; at its N end it stopped at the N baulk of trench Beta 1. [When removed, it yielded sherds that were doubtfully identified as LH IIIAi; however, it seems to the editor more likely to belong to LH IL W. D. Taylour suggested that at its N end wall gc would have turned to the w and joined up with the missing continuation of wall lp. Wall gc passed over walls gd and ge, which have been assigned to the LH I-IIA phase. Hence wall gc is LH II-IIIAi . [Walls mj, la, lp and gc date from LH II-IIIAi; wall mj probably went out of use within LH IIIAi, but walls la and lp seem to have been reused in the following phase of construction. They were built after the collapse of the earlier wall If. These walls are all assigned to Structure Lambda III; for their particulars see table 1.41. Walls la and lp, with wall gc to the e, delimited Room 3. The s part of Room 3 was terraced away for the construction of Rooms 1 and 2 in LH IIIC Early, when wall hu formed its s wall; for the same reason no traces remained of the s wall of the room formed by walls mj and la. The n wall of this room was not found, and presumably lies under the baulk. 79 See §5 (ii). 80 See Chapter 2 §5 (i) below.</page><page sequence="96">7O W. D. TAYLOURt AND R.

This floor lay in the Beta 1 / Beta 12B baulk E of wall gc and ran under, and E of, the later wall ga (see figs. 1.35 and 1.42 stratum 6). It was made of sticky yellow clay very like that of the LH II-IIIAi Floor 1 of 1973. On it lay LH IIB pottery, including the cup 3672. Other LH II pottery was found in layers of wash that originated in eroded floors of this period in the N part of the Area. The LH IIA goblets 3667 and 3670, found on the LH IIIC Early slabbed floor in Room 4, must be attributed to wash which came down over Room 4 after its collapse. The LH I micaceous jar 1774, found in Room 2 on the LH IIIC Early slabbed floor, must also be ascribed to such wash.]</page><page sequence="101">THE BRONZE AGE ARCHITECTURE AND STRATIGRAPHY §5 75 A third floor of this phase was found in the n half of trench Lambda i . This was Floor i of 1973, a layer of yellow clay that was only partly preserved. It passed over the earlier wall le (shown in plate 10 ¿, in plan in fig. 1.36, and in section in fig. 1.45). It had no whole pots or finds on it. It was LH II- IIIAi in date. [Since it was made of sticky yellow clay like that of the LH IIB Floor 19 of 1963, it was perhaps laid at that time.] Another floor associated with this phase is Floor 3 of 1974, which lay in the Lambda i/Beta 12 baulk, e of wall la and s of wall lp in Room 3. This was taken up with baskets 30 and 32 of 1974. It was paved with slabs, on which lay the pestle 7244 and greenstone drill-core 6101, residue from the manufacture of a stone axe-head. This floor is thought to date to LH IIA. It lies at a very high elevation, which is marked in fig. 1.41 at upper right. Another floor, Floor 3 of 1973, was noted in the N sector of trench Lambda 1. This appeared to be associated with wall la and belongs to LH IIIAi. [It ran from wall la across to the base of wall mj in the w baulk, as can be seen in section in fig. 1.38. It is presumably to be associated with both these N-s walls. It lay over the earlier wall If; it was dug with baskets 13, 19 and 21 of 1973. On it were found the hole-mouthed jar 3497, which is dated to LH IIA, and the LH IIIAi unpainted goblet 3558. It also yielded the other objects listed in table 1.42.] (v) Middle Helladic III Late to Late Helladic IIA The later walls were removed in order to reveal the plan of the earlier period. The walls of this period are shown in the plan of this phase, fig. 1.43. They constituted a set of rooms numbered Rooms 5-12 on the plan and known as Structure Lambda II (see table 1.43). It was suggested that there was a second phase of construction, which involved the building of wall lc and the use of thin slabs at doorways in walls le and ht. [The earlier strata just under the surface in the s part of the Area proved easier to understand than the deeper layers in its N part.] In the N part of trench Lambda 1, wall la, described above,81 was found to rest on an earlier, broader wall in the same N-s axis, wall If. Wall If was built of largish rubble blocks, up to three courses, and was 60 cm wide. It was not removed. Wall If was assigned to the Early Mycenaean period, delimiting Room 6 from Room 7 on the plan ofthat period (fig. 1.43). It is uncertain whether Room 6 was roofed or an open courtyard. Wall If was preserved to a greater height than other Early Mycenaean walls in this sector. [To the e of wall If in trench Beta 1 , a wall with ese-wnw axis, wall gd, was abutted by a N-s wall, ge (plate 10 d). To judge by the section (fig. 1.40), wall ge is probably to be associated with the MH III/LH I or LH I layer that runs up to its base (Floor 20 of 1963), and wall gd would therefore be of a similar date. Since wall If was aligned on approximately the same coordinates as wall gd, they are thought to have joined at right angles within the Lambda 1 / Beta 1 2 A baulk and to have formed a room (Room 7 on fig. 1.43). The E side of Room 7 was formed by wall ge and the s side by wall hx, which is described below.] With the removal of the N-s baulks and revelation of the n-s walls that they contained, it proved possible to define further 'rooms' to the n and E, which had already been exposed during the earlier excavations (Rooms 5, 8 and 9 on fig. 1.43). Room 5 in Beta 6 / Beta 1 was bounded by wall hd to the N, the line of wall gd to the s and wall he to the E. Room 8 lay within trench Beta 1, to the E of Room 7 and s of Room 5; it was bounded to the n by wall gd, to the E by wall hy, the s continuation of wall he, to the w by wall ge and to the s by a probable eastward continuation of wall hx. Room 9, which lay in trenches Beta 1 2B, Beta 1 and Beta 6, had wall hd as its n boundary, wall he/hy to its w, and wall hw to its s. [Its E boundary lay to the e in Beta 4 and Beta 1 1, and may have included wall gu.] To turn to the central and s part of the Area, at the end of the 1973 season it was possible to interpret the ese-wnw wall le as a continuation of wall hx in trench Beta 12A of 1963, and the solidly built terrace wall Id, running more or less parallel to it in the s, as an extension of wall ht in that trench (see figs. 1.35 and 1.43 and plate 11 a). In 1974, as was expected, wall Id was found just below the surface at the s end of the Lambda i/Beta 12 baulk, and did indeed connect with wall ht to the E. The rest of the short wall hr adjoining it on the s was also uncovered (figs. 1.35 and 1.43 and plates 9 a and '' b). [The eastward continuation of wall le was reached and sketched, but its stones were not planned.] In the w part of trench Lambda 1 , another wall, wall lc with nne-ssw axis, lay approximately at right angles between walls le and Id. [Wall lc abuts wall le. The recorded elevation of the top of wall 81 See §5 (iv).</page><page sequence="102">y() W. D. TAYLOURt AND R.

The dating of both walls proved difficult. The removal of wall lc yielded two yellow-glazed Medieval sherds and the LH IIIAi rim 3554. Hence it was suggested that wall lc once made a corner with the LH IIIAi wall lb, thereby forming the w side of Room 1, which would have been closed by the earlier wall Id to the s; wall Id too would have continued in use down to LH IIIAi. However, the presence of Medieval sherds in wall lc shows that all the later sherds in it can be ascribed to a Medieval intrusion, probably to rob stone. Moreover, the layer of yellow clay called Floor 1 of 1973, which is LH II-IIIAi in date, overlies wall le (figs. 1.44-1.45 and plate 10 b). Indeed, the LH I-IIA Floor 2 of 1973 stops at the bases of both walls, which rest on a burnt level dated to MH III/LH I, basket 20 of 1973, as is described below (see figs. 1.44-1.45). It follows that both walls must be dated to LH I-IIA, and probably to LH L] The space between the e-w walls le and Id formed a long room (Room 10 in fig. 1.43). An early wall with N-s axis, wall It, which started to appear at the end of the 1974 season between walls Id and le immediately to the w of the line of wall lm, would along with wall lc have conveniently divided Room 10 into three parts, Rooms 10A and 10B to the w of wall It and Room 10C to the E of it. [Wall It was not cleared; it appears in outline in fig. 1.43. The e side of Room 10C was formed by wall lr, a wall that came to light in the s part of the Beta 1 2 A / Beta 1 2B baulk when the s end of the later wall lq was taken down in the last days of the season of 1974. Wall lr was never planned. In the se of the Area, the corner formed by walls hw and lr, which was also cleared but not drawn, probably represented a further room, Room 1 1 , since wall lr appears to have continued s of the line of wall ht. The area s of wall ht, probably a courtyard or street, is called Room 12.] The construction of the walls forming Rooms 6-12 showed some variation. Their details are given in table 1.43. Most of them were built of irregular blocks, two to a thickness of a wall, giving it a width of 50-60 cm. Wall gd, 48 cm wide, had two rubble courses surmounted by rows of flat slabs. It is suggested that these formed the base for a mudbrick superstructure, which would not have been a unique case. Numerous slabs were found helter-skelter in digging. Not all of these were necessarily part of beaten floors; some could equally well have fallen from walls. Wall Id was exceptional in being 70 cm broad; it had three to four courses and was also constructed of larger stones. To judge by the results of the excavations of 1963,82 the territory to the s of walls ld/ht and hq was without habitation and was used as a cemetery (see fig. 1.43). Wall ld/ht therefore was perhaps a terrace wall. [Its thickness is explicable if it was an exterior or terrace wall in which at least wall Id was of earlier construction than the rest.] The position of the entrances to the various rooms is sometimes discernible from the use of thin slabs for their thresholds; see the plan, fig. 1.43. Wall gd ended abruptly in the E, thus allowing ample communication between Room 5 and Room 8. It was suggested that an opening at the s end of wall If would have allowed access between Rooms 6 and 7. There was a possible threshold on wall lr, not marked on the plan, that would have allowed communication between Room 10C and Room 11. There was also a door in wall le towards its w end, just short of the line of wall lc. Through this door one could pass from Room 10B to Room 6. The threshold was made up with thin slabs. [The slabs abutted the e face of wall lc, which proves that walls lc and le were in use at the same time; see the elevation in figs. 1.44-1.45.] The approach to Room 10C from the s was through a doorway in ld/ht which was likewise made up with thin slabs (see plate 1 1 b and fig. 1.45). The short wall hr, built in front of and to the s of the doorway in wall ld/ht, seems to have served no other purpose than to act as a kind of ramp to approach the entrance. [Its E end was robbed out, as is shown by the cut line of Floor 7 of 1963, which abutted onto it at the s. Wall hr thus seems to have continued E beyond the doorway, forming a long step to either side of the opening.83 Wall hr went out of use during LH I, perhaps because it was gradually buried under occupation debris.] The floors of this building were barely reached, as investigation of the lower levels was not possible, owing to the final suspension of all excavation in Greece in 1974. Information therefore is of necessity incomplete. The finds from these floors are listed in table 1.44, and the pottery is published below.84 In trench Lambda 1, just n of wall le and under the LH IIIAi Floor 3 of 1973 (see fig. 1.36), were found the rim fragments of the bichrome semiglobular cup 1595 of LH I-IIA date. [This was probably from a surface in Room 6 associated with wall If.] 82 Taylour 1072, 2^0-6, 2 f^-6. 2^1 fier. i£. 83 So Taylour 1972, 254. 84 See Chapter 5 §5 (v) (c).</page><page sequence="104">78 W.

D. TAYLOURf AND R. JANKO [In Room íoC, delimited by wall It to the w, wall ht to the s, wall lr to the e and wall hx to the n, two floor levels were recognized in 1963, when trench Beta 12A was dug. These were Floor 21 and, over it, Floor 21 A (see fig. 1.41, at centre-left). These surfaces, dated by pottery to MH III/LH I, were associated with walls ht and hx. No finds were made on them.] To the w of wall It but e of wall lc, Room 10B had a much-damaged floor, called Floor 2 of 1973. This hard-packed surface had one or two horizontal slabs and some small patches of clay. The pottery was LH I-IIA. [This floor was associated with walls lc and le, i.e. the use of Room 10B, as appears in the sections, figs. 1.44-1.45. It yielded no complete pots and only a few small finds, viz. three stone tools and a spool. These are included in table 1 .44.] Underneath Floor 2 of 1973, Room 10B was filled with burnt and reddened material that consisted of very hard, caked mudbrick debris, charcoal, white ash and stones. This was the only evidence for burning in the entire Area. [The burning appears in the sections, figs. 1.44-1.45; see also plates 10 b and 1 1 a. This fire, dated to MH III/LH I, happened before walls lc and le were built. It follows that they were a later addition to wall Id, probably during LH I. Wall Id, which is very solidly built, goes back to MH III Late or MH III/LH I, as the stratigraphy demonstrates (fig. 1.44).] In Room 10 A, to the w of wall lc, two complete pots were recovered. The LH ILA Gritty Matt Painted hydria 1693 and cup 351 1 were found in basket 1 2 of 1973. [This was at a level approximately at the base of wall le. However, although this suggests that there was a floor associated with wall le=hx and probably with wall Id, none was observed (see fig. 1.45).] A pottery deposit of LH I/IIA date was found lower down the hill just under the surface, over wall hr; this consisted of the Gritty Yellow Minyan rounded goblet 1614 and the Gritty Matt Painted goblet 1649, f°un(i with the stone pounder 7263. An uncommon surface find from the s part of Lambda 1 was the tablet of black stone 6154, inscribed with two Linear A characters. [Another unusual find that may be from these levels is a MM II- III cushion-shaped seal of steatite HS 249,85 together with conulus HS 302 and whorl HS 306 from surface levels.86 The pottery shows that the doorstep hr went out of use within LH I, and they may have come from a floor running over wall hr and associated with walls ht and lr, the socles of which protected it from erosion; see fig. 1.39, at right. [A MH III/LH I surface, Floor 20 of 1963, was uncovered under LH I- II destruction debris in Room 7, both in 1959 within trench Beta 1 and in 1963 to the s within trench Beta 12 A, where it ran s to the se corner of the room against walls ge and hx (see figs. 1.40-1.41 for the section and fig. 1.43 for the plan). This floor was a hard, reddish surface made of crumbled mudbrick with white powdery earth; its N part seemed to have been re-laid after subsidence. It was exposed over a total area of c. 1.9 x 0.5 m. There were no complete pots or small finds. [A further floor belonging to this complex was found in Room 9 within trench Beta 12B in 1963 (fig. 1.43). This was Floor 22, some 2.3 x 1.0 m in extent. It had survived, with a hearth, in the sw corner of walls hw and hy (see the E-w section fig. 1.40 and the n-s section fig. 1.42). This floor yielded the basin 2322 and two jars dated to MH III or early LH, the pithoid 2288 and the polychrome HS 32.87 Other sherds from here are published as 2270 and 2294-2295; the large goblet HS 100 may be from the same context.88 However, the jug-rim 2328 is an Aeginetan import datable to no earlier than LH I, but more probably to LH II-IIIA; this may derive from the overlying LH II fill, since a join in 2288 with Lambda/Beta 12, 1974 # 43, which consists of MH III/LH I wash mixed with LH IIIA material, shows that this floor was partially eroded down the slope to the sw. The pottery found on Floor 22 suggests that walls hw and hy were originally constructed during MH III/ LH I, and this may be the date of much of the complex. However, the stratigraphy under walls lc and le proves that the latter walls were added after MH III/LH I, probably during LH I: see fig. 1.45. [Two burials found in Area Lambda/Beta 12, Beta burial 21 and Lambda burial 13, date from this period.89] (vi) Middle Helladic I-III Early [Below the MH III Late to LH IIA levels of Structure Lambda II, small soundings reached pure MH strata in only three places.

This lay under tumble and a MH III/LH I stratum. It appeared in the sw corner of the trench and ran for 1.65 m on a wsw-ene axis until it disappeared under wall Id; for details of the wall, see table 1.45. Whether it continued beyond the line of wall Id is unknown, since excavation ceased in that sector just above the depth where the top of the wall would have been expected to lie. Wall mk was not cleared, but to judge by its depth, overburden and alignment it could not be later than MH III Early. No layers connected with it were dug. [Pure MH III Early strata were reached in the second sounding, which was made N of wall Id, in the central sector of trench Lambda 1; it covered an area some 3.2 x 1.7 m in extent, inside the confines of Rooms 10A and 10B of Structure Lambda II, including the baulk under wall lc, which was removed (see fig 1.43; the sounding appears in section in figs. 1.44-1.45). The MH III Early strata lay on either side of wall lc, well below the level of its base and that of the other walls of the room.] In Room 10A, the MH III Early Lustrous Decorated jar 1498 and coarse cooking bowl 1509 were found in the stony level dug with basket 22 of 1973. [These vessels must have come from a MH III Early floor antedating the construction of wall lc. This probable floor to the w of wall lc, and an ashy stratum to its E containing MH III Late sherds, both lay over a hard, whitish-grey layer some 20 cm deep, containing MH III Early sherds, into which were cut burials Lambda 2-3, dating from MH III Late. Excavation ceased at this level. The few finds from this layer are included in table 1 .46. Among them was an important discovery, viz. the fragments of the clay crucible 6061, which preserved traces of tin bronze.90 This crucible was found under wall lc and below the levels of the bases of walls le and Id. It attests to metal-working here during MH III Early. This art was also practised n of here in Area Nu from as early as MH I, in LH IIA in the se sector of Area Beta, and just E of here, in Room 2, in LH IIIC Early. There was a long tradition of metallurgy at the site, exploiting the maritime breezes that buffet the s side of the promontory on hot summer afternoons. [The third and deepest sounding was through the E side of Room 7. This sounding was bounded to the N by wall gd, to the E by wall ge, to the s by wall hx, and to the w by the baulk (see fig. 1.43). Its N part was dug in 1959 within trench Beta 1, and its s part in 1963 in the Beta 1 / Beta 12 baulk; it was some 1.9 x 0.5 m in total extent. Thus it cleared both the ne and se quadrants of Room 7. It appears in the E-w section fig. 1.40 at right; this shows the s baulk of trench Beta 1 as drawn in 1959, modified to take account of the excavations immediately to the s in 1963. The sounding also appears in the N-s section fig. 1.41. The surface associated with the MH III/LH I walls ge and hx, Floor 20 of 1963, was discussed above.91 This floor lay over a stratum c. 15-25 cm deep of brown, crumbly earth. The pottery included Dark Burnished, Yellow Minyan and 'Matt Painted' sherds; as always in the records of the earlier excavations, it is not clear whether Dull Painted or true Matt Painted is meant. It also included 'Mycenaean', by which Lustrous Decorated is probably meant, and sherds with light-on- dark decoration. This probably points to a date of MH III Late, when dark ground decoration prevailed. The excavators of 1963 identified a floor (Floor 23) within this stratum, but this is doubtful, as no significant finds were made and no such floor was recognised by R. Hope Simpson in 1959. [At the base of this stratum in trench Beta 1 was a very hard orange layer c. 1 2 cm deep with small stones, with a small area of white ash some 30 x 40 cm in extent, perhaps a hearth, and other smaller patches elsewhere. This was certainly a floor, Floor 25 of 1963. It did not extend s of the upright slab that appears in the N-s section, fig. 1.41. Floor 25 yielded the bone awl HS 330,92 the carinated Dark Burnished bowl or goblet HS 94,93 and sherd 2285 from a Lustrous Decorated light-ground jar. This suggests that the floor dated from MH III Early, when the dark-on-light style predominated. The earth beneath it, some 15 cm thick, was softer and brown to orange with white ash. The pottery included Dark Burnished, 'Matt Painted' (which may mean Dull Painted) and polychrome sherds, and a thickened rim with a row of oblique incisions below it. Burial Beta 2 1 was cut into this layer but was not removed.94 [Under this was 30-40 cm of darker brown earth with small stones. In the N it came down onto a possible wall, of which only two stones were exposed, perhaps with a wsw-ene axis, under the later wall gd. To the s lay an area of cobbles called Floor 27 in 1963. The pottery was still MH, including 'Matt Painted' and polychrome sherds and a tripod cooking pot; in 1963 the sole sherd recovered, from near the base of the layer, was the Dark Burnished bowl rim 2219, with the simple MH I rather than the complex MH II profile. R. Hope Simpson believed that this layer was formed by debris 90 See Appendix 4. 91 See §5 (v). 92 Taylour 1972, 261, pl. 42Ì.1. 93 Taylour 1072, 2f;7. 94 See Chapter 2 §5 (ii) below.</page><page sequence="108">82 W. D. TAYLOURt AND R. JANKO from a building. Its exact date is undetermined, but judging by comparable destructions elsewhere on the site, notably those in Areas Eta and Nu, one suspects that it occurred in MH I Late. Excavation ceased at this depth, although bedrock had not been reached, nor even the red soil characteristic of EH occupation at the site. The few finds made in this small sounding are included in table 1.46.] 6. AREA LAMBDA 2, 1974: LATE HELLADIC (figs. 1.46-1.47) (i) Introduction In 1974 a new trench was opened to the N of trench Lambda 1. Its ultimate dimensions were 5 m (n-s) x 4 m, i.e. 20 m2 (fig. 1.46). The ground sloped steeply down from n to s. Immediately to the n of it was Area Nu / Gamma 1 , and it was hoped that trench Lambda 2 would help to establish the relationship between Area Nu / Gamma 1 and the Beta trenches (see fig. iv above). [However, the results proved disappointing, and excavation ceased before interesting finds were made.] (ii) Late Helladic IIIA2-IIIC Early Sector alpha in the nw corner yielded mainly Medieval levels.95 Excavation under the Medieval walls lg and Ik proceeded to a depth of 70 cm, but no earlier wall came to light. Instead, a thin layer dated to LH IIIC Early was found. Under it orange earth and black pebbles were revealed. The scattered small finds in the trench could not be associated with any particular wall. [Excavation in sector alpha ceased at this depth (see the schematic section, fig. 1.47). The sherds suggest, but do not prove, that the orange stratum, which may represent decayed mudbrick rather than burning, belonged to the LH IIIA2-B fill that occupied the remainder of this trench. Except in sector beta, which was protected from erosion by the early wall lj, the rest of the trench down the slope from the Medieval walls was occupied by this uniform fill, which contained many worn LH I-IIA sherds as well as some unworn LH IIIA2 and LH IIIB fragments. The latter are published as 3576-3582 below and serve to date this layer. It was unclear whether its bottom had been reached when excavation ceased at a maximum depth of c, 80 cm in the s part of the trench. This same fill may have reappeared in the N half of trench Lambda 1 , which lay down the slope to the s, in strata only a slightly lower in elevation than those in the s part of Area Lambda 2 itself. A similar layer of fill was observed E of wall lm in the Lambda 1 / Beta 12A baulk (see fig. 1.39, under the surface level), which was located to the se of Lambda 2. It was also observed under the surface level in Lambda 3/4 of 1977 (see fig. 1.50 strata 10-11, fig. 1.51 stratum 6, fig. 1.52 stratum 5). All the Bronze Age finds from this trench are listed in table 1.47; nearly all came either from this stratum or from the Medieval levels above it. The three pierced shells (9268-9269, 9274) represent a simple necklace.] (iii) Late Helladic II-IIIAi Another Bronze Age wall, lh, was seen to issue from under the Medieval wall lg near its sw end in an easterly direction; it stopped after 1.25 m (plate 1 1 c and fig. 1.46). It had two courses. Later it was found to make an angle at its w end with wall 11, of similar construction (plate 11 d) . At this junction wall 11 consisted of five courses. It continued s down the slope, disappearing into the s baulk. The orientation of these two walls could relate them to those in Lambda 1 of the LH IIIA-LH IIIC Early phases (fig. 1.36), but the pottery suggests that they belonged to LH II. [The tumble from wall 11 contained LH II sherds, but the wall itself was not taken down and the fact that later sherds were not found among the stones could be accidental. Together these walls form Structure Lambda IV, the details of which are given in table 1.48. I suggest that these walls belong to LH II-IIIAi.] Floor 2 went with these walls (plate 12 a). This floor consisted of a mass of small stones and chips beaten down hard; among the stones were fragments of animal bones. No other finds came from it. (iv) Late Helladic I To the ne of wall lh another wall, wall lj, was found to issue from under the Medieval wall lg at a lower level than wall lh. It had three courses, and its orientation was roughly nw-se. Its exposed length before disappearing into the e baulk was 1.85 m. A very hard stony layer, designated Floor 1, 95 See Chapter 3 §4 below.</page><page sequence="109">THE BRONZE AGE ARCHITECTURE AND STRATIGRAPHY §6 83 Fig. 1.46. Area Lambda 2. Plan showing location of walls and section (fig. 1.47). was associated with it (plate 12 a). Like Floor 2, Floor 1 yielded no whole pots or small finds. Wall lj appeared to be earlier than walls lh and 11; its base was not reached, unlike that of wall 11. It probably belonged to LH I. At present wall lj cannot be tied up with any other walls of the same period. In the space sheltered from erosion behind wall lj (i.e. sector beta in fig. 1.46), LH IIA levels survived to a depth of 20 cm and seemed to overlie the top of the wall (see fig. 1.47). At the s end of the trench, two lines of stones with N-s axis and others running E-w suggested that new walls were appearing, but there was not the time to investigate. [Many MH sherds were found in the fill, and levels of this date seemed likely to lie beneath. However, because of the international crisis, excavation ceased here at a maximum depth of c. 0.7 m below the surface. It is unknown why the trench was not reopened in 1977. No burials of any period were uncovered.]</page><page sequence="110">84 W. D. TAYLOURt AND R.

AREA LAMBDA 3/4, 1977: EARLY TO LATE HELLADIC (figs. 1.48-1.52) (i) Introduction In view of what promised to be important developments in Area Nu / Gamma 1 ,96 a trench called Lambda 3 was laid out to the e of it, with a baulk of up to 1 m between the two (see fig. iv above). The terrain sloped down from N to s. A modern terrace wall ran ne-sw along what turned out to be the line of the Medieval wall lx/ma; much of its walling was probably the original Medieval construction. The trench was at first 5 x 5 m in extent (fig. 1.48). A quite considerable depth of Medieval deposits was dug through before any Bronze Age levels were reached, and when they were, it was necessary to extend the trench by 1.5 m at the N end; this extension was called Lambda 4. The whole Area amounted to 32.5 m2in extent. The greater part of the Medieval building was laid bare. [This building is Structure Lambda VIL 97 Since its substantial walls, except Pier IV, were not removed, the Bronze Age levels beneath them were not exposed. This is why the areas excavated had the irregular and discontinuous shape seen in figs. 1.48-1.49. [Bronze Age levels were reached in only three parts of the Area: first, a small sector in the sw corner, which is designated Room A, Floor 6 on fig. 1.49; second, an even smaller sector in the se, with Floors 4a and 4b; and third, a larger sector in the centre and ne of the Area, labelled Room B, Floor 7 and Room C, Floor 8. The designations of Rooms and Floors refer to Structure Lambda I.98] (ii) Late Helladic IIA-IIIA [Although a little LH IIIC Early pottery was found, any layers of that date seem to have been terraced or eroded away. If there was any later Mycenaean walling, it did not survive the massive Medieval building works in the Area. The Medieval building rested on a layer containing worn LH I-IIA sherds with some LH IIIA2 material; a similar layer was found in trenches Lambda 2 and Lambda 1 to the s." This layer appears as stratum 10 in fig. 1.50 and stratum 5 in fig. 1.52; the finds from it are listed in table 1.50. This layer overlay the Mycenaean wall me] Apart from sporadic sherds, the first architectural feature of the Bronze Age to appear was a cist grave, Lambda burial 14, near the sw wall of the Medieval building. The cist contained the small jug 3572, which dates the burial to LH IIIA2. In the narrow space between the earlier walls me and me another cist grave, Lambda burial 16, covered by a single slab, was revealed. This interment also may be LH IIIA2. On these burials see below.100 [Their presence suggests that the Area was unoccupied at this time.] A pithos burial, Lambda burial 15, appeared in the se corner of the trench, outside the precincts of the Medieval structure; it rested on the earlier wall mb (fig. 1.48). [Since wall mb probably went out of use early in LH IIA, but the burial was under the LH III strata, it must date to LH II. This is supported by the fact that the jar 1781, which contained the burial, is LH I-IIA in date. On this interment see below.101] The latest Bronze Age wall in this trench is wall me. It is shown in plan in figs. 1.48-1.49 and in section in fig. 1.50; for its details see table 1.51. This wall, though in proximity to the earlier wall me, is not related to the megaron, Structure Lambda I,102 since it was on a slightly different alignment (see plate 12 ^). It was barely a metre in length. No doubt stones were robbed from it for the construction of the Medieval building. Near the sw end of the wall is a single stone that may indicate a wall branching off from it at right angles in a westerly direction. The various baskets surrounding this wall contained Early Mycenaean pottery, but one also included a sherd possibly of LH IIIA2. [This is the only Bronze Age wall found in the Area apart from those of Structure Lambda I. It clearly post-dates the abandonment of that Structure early in LH IIA, but its date is uncertain.] (iii) Middle Helladic II to Late Helladic IIA [Much more survives from the previous phase of construction. This began with the erection of Structure Lambda I at a date no later than MH III Early. Since its walls are on the same alignment as walls ng and nx in the adjacent Area Nu, which were certainly built in MH III Early,103 it was probably 96 See §8 below. 97 See Chanter &lt;* §4 with fig. &lt;*.&lt;*. 98 See §7 (iii) below. 99 See §6 (i) above. 100 Chapter 2 §6. 101 Chapter 2 §6. 102 See §7 (iii) below. 103 See §8 (vii) below.</page><page sequence="112">86 W.

This building underwent several stages of remodelling, with successive floors, until it was abandoned early in LH 1 1 A. Its walls survived less well than did the floors, no doubt because the Medieval builders raided them for stone; they will be discussed first.] Wall mb, with nne-ssw axis, now made its appearance in the se corner of the Area (see fig. 1.48); it lay under the thick fill with worn LH I-IIA pottery and some LH IIIA2 sherds, as is seen in section in fig. 1.51. Approximately at right angles to wall mb on its nw flank was a double row of small stones, some of them the size of a potato. Although apparently insignificant as a wall, these seem to have served some purpose and have been designated wall mi. The sector to the sw of wall mi is designated Room A on fig. 1.48, while that to its ne is called Room B. Wall mb was roughly parallel to another wall, wall me in the centre of the trench, and was about 3.5 m distant from it. Wall me continued into trench Lambda 4, where it is called wall mg. Wall me, seen in section in fig. 1.50, lay under the same LH IIIA2 fill. At right angles to it, on its se side, another wall, called mh, proceeded in a south-easterly direction for about 1 m, but was interrupted in its course by a very short wall on the same alignment, wall md, which has been interpreted as a threshold. When combined, all these walls form the incomplete plan of a megaron. The walls and rooms of this house, Structure Lambda I, are shown on fig. 1.48, with dotted lines to indicate reconstructed walls. The possible wall mi, branching off from wall mb, could be one of a pair of opposing walls separating off the porch of the megaron from the vestibule. Thus Room B is delimited by the lines of wall mi to the sw, wall me to the nw, wall md/mh to the ne, and wall mb to the se. Two sides of a further room, Room C, were formed by wall md/mh to the se and wall me/mg to the nw. Its other two sides were thought to lie under the baulks; they would be supplied by a continuation of mb on the se and a hypothetical ne cross-wall that would join this continuation to wall me/mg. For details of all these walls see table 1.51. That so little remains of the megaron must be attributed to the Medieval</page><page sequence="113">THE BRONZE AGE ARCHITECTURE AND STRATIGRAPHY §7 87 Fig. 1.49. Area Lambda 3/4. Plan showing MH III-LH I walls and LH I floors and finds; Medieval walls (shaded) not removed. building activities that involved making deep foundation trenches for the construction of the massive piers. These caused soil disturbance throughout the trench, and there were few baskets that were not mixed in some way. Wall mb in the se corner was overlaid by an Early Mycenaean stratum and, as LH I is also represented among the sherds on the floors of the megaron, it is certain that the building was used at that time. Its disuse must be dated by the latest material found on the floors. [There were several phases of occupation in Structure Lambda I, represented by successive well- stratified floor levels. The latest were Floors 4a, 4b, and 6, probably all laid in LH I/IIA. The make- up of Floors 4a and 4b was not investigated, but that of Floor 6 was LH I/IIA. The finds from these floors are plotted on fig. 1.49 and listed in tables 1.52-1.53; some of the Bronze Age finds from Medieval levels listed in table 1.50 may come from them also. The plentiful pottery is published as 3381-3461 below.] Floors 4a, 4b, and 6 go together. Floor 4a was in the se sector to the nw of wall mb and to the ne of the possible wall, wall mi, that made a right angle with it on its nw flank (see fig. 1 .48 and plate 12 c). Floor 4b was in the same sector to the sw of wall mi. Floor 6 was a continuation of Floor 4 in the sw sector, designated Room A, sw of the putative continuation of wall mi. [Wall mi, like wall mh, lay under LH I Early sherds and was buried before Floor 6 came into use. On the surface of Floor 6 lay LH I Early sherds, including 1710, but also one whole vase, the LH ILA goblet 3522. Parts of a LH ILA hole-mouthed jar, 3495, were found at a higher level over Floors 6 and 7. Perhaps it was standing on a flat roof which collapsed onto the floor. Moreover, P. A. Mountjoy tentatively dates sherd 3457, from the matrix of Floor 6, to LH IIA Early, while C. Zerner assigns it to the transition LH I/IIA, which amounts to the same date. Although nearly all the pottery from these floors is LH I, it is clear that these floors were laid late in that period and the building quickly went out of use after the start of LH HA.]</page><page sequence="114">88 W.

Floor 7 went up to wall me, which was uncovered during the clearing of the floor. On it were found a stone quern, which was not kept, and the four strange boat-like objects 6078-6081. [These are surely model boats used as toys. The dating of Floor 7 depends on that of Floor 8; it was certainly in use during LH I Early, and the finds on it are probably of that date.] Floor 8 was in Room C, nw of wall md/mh in trench Lambda 4 in the N but at a slightly higher elevation than Floor 7. Floor 8 had two periods of use. The pottery fragments from the upper levels over Floor 8 have LH I Early as the latest material. Such is the date of the gritty Yellow Minyan carinated cup 3401 found on the Floor. [As there seems to have been no Mycenaean pottery in the matrix of Floor 8 (see the sections, figs. 1.50-1.51), it was probably laid in MH III/LH I, which is also the date of the unusual cup 3391 found in this layer. It was remade in LH I Early. The date of its renewal is confirmed by the fact that the threshold called wall md contained two Lustrous Painted, i.e. Mycenaean, sherds. This threshold was laid when the floor level had risen, no doubt when Floor 8 was renewed, in order to provide a step up from Floor 7 to Floor 8. This fact suggests that the two floors were contemporary. [There may also have been a floor on the se flank of wall mb in the extreme se corner of Lambda 3; although this sector was very limited in extent, the layer has been dated to MH III/LH I. It was overlaid by the same LH I-IIA fill. Excavation ceased at the levels of floors 4, 6 and 7, but continued deeper in Room C] Two earlier floors, Floors 9 and 10, were excavated beneath Floor 8 in the ne sector (see the sections, figs. 1.50-1.51). The whole pots from them are listed in table 1.53. Floor 9 is in the ne corner of trench Lambda 4, immediately under Floor 8. On Floor 9 lay the goblet 1484, the pithos 1513, and the stone drill-core 6100. The two complete jars 1507-1508 were found in the matrix of the floor. [C. Zerner assigns all four vases to MH III Late. It follows that this floor was made up in MH III Late and used during that phase. An undersized sample from the use of Floor 9 yielded the excessively early calibrated radiocarbon date of 2450 ±650 bc.104] Floor 10 was in the same location, some 18 cm lower than Floor 9. Remains of the cup 1487 and jars 1501 and 1508-1509 were uncovered on it. A great deal of ash and carbon was found while excavating this floor; this probably indicates a destruction of the building in that period. [C. Zerner dates the pottery on this floor to MH II or MH III Early; perhaps it is from the MH II/III Early transition. Carbon and soil found on Floor 10 yielded a calibrated radiocarbon date of 1975 ±150 bc.105 This date may well be derived from an old roof-beam burned in the destruction. The building was repaired after this destruction and its floor was remade as is described above.] Thus this building appears from the pottery associated with its lowest floor, Floor 10, to have been constructed no later than MH III Early and possibly in MH II. [Excavation ceased at the level of Floor 10. Whether Structure Lambda I antedates this time is unknown, as the bases of the walls were not reached; it may well go back to the start of MH II. However, it must post-date the destruction in MH I late of Structure Nu I, the e part of which must have extended beneath it.] (iv) Early Helladic II to Middle Helladic I [Stray sherds of the EH and MH I- II periods strongly suggest that, had it been possible to continue the excavation, the late MH I apsidal house that lay in Area Nu/Gamma 1 to the w, viz. Structure Nu I, would have been found to extend under this Area, with EH II occupation beneath it.] 8. AREA NU / GAMMA 1, 1959 AND 1973-77: MIDDLE TO LATE HELLADIC (figs. 1.53-1.66) (i) Introduction [The first part of this Area to be excavated was trench Gamma 1 in 1959, which was originally 5 m long (e-w) x 1.5 m wide. A NE Extension was added, so that it was eventually 6.2 m long (e-w) x 1.5 m wide, but 2.8 m wide in its NE Extension (fig. 1.53).106 The NE Extension uncovered only Medieval remains, which were thought to be modern, whereas the Bronze Age walls that appeared in the w part of the trench were not understood. Excavation was only resumed in the Area in 1973.] 104 See Appendix o §5. 105 See Appendix 9 §5. 106 jror pians anci sections see Taylour 1972, 230 fig. 14.</page><page sequence="118">92 W. D. TAYLOURf AND R. JANKO First, a trench was laid out on level ground 1.5 m to the s of Gamma 1. The new trench, designated trench Nu 1, had the same length as Gamma 1 of 1959, viz. 5 m (e-w), but was 3 m wide. Following the discovery in trench Nu 1 of the MH III/LH I house, Structure Nu II, it was decided in 1974 to take down the 5 m (e-w) x 1.5 m baulk separating trenches Gamma 1 and Nu 1, called the Nu / Gamma 1 baulk. Except for the surface level, all earth from digging this baulk was passed through a water-sieve specially set up for this purpose c. 200 m from the site. Before excavation was resumed in trench Nu 1 in 1974, a new trench, 4 m (e-w) x 2.50 m in extent and designated Nu 2, was started to the s of it. The s limit of Nu 2 stopped 1 m short of Area Lambda 2 (fig. iv). During the 1977 season the Area was dug as a single unit, 47.2 m2 in extent. For a diagram of the trenches in this Area see fig. 1.53. The upper levels of the Area contained the debris from a Medieval building and courtyard.107 The building, Structure Lambda VII, was located almost entirely to the E in Area Lambda 3/4 of 1977, but the whole of Area Nu lay under the courtyard that was attached to it. [The excavators of this Area, J. B. and S. H. Rutter, have published a detailed and thorough study of much of the MH and LH pottery found here in 1973 and 1974.108 For the most part, this pottery is not republished in this volume. Although the architecture and stratigraphy from these seasons is reinterpreted here, the reader interested in the ceramic sequence in this Area will continue to find their pioneering study essential. When mentioned in this chapter, sherds published there are indicated with the prefix R, e.g. R968, and are included in the concordance; the groups of baskets from which they come, called 'Deposits' by the Rutters, are designated with a capital letter in bold face, e.g. Deposit D. They recognised five ceramic phases. The latest, Period IV, was LH ILA. Next came some material dated to between Period IV and Period III; Dickinson assigned this to LH I.109 Under this was stratified the pottery of Period III, which the Rutters regarded as wholly within MH III.110 Below this was the pottery of Period II, which was at the time dated to MH II Late,111 and then that of Period I, which was considered MH II. [The excavations of 1977 and subsequent study seasons have changed this picture, which is reaching a degree of precision that could not have been imagined without the earlier publication. Two phases of LH I are distinguished, LH I Early and the transition LH I/IIA. Period III is now regarded as the Transitional Period MH III/LH I; C. Zerner suggests that three of the constituent Deposits (H, K and L) are LH I Early. There are two phases of MH III, Early and Late, between Periods II and III. Period II is now deemed to represent the transition MH II Late/MH III Early. Period II is now considered to be MH II, and Period I to be MH I Late. A few Deposits have been reassigned, and some baskets have been re-dated. The original and revised chronologies of the Deposits and baskets allotted to each Period are presented in table 1.54; for a more extensive tabulation of chronological data see chart 14.1.] For the burials from Area Nu see below.112 All are MH to LH in date. (ii) Late Helladic III [Any LH IIIB or LH IIIC Early levels in Area Nu had been removed by Medieval activity. Even from LH IIIA no architectural remains survive; hence it is possible that the Area was then unoccupied and used only for burials.] In the Nu/Gamma 1 baulk and in Nu 1 the Medieval levels were c. 40 cm in depth and were filled with a lot of debris. These levels yielded a few unstratified Mycenaean finds, mainly LH III; the finds made in them are included in table 1.55. In the Nu / Gamma 1 baulk, the top stones of the MH III/ LH I wall nf appeared immediately below the Medieval strata.113 This wall divided the trench into two unequal portions. Digging was then started on either side of wall nf but was interrupted in the E by the discovery of four child burials, burials 7-10 (fig. 1.53). These graves, represented by infant skulls and some associated bones, lay in the SE corner of the Nu / Gamma 1 baulk, just above the MH wall ng and to the ne of it (fig. 1.53 and fig. 1.55 at left). In this sector it was noticed that the soil in the w part differed in colour from that in the E. The dividing line was umwof the e trench wall. The change in colour probably marked the disturbance caused by these burials. Thirteen minute disc beads of carnelian, paste and bone, viz. 7219-7231, were found in the water-sieve residue and came from this area.

After most of its Medieval levels had been removed, trench Nu 2 was divided into a w and an E half of roughly equal dimensions. Two new walls started to appear, walls nl and ni (figs. 1.53-1. 54). 118 They are both Early Mycenaean but do not make a coherent plan. For the details of the LH IIA walls see table 1.56. Wall nl in the w of Nu 2 was an ill-constructed wall, the axis of which turned out to be wnw by ese. Starting from the w baulk, it proceeded for a distance of 1.85 m and came to an abrupt stop with a roughly squared end. The excavator, J. B. Rutter, suggested that this was a doorjamb. Wall nl passed over the MH III/LH I wall nf. Wall nl was crudely built of medium-sized and large stones (plate 12 d). Neither face was particularly straight or vertical. Up to two or at most three courses were preserved in the sector w of wall nf, but only one course to the e of that wall. Its average width was 60 cm. When removed, wall nl contained LH IIA sherds. The surviving half of the small terracotta tub R967, the end of which measures 22 cm in length and 16 cm in width, was uncovered upside down at the se end of wall ni on a floor that can probably be associated with this wall (see plate 13 b).

JANKO The floor, which seems to have sloped down slightly from ne to sw, has been dated to LH IIA. The pottery from it is published as Deposit O; the location of this Deposit appears in section in figs. 1.55- 1.56. Apart from the tub, other fragmentary vases found on the same floor were the Gritty Matt Painted bowl R655 and the beaked jug 3644. [The goblet 3647 and the krater 3648 were at first associated with this floor. However, since these vases are later in date, they have been reattributed to the LH IIIAi Nu burial 11, which must have been cut into this level.119] Wall ni in the e of Nu 2 was a short wall of just under 1 m running approximately N-s. Originally it was longer, but its s end had probably been destroyed by a Medieval pit (see fig. 1.53).120 Wall ni bordered the MH III/LH I wall nk on its w side and partly overlay it (plates 12 d and 13 a). It was built of small or medium-sized stones. It had no well-defined faces and it could not be said to be coursed. At most it was two stones high. [The excavator believed that it originally ran almost to the s baulk, before it was robbed out by the Medieval pit. However, the stones to the s may have belonged to the cist of Nu burial 1 1 . The construction of wall ni is so poor that one may doubt whether it was a wall rather than merely a dump of loose stone or perhaps a cairn marking burial 13 beneath. When removed, it contained LH IIA sherds.] To the e of wall ni another Early Mycenaean deposit was dug. Among the pottery found was the Vapheio cup 3645. This LH IIA pottery is also published as part of Deposit O, together with found w of wall ni, i.e. e of wall nl as was just mentioned. The LH IIA vases and small finds are included in table 1.57. In Area Nu 1 it was not until a depth of 40 cm was reached that Bronze Age buildings started to appear. Just above that level there were several clumps of mudbrick, the remains of disintegrated walls built of that material. The first stone wall to emerge was wall na, with a n-s axis (fig. 1.53). This wall consisted of one course of facing stones and a rubble core; the base was about 10 cm higher than that of the MH III/LH I wall nf. Wall na appeared to have turned to the w at its n end. When the wall was removed, the pottery from it showed that it was datable to the LH period. [The sherds from the stratum to the E of wall na and associated with that wall were published as Deposit N; the location of this Deposit is shown on the sections, figs. 1.55 and 1.59, and the elevation of the wall, projected, appears in fig. 1.58. This material, at first considered LH IIA, is assigned to LH I by Dickinson121 but to LH I/IIA by C. Zerner. Since Deposit N is associated with wall na,122 it would follow that the wall itself is of the same date. In trench Nu 2 in the narrow strip to the E of the MH III/LH I wall nk and N of wall nm (see fig. 1.61), charcoal and mudbrick came to light, apparently in a MH I layer (see fig. 1.59, stratum 12). The charcoal, sample P-2568, was found at a depth of -1.515 BM, well below the depth of Deposit N and probably at the base of stratum 8 in fig. 1 .55. It yielded a calibrated radiocarbon date of 1450 BC ±15O.123 This date, far too recent for MH I, is more appropriate to LH I/IIA; the charcoal seems to have come from or been contaminated by the later stratum, which lay immediately adjacent to it in the cutting. Stratum 8 can then be LH I/IIA fill under the surface represented by Deposit N. This chronology also entails that wall na is LH I/IIA or LH IIA.] No LH IIA walls appeared within the Nu / Gamma 1 baulk. The sector to the w of the massive MH III/LH I wall nf, which divided the trench in two, produced unmixed LH IIA sherds, and included fragments of the medium coarse jug R966, which could be partly restored. The LH IIA pottery from this thin stratum is published as Deposit P; see fig. 1.57, at right. The layer below, Deposit K, produced a little LH IIA among earlier material (figs. 1.57-1.58). The small pierced schist pendant 6088 and other objects were found in the water-sieve residue and came from this sector. These finds imply LH I Early to LH IIA occupation to the w of wall nf, the pottery of which was retained by that wall, confining it on the e. [Four Early Mycenaean finds came from Gamma 1, the cups 3660 and HS 89-90 and the terracotta burnisher HS 298.124] In the s of the Area, traces of a further burial were found in 1974, but this was not then recognised. In the sw sector of Nu 2 the position was confused by the finding of many stones, thought at the time to derive from the collapse of walls. The outlines appeared of what seemed to be a wall, wall nn with NNE-ssw axis, issuing from the s baulk. But in 1977 wall nn was discovered to be the nw face of a square cist tomb of a small child, called Nu burial 12 (see figs. 1.53-1.54 and plate 24 d).U5 Under its stones were uncovered fragments of the large jug R835 and of the coarse cooking pot R968. They are published with a few other sherds as Deposit Q. see the section, fig. 1.56.

JANKO associated with the interment, dating it to LH IIA. The tomb had destroyed the s end of the MH III/ LH I wall nf (see figs. 1.54 and 1.61 with plate 23 ¿), and some of the stones of wall nf were incorporated into the structure of the cist. (iv) Late Helladic I [Apart from the LH I/IIA wall na, there was no settlement architecture from the phase that followed the destruction of Structure Nu II in LH I Early. Pottery from LH I contexts has been published as R973-1012. This came mainly from 1974 baskets 38 and 41, representing two thin layers under the LH IIA fill that lay over Room 2 of the MH III/LH I Structure Nu II and to its s and e (see fig. 1.55 stratum 7); R975, however, is earlier, as it comes from the removal of the MH III/LH I wall nf. The LH I whole pots and small finds are included in table 1.57. [The only LH I construction in Area Nu was the shaft grave, Nu burial 13. The existence of this grave, recognised only after its shaft had almost been cleared and the MH III/LH I levels had begun to be taken up, made the stratigraphy of the Area hard to interpret and led to the contamination of some of its earlier levels with a small amount of LH I and LH I/IIA pottery from its fill. The upper surround of this grave was discovered at a depth that was actually below that of the MH III/LH I floor in Room 2 of Structure Nu IL This floor was for the most part curiously rough and stony, and yielded no finds at all except near the hearth, where it was undisturbed (see figs. 1.60-1.61). But no discoloration of the earth was recognised at the time, and there seemed no reason to suspect that it had been cut through for a burial. Only later was the line of a cutting along the n edge of the tomb observed; this is shown in section on fig. 1.59 and in plan in figs. 1.60 and 2.10 a. A quadrangle of walls called np, nq, ns and nt, very roughly built with one stone's width of small or large stones and of one course only, was found to have marked the area of the shaft grave (figs. 1 .60, 2.10: a and 2.1 1 with plate 24 b). Its dimensions were c. 2.1 x 1.6 m. Its construction had destroyed that part of the MH III/LH I wall nm that originally ran E-w between the s ends of the contemporary walls nf and nk; the line of where wall nm was destroyed is marked by dotted lines in fig. 1.61. [The excavator wrote in 1977 that 'the shaft grave is sealed by and predates the construction of the MH III/LH I building'. However, it must come from the phase after LH I Early, for two reasons. First, LH I/IIA sherds were found in the fill of the shaft. Basket 40 of 1977 from within the top of the shaft yielded the rim of a fine Matt Painted bichrome goblet (2045) which C. Zerner dates to LH 1/ IIA. Basket 47 of 1977, also contaminated by the shaft, contained sherds of fine Lustrous Decorated cups with dark-on-light decoration which are also LH I/IIA (2081, 2086). Also, the length of the destroyed portion of the s wall of Structure Nu II, wall nm, matched the width of the surround of the shaft grave. The exactitude of the fit is illustrated in fig. 1.60. Hence the missing portion of wall nm was removed when the tomb was built, just as the s continuation of wall nf was obliterated by the construction of Nu burial 12 soon afterwards.126 The shaft grave initially passed undetected because the earth of its shaft had sunk, taking the stone surround of the shaft down with it to a depth below that of the MH III/LH I floor of Room 2 (plate 150). Presumably the stones of the quadrangular grave surround settled into the top of the shaft, which must have sunk by at least several centimetres once the soil with which it had been filled had dried out and become compacted. The fill included much of the Lustrous Painted jar 2125, which has large, loopy spirals dated to MH III Late and contemporary with MM IIIB, and the crucible 6064; other pieces of both were built into the walls of the grave. Another crucible, 6062, was found only in its shaft. Pieces of metal- working residue were found in the foundation trench of the MH III/LH I wall nf and in MH III contexts (see tables 1.60 and 1.63). Their discovery confirms that this industry was carried on hereabouts; it is also attested in the MH I apsidal building, Structure Nu I.127 Unfortunately it follows that the artefacts from metal- working from contexts later than MH I could all be cast-ups from the latter period, and cannot in any case be dated with accuracy. For a more detailed account of the grave see below.128] (v) Middle Helladic III/Late Helladic I to Late Helladic I Early (Period III Rutter) [This period was marked by the building and destruction, which ensued shortly afterwards, of the very solid Structure Nu IL The terrace on which it stood was thoroughly cleared in preparation for its erection.

Plan of trenches Nu 1 and 2 to show relation of Structure Nu II (MH III/LH I) to LH I/IIA Shaft Grave, burial 13. terraced away, and the tops of the MH I wall nh and the MH II wall nv were also removed. The cutting, over 40 cm deep, is seen in the E baulk exactly at the boundary between trenches Nu 1 and Nu 2, as is seen in fig. 1.55, at right. Its escarpment is also indicated, with some degree of conjecture except at the E baulk, in section in figs. 1.58-1.59 and in plan on figs. 1.61-1.62. The date of this terracing is proved by the section, fig. 1.55. The latest stratum into which the terrace was cut was the MH III Late destruction level above this floor (stratum 11). Moreover, a sloping MH III/LH I fill mixed with MH I- II sherds (stratum 10) formed the lowest level in the cutting, underlying a LH I Early floor. Thus this terrace was created by the builders of the MH III/LH I Structure Nu II, in preparation for its construction.129 [The floor is dated to MH III/LH I, and it must have been a temporary surface created during the cutting of the terrace for the building of Structure Nu IL At the same time the MH III walls dd, nu, nw and nx, and perhaps too parts of wall ng and the w end of the MH II wall nv, were robbed to provide stone for the builders. In addition, what appeared to be a robber trench for wall nx cut a surface that lay to the E of it: see fig. 1.56, at left. This surface, with plentiful pottery, bone and shell, sloped gently downwards from N to s. It passed over the MH II wall nv and its associated floors (fig. 1.55, at right).] In Area Nu 1 , a solidly built wall nf, with a n-s axis, appeared to the w of the later wall na and adjacent to it, but at a level 15 cm further down (fig. 1.61). Wall nf ran n-s for the whole length of trench Nu 1; it appeared to be a continuation of wall da, which had been found in 1959 in Gamma 1 to the N and was at about the same level. When in 1974 the Nu / Gamma 1 baulk was taken down, the top stones of wall nf appeared immediately below the Medieval strata, and it became clear that wall nf was indeed the same as wall da. In Gamma 1 the wall stood at a higher level than its continuation in the s. It was later verified that, because of the slope of the ground downwards from N to s, wall nf was built on a lower terrace. When in trench Nu 1 the two uppermost courses of wall nf were removed, it was found to have no rubble core. The pottery was datable to the Transitional Period MH III/LH I. 129 So Rutter and Rutter 1976, 20.</page><page sequence="132">THE BRONZE AGE ARCHITECTURE AND STRATIGRAPHY §8 105 Q. B. Rutter noted that wall nf stepped downwards over the underlying MH I wall nh; there was some difference in the levels of the preserved top of wall nf at its N and s ends (see the sections, figs. 1.58-1.59). This impressive wall continued southwards across Nu 2, although the upper courses of its s end were robbed out when burial 12 was interred.130 Nevertheless, the wall continued onwards and is seen in section in the extreme s of the Area in fig. 1.56; perhaps it formed the E boundary of a street. This continuation is marked with dotted lines on fig. 1.61.] Just s of the NW corner of Nu 1 the squared end of an impressive wall, wall ny, was revealed, flush with the w baulk (figs. 1.57 and 1.61 with plate 14 a). It was preserved to a height of five courses. Its position and elevation suggests that it was the w jamb of a doorway or a gateway that lay between itself and the w face of wall nf. [The width of the opening was 1 m.] Other walls in trench Nu 1 emerging at slightly lower levels were called walls nc, nd and ne. Wall nc ran n-s in the e part of the trench and parallel to wall nf. It began at the n end of Nu 1 and was later found to continue further s, where it was called nk. Wall nd had an e-w axis. Wall ne ran parallel to wall nd to the n. Both walls abutted wall nf in the w; wall nd abutted wall nc/nk in the e. From the interrelationship of these walls the plan of a house took shape. Pottery associated with the house places its construction in the Transitional Period MH III/LH I. The house consisted of two rooms divided from one another by wall nd. Copious evidence of mudbrick was found in the levels above both rooms. Room 1 is to the N and Room 2 to the s. [This building is Structure Nu II (fig. 1.61 and plates 13 c, 14 a-d). Erected in MH III/LH I, it went out of use in LH I Early. Details of its walls are given in table 1.58.] The rest of Structure Nu II was uncovered in 1974 in excavating trench Nu 2, and its complete plan was thus revealed. Wall nd was not uniform in construction. The w and E portions of the wall were on slightly different alignments. Wall nd (e) made a good right angle with wall nc, and both were well built. At its w end wall nd (e) appeared to run under wall nd (w). The latter wall was perpendicular to wall nf and lay at a distinctly higher level; its E end finished abruptly c. 60 cm E of wall nf. Both wall nf and wall nd (w) were less well built than walls nc and nd (e). The existence of a mudbrick superstructure to the walls was demonstrated by mudbrick patches in the soil during excavation. The s extension of wall nc into trench Nu 2 was called wall nk, as at first it was thought to be a different wall. Its neat construction and well-defined outline were far superior to the rough walling of wall nc, but what had been uncovered of the latter could be regarded as the socle supporting the main wall proper. It should be mentioned, however, that there was earth between walls ne (s) and nk, that the two walls did not line up exactly, and that wall nk leant over to the w. [Perhaps this was caused by subsidence after the cutting of the shaft grave burial 13.] Walls nc and nk were built in a narrow prepared trench below the floor level to either side. The s end of wall nk was joined at right angles by another well-built wall, wall nm, that issued from the E baulk of trench Nu 2 and bonded with wall nk (see plate 13 a, c). In the axis of wall nm there was a stump of a wall on the w flank of wall nk, making a right angle with it. Moreover, the s end of wall nf turned to the e, ending in a short wall. It appeared that between these two short walls there was once a wall forming the s limit of the house, which had been removed. The outline of its missing portion is shown with dotted lines on fig. 1.61. Its former existence was confirmed by the discovery in 1977 of the shaft grave, Nu burial 13, the width of whose shaft corresponds to that the missing length of wall nm; the cutting for the burial must have destroyed this piece of the wall.131 In Room 2, just s of wall nd, a rough rectangular foundation of small stones, on a level corresponding to walls nc and nd (e), was interpreted as a hearth (fig. 1.61 and plates 13 c, 14 a-c. Some of its stones showed marked signs of burning, and charcoal patches were noted at a level slightly above the hearth but to the e of it extending as far as wall nc. During digging in the centre of Nu 2, a stone bench, wall no, was revealed. The bench was built against the e face of wall nf (fig. 1.61 and plate 14 a-d). It was 1.65 m long and 35 to 40 cm wide. Its s end coincided with the return to the E of wall nf, i.e. the w end of wall nm. [Thus it was constructed in the sw corner of Room 2 while this room was closed to the s by wall nm, before most of the latter wall was destroyed by the cutting for the shaft grave, Nu burial 13. Since it contained some LH I sherds, it was an addition to the original plan.] At the ne corner of the bench, just s of the hearth, the painted kantharos R297 was uncovered (fig. 1.61 and plate 14 c-d). The vase lay upside-down on a layer of charcoal, parts of which were found inside the cup, which was badly burnt. Its position established the level of the floor of Room 2, where it of was not cut by the later shaft grave burial 13. The small handmade kantharos R514 was found just e of the hearth. The burning and charcoal, first noted in 1973 to the E of the hearth, was widespread 130 See §8 (iii) above. 131 On the shaft grave see §8 (iv) above and Chapter 2 §7 below.</page><page sequence="133">lo6 W.

The pottery from this floor in Room 2 and from the contemporary living surface s of the building, extending to the limits of trench Nu 2 to the s and se, was regarded as MH III/LH I in date, but C. Zerner dates it to LH I Early, on the basis of the LH I pieces R428 and R461-462; pieces R249 and R284 may be LH I/IIA, but these were probably introduced by the intrusive LH I/IIA shaft grave burial 13. This material is published as Deposit L (figs. 1.55-1.56, 1.59).

[These were found among the sherds from between c. -1.0 and -1.2 BM. Their approximate find spots are marked on fig. 1.61. The remains of these pots were perhaps protected by being under the LH I/IIA wall na. The floor itself seems to have been at a lower level, viz. c. -1.47 BM. Since these vessels lay above the level of the floor at the time of the destruction of Structure Nu II, they may have been on the roof when the building collapsed; there is no sign of burning. The MH III/LH I pottery found under wall na is published as Deposit M. The plentiful sherds could have been used as bedding for the wall;133 one may compare the large quantity of pottery from the foundation trench for wall nf. The obsidian core 6122 was found with these sherds, indicating the manufacture of stone tools. For a section through Room 1, showing wall ne in elevation, see fig. 1.58.] In the Nu / Gamma 1 baulk, w of wall nf, below the thin LH IIA level whose pottery was published as Deposit P, was a stratum containing Deposit K (fig. 1.57). The sherds were held to comprise some LH IIA pieces but mostly MH III/LH I; however, C. Zerner now believes that they are LH I Early to LH IIA. Under this fill lay a LH I Early floor (see fig. 1.61) on which were uncovered the base and lower body of the coarse vessel 2309a, lying upside down. This floor was contemporary with the use of Structure Nu II to its E, but it lay at the same level as the MH III Late floor associated with wall ng (see fig. 1.61). Its level was the same as that of the MH III Late floor because Structure Nu II rested on a terrace that had been cut down by 50 cm into the destruction levels of the building involving wall ng (see the sections, figs. 1.55 and 1.58, the plan, fig. 1.61, and plates 14 b and 15 b). [The same LH I Early surface was found at a slightly deeper location in trench Nu 1 to the s; the pottery from there is published as Deposit H. Deposits H and K are indicated in section in fig. 1.57. The same floor was uncovered in trench Nu 2 w of wall nf, at almost the same level as the one in Room 2 (see fig. 1.56, at right, between strata 7 and 10). Two or possibly four shallow stake holes had been cut into it; their exact locations are not recorded.] The base of the crude pot 2313a was uncovered E of the MH III/LH I building. The pots and small finds from this phase of occupation are shown on fig. 1.61 and listed in table 1.59. Other vases came to light during the excavation of Nu 1 in 1973 that were stratified under the occupation levels of the house. Four vessels were uncovered to the w of wall nf from the foundation- trench for that wall: R243, R246-247 and R412. These comprise ajar, two kantharoi and a lug- handled bowl. In 1974 more pottery was excavated from the continuation of this trench in the Nu/ Gamma 1 baulk. Upon the removal of wall nf in 1977, it became possible to clear the remaining fill of the trench. [This trench was c. 60 cm wide to the n in the Nu/Gamma 1 baulk, broadening to c. 1.2 m in trench Nu 1 but then narrowing again to c. 30 cm in trench Nu 2 to the s.134 It contained a surprising number of finds, which are listed in table 1.60. It was sealed by the surface of LH I Early date, and it cut the MH III Late Upper Pebbled Road (fig. 1.58, at left).135 Rutter rightly dated the material from this fill to MH III/LH I. The pottery excavated in 1973 is published as Deposit G; however, some pieces that belonged with Deposit G were dug as part of the overlying Deposit H,' which is LH I Early. The sherds recovered in 1974 are published as Deposit J, while those found in 1977 (baskets 13 and 22) are published below among 2001-2204 and 3598-3637. These Deposits are shown in the sections, figs. 1.57-1.58.] There seem to be no burials of this period. (vi) Middle Helladic III Late Underneath Structure Nu II walls of the previous periods came to light, but it was not easy to make any intelligible plan out of them. [Walls dd, ng, nu, nw, nx and oa belong to MH III, as well as two streets, the Upper and Lower Pebbled Roads, which lay underneath the Upper Pebbled Road for its whole length. In studying the pottery from this Area, C. Zerner has been able to distinguish two phases of MH III, with the earlier corresponding to MM IIIA and the later to MM IIIB. There were three phases of construction, MH III Late, MH III Early and an earliest phase, which seems to have belonged to the transition between MH II and MH III Early. The MH III Late phase will be discussed first. [The only walls known to have been in use during this phase are the MH III Early walls ng and nx. However, two strata have been recognized as pure MH III Late in ceramic terms: these are the Upper Pebbled Road and a surface to the e at a higher level.] The layer of pebbles called the Upper Pebbled Road ran n-s across the w edge of the s half of the Area. It varied considerably in width. In the centre of the Area it was as much as 1.20 m 133 Rutter and Rutter 1076, 21. 134 Rutter and Rutter 1976, 20-1. 135 See §8 (vi) below.</page><page sequence="135">io8 W. D. TAYLOURf AND R. JANKO wide; further s, where the slope was pronounced, the uncovered part of it was 42 to 68 cm wide, and at the s end it was c. 85 cm wide. At the s it could very well have linked up with the E-w cobbled road that skirted the n flank of Area Beta, of which a further stretch was uncovered in 1977, namely Street Beta II (see figs. 1.31-1. 32). 136 [In trench Nu 1 the foundation trench of wall nf had cut away the E part of the road: see the section, fig. 1.58. The road was also traced in the Nu / Gamma 1 baulk, as the requisite depth was just reached, and reappeared to the N in trench Gamma 1 of 1959. Here it lay at a depth of c. -1.1 to 1.2 BM to the w of wall nf, where it was cut by the foundation trench of that wall. The stratum in trench Gamma 1 contained sherds of Yellow Minyan, a ware introduced in MH III Late. According to R. Hope Simpson, a stratum that seemed identical was found at the same depth to the E of wall nf; this soft orange layer of small stones c. 20 cm deep lay directly over the MH I apsidal wall de (see fig. 1.63). If so, the Upper Pebbled Road either turned to the E at this point or continued n and was joined by another road coming from the e; in either case, the road seems to have overlaid the w and N sides of the ruins of the apsidal building Structure Nu I (fig. 1.63), which must have formed a mound consisting of very hard earth that would have been difficult to remove with Bronze Age tools, as J. B. Rutter noted. The unusual Minoan male figurine 7092, tentatively dated to MM III, was found c. 5 cm below the base of the road, in a hard orange fill that contained a sherd with ripple pattern; this too dates from MH III Late.137 Its find spot is shown on fig. 1.62. [The sherd material from the Upper Pebbled Road (1977 basket 30) is dated to MH III Late (fig. 1.56 stratum 12). Only two pre-existing walls, the MH III Early walls ng and nx, seem to have remained in use during MH III Late.138 Any other walls that existed would have been destroyed during the construction of the MH III/LH I Structure Nu II. However, a pale brown destruction level of this date, flecked with reddish yellow fragments of mudbrick, survived over a MH III Late floor in the ne part of the Area. This fill yielded Deposit E of pottery.] Deposit E produced several finds. The coarse dipper R168, all but complete, was found against the sw face of wall ng. Together with the dipper was the greenstone pounder 6109. [For their locations see fig. 1.62 and plate 15 c. These MH III Late finds were on the floor when the building incorporating wall ng was destroyed, as the section shows (fig. 1.55 stratum 11, also in fig. 1.59 stratum 10). The destruction layer ran over the stump of wall ng and continued southwards until it was cut by the MH III/LH I terracing that was done as preparation for the erection of Structure Nu II (see fig. 1.55 stratum 11). Some material from this fill is also published within Deposit F. It lay under the LH I/IIA Deposit N, and over an earlier floor, dated to MH III Early, which was also associated with wall ng. [Further s but still to the E of the Upper Pebbled Road a layer of similar appearance was found (fig. 1.59 stratum 9). This layer probably once contained the MH III Late jar 2125, crucible-fragments 6062 and 6064, and phyllite disc 6118. However, these objects were built into the walls and chamber of the LH I/IIA shaft grave burial 13. If they lay on a floor of this date, it perished completely in the cutting for this grave. The crucible-fragments show that tin-bronze was worked hereabouts. The recovery of pieces of metallurgical residue (6067-6068) from the foundation trench for the MH III/ LH I wall nf suggests that other material from this same destruction layer, including pottery and other finds, was dumped into the foundations of the latter wall. However, the recovery of a piece of melted bronze from the Lower Pebbled Road (6069) means that the evidence for metallurgy might belong to MH III Early; indeed, the fact that parts of the MH III Early vase 1933 were found in the foundation trench as well as in the MH III Early fill under the Upper Pebbled Road shows that this trench also contained at least some MH III Early material. Hence the objects from it range in date from MH III Early to MH III/LH I. They are listed in table 1.60. Other finds probably or certainly from MH III Late contexts are listed in table 1.61.] (vii) Middle Helladic III Early (Period II Rutter) [Walls dd and nu were built during MH III Early, since they lay below the Upper Pebbled Road but above the Lower Pebbled Road. As these walls are poorly built and make no coherent plan, they may perhaps have been pens for animals. In addition, the parallel walls ng and nx probably delimited wall a roughly rectangular building or yard of which the se wall has not been found, but bounded by wall nw to the w; all three must have been built during the same phase, as will be shown presently. However, the survival of a MH III Late floor also associated with wall ng indicates that these walls 136 The cobbled street at the S end of Beta 12A (Taylour 1972, 256 with 231 fig. 15 and pl. 46h) is unrelated, since this was LH IIIC Early or even Medieval. 137 For this datine criterion see Chapter 5 §2 (iv) (a) below. 138 These are described in §8 (vii) below.</page><page sequence="136">THE BRONZE AGE ARCHITECTURE AND STRATIGRAPHY §8 109 continued in use into MH III Late.139 The walls and floors of this phase are shown in plan in fig. 1.62, and their details are given in table 1.62.] In the N end of the Area, wall dd ran nne-ssw in trench Gamma 1, dug in 1959, for 1.5 m just w of the line of the MH III/LH I wall nf, slightly off-axis in relation to it and just under its base at the N. It lay below the N continuation of the MH III Late Upper Pebbled Road; the base of a jar, which was not kept, lay on top of it. The wall emerged among fallen stones and hard reddish debris, which was no doubt decayed mudbrick. It seemed to peter out exactly at the s baulk of Gamma 1: see fig. 1.62 and plate 15 d. Tumbled stones from its s end were excavated in 1977 in the nw corner of the Nu/ Gamma 1 baulk; these contained the MH III-LH I sherd 2087. The wall was irregularly constructed of large stones, and varied from 40 to 60 cm in width. It was not removed. [It was probably robbed to build the MH III/LH I wall nf. [The remarkable terracotta drain-tiles HS 91 of Minoan type were found with the channel-side uppermost in the fill under the Upper Pebbled Road just to the w of wall dd and an elevation of c. 1.25 m below the surface (plate 15 d).uo After some 30 cm of this soft orange fill, containing Dark Burnished and Dull Painted sherds, a stone floor was reached w of wall dd, which presumably went with the wall. Since the floor yielded a piece with ripple-pattern, presumably in Lustrous Decorated ware, this level was MH III Late. A further 10 cm below this floor, under earth that yielded another sherd with ripple-pattern, lay a cobbled surface, a continuation of the MH II/III Early Lower Pebbled Road to the s; this was not removed. Hence the two levels of the Upper and Lower Pebbled Roads, which are seen in section in the extreme s of the Area in fig. 1.56 and further n in fig. 1.57, were both present in trench Gamma 1 in its far n, with wall dd stratified between them. In this case, the wall was both built and demolished during the MH III Early phase of construction. Excavation ceased at c. -1.56 BM. This was almost level with the base of wall dd; however, as the wall was never taken down, the depth of its base is not entirely certain. The top of wall dd was some 25 cm above that of the MH I wall de, the n wall of the apsidal building,141 and its lowest visible course was some 30 cm above the MH I floor level] To the s, wall nu, found in 1977 in the sw corner of trench Nu 1, consisted of one course with a NNW-SSE axis, which issued from the w baulk for a distance of c. 1.5 m and then petered out. It was as much as 80 cm wide. Its sse end consisted of a few stones and indicated that it had been robbed, as is shown with dotted lines in fig. 1.62. Since the robber trench of wall nu contained the MH III/LH I sherd 2107, it must have been plundered for the construction of wall nf. Wall nu lay under the layer of pebbles, i.e. the remains of the Upper Pebbled Road running n-s, and wall nu itself was laid on a pebble layer, i.e. the Lower Pebbled Road with the same axis. The two layers of pebbles were only separated by c. 5-10 cm of fill at this point. [See fig. 1.57. When wall nu was removed, it was found to contain the MH III Early sherd 2108.] Wall nu had a very different axis and width from wall dd, and the two seem not to be related in plan. [However, it too lay over the Lower Pebbled Road and under the Upper Pebbled Road, although by the w baulk part of its stump projected c. 20 cm above the surface of the upper road (see fig. 1.57). It follows that both walls were built and demolished during MH III Early, when the original road was brought back into use.] In the Nu / Gamma 1 baulk to the e of the line of the MH III/LH I wall nf, another wall, wall ng with a WNW-ESE axis, started to take shape (see the plan, fig. 1.62, and sections, figs. 1.55 and 1.58). It was of poor construction, perhaps because some of its stones were used in the construction of the MH III/LH I building directly to the s, Structure Nu II, and it was of two courses at the most. Wall ng had no relation to Structure Nu II. Not only was wall ng ill built, but it was also on a completely different alignment. When wall ng was removed, the sherds in it were apparently found to be of MH II/III Early date, and the pottery on the floor associated with it was MH III Early. [The MH III Early pottery from the floor n of wall ng, stratified below the MH III Late Deposit E, was published as Deposit D; this Deposit is indicated in the section, fig. 1.55, at left. A grain of barley and a grape pip, 9282 and 9287, were also recovered from Deposit D.] To the s of wall ng, three vases were found in 1973 in trench Nu 1 to the e of the MH III/LH I wall nc (see fig. 1.61) on what appeared to have been a floor level in that sector; these are the two Dark Burnished goblets R62-63 and the medium coarse Lustrous Decorated amphora 2280. [These vases could be either MH II or MH III Early, but they probably came from a surface visible in the E baulk (fig. 1.55, stratum 12) that can be assigned to the latter date. Unfortunately their exact find spots are 139 See §8 (vi) above. 140 Taylour 1972, 230, 252 with 230 fig. 14 and pl. 47I1-Ì. 141 See §8 (x) below.</page><page sequence="137">110 W. D. TAYLOURt AND R.

They came from Deposit F, the elevation of which is marked in the section, fig. 1.55, at centre right. However, Deposit F includes sherds from the MH II fill beneath the MH III Early floor, sherds from the floor itself, some MH III Late material and some MH III/LH I and LH I material from the overlying levels.

[The surface s of wall ng and associated with it is best seen in the section, fig. 1.55 stratum 12.

The MH 142 Rutter and Rutter 1976, 20.</page><page sequence="138">THE BRONZE AGE ARCHITECTURE AND STRATIGRAPHY §8 ill III Early kantharos 2007 was found immediately under the lowest course of the MH III/LH I wall nm NW of the MH II wall nv (fig. 1.61). The find spot of this kantharos is marked on fig. 1.62. J. B. Rutter suggested that this pottery survived in this location because wall nm was built directly over it (see the section, fig. 1.55, stratum 9, at right); the vessel must be a remnant of a MH III Early floor associated with wall nx that was disturbed when the cutting for Structure Nu II was made. Otherwise this stratum contained mostly MH III/LH I sherds, since it was disturbed by the cutting for Structure Nu IL Another part of the MH III Early surface survived in the centre of the Area; it was represented by Deposit C, excavated at an elevation of -1.5 to -1.65 BM within the area of the MH III/LH I Room 1, and by 1977 basket 31, excavated at a depth of c. -1.70 to -1.75 BM under the hearth in the MH III/LH I Room 2 (see fig. 1.59 stratum 11). This surface lay to the E of wall nf, w and NW of the LH I shaft grave, and above the hard yellow MH II fill on which wall ng was built (fig. 1.62). The elevation of these layers, which were 10-20 cm lower than that of the floor s of wall ng, shows that the surface sloped down more steeply to the w than it did to the s. The MH III/LH I terracing and the cutting of the LH I/IIA shaft grave, Nu burial 13, removed the rest of this surface in trenches Nu 1 and Nu 2, as is shown in fig. 1.62; it spared only those small parts of it that lay immediately sw of wall ng and due s of it along the E baulk. Pottery of MH III Early is published among 1908-2000 below.] Wall nx was built of medium-sized calcareous fieldstones on an ese-wsw axis. It issued from the s baulk for a distance of c. 1.5 m before it came to a halt at the sw corner of the surround to the shaft grave, Nu burial 13. It was only one stone thick, but had a good N face. The w end of the wall seems to have been cut by the construction of the MH III/LH I wall nf. [This end of the wall ran over the MH II/III Early lower terrace wall oa seen in fig. 1.56 at centre, where three to four rough shallow courses of it survived. Wall nx bonded with the s end of the upper terrace wall nw, although this did not lie at a right angle to it; the two walls were evidently contemporary. Wall nx ran parallel to wall ng and presumably formed part of the same structure, built in MH III Early and destroyed during MH III Late. Both walls are on the same alignment as Structure Lambda I in Area Lambda 3/4 to the E, which is presumably also MH III Early.143 Wall nx was not removed. Wall nw, with approximately n-s axis, lay to the w of the cutting for the later shaft grave, Nu burial 13, and shared some stones with the w wall of the stone surround over it, wall ns. The wall was poorly preserved because it had largely been dismantled when wall nf was built in MH III/LH I. [Wall nw, originally called wall nw(II), ran slightly to the E of the line of wall nf. It issued from the s baulk of trench Nu 2, where it was c. 50 cm wide. It then ran nnw for c. 1.4 m, where it had widened to c. 70 cm (see fig. 1.62). Its uppermost surviving course lay at -1.65 BM at the s and at -1.85 BM at the ne; it apparently ended against the sharp rise in the ground formed by the ruins of the MH I apsidal building. Its base sloped down markedly from n to s. The wall was largely robbed out in MH III/LH I except for a number of medium-to-large stones. It had a good e face, but its w face was demolished during the construction of wall nf. Its e side was further damaged by the construction of the LH I/IIA shaft grave; towards the N, the w wall of the grave, wall ns, penetrated the fill of the robbing trench of the latter. The e edge of this robbing trench ran along the E face of wall nw at the s baulk but some 15 cm to the e of it near its n end, where it cut the MH I wall nh; here only the robbing trench survived. Wall nw contained only sherds dated to MH I- II, but two facts prove that it is MH III Early. First it overlay wall oa, which bordered the MH II/III Early Lower Pebbled Road. Moreover, it bonded with wall nx. It functioned as a retaining wall that held back the higher strata to the E. The steep gradient in the s of the Area required the building of this wall, whereas the gentler incline in the N meant that no retaining wall was needed in that sector. The pottery and small finds from the MH III Early levels are listed in table 1.63. No burials of this period were found.] (viii) Middle Helladic II/III Early (Period II Rutter) [We shall now turn to the architectural phase stratified between MH II proper and MH III Early. The terrace wall oa and the Lower Pebbled Road associated with it belong to this phase.] A wall oa ran n-s, passing into the s baulk of trench Nu 2, where it is visible in section in fig 1 56 [Wall oa lay under the MH III Early walls nx and nw. As it was not cleared, only its w face was exposed and its length is unknown. This wall appears to have served to separate the higher levels to the E from the lower ground to the w, where the Lower Pebbled Road was laid some 20 cm below the wall, m accord with the natural e-w slope of the ground, as can be seen in fig. 1.56. If this is correct, 143 See §7 (iii) above.</page><page sequence="139">112 W. D. TAYLOURt AND R. JANKO the construction of the wall was associated with the laying of the road in MH II/III Early and would therefore have been contemporary with it. Just in front of its w face, i .04 m from the s baulk and with its top at an elevation of -2.3 BM, there was a post-hole 13 cm in diameter and at least 25 cm deep, perhaps for a gate or fence installed after the wall was built.] The Lower Pebbled Road, shown in plan in fig. 1.62 and in section in figs. 1.56-1.58, ran steeply uphill, like its successor the Upper Pebbled Road, from the s baulk on a N-s axis along the w edge of the Area; it also sloped up from w to E. It would, according to the excavator, have been delimited by the possible terrace wall described above. A number of objects were discarded or lost in the surfaces of this road; these are included in table 1.63. [The sherds in the fill under the Upper Pebbled Road (1977 basket 34) and over its predecessor are MH III Early, together with a little LH I, the presence of which is unexplained. The sherds found in the upper stratum of the Lower Pebbled Road itself, i.e. in basket 43 of 1977, are published among items 1908-2000 below; they are MH III Early. However, the construction of this road should have been slightly earlier, i.e. in MH II/III Early. A similar stratum was found in the sounding in trench Nu 1 of 1974, where it lay directly over the MH I wall nh. The pottery found in it suggests that this stratum represented the Lower Pebbled Road rather than its MH III Late successor, which would have lain only a few centimetres above: the date depends on the fact that dark-on-light decoration predominated, and there were no Yellow Minyan or Matt Painted sherds. Only the later road was traced in the Nu / Gamma 1 baulk, but the earlier road reappeared in trench Gamma 1 to the w of wall dd; this is the cobbled surface mentioned in the previous section. Going from N to s, the road must have risen slightly to surmount a hump caused by the ruin of the MH I apsidal building Structure Nu I and then sloped down so that it was almost a metre lower when it reached the s baulk. Like the Upper Pebbled Road, this earlier surface seems to have branched off to the E in the n part of trench Gamma 1. The pottery and small finds from MH II/III Early levels are included in table 1.63. The presence of a piece of melted bronze (6069) shows that metal-working went on during this period too. There seem to be no burials of this phase.] (ix) Middle Helladic II (Period I Rutter) [The remains of the preceding phase, which is dated to MH II, are meagre.] In the se corner of the Area, wall nv was seen to issue from the E baulk of trench Nu 2 with an E-w axis for a distance of c. 80 cm before being cut at its w end by the great pit sunk for the construction of the shaft grave, Nu burial 13. At this point its base was visible in the side of the pit at -2.20 BM. [For the details of this wall see table 1.64. Associated floor levels were found both n and s of wall nv (figs. 1.55 stratum 14 and 1.56 stratum 15). The pottery on that to the N was pure MH II, whereas that to the s was mixed with later material. The MH II pottery from these floors is published below as 1909-1911, 1917, 1924, 1931, 1938. X944, 1950, 1962, 1&amp;9-19I0, !975&gt; !979&gt; i^-^1 and 1996-1999. Excavation ceased when these surfaces had been reached. [During MH I Late, the n part of Area Nu / Gamma 1 had been occupied by a large apsidal building, Structure Nu I (fig. 1.63). The destruction levels of this building lay under a relatively sterile, extremely hard stratum of brownish-yellow fill, which in turn lay below the MH III Early building that included wall ng. This fill presumably derived from the burned mudbrick of its superstructure; it was so hard that the successive MH III Lower and Upper Pebbled Roads skirted the building, as was suggested above.144 The pottery found in this stratum in trench Nu/Gamma 1 is published as Deposits B and A under it.145 These Deposits are marked in the section, fig. 1.55 at left, and which shows that they post-dated the apsidal building. Stratified between those of MH I Late and those of MH III Early, they are datable to MH II. The pottery and small finds from MH II contexts are listed in table 1.65.] In the NW corner of the main room of the apsidal building a cist tomb, Nu burial 14, came to light (fig. 1.63). Those who constructed this tomb appear to have been aware of the architecture of the building, and the inhumation may have taken place shortly after its destruction; its date is MH II. [It contained the MH II vase 1888. On this burial see below.146] (x) Middle Helladic I Late In 1Q74 a sounding was made to test for earlier levels in trench Nu 1 to the w of the MH III/LH I house, Structure Nu II, and due s of the Nu/Gamma 1 baulk. The breadth of the sounding was 144 See §8 (vi). 145 Rutter and Rutter 1976, 16, 19. 146 Chapter 2 §7.</page><page sequence="140">THE BRONZE AGE ARCHITECTURE AND STRATIGRAPHY §8 113 Fig. 1.63. Area Nu/Gamma 1. Plan of Structure Nu I (MH I Late), showing debris above floor, MH II burial 14 and location of sections (figs. 1.55-1.59 and 1.64). determined by the w baulk of the trench and the w face of wall nf: it measured c. 1 m wide. The length of the sounding was c. 1.5 m. A new wall was revealed, wall nh with N-s axis, with a floor to the E (plates 16 a-b, d and 17 c). The wall lay directly under the MH II/III Early Lower Pebbled Road (see fig. 1.62). [This wall turned out to be the w end of the apsidal building described below. Part of the N side of this same horseshoe-shaped wall had already been revealed in trench Gamma 1 of 1959, when it was called de.] The full excavation of the MH I levels was undertaken in 1977. After the MH III/LH I walls had been demolished, with the MH III Early wall ng having already been removed in 1974, the plan of the end of the large apsidal building, Structure Nu I, was laid bare in the n part of the Area; for a plan which shows its destruction debris see fig. 1.63. From the complete pots found in it, this building is dated to MH I Late. [This building also yielded a number of radiocarbon dates, most of which are</page><page sequence="141">114 w- D- TAYLOURt AND R. JANKO very early but one of which provides a plausible terminus post quern for its erection.147 Its se corner lay directly under layers dated to MH III/LH I, because the intervening levels had been terraced away.148 The intermediate layers survived intact over the rest of the building, but outside it they remained only at the E, s and w edges of the Area. Moreover, the insertion of the LH I/IIA shaft grave, Nu burial 13, not only cut the line of red mud-plaster that ran along the interior face of the s wall of Structure Nu I at a depth of -1.77 to -1.90 BM, but also the narrow footing trench that ran outside its exterior. The grave pit removed the upper 80 cm of the stone socle of the exterior face of its s wall and reached the large stones that formed the foundations: see the section, fig. 1.59 at bottom centre, and the plan, fig. 1.63. The apparent difference between the construction of this stretch of wall and that of the remainder is owed merely to this intrusion, which revealed the lowest courses that were otherwise invisible. However, the interior of the building was entirely sealed by undisturbed destruction debris, except where the MH II burial 14 was cut into it.] On the floor of the main room there was plentiful evidence of destruction, seen in plates 16 c and 1 7 a: fallen burnt mudbrick, some of which had scraps of thin plaster attached to it, burnt unidentifiable patches of material, chunks of coloured pise ras much as 1 1 cm thick, mud-plaster with reed impressions that were obviously part of the roofing (plate 17 a), and a number of pieces of fallen piaster. Much of the pottery showed signs of burning, and there was other evidence of this nature throughout the building. The debris in the main room is shown in plan in fig. 1.63 and in section in fig. 1.58 and in more detail, along the line marked F-F on fig. 1.63, in fig. 1.64. A peculiar feature of the debris was the presence of three narrow elliptical pits, Pits A-C, with roughly N-s axis that contained nothing that could be recognised as of any significance. These were situated roughly in the central part of the room. [They probably represented the decay of cross-beams from the roof, which had not been completely consumed by the fire that destroyed the building. A further pit at a higher level, Pit D, was at the same time thought to contain some nondescript sherds, but one suspects that these were in fact clay roofing material. The floor of soft, white earth was usually covered by black burnt material, covered in turn by mudbrick debris. In the s part of the main room this debris was overlaid by at least eight coloured patches with two or more straight sides (fig. 1.63). These patches were coloured pale brown, grey to grey-black, or whitish. Their tops were at progressively lower levels as one went eastwards from the partition wall nz, lying at -1.77, -1.72, -1.73 and -1.72 m BM to the w, and at -1.87, -1.92, -1.90 and -1.97 to the e. None lay N of Pit D. They yielded numerous pebbles which were probably used to hold thatch in place.] Wall de, part of which had been uncovered in Gamma 1 of 1959,149 turned out to have been a portion of the apsidal wall itself. Its continuation southwards, wall nh, had been recognised in the sounding of 1974. In this sector the width of the wall varied between 55 and 65 cm. Its exposed surface showed two rows of small stones along the faces, with a fill of small stones and earth in the middle. The sounding gave the impression that the axis of the building would be N-s, but further excavation in 1977 showed that wall nh curved round into an ese to wnw direction and that this was the true axis of the building (see plate 16 ¿, d). Its internal width was c. 4.5 m and its exposed length c. 5 m. Along the s side, where it was best preserved, the wall averaged 50 cm in width and stood about a metre high. In this sector the top surface consisted of a double row of small stones, with smaller stones used as a fill in the centre. The lower courses were constructed of much larger stones, as is visible in the s wall in fig. 1.63, where the lower courses were exposed by the cutting for Nu burial 13. The rubble socle appeared to have survived to its original height. It would have borne a mudbrick superstructure, to judge by the amount of debris of that nature scattered over the floor of the building. In places pisé may have been used, however, as was done in the case of the partition wall; in one stretch of the outer wall a small amount of pisé above it seemed to have been preserved. Mud-plaster, 5 cm thick, was found on the s stretch of wall nh but not on wall de in the n. However, something like it appeared in the destruction debris over the floor 25 to 40 cm s of wall de, and it is quite likely that the walls of both rooms were similarly plastered. A partition wall, wall nz, divided the building into two unequal parts (figs. 1.65-1.66). This wall was situated at the points where the straight sides of the building merged into the curve of the apse. Consequently, the greatest depth in the apse was barely 1.3 m, whereas its maximum width was 4.5 m. Wall nz was not fully exposed in excavation on the w side, and the n end had been disturbed and partly damaged by the adult cist grave, Nu burial 14, as is shown in fig. 1.63. But it would appear to have had a low stone socle of c. 25 to 35 cm in height, made up of small and medium stones at the 147 See Appendix g §3. 148 See §8 (v) above. 149 Taylour 1972, 230 fig. 14.</page><page sequence="142">THE BRONZE AGE ARCHITECTURE AND STRATIGRAPHY §8 115 lo CO LO ci LO o" LO 00" CO C/5 I &gt; O •8 co T3 "o tí O 1! to C£5 O T3 -G tí ^ C/3 hJ O H^ 'S II s .s5 Vi "o O 2 tí I I o cd Ü oí &lt; CID O ti 2 11 ^ iê3iiii?Hiieiiig CD CD O O lo n ^ J g U í % ìli - fr le S ^ ^3 CD Ö 2 .^ 00 »I ^^ cío o o^o ^ C r N O ^ O '3 t t ^ ^ g ^^ o 1 'Sd'S);3 •§)'§)'§)'§)'§) S fe ^s ^ ^^ C Oh^3 ^3 &gt;^^í ^=3 ^=3 A=3 ^=3 &gt; &gt; £ X¡ co - - - - ^</page><page sequence="143">ii6 W.

This socle supported a narrower wall oí pisé, the exact width of which could not be measured except at the doorway, where it was 40 cm wide. The wall, including its socle, was best preserved at the N end. Here its top was 3 1 cm above the floor of the apse, but as much as 70 cm above that of the main room. Further s the wall was preserved to a much lower height. A doorway was located roughly at its mid-point, but slightly nearer the N end than the s. It was 60 cm wide and 50 cm deep. The threshold was marked by a large patch of charcoal 2 to 3 cm thick that in part preserved the graining of the wood (sample P-2969), which ran N-s. This solid plank yielded a calibrated radiocarbon date of 1838 bc ±i38.150 Its ne and w surfaces had a thin coat of white plaster; this was also noted on the surviving traces of the N vertical face of the threshold, representing the N doorjamb, which was only preserved to a height of 15 cm. On the s doorjamb the white plaster was barely 5 cm high. The line of it was found to continue, after rounding the corner, onto the E face of the pisé wall, which is set back 5 to 10 cm from the edge of the stone socle. This suggests that the socle was c. 50 cm wide. There are traces in several places of white plaster covering the exposed upper surface of the socle and its E flank down to the floor. One must suppose that the entire E face of the partition was covered by this thin 'stucco' veneer less than 1 cm thick, which lay over red mud-plaster that in turn covered a revetment of small stones in its upper portion. However, there is no evidence for plastering in the apse itself. The threshold lay 16 to 20 cm above the apse floor, which rose slightly to meet it. On the E side the step-up from the main room was much higher: 33 cm. For details of the walls see table 1.66. Full excavation of the w face of the partition wall nz was impeded by the fact that a number of pots, several of them complete, were found close to the wall (see plate 17 a and for a plan fig. 1.66). The careful disengaging of them took up much time. A number of fragments of vases scattered over the floor of the apse, especially towards its edges, could be made up into complete pots, among them the exceptionally fine incised flask 1851. Eight vases were found in this confined space, which was obviously used as a storeroom. The fragments of several of them were found 10 to 20 cm above the floor, as if they had fallen from above, perhaps, as J. B. Rutter suggested, from shelves or pegs. Several isolated flat stones and inverted coarse pot bases above floor level could be interpreted as pot stands on which 150 This date accords well with a late chronology for M H I Late: see Appendix 9 §3.</page><page sequence="144">THE BRONZE AGE ARCHITECTURE AND STRATIGRAPHY §8 117 Fig. 1.66.

[There were two flasks, three cups, a jug, and two jars. The jar 1849 contained the bones of three or more eels (9218), which are very nutritious. There were also eight pierced cockle-shells (9256-9362, 9271), evidently the remains of a necklace. For a list of the finds see table 1.67.] Four or five water-worn pebbles were scattered among the debris in the apse. One was of grey marble. They were smooth and un worked, and it is possible that they were raw material intended for the manufacture of stone tools. [Alternatively, some or all of these stones could have served to hold down the thatch of the roof, as in the case of Unit IV- 1 at Dark Age Nichoria.151 Structure Nu I is likely to have resembled that building, which had a pitched roof with thatch over a ceiling of canna reeds and no upper storey.] 151 Coulson 1983, 31.</page><page sequence="145">ii8 W. D. TAYLOURt AND R. JANKO Of the main room, only the w part had been uncovered before the excavation ended. Two vases came from this sector. These were the spouted bowl i860 and the cooking pot 1901; much of the latter was found in the apse. Other finds provide some evidence of the activities carried out in the building; they include pins, a whorl, spools and fragments of at least one crucible. The sherds found in the building in 1977 are published among items 1828-1907 below, and those from the sounding of 1974 are published as Deposit A; this deposit, shown in section in fig. 1.55 at left, is proved by its depth to have come from the top of the destruction layer. [A deeper sounding was made in 1959 by R. Hope Simpson in trench Gamma 1, N of the apsidal wall de. Nearly all of the apsidal building, Structure Nu I, lay beneath the hard yellow stratum of MH II date. However, the stratigraphy just to the n of it was different. Here, a branch of the MH III Late Upper Pebbled Road ran E-w just above the elevation of the top of wall de and almost immediately to its n. Under this, the first 25 cm below that elevation consisted of a soft orange stratum with debris from a wall; this stratum contained MH III Late sherds and finds.152 Next there was a hard stony layer c. 10 cm thick; this may have been a branch of the Lower Pebbled Road running eastwards. The lowest stratum excavated consisted of a fill of soft orange earth c. 20 cm deep. Like the layer above it, this contained sherds with light-on-dark decoration as well as Dark Burnished and Dull Painted pieces; it was presumably MH II or MH I Late. The body of a large pithos over 1 m in diameter projected from the floor of the trench, as is shown in fig. 1.66 and plate 17 c. The MH I Late surface n of and contemporary with the apsidal building probably lay just beneath this fill, since excavation ceased at the same depth as the floor of the apse and only f. 15 cm above that of the floor of the main room. The sounding of 1974 w of wall nh went down c. 15 cm below the top of the wall by the w baulk, but the area excavated was so narrow that no sherds were recovered. The fill was similar to that on the floor inside the building. [Two further soundings to test for earlier levels were made in 1977 at the opposite side of Structure Nu I, to the s of wall nh. A MH I surface antedating the building was uncovered. The soundings also show that this area was covered in a deep layer of MH II fill, and that the building itself was constructed no earlier than MH I Late, only to be destroyed within the same phase. [Along the w side of trench Nu 2, in the area s of wall nh and w of the cutting for Nu burial 13, a light grey-brown stratum that sloped down from N to s lay under the MH II/III Early Lower Pebbled Road and the foundation trenches of walls nf and nw (see the plan, fig. 1.66, and two sections, fig. 1.56, where it is marked as stratum 16, and fig. 1.57, stratum 10). This fill was dug with basket 57, which was also used in the sw corner of trench Nu 1. Excavation in these sectors ceased at depths between -2.19 BM in the n and -2.53 BM to the s. The fill yielded the red-brown burnished lug- handled bowl 1856, the completeness of which suggested the presence of a floor. However, this unusual vase and the sherd 1857 are regarded by C. Zerner as earlier cast-ups, perhaps from a final phase of EH III (a possible parallel, 1925, is from a still later context). She notes that the rest of the pottery hardly differs from the MH I Late material found in Structure Nu I: other pieces from basket 57 are published as 1834, 1842, 1846, 1854, 1858, 1874-1875, 1877, 1883, 1885, 1887, 1891, 1897 and 1906 below. However, J. B. Rutter noted that there was more 'minoanising', i.e. Lustrous Decorated, ware than was found inside Structure Nu I. Hence he suggested that some of this pottery belongs to MH II, like Deposits A-B from the fill over the apsidal building. C. Zerner agrees that this is possible. [East of the area excavated with basket 57, in the sector of the pit for the shaft grave, Nu burial 13, a much greater depth was attained: see the section, fig. 1.59, and the plan, fig. 1.66. The n end of the pit had exposed a height of c. 90 cm of wall nh, which had a narrow foundation trench along its s face. Excavation began at a depth of -2.79 BM, using basket 58, in order to investigate a white layer exposed in the w baulk of the grave pit, which turned out to be merely a patch. The base of the pit had penetrated a compact stony reddish-brown fill, which was also cut by the foundation trench of wall nh. It follows that this fill antedated the construction of the apsidal building. The fill contained large pieces of bone and plentiful sherds, but hardly any shell. After a depth of c. 10 cm of it had been the removed, a beaten earth floor with flecks of carbon was exposed at depths between -2.83 BM in the N and -2.95 BM in the s. Since this floor was at the same level as the base of wall nh, one might have thought that it was associated with Structure Nu I, but the fact that the foundation trench of wall nh had been cut into the fill at a higher level proves that this floor existed before Structure Nu I was erected. However, the MH I pottery on it, which included sherds 1836, 1840 and 1871 as well as a few EH II, seemed to be of much the same date as the building. From the same basket came the 152 See §8 (vi) above.</page><page sequence="146">THE BRONZE AGE ARCHITECTURE AND STRATIGRAPHY §8 119 Minoan rounded cups 1878-1879 of MM IB/II style, showing that the end of MH I Late was contemporary with MM IB/II. The floor at its base was the earliest stratum reached in the entire Area; excavation ceased at this depth.] (xi) Early Helladic I-II Early [Early Helladic strata were almost reached in 1977 in trench Nu 2 s of the MH I apsidal building, Structure Nu I, where baskets 57 and 58 yielded a small amount of EH I-II material amongst later sherds. Charcoal on the floor exposed by basket 58 (sample P-2968) yielded a calibrated radiocarbon date of 2250 BC ± 650. If this floor, the earliest level reached in the whole Area, represented the ground surface contemporary with the first MH occupation, perhaps dating from the very end of EH III, the charcoal could derive from burning that occurred during EH II Early.153 EH pottery was also found to the N in 1959 in trench Gamma 1. The cast-up sherds from these sectors belong to EH II Early, since they included some 'slipped and burnished' pieces as well as Yellow Mottled ware but hardly any sherds with White or Yellow Slip, which is the ware that characterises EH II Late.154] 153 See Appendix 9 §2. 154 See Appendix 1 .</page><page sequence="147">Chapter 2 The Bronze Age burials W. D. Taylourt and R. Janko [Editor's note: W. D. Taylour drafted half of this Chapter. My additions, finalised in 2004, are in square brackets. As in the publication of the earlier excavations,1 each separate burial is assigned a number, and each Area has its own series of numbers, which run on across the several seasons: these replace the numbers used during the excavation. For example, what was called Lambda burial 1 of the 1974 season has been renumbered Lambda burial 5 (with the number in bold type), because four burials had already been found in Area Lambda in 1973. In Area Beta, the numbers continue the series from the earlier excavations.2 The original numbers are stated in the text and in table 2.3. This same series of numbers is prefixed 'SK' on the figures in Taylour 1972 and in the anthropological analysis below,3 where each individual is assigned a separate catalogue number, e.g. 9137.] 1. AREA EPSILON, 1973: MIDDLE HELLADIC III LATE For the location of Area Epsilon see fig. iv; for its architecture and stratigraphy see above.4 1. There was only one burial in this Area, that of a very tall adult male in a good state of preservation (9100). It is seen in plan in fig. 1.8 and plate 17 d and in section in figs. 1.3-1.4 and 1.7. According to the excavator, J. G. Younger, a short shaft was detected in the section, filled with darker earth (fig. 1.7 stratum 7). The skeleton lay on its right side, the legs drawn up to the squat position and the arms, bent at the elbow, extended forward. It was orientated sw-ne, with the skull at the ne end, which was tilted forward so that it faced w. It rested on a bed of pebbles, attractively coloured pink, green and blue.5 No grave goods were found with Epsilon burial 1, so it cannot be dated with accuracy. The grave had been excavated in a stratum dated to MH I Late. Although the latest pottery in that area was LH IIIA2, the burial is more likely to be earlier. [Since the fill contained the MH III Dark Burnished rim 1021 with Yellow Minyan and Gritty Matt Painted sherds, and the bed of the grave contained a light-on-dark Lustrous Decorated piece, the pottery associated with the burial is MH III Late; the presence of a sherd from the LH IIIA2 vase 3051 is accidental.] 2.

None of them had any grave goods. 1. Very little information is recorded about this skeleton (9101). It was found against the ne face of wall ig, which is dated to MH I Late. A piece of red substance was attached to the skull. [The pottery surrounding this newborn baby is MH II- III with some LH IIA, which probably dates this interment.] 2. This was the poorly-preserved skeleton of an infant (9102), lying on stones on its right side and facing w. It was close to burial 1 near the w flank of wall ic and under it. The axis of the body was N- s, with the skull to the N. The upper limbs were in disorder. What survived of the leg bones indicated that the legs were bent at the knee.

It lay against the se flank of wall ie, which was apparently of LH IIIC Early date but reused in the Medieval period, in the middle of the area bounded by wall ia at the ne, wall ib on the nw and wall if at the sw, all of which were MH II. The skeleton was parallel to the last-mentioned wall, with the skull to the nw. From the associated pottery, the interment would not appear to be earlier than LH IIIA2, and the latest sherds were LH IIIC Early. [These sherds surely date this burial.] 4 and 5. [These interments were of foetuses or newborn babies (9104-9105). Their disordered skeletons were found in the area defined by the MH I walls il, io and ip, i.e. the SW-Central Sector (see fig. 2.1). Since they were deep in MH I levels, i.e. the third phase of MH I in this Area, below the destruction level of Structures Zeta III and Zeta IV, they presumably date from MH I Late or not long after, and may well have been interred while the structures just mentioned were in use, in what was apparently an open area to their s and E.] 6. [This was the disordered remains of a very young baby (9106). Located in the n part of the same area as were 4 and 5, but much deeper, it was in the earliest MH I stratum, i.e. basket 108. It was found over fragments of a large pithos that ran into the baulk below wall io, which probably belongs to the middle phase of MH I, and under fragments of a large coarse vessel, finer than the pithos. This can be interpreted as an interment that employed two large pieces from different pots as a makeshift pithos-burial. However, the bones were themselves badly burnt, for mysterious reasons, and were also covered by a layer of dark red earth that appeared to indicate intense burning. This burning must be assigned to the first phase of MH I.7] 3. AREA ETA, 1973: MIDDLE HELLADIC I-LATE HELLADIC IIIC EARLY For the location of Area Eta see fig. iv, and for its architecture and stratigraphy see above.8 This Area, which attained dimensions of 8 x 4 m, produced no fewer than 15 burials, including three pithos burials of the MH period. In every case the bodies are those of infants or small children, an eloquent 7 See further Chapter i §2 (vi) above. 8 Chapter 1 §3.</page><page sequence="149">THE BRONZE AGE BURIALS §3 123 Fig. 2.2. Area Eta. Plan showing location of burials. commentary on the high mortality of young life in the MBA and later. The bones of such infants were seldom articulated, and it was difficult to distinguish those of one interment from those of another. The Area was criss-crossed by walls; the spaces between them were later utilised for the deposition of interments. Insofar as any plan emerged from the burials in this Area (fig. 2.2), eight of them are concentrated at the crossing of the MH I walls dg and dj, namely 1-3 and 7-11. Burials 1 to 6 were laid on or above the ruins of walls dg and dj. Of the 15 interments discovered, only two, 13 and 15, are definitely LH; the rest were found in MH strata. [Their dating proved difficult. A small amount of LH material in the contexts of 5 and 7-8 makes one suspect that some of these infants too may have been interred during that period. The worn bird askos 1319, which appears to be LH III, came from a mixed surface level in the s of the Area. Another bird askos, 1320 from basket 3, is also likely to be Mycenaean; its context was MH I Late, but with a slight Mycenaean admixture. These finds probably represent two disturbed LH III infant burials. On the relationship of the graves to the two MH I building phases, which enable several interments to be assigned with certainty to MH I, see above.9] 9 Chapter i §3 (iv).</page><page sequence="150">124 w* D- TAYLOURt AND R. JANKO i. This was a pithos burial, pieces of the skull of a very small child (9107) being found among the sherds of pithos. The pithos fragments were scattered over the corner made by the MH I Late walls dg and dh as well as over the point where wall dg passes over the MH I Early wall dj (see plate 18 ã). The excavator, J. B. Rutter, recorded that 'the skeleton, as preserved, still lies within the confines of the outline of the pithos. The burial is orientated roughly N-s with the head of the body and the rim of the pithos at the s. The body appears to be flexed with the legs pulled up under the buttocks.' In the vicinity there were the rims of three pithoi, ii?87a-c, the fragments of which weighed over 7 kg. 2-3. [Study of the bones of burial 1 byj. L. Angel revealed that two more very young infants (9108- 9109) were interred here. Presumably there was one infant for each of the three pithoi i287a-c. These graves are of a similar date to burial 1. The stratigraphy shows that they all post-date the destruction of Structure Eta I, i.e. the building that included walls dg and dh. There was a little Mycenaean material, but this does not make one doubt that these burials belong within the MH period; the later disturbance may be ascribed to the interment of burials 7 and 8 close by. The Dull Painted jar 1255, dated to MH I Late, was at first thought to have been associated with one or other of these interments: see the sections, figs. 1.19-1.20.] 4. The bones of an extremely small infant (9110), at first called Eta burial 2, were uncovered against the NW flank of the MH I Early wall dj in a position and at an axis equivalent to a nw extension of the EH II wall do, which is situated on the se flank of wall dj. The skeleton appears to have been laid on its right side, with the legs at the ne end. The skull was not found. A pierced schist disc, 6117, seems to be associated. This was found 25 cm nw of the edge of the interment. [This burial follows the orientation of wall dj, which must antedate it. The surrounding sherds, which are EH II with a little MH, show that the grave dates to MH I Late, while Structure Eta I was still in use: see fig. 1.19.] 5. This burial, originally called Eta burial 3, lay immediately to the E of the end of the MH III wall dk. There were only a number of skull fragments of a child or infant and two pieces of bone (9111). The surrounding pottery suggests that it is MH. [It is cut into a layer contemporary with the use of the MH I Late Structure Eta I and below the destruction levels of that building. However, the presence of a little LH HA material may indicate that it was cut down through these layers and is of Early Mycenaean date. These sherds, however, may have derived from the adjacent Medieval pit, since slight Medieval contamination was also suspected.] 6. This was located just s of burial 5, near the E baulk. This cist burial, at first called Eta burial 4, was of unusual interest (plate 18 c)At had a stone surround that had been badly disturbed in its s part by the digging of a Medieval pit in its vicinity. Two upright slabs from the surround of the cist survive to the w of the interment. The skeleton (9112) was that of a youth aged 13 years old, according to S. Bisel; it was in some disorder, but it had been buried in a crouched position facing w, yet with the skull looking s. It was quite clear from the layout of the leg bones that they had been drawn up tight so that the knees were brought up under the chin; in other words, it was a trussed burial. The treatment of the corpse in this way suggests that it was intended for burial in a large jar of the kind found in western Messenia,10 but there was no evidence of any fragments of such a vessel in the immediate area. The corpse must have been trussed to fit it in a circumscribed space within the cist tomb, the date of which is MH. [Since EH I layers are just below, the date could be as early as MH I Late, but it could equally well be MH II- III. The LH III and Medieval material in the vicinity probably comes from the Byzantine pit that cut this grave to the SE.] 7. This interment was uncovered in the corner made by the MH I Late walls dh and dg. The bones were those of a toddler (9113, plate 18 dj. The skeleton lay on its left side, with its head to the nw. Pieces of the Dull Painted storage jar 15555 were found in the vicinity. This large, handsome and partly restored jar has too narrow a mouth for the infant to have been laid in it. [The body could, however, have been buried in it if the jar was first broken, a practice noted at Mycenae.11 However, this jar, at first associated with Eta burial 1, seems to have belonged to the destruction deposit of Structure Eta I and to have been disturbed by these interments. Some later material in the vicinity suggests that burial 7, which was at first called burial 5, dates from the Mycenaean period.] 10 Biegen, Rawson, Taylour and Donovan 1973, i44"5 wit^ figs. 215, 233-5. 11 Alden 2001, 21.</page><page sequence="151">THE BRONZE AGE BURIALS §3 125 8. This burial lay due s of burial 7, up against the ne flank of the MH I Late wall dg and over the MH I Early wall dj. Again the body was that of an infant (9114), of which only the skull and five ribs survived. [It was orientated N-s, with the skull to the N. It was originally called Eta burial 6. Although J. L. Angel found traces of anaemia in the bones of both 7 and 8, they are definitely different individuals: he assigned them different ages, and they appear at different locations on the plan, as can be seen in fig. 2.2. They may well represent siblings, 7 having died when it was about 28 months older than 8. The date is apparently the same as that of burial 7, i.e. Mycenaean.] 9. This burial, at first called Eta burial 7, again lay further se and almost touching burial 11. It consisted of another infant skull with a couple of ribs (9115). It partly overlay an animal bone. [It was located close to the inner face of the MH I Late wall dg. The stratigraphy shows that this is an intramural burial made during the use of Structure Eta I, which includes that wall.] 10. This burial, at first called Eta burial 8, was the skull and ribs of a newborn infant (9116). It occupied the corner made by the MH I Late walls dh and dg. [The date is the same as that of burial 9, i.e. MH I Late.] 11. This was another infant skull (9117), at first called Eta burial 9. It lay close by to the se, together with three scattered bones to the n. [Found in the angle of the MH I Late walls dg and dh, i.e. within Structure Eta I, this interment lay 6 cm lower than burials 9 and 10. As it is in the MH I Early stratum, with an admixture of EH II sherds, it cannot be dated precisely within MH I.] 12. This consisted of a pile of baby bones (9118) against the s baulk of Area Eta and about 70 cm w of the se corner. It was at first called Eta burial 10. A layer of stones against the s baulk was removed before this burial was uncovered. A small quantity of sea shells (Donax) was found in the vicinity, as well as the broken shaft-hole axe 6090, but it is doubtful whether these are to be associated with the interment. The surrounding pottery was MH I. [This burial of a neonate infant was incompletely dug, as it lay partly under the baulk. Its depth suggests a date in MH I Late, during the use of Structure Eta I.] 13. This was the disturbed interment of an infant (9119), at first called Eta burial 11. This interment lay in the nw corner of the Area against the ne flank of the MH wall dp. Immediately to the N of it, projecting from the n baulk, was a pile of stones, and it is possible that this represents the remains of another cist grave. Among the bones was found the lentoid seal 7126, dated stylistically to LH IIIA2 or later. This gives a terminus post quern for the burial. This would therefore be the latest of the graves in Area Eta. [The faience bead 7163 was also among the bones, and suggests that the seal was a personal ornament. Its abraded condition and the fact that it was buried with an infant suggests that it was an heirloom. Although this burial was cut into a MH II context, LH IIIC Early sherds were found around it: see fig. 1.19. Its date must be LH IIIC Early.] 14. [The humérus of a newborn baby (9120) was found among, and confused with, the bones of burial 13. It could be LH IIIC Early, but seems more likely be an earlier interment disturbed by burial 13, with a date between MH II and LH IL] 15. This, the most impressive of all the burials in Area Eta, was a well preserved cist-grave just to the s of burial 13, in the North-Central Sector (figs. 2.2-2.3 and plates 4 c, 19 a). It was at first called Eta burial 12. Its axis was approximately sw-ne. Its exterior dimensions were c. 2.05 x 1.65 m, but the of chamber itself was only 1.35 x 0.8 m. The tomb had originally been roofed with cover slabs, presumably of schist, but only one such slab, the south-westernmost one, was found in the sw corner of the grave, into which it had collapsed. One broken end of it rested against the nw wall dm. The preserved length of the slab was 0.8 m and the width 0.68 m. If allowance is made for the missing centimetres at its broken end, the slab would have been sufficient to cover the width of the chamber. [The excavator, J. B. Rutter, observed that it must have been broken while the tomb was still empty of fill, and that there must originally have been two or three more such slabs covering the cist. No trace of them was found, which suggests that the tomb was opened in antiquity. For other such evidence see below.] The se wall di, which appears to have been a terrace wall and had a top course of very large stones was tilted towards the se, no doubt because of earth pressure accentuated by the slope of the terrain in that direction. On the other hand, fallen stones within the tomb, which could only have come from that wall, were found on its nw flank. The walls of the cist, dl, dm and dn, were built on bedrock</page><page sequence="152">!26 W. D. TAYLOURt AND R. JANKO Fig. 2.3. Plan of LH IIA burial Eta 15. save that wall dn rests on a few centimetres of soil where the bedrock slopes away to the ne. The nw wall, wall dm, was of two-stone thickness, whereas walls dl and dn were only one stone thick; however, wall dm also served as a retaining wall against the thrust of earth from the nw. The walls consisted of three to four courses and did not appear to bond. The top course of these walls seemed to be double in thickness, but the extra stones rested on earth. [The excavator suggested that the broader tops to the cist walls may have been intended to strengthen the bearing surface for the large and heavy cover slabs. The details of the walls are given in table 2.1. To the sw the floor of the tomb consisted of bedrock; at its ne end the skull and the vase 1322 rested on slabs, since there were some 5-10 cm of soil above the bedrock. See the sections, figs. 1.19-1.20.] The tomb contained three complete vases that occupied the N corner, one of which, jar 1322 in the extreme corner, rested on a small schist slab. Two animal bones were also found in the fill. The skeleton of the incumbent of the tomb (9121) was moderately well preserved. It lay on its left side facing se, occupying the SE side of the tomb (plate 19 a). The skull, badly smashed, was located about half-way along the ne wall di and close to the pots. The jaw was completely crushed, and the rib bones were in disorder. There was no trace of the phalanges of the hands or feet. The skeleton was that of a juvenile about five years old. This tomb was originally dated to MH III/LH I,12 but the vases 1321-1323 that it contained - a goblet, ajar and a jug - are LH IIA in date. The fill also contained the LM I jar 1324 and four LH IIA sherds, published as 3223 and 3225-3227 below, as well as the obsidian retouched blade 7335. [These objects presumably date the tomb. J. B. Rutter thought the burnt Micaceous Minoan jar 1324, found 10 cm down in the ne sector of the fill of the chamber, was a later intrusion from a pit cut into the soil over the chamber. But could this jar derive either from funeral rites conducted upon the closing of the grave or from its being robbed soon afterwards?] 12 Catling 1974, figs. 23, 24.</page><page sequence="153">THE BRONZE AGE BURIALS §4 127 4. AREA BETA 1959, 1963 AND 1974-77: MIDDLE HELLADIC III-LATE HELLADIC IIIC EARLY For the location of Area Beta see fig. iv and for its architecture and stratigraphy see above.13 The locations and elevations of the burials found there are shown in fig. 2.4. This discussion excludes Beta burials 20-21, which were first dug within Beta 12A of 1963, as their excavation was completed within the ambit of Area Lambda/Beta 12 in 1974. The architecture and stratigraphy of the latter Area is published above,14 and the burials in §5 (ii) below. 1. [This burial was excavated in 1959 in trench Beta 3, which later became the se corner of Area Beta. The skull of an infant (9081) aged seven to eight months was found, with a few disordered ribs nearby. The female figurine 7073 found with it can be no later than LH IIIAi, and the burial was originally of that date. Other finds possibly from this burial include a segmented bead of faience (HS 232), a flattened spherical bead of glass (HS 234)15 and a pierced Conus shell (9276). The skull rested on the cover slab of the cist of the LH IIIA2 burial 26 (plate 19 c), which lay beneath it. The interment was evidently disturbed by the digging of the latter grave, and the bones and grave goods were reverently replaced on top of the cist that had displaced them.] 2-19. Beta burials 2-19, excavated in Area Beta in 1959-63, were published with the earlier excavations.16 [Burial 6 is now datable from pots 2273 and 2281 to MH I Late.17 The bead HS 244, which accompanied LH IIIC Early infant burial 7 or 8, is a holed cowrie-shell and not a glass bead as was thought.18 Burial 19 must be associated with neither the LH IIIA2 dipper 3680 nor the seal HS 249, which is now re-dated to MM II-III.19 The base of the pithos that contained the dipper was found in situ, displacing the skull; the belief that the cist cut the LH IIIC Early yellow clay floor20 is owed to the fact that the latter had eroded away lower down the slope. The context contained LH I- IIA sherds, which probably give the date of this burial.] 20-21. For Beta burials 20-21, excavated in trench Beta 12A in 1963 and 1974, see below.21 22. This interment, formerly Beta burial 1 of 1974, was within the space bounded by the Medieval walls ea, eb and ec, i.e. Structure Beta VI, Room 2 (fig. 2.4). It was an infant skeleton (9122) in a cist grave made of thin schist slabs, built against the se face of the Medieval wall eb in the n half of the room. Its posture was supine, with the hands laid palms down. It was orientated nw-se, with the head to the NW. It overlay the LH IIIAi floor. It was laid in a pit of soft, dark earth covered by a Medieval tile, and the surrounding pottery was Medieval as well as Mycenaean. Therefore the burial was probably Byzantine. But if so, why was it not in a cemetery? It is possible that the burial is LH IIIC Early and that the position of the Medieval tile over it was fortuitous. [However, cist graves were known in Byzantine times, as in the case of Delta burial 25-22 Given the high elevation of this grave in relation to the base of wall eb, a Medieval date seems likely. A holed Natica shell (unpublished) may have been associated with it.] 23. [This interment, formerly known as Beta burial 2, 1974, was an infant's skeleton (9123) in a cist grave covered with schist slabs in the NE Sector (see plates 6 d, 19 d). Its internal dimensions were 65 x 30 cm. The infant was placed on its side facing sw. Its skull was to the nw, its feet to the se. Its upper arms were by the side of the body, its lower arms at right angles to the upper, and its legs were semi-flexed.] The pottery in the area was not later than LH IIIAi. As no grave goods were found with this interment, it could not be dated, but is unlikely to be any earlier than LH IIIAi. 24. [This burial, formerly known as Beta burial 3, 1974, was found in a make-shift cist up against already existing stones in the se part of Area Beta, in the space formed by the Medieval walls ef and el and the earlier walls ej and eo, i.e. in Structure Beta VI, Room 4 (see plate 20 a); it lay over wall fc, which was probably built in MH III Late.23 This foetus (9124) lay supine in an extended posture 13 Chapter i §4. 14 Chapter 1 §k. 15 Taylour 1072, 232 with ni.

The head rested on a flat stone, the rest of the body on earth, with its extremities at a higher level than its mid-parts. It was orientated nw-se, with the head to the nw. The cist was covered with 44 broken fragments of pithos, but it was not a pithos burial. Since its context contained no sherds later than Early Mycenaean and some late MH, it may be LH IL] 25. This grave, at first called Beta burial 4, 1974, was in the NE Sector (plates 6 d, 20 b). The pottery surrounding it contained nothing later than LH I- II. Although there were no grave goods with the interment and it could not be dated, it is probably no earlier than LH IIIAi. [The cist measured 1.6 x 0.5 m internally and was made of large, flat-topped stones in the first course, overlain by similar stones in the nw, to bear the weight of three large cover slabs. The gaps between these slabs were plugged with small stones; compare the covering of the LH I/IIA shaft grave Nu burial 13 (fig. 2.10: b). The cist was built of large blocks at the head end, where the interior was rectangular; it tapered to a point at the feet, where it was built of small stones. Its depth was c. 1 .4 m. It was orientated nw-se, with the head to the nw. The occupant was an adult male (9125), aged about 38 years. The body was supine, with the arms extended and the hands resting on the thighs. The legs were bowed so that the soles of the feet touched face to face; there are parallels in graves Gamma, Mu and Nu in Grave Circle B at Mycenae.24 Presumably the legs had been flexed vertically and fell into this position as they decayed. A small patch of shell and charcoal was found in the loose brown earth 24 Mylonas 1966, 99-100, figs. 90-91.</page><page sequence="155">THE BRONZE AGE BURIALS §4 129 above the skeleton, and some white ash outside the cist to the nw. This grave produced the only Turritella shell known from the site.] 26. This burial, formerly known as Beta burial 1, 1977, was a cist grave in the se corner of Area Beta (plate 20 c), with a well-cut and well-smoothed cover slab. It had been discovered but left unexcavated in the 1959 season underneath another interment, burial 1, in trench Beta 3; plate 19 c shows the skull of burial 1 lying on the cover-slab of this grave. Since parts of burial 26 lay under the s and E baulks, it is shown in the sections, figs. 1.24-1.25. The interment was that of a child (9126) about twelve months old. Its orientation was se-nw with the skull at the nw. It lay supine; the legs below the knees were under the baulk. The skeleton was badly disturbed. One bone of each arm survived, half the pelvis, four vertebrae and about ten ribs. The left hand appears to have rested just above the pelvis. The lower jaw was quite well preserved, and some teeth of the upper jaw lay over it. The front of the skull was crushed, but some facial bones survived. A jug and an askos, which are published as 3338-3339 below, were laid on top of this burial near the skull and date it to LH IIIA2. 27. This interment, formerly known as Beta burial 2, 1977, was a cist grave built against wall ej, which was probably constructed in MH III Late and continued in use until LH IIIAi. The builders of the cist used the wall as its nw boundary, close to the LH IIA wall eo (see plate 20 d). Smaller stones were used for the other three sides. The slabs were badly disturbed. Various animal jaws and bones were noted overlying this region, but it was not thought that they had any connection with the burial, such as an animal sacrifice. The internal dimensions of the cist were 1.1 x 0.54 m. The cover slabs of no great size, thin and small, had fallen in on the burial from the pelvis to the ankles. The skeleton (9127), in a crouched position lying on the left side, was that of a child aged about seven years. It was in a fair state of preservation. It had been laid on a stony surface with the skull at the n end looking towards the se. The stone pounder 6111, of lapis lacedaemonius, was probably not associated with this interment. The surrounding pottery ranged from MH III to LH I, but it is doubtful whether the burial is any earlier than LH I. [The MH III sherd 1442 is from this burial] 28. This interment, formerly Beta burial 5, 1977, had escaped spoliation and contained important finds, including an askos of most unusual form (fig. 2.5 and plate 21 a-b). It was a cist grave with a NNW-SSE axis. The nne wall of the tomb was built into the MH III wall em. The skeleton of an infant (9128) lay supine in an e-w orientation, with its arms alongside the body. The skull was located at the w. A bracelet of glass beads encircled either wrist, six on the left wrist (7164-7165 and 7207-7210), and eight on the right (7200-7206); a further stone bead (7218) was also found. Three vases were uncovered with this burial: a jug (3290) and a goblet (3291) on the left side of the upper body, and an askos (3289) by the right leg. The pots from the tomb are, according to P. A. Mountjoy, datable to LH IIB or even perhaps early LH IIIAi, and this would also be the date of the interment as a whole. 29. This grave, formerly called Beta burial 6, 1977, was a cist grave 65 cm long by 35 cm wide located in the angle formed by the ne side of wall ex and the nw side of wall ff. Its axis was sw-ne. It contained a small child (9129) lying on its back, with the head at the ne end. It was well preserved except for the skull. No grave goods were found with it. The latest pottery round about is not later than LH IIA, which is possibly the date of this burial, though it might perhaps be LH IIIAi. [Walls ex and ff were probably Medieval. Hence this interment is likely to have been Medieval.] 30. This tomb, formerly called Beta burial 7, 1977, was located in the sw part of the Area. It was a small cist in the upper fill of the circular cist grave burial 32, which is described below. Within it was a newborn infant (9130), perhaps only a few days old. The presence of a chipped blade of obsidian, not this kept, seems to be fortuitous and unconnected. Another cist was uncovered immediately below this interment, containing burial 32. [The upper cist was built against the MH III Early wall fd, which was cut by it (fig. 1.24 and plate 7 c-d). The surrounding pottery was MH III. But the presence of a bichrome Matt Painted sherd in burial 32 suggests a date in LH I or more probably LH IIA. ] 31. A poorly-preserved skull of an infant (9131), formerly called Beta burial 8, 1977, was excavated m the narrow space between the probably Medieval wall ef and the probably MH III Late wall ej and over the probably MH III Late wall fc, in the NE Sector of the Area. These walls created the effect of a cist. No body was found with it. The skeleton of this burial, had it existed, would presumably have been laid under a small slab with a w-e orientation in this confined space. As so often no</page><page sequence="156">1S° W. D. TAYLOURt AND R. JANKO Fig. 2.5. Plan of LH IIB-IIIAi burial Beta 28. datable material was found with it. The latest surrounding sherds were probably MH III. [Burial 9 of 1977 turned out to be the same skull as 31.] 32. This grave, formerly called Beta burial 10, 1977, was an infant burial that was laid against the w side of a circular stone construction that occupied the south-central part of the Area, built against the MH III Early wall fd (see fig. 2.4 and plate 7 c-d). This large cist was 1.6-1.8 m in exterior diameter, 0.9-1.1 m in interior diameter, and about 20 cm deep. Its walls varied between 40-70 cm in thickness. They were well built of large stones in several courses. The orientation of the skeleton (9132) was n- s, with the legs at the N. No skull was found. [This very young infant lay at a deeper elevation than burial 30 described above. The walls of the cist, and the pottery in the fill, which included the MM II Fine Lustrous Decorated egg-cup 1334, yielded MH III Early pottery, but this probably came from the floor level through which the cist was cut. However, C. Zerner notes that the presence of a bichrome Matt Painted sherd in the lower fill suggests a date in LH I or more probably LH IIA for both interments, and this is probably the date of the construction of the cist too.] 33. This grave, previously Beta burial 11, 1977, was represented by an infant skull only (9133). Its position was between the MH III walls ej and em in the central part of the Area, close to wall ej. As so often, no datable material was found with it. It is probably of the same date as burial 32, i.e. LH I- IIA. [Its elevation suggests such a date.] 34. This interment, originally Beta burial 12, 1977, was an infant (9134) uncovered in the corner formed by the baulk under the LH IIA wall ed and the first step of the roadway, skirting ed, that led to an upper terrace. [To judge by its depth, its probable date is MH III/LH I.]</page><page sequence="157">THE BRONZE AGE BURIALS §5 131 Fig. 2.6. Area Lambda/Beta 12. Plan showing location of burials. 5.

It was at first attributed to LH I-II,26 since the pit for this burial was cut into the floor of the room formed by the MH III/LH I walls lc, Id and le, i.e. Room 10C (w) of Structure Lambda II, and it would therefore have been an intramural interment, had Room 10 then been in use. The pit, some 36 cm deep and filled with very soft earth under tumbled stones, contrasted strongly with the compacted MH III/LH I layer into which it was cut, and was some 65 cm in diameter. The shaft, filled up with the stones, was presumably some 50 cm deep in total. The burial was that of an infant (9135) in a flexed position lying on its left side with approximate orientation nne 25 Chapter i §5. 26 Catling 1974, 16.</page><page sequence="158">132 W. D.

The two cups 3573-3574 were uncovered lying over the feet, with 3573 resting upside-down upon 3574; these are datable to LH IIIA2, with LM IIIA2 parallels. A further LH IIIA2 vessel, the flask 3575, found during the excavation in 1974 of Beta burial 7, almost certainly belongs with this interment. [This vase was found at the same depth as the others, almost intact amid the stones at the E edge of the pit. They date the burial to LH IIIA2 Early. Stone tools 7310a, 7319 and 7326 may also be associated. For the possibility that the bowl 3569, of the same date or earlier, also belongs with this interment, see on burial 7 below.] 2. This burial, a child aged three years (9136), was found close to and to the n of burial 1 (fig. 2.8 and plate 22 a). Most of it was unexcavated, as it lay under the baulk beneath the MH III/LH I wall le. It was much disturbed. The jaw, vertebrae and ribs lay to the w of the skull, an arm bone to the s, and more ribs and vertebrae to the e. The orientation may have been nw-se. Only the skull and the small Dark Burnished kantharos 1482 immediately to the e of it could be retrieved. [This miniature vase, dated to MH III Late, reflects the practice begun in the Shaft Grave era of making miniature vessels for child burials, as C. Zerner observes. Its presence dates the burial, and this is confirmed by the fact that the grave was sealed by the MH III Late stratum above (1973 basket 26) and cut into a MH III Early stratum (1973 basket 31); see figs. 1.39 and 1.45, at right. This child suffered from thalassaemia, a rare condition at Ayios Stephanos.27] 3. This burial was that of an adult (9137), but only the tightly flexed long bones and pelvis could be recovered in 1973, and the remainder was never excavated (see plate 22 b). The skeleton was of a woman aged about 52. Like burial 1, this was found within the room formed by the MH III/LH I 27 See Chapter 12 §1 (iii) (c) (i) below.</page><page sequence="159">THE BRONZE AGE BURIALS §5 133 Fig. 2.8. Plan of MH III Late burial Lambda 2. walls lc, Id and le, i.e. Room 10C of Structure Lambda II. It came to light when the baulk under wall lc was removed. The main part of the skeleton lay under wall Id, with the skull presumably at the s. No grave goods were uncovered, but the burial is likely to be late MH. [The stratum in which it was interred, viz. the lowest level of 1973 basket 33, which must be of the same date as 1973 basket 28, is MH III Early (see fig. 1.45, at centre), but the date of this interment is presumably MH III Late.] 4. This burial was found in 1973 in the se corner of Lambda 1, s of the MH III/LH I wall Id. It was left undug. No further details are available. [It lies under MH III/LH I strata and should be of that date, or possibly later.] 5. Most of the interments discovered in 1974 were concentrated in the same area as those found in 1973, i.e. in the South-Central Sector. This interment, formerly called Lambda burial 1, 1974, was not far from burial 1 described above, viz. in the corner made by the w face of the LH IIIC Early wall lm and the n face of the earlier wall Id. It lay in a pit of very soft earth cut into a layer of harder earth. Its dimensions were 45 by 35 cm. This was a burial of an infant (9138). The skull was located in the se; the body lay crouched on its right side with its feet to the nw. It was perhaps an intramural burial, being sunk into the earlier strata of LH I- II date: see fig. 1.39. From the surrounding pottery it is datable to LH, probably LH IIIAi. [For the possibility that the cup 3560 and bowl 3569, LH IIIA2 Early in date, are to be associated with it, see on burial 7 below.] 6. The infant bones and skulls were mostly in total disorder, and it was not easy to separate one from another. [This skeleton was found along with burial 5, but was only distinguished from it during J. L. Angel's study of the bones. It is that of a newborn infant (9139). The date is presumably the same as burial 5.] 7. This disordered burial of a newborn baby (9140), at first called Lambda burial 2, 1974, was a little further to the N of burial 5, w of wall lm and s of wall le. The skull was apparently to the s. A nearby sherd of the bowl 3555 gives it a date of LH IIIAi. In the course of clearing burial 7 the LH IIIA2 flask 3575 of well-known type was revealed. It lay complete, though broken, 20 cm below the burial, but was not connected with it. It almost certainly belonged, with the two cups 3573-3574, to Lambda burial 1. [The pit for this interment was cut down through the layers above, as the provenance of bowl 3555 demonstrates: sherds of it were found in baskets 37 and 66 as well as in basket 70. Since P. A. Mountjoy observes that 3555 has features characteristic of both LH IIIAi and LH IIIA2, it is probably transitional. This observation leads me to connect it with a vase found in the uppermost layer cut by the pit, the monochrome bowl 3569. Mountjoy dates this unusual bowl to LH IIIA2 Early or before. It could be associated with burial 1, which was found just to the w and is also dated LH IIIA2 Early, or with burial 5 just to the s, which is LH IIIAi, or with burial 10, which was found just to the N and has the same date as this grave. However, it seems best to assign it to the top of the shaft of burial 7.]</page><page sequence="160">134 w- D- TAYLOURt AND R. JANKO 8. [Another infant skeleton (9141) was found mixed with that from burial 7 during study of the bones; it is no doubt of similar date.] 9. [An adult's jawbone (9142) was also recognised during study of the bones of burial 7. This was surely a cast-up from an earlier interment, which was disturbed when burials 7 and 8 took place.] 10. This disordered interment of an infant (9143), formerly called Lambda burial 3, 1974, was discovered N of burial 7 and is of the same date as burial 7. [It was apparently about 7 cm N of wall Id and 28 cm n of burial 7. For the possibility that the bowl 3569 is associated see on burial 7 above.] 11-12. [Two further sets of bones, belonging to an aborted foetus (9144) and an infant (9145) respectively, were distinguished during study of the physical remains of 10; they are presumably of the same date.] 13. This infant's skull (9146), originally called Lambda burial 4, 1974, was found further N, in the corner of the MH III/LH I walls If and gd in Room 7 of Structure Lambda II, among a number of slabs lying in disarray, and may have been interred in a cist. The surrounding pottery was LH I- II, and the date of the skull is possibly LH IIA. [The rest of this interment was not excavated, since it lay under the baulk. For Lambda burials 14-16 see §6 below.] (ii) Trench Beta 12 A, 1963 [The excavation of Beta burials 20 and 21, which began at the end of the 1963 season,28 was completed in 1974 as part of Area Lambda / Beta 12. For their locations and elevations see fig. 2.6. During the later excavation they were called Lambda burials 5 and 6, 1974. However, it seemed better to keep their original numeration.] 20. The remains of this infant (9147, plate 21c) had been left in situ in trench Beta 12 A, to the N of the MH III/LH I wall ht, at the end of the 1963 season. It was the burial of a toddler, found under an occupation floor at the E end of the area of slabs called wall hs. There were some stones around the skeleton, but one could not be certain that they were part of the burial. Its axis was N-s, with the head to the N. It was probably a crouched burial; at least, the legs were drawn up to the body. The right arm was extended, the left flexed across the chest. [The body was laid on its right flank, since all the vertebrae were found at that side of the skeleton. A pit that contained the burial may have been dug with 1963 basket 88; this contained the LH IIIC Early alabastron 3704. The stones around it may have come from the slab floor that overlay it, since wall hs is now recognised as part of the LH IIIC Early slab Floor 4, in the sw sector of Room 2 of Structure Lambda VI. The surrounding pottery was LH I-IIA with a few LH IIIAi sherds, but the burial is probably LH IIIC Early.] 21. A child's skull only (9148) was uncovered in trench Beta 1, under the LH III wall hu and to the n of and well below the MH III/LH I wall hx. The rest of the skeleton lay under the Lambda 1 / Beta 1 2 A baulk, but this was not dug to a sufficient depth to reveal it. It was found under several occupation floors at a depth of c. 2.5 m from the surface. Two slabs, one of them upright to the s, were found near the skull. Presumably this was a cist grave.29 [This burial was found in the deep sounding in the se corner of Room 7 of Structure Lambda II, in a MH III Early fill (see fig. 1.41 stratum 14).30 Its date is MH III.] 6. AREA LAMBDA 3/4, 1977: LATE HELLADIC II-IIIA2 For the location of Area Lambda 3/4, excavated in 1977, see fig. iv; for its architecture and stratigraphy see above.31 The find spots and elevations of the Lambda burials found in this Area are recorded in fig. 1.48. The numeration continues from §5 (i) above. 14 This burial, originally called Lambda burial 1, 1977, was a cist grave found by the sw face of Pier II of the Medieval building, Structure Lambda VII (see fig. 1.48 and plate 22 ¿j. The grave consisted of six vertical slabs, one at either end of the skeleton and two in line on each side; there were two 28 Taylour 1972, 236 with 231 fig. 15. 29 Taylour 1972, 236 with 231 fig. 15 and 254 tig. 27. 30 See Chapter 1 §5 (vi) above. 31 Chapter 1 §7.</page><page sequence="161">THE BRONZE AGE BURIALS §7 135 cover slabs. From the pit cut for the slabs came the conical cup 1501a and the obsidian blade 7345. The cist contained the skeleton of an infant (9149), thirty-eight beads (7166-7199, 7211-7213 and 7215) and the small jug 3572, which dates the skeleton to LH IIIA2. When the skeleton was removed, it was seen that the sides of the lower part of the grave were lined with small- to medium-sized stones that acted as a foundation for the slabs. The tomb was cut into Early Mycenaean levels. [The conical cup and obsidian blade are probably to be associated with the LH IIA level into which the tomb was cut rather than with the burial itself: see the section, fig. 1.52.] 15. This pithos burial of a newborn (9150), formerly called Lambda burial 2, 1977, appeared in the se corner of the trench, again outside the walls of Structure Lambda VII (see plate 22 d). Only the lower part of the knob-based pithos 1781 was preserved, which was orientated approximately nw-se, with its base to the nw. It contained only five infant bones. No other pottery was found with it. [The button-based jar rested upon wall mb, built in MH III Early and disused at the start of LH IIA Early. To judge by its position, the burial must belong to LH II, since it was cut into the ruins of Structure Lambda I, which was out of use early in LH IIA, and the burial underlay the LH III levels in the Area, as P. A. Mountjoy noted. A pithos burial is unlikely to be any later than this.32] 16. This burial, at first known as Lambda burial 3, 1977, was a cist grave covered by a single slab (seen in plate 12 b). It rested on top of the stone socle of the MH III wall mh. The grave had a rough stone lining, and the side slabs, where extant, rested on the sides of the pit (plate 23 a). Within it was the skeleton of a newborn infant (9151), resting on a layer of stones and with the skull raised on a 'pillow' stone. It lay on its left side with its legs drawn up. Its axis was ne-sw with the head to the sw. Its depth supports a date in LH III. There were no grave goods to date this burial, but it may have been LH IIIA2; the latest surrounding pottery is LH IIIB. [Stone 'pillows' are paralleled in the MH period at Mycenae in Gamma Grave 15 and at Asine, as well as in the Mycenaean cemetery at Ayios Kosmas.33] 7. AREA NU / GAMMA 1, 1959 AND 1973-77: MIDDLE HELLADIC II-LATE HELLADIC IIIA For the location of this Area see fig. iv; for its architecture and stratigraphy see above.34 The locations and elevations of the interments found in it are plotted in figs. 1.53-1.54 unless otherwise indicated.35 1. [This is the first of two interments found in the NE Extension of trench Gamma 1, excavated in 1959; little information was given in their first publication.36 Fragments of the skeleton of an infant (9079), including part of the skull, were found just on the line of the s baulk where trench Gamma 1 meets its NE Extension, in a MH level with a little LH III material. There were no grave goods. No further details are recorded, but the date is presumably LH III, and probably LH IIIA, to judge by the adjacent burials in Area Nu.] 2. [More infant bones (9080) came to light at a depth some 10 cm below that of Nu burial 1 in the s part of the NE Extension of trench Gamma 1 . The remains of this infant were laid in a pit some 50 x 34 cm in extent, which was cut into a level dated by sherds to LH ML There were no accompanying finds, but the date is more probably LH IIIA than LH II.] 3. This extended burial of a newborn infant (9152), originally known as Nu burial 1, 1973, was laid in a cist of schist slabs against the E flank of wall na in trench Nu 1 (plate 23 b). Interred at a depth similar to that of the previous interments, this skeleton was orientated wsw to ene, with the skull in the sw, facing N. It was enclosed by four upright slabs with a single cover slab broken into two pieces. The body rested on hard-packed earth. It had no grave goods. This burial could not be closely dated, but it is later than LH ML [Although it was cut into a LH I/IIA stratum, it is probably LH IIIA. If the LH IIIAi figurine 7063 does not belong to Nu burial 4, it may be associated with burial 3, as was proposed by J. B. Rutter when he excavated this Area.] 4 This contracted interment of a very young infant (9153) on its right side with its arms extended along its sides was m a cist made of slabs against the E trench wall of Nu 1 (see fig. 2.9 and plate 23 ¿j. 32 See §8 (iv) below. 33 Alden 2001. 26. 34 Chapter 1 §8. 35 These do not show burial 8 because it was identified only on an thronoln evirai D-rnnnrl« 36 Taylour 1972, 230.</page><page sequence="162">!36 W.

The date appears to be the same as burial 3. [The pit of this grave appears as stratum 5 in fig. 1.55, at centre. The figurine 7063, which is apparently derived from the fill or surface of the pit for this cist, dates it to LH IIIAi. Its presence suggests the performance of funerary rites at the grave, which was at first known as Nu burial 2, 1973. Also found in the fill of the pit was the terracotta whorl 7024.] 5. Since the lower body of this baby (9154) lay under the w baulk of Nu 1, this burial could not be fully excavated. Originally called Nu burial 3, 1973, it lay on a N-s axis with the skull to the N. A necklace made of 28 faience 'melon' beads (7135-7162) was found still in situ around the neck of the infant. The dating is the same as that of burials 3 and 4, namely LH IIIAi. [The excavator dated burial 5 to LH IIA.37 It was indeed at a greater depth than burials 3 and 4: see fig. 1.57, at left. The MH III/LH I pot R412 came from the surrounding stratum.] 6. This burial, at first known as Nu burial 1, 1974, was the cist grave of an newborn infant (9155) found in the excavation of the Nu / Gamma 1 baulk; it lay partly under the e face of the trench. Only the skull and a few bones from the w end of the tomb could be retrieved for study. No grave goods were found with this burial, but it was only partly excavated. The pottery above the burial is Medieval, but the surrounding stratum is LH IIA. [Although the slabs that covered this cist project above the Medieval yard surface marked by a wash line (see fig. 1.55 stratum 4), the Area sloped down from n to s and the cist may have been exposed by erosion before it was reburied by Medieval deposition; hence it need not be Medieval. The elevation of this interment suggests that it is LH IIIA.38] 7-10. These were the burials of two newborn infants (9156, 9158) and two babies (9157, 9159), probably in pits, located very close together in the se sector of the Nu / Gamma 1 baulk and to the N of the MH III Early wall ng. They were all very much disturbed, and it was not possible to say to which skull the bones belonged; some fragments of them turned up in the water-sieve. As in the case 37 Rutter and Rutter 1976, 3. 38 Cf. Rutter and Rutter 1976, 3, 22.</page><page sequence="163">THE BRONZE AGE BURIALS §7 137 of burials 3 and 4, the interments were concentrated in the ne part of the Area. They are probably of the same period, i.e. LH IIIAi. [These burials were at a higher elevation than the top of wall ng, and burial 9 appears to have been directly over it. Cut into the destruction levels associated with wall ng, they might date to MH III/LH I or LH I,39 but they lay at the same elevation as burials 3 and 4, which are certainly later, and there was a LH IIA sherd. Burials 7, 9 and 10 were formerly called Nu burials 2, 3 and 4, 1974, while burial 8 was distinguished only during anthropological study. The fourteen beads from this sector (7216, 7219-7231), many of which were found in the water-sieve residue, must derive from one or more of these graves.] 11. [A rough rectangle of small stones representing the E and s sides of a well-built cist tomb, with interior dimensions of 65 x 35 cm, was uncovered in the s baulk of Area Nu 2; see fig. 1.56 with plates 13 b and 23 d. It was partially cut by the Medieval pit shown in fig. 3.4. The tomb had been so badly disturbed that no trace was found of its occupant's bones, and its existence was only tentatively accepted at the time of excavation, when it was called burial 5, 1974; indeed, only the sw corner of the cist was recognised as such by the excavator,40 who regarded the remaining stones as the s end of the LH IIA feature or wall ni, the rest of which had been cut by the pit. However, nothing other than its presence can explain three important later finds in the otherwise pure LH IIA layer into which it was cut. These are the LH IIB goblet 3647, the LH IIIAi krater 3648 and the unusual and very battered terracotta wheel 7122, which comes from a chariot-group figurine and is dated to LH IIIA. The find spot of this last item is plotted on fig. 1.54. The depth at which this tomb was uncovered is comparable to that of the other LH IIIA cists in this Area. Hence the interment, presumably that of a toddler buried with his favourite toy chariot, must have dated from LH IIIAi.] 12. This grave, formerly called Nu burial 1 of 1977, was cut into the sw corner of Room 2 of Structure Nu II (plate 24 a). Its construction cut away the s extension of the MH III/LH I wall nf, as is seen in the section, fig. 1.56. It was a square cist tomb enclosing the skull and bones of a small child (9160). Part of the skull was under the s baulk; the skeleton rested on a thin bed of pebbles. It lay supine on a NW-SE axis, with the head to the se. The tomb had a 'roof of large stones in place of slabs; this surround of stones apparently supported a cairn over the burial. These stones were removed in 1974, when they were mistaken for tumble. Under the stones, which were at first called wall nn, the amphora R835 and the cooking jug R968 were revealed; these should probably be associated with the burial and would date it to LH IIA. The ceramic material from this cairn was first published as Deposit Q.41 No datable vase was found with the burial itself, but the sherds found around and about it are also LH IIA. [These are published as 3638-3643 below. Also found was the cobble 7256. The two vases were presumably deposited during funerary ceremonies. The terracotta tub R967, found on a LH IIA surface at the ne end of wall ni, can hardly be associated, especially as it seems an unlikely grave gift.] 13. This tomb, originally Nu burial 2, 1977, was a shaft grave (see figs 1.60 and 2.10-2.1 1, with plate 24 b-d). The first sign of it, a pit containing a stone surround of the top of its shaft, was not recognised as such when it was first uncovered (see plate 15 a). This stone surround was revealed in Room 2 of the MH III/LH I Structure Nu II just under the level of the floor, although one stone, at the ne, projected well above the floor level. This quadrangle of walls, which are called np, nq, ns and nt, was very roughly built of large stones and of one course only (see fig. 2.10 a and plate 24 b). Its dimensions were c. 2.1 x 1.6 m. For its walls see table 2.2. The shaft itself measured c. 2.2 m (n-s) by 1.5 m at the N and 1.26 m at the s end. The w wall of the tomb was the reused E section of the earlier wall nw, while its E wall cut the end of wall nv; both walls were MH II-III. The n wall of the tomb cut into and damaged the s face of wall nh of the MH I apsidal building Structure Nu I. [The finds from the fill and walls of this tomb included the MH III Late disc medium-coarse Lustrous Decorated jar 2125, found in widely scattered fragments, the phyllite disc 6118, and at least one clay crucible, represented by fragments 6062 and 6064. These and the other objects found in it were not grave goods, but must have originated in a MH III Late floor that was destroyed by the builders of the tomb. The shaft was even cut into EH II levels below ' since many sherds of that date were found in it.] ' 39 So Rutter and Rutter 1076, &lt;*, 10. 40 It is marked 'cist tomb?' in Rutter and Rutter 1976, 4-5 with ill. 2. 41 Rutter and Rutter 1976, 46-60.</page><page sequence="164">X38 W.

The roof of the tomb, which was revealed some 30-40 cm below the level of the stone surround, consisted of four large slabs with E-w axis. Three rows of small stones in the same axis covered the interstices between the slabs (see fig. 2.10 b and plate 24 c). The tomb was lined on three sides with walls of one stone's width, varying in thickness from 15 to 36 cm (fig. 2.10 c). The walls consisted of two courses, 38 to 45 cm in height, and were capped with flat-faced stones to provide a bedding for the massive roofing slabs. The n wall consisted of a single large slab set as an orthostate, with a course of flat stones resting on it that helped to support the N roofing slab. A single thin schist slab, also an orthostate, occupied the s end of the tomb but had no stones above it. When all the overlying stones were removed, a supine adult skeleton (9161), that of an elderly woman, with the skull to the s, was found under a fine loose fill of water-washed earth, the top level of which</page><page sequence="165">THE BRONZE AGE BURIALS §7 139 « PQ II M I* O &lt; h &lt; vT O oi O íZ &lt;D &lt;V &gt; O o o eft H I 'S -S &lt; 3 O CO o '■G c^</page><page sequence="166">140 W. D. TAYLOURt AND R. JANKO started £.25 cm below the slabs (see plate 24 ¿with figs. 2.10 t and 2.11). The lower limbs of the skeleton overlay the projecting socle of the MH I wall nh. The internal dimensions of the grave itself were 1 .74 m N-s by 40 to 46 cm E-w. A refinement in its architecture was the flaring of the walls at the s end to accommodate the broader upper body of the deceased, which lay on a stony, reddish floor. No grave goods accompanied the burial. [Its date has been disputed. The excavator, J. B. Rutter, was sure that the top of its shaft was sealed under the floor of Structure Nu II of the Transitional Period MH III/LH I, and it certainly seems that the N edge of the shaft was not clearly delimited by the red earth just s of the hearth and associated with it. However, several considerations tell against a dating to MH III. The width of the tomb corresponds exactly to the missing length of wall nm, the s wall of Structure Nu II, which was at some date robbed out. Wall nm was cut away for c. 1 .56 m of its length exactly over the surround of the tomb, which is here c. 1.60 m across: the exactitude of the fit is illustrated in fig. 1.60. That precisely this length of nm was removed at a date after the tomb had been constructed seems an unlikely coincidence; economy of hypotheses suggests that wall nm was cut during the construction of the tomb, that the lower-lying portion of the E wall nc was robbed at the same time, and that the outline of the rest of the pit in the MH III/LH I floor was missed during the excavation. In fact, the excavator recorded, during the removal of basket 10, the line of a 'cutting for wall nq', which is plotted on fig. 2.10 ¿z, at top, and may also be visible in plate 13 r, this was surely the N edge of the shaft. The cutting shows that, at least at the N, the grave pit was considerably larger than its stone surround. This fact is of capital importance. If the stones of the surround at first rested on earth that was very soft indeed, this would explain how most of them could eventually have sunk to a depth well below that of the top of the shaft. [Four further arguments support this conclusion. The spread of charcoal near the hearth on the floor of Room 2 was not observed at either the same or at any other depth within the area of the grave; instead, many flecks of charcoal were found in the fill of its shaft, which suggests that it had been dug through the floor. Secondly, except near the hearth only one find was made anywhere on the floor, a pot base just w of wall nm (e) at -1.57 m BM. Thirdly, although most of the stone surround lay below the level of the MH III/LH I floor at c. -1.59 m BM, the stone that formed its ne corner projected 8 cm above this level, being at -1.51 m BM. Lastly, to the s the pit was littered with small- to medium-sized stones of precisely the type from which wall nm was constructed; these surely represent debris from that wall, which was thrown into the pit as it was refilled. [Thus the stone surround of the grave was surely found below the level of the MH III/LH I floor because the fill of the shaft on which it rested, after originally being very loose, had settled considerably. The base of wall nm lay well below the top of the E wall of the surround, wall np. The w wall of the surround, wall ns, partially underlay the bench no and wholly underlay wall nm (w), but consisted only of a single row of large stones, with none of the small stones found in the other walls of the surround. Hence it seems that the bench and wall nm were slightly undercut for the construction. If the tomb does indeed post-date Structure Nu II, it must have been cut into that building soon after it had gone out of use. As C. Zerner noted, LH I/IIA sherds were found in the shaft. Basket 40 of 1977 within it yielded the rim of a fine Matt Painted bichrome goblet (2045) which is LH I/IIA. Basket 47, which also contained material from the shaft, contained sherds of fine Lustrous Decorated cups with dark-on-light decoration of the same date (2081, 2086). These pieces supply the date of the burial. One wonders whether the adjacent burial 12, which was equally elaborate and only slightly later, belonged to the same family group.] 14. This grave, at first known as Nu burial 3, 1977, was a cist type of interment, but stone seems to have been used for two sides of it only, to the N and w, and stones instead of slabs covered the adult skeleton (see the plan, fig. 1.63, and plate 25 a). The w wall was made up of slabs laid against the E face of the N end of the partition wall, wall nz, of the MH I apsidal house Structure Nu I. The s face of the N wall of the house, wall de, had been cut into to provide the N wall of the tomb, and the e side of it was delimited by mudbrick or pisé. A line of small stones marked its s limit. Four large stones and one of medium size (not illustrated) had been laid over the lower part of the body; originally they were probably supported by wooden planks covering the grave. The fill contained few sherds, but a very crude miniature object, the pinch-pot 1888, was found in the neighbourhood of the skull; it is shaped like a thimble. The builders of this cist seem to have been aware of the architecture of the MH I apsidal building, and the inhumation may have taken place shortly after its destruction. [Its date is MH II. The skeleton (9161), that of a 39 year-old but almost toothless woman plate A7.2, was orientated N-s with the skull at the s, and lay on its left side with neck and legs bent forward. The pierced Glycymeris shell 9263, probably used for adornment, was found with it.]</page><page sequence="167">THE BRONZE AGE BURIALS §8 141 15. [This infant burial could not be excavated. Fragments of a tiny skull (9163) were visible in the E baulk of Nu 2, cut into a LH I stratum. The burial lay just over the MH III/LH I wall nm and just under the Medieval ground surface marked by a wash line; see fig. 1.55, at right. It is therefore LH IIA or later; given the number of LH IIIA burials further n in the Area, it may well be of that date.] 8. GENERAL OBSERVATIONS ON THE BURIALS R. Janko (i) Introduction Eighty-eight interments were discovered during the earlier excavations of 1 959-63. 42 This total excludes five that have been restudied in the present publication: Beta burials 1, 20 and 21 and Nu burials 1- 2. The excavations of 1973-77 yielded a further 69 burials; these are listed in table 2.3. The total number of burials is thus about 157; the imprecision is caused by cases where tomb structures survive without human remains. The results obtained from the two phases of excavation differ in three ways. Firstly, numerous interments found in 1959-63 could not be precisely dated, especially within the MH period. The stratigraphy and architecture were often so complex, hard to understand or eroded that one could not tell whether many of those without grave goods were EH, MH or even Early Mycenaean. Moreover, in ! 973-77 the areas dug were concentrated on the sw slope rather than, as before, on the hilltop itself. Lastly, the later seasons probably did not yield even one EH skeleton, but yielded many more of LH date, whereas the earlier campaigns laid bare a number of EH graves but few of the LBA. Thus it appears that the EH cemetery was restricted to Area Alpha, which was again used for burials in the MH period; the tombs in Area Delta and Trial Trench VII ranged from MH to LH I, since none of the three possibly EH graves in Area Delta is certain, and those in Area Beta ranged from MH I to LH III,43 although here EH levels were not reached. This corresponds closely to the pattern of occupation of the site, namely the disuse of the top of the hill for habitation from LH I onwards.44 This abandonment of the hilltop is matched by the use of that area as a cemetery. Evidently graves were interspersed with houses within a small area throughout the whole of the Bronze Age here; it is conceivable, however, that in LH II-III at least some of the adults were buried in an as yet undiscovered cemetery beyond the boundaries of the settlement. It is uncertain how many of the burials were made intramurally inside houses then occupied, since the stratigraphy and the architecture of the site were so complex, and it is often hard to determine whether burials were made during the use of a structure or after its abandonment. However, there are proven instances of the intramural burial of infants from as early as MH I in the case of Eta burial 9 to as late as LH II in that of Lambda burial 15. The result of these differences between the earlier and the later excavations is that little can be added to the picture of EH burial practices at the site, but more can be said about later periods. It is clear, at least, that at all periods of the Bronze Age the orientation of the skeletons, i.e. the direction in which For the head was pointing, was random. In addition, there is no sign of cremation at any period. For a study of the pathology and demographic implications of all the human remains, see below.45 Statistical analysis cannot be applied with any confidence to the data from 1959-63, since many of the 88 interments then excavated are of uncertain date. Restudy of the pottery has brought many some clarifications. Alpha burial 1 is MH I, because the ribbed Dark Burnished bowl HS 12 is of that date.46 Alpha burial 8 is MH, because it contained the pinch-pot 23 13.47 Alpha burial 23 is MH III/ LH I.48 To judge by the accompanying vessels, Alpha burial 31 is probably MH III, because it contained a Matt Painted cup (HS 22).49 Delta burial 7 is datable to MM IIB-IIIA, i.e. MH III Early on the basis of vases 2290 and 2296.50 Since Delta burial 11 displaced the latter,51 it must itself be later perhaps LH I. Beta burial 6 is MH I, and burial 19 may be LH I-IIA.52 Several further interments may be Medieval.53 42 These are tabulated in Taylour 1972, 237-9, witn an analysis at 2 s 7-8. 43 Taylour 1072, 236. 44 See Chapter ia §a fi). 45 Chapter 12 §1. 46 Taylour 1072, 208 with pl. «ob. 47 Taylour 1972, 211. 48 See §8 (iii) below; Taylour 1972, 214-17 with 214 fig. 5 and pl. 4od. 49 Taylour 1072. 210-20 with ni Ana 50 Taylour 1972, 222-4; cf.

JANKO (ii) Early Helladic Among the 157 interments found at the site c. 17, or 1 1%, are certainly or possibly EH, if we count those listed as 'EH or MH' (the infant burial Zeta burial 6 is almost certainly MH I). All are from Area Alpha. Burials Alpha 3, 5, 16-17 and 20 are definitely EH II rather than EH I, and 17 must be dated between the second and third building phases there. The burials, even of adults, seem to be intramural.54 In terms of posture, only one skeleton, Alpha burial 9, an adult possibly EH in date, was laid in an extended position; the remaining nine whose posture could be determined were interred either crouched or contracted. This seems to have been a cultural trait, unless at this early date it simply consumed too much effort to inter the dead at full length. In terms of the type of grave, eight were pits; only two interments possibly of this period were in cists, and a further three, whose dating as EH is not secure either, were in graves with stone surrounds. Both cists and stone surrounds are securely attested for the M H and LH I periods at the site. Thus pits, which take the least trouble to construct, seem to have been the standard form of tomb, and there is no confirmed case of a cist or stone surround. There is no evidence of the later practice of discarding the bones of previous interments to make room for new bodies, of funerary cult or of grave markers. Grave goods were found in eight of these 17 interments, i.e. 47%. Two out of 11 infants and five out of eight adults receive offerings of one or two pots, almost exclusively in open shapes; whether the graves with stone tools and a pair of bronze tweezers are EH is uncertain. A miniature cup was given to the child in tomb Alpha burial 5. Thus offerings were placed in a higher proportion of burials than was later the case. (iii) Middle Helladic The MH interments are the most numerous category. If, among the 88 burials found in 1959-63, we count those of the MH III/LH I transitional phase and those dated to 'MH?', there are 49, to which can now be added a further 25, for a total of 74, i.e. 47% of the 157 burials found at the site. The position in which people were interred differs from the custom in the EBA: of the 37 bodies whose posture could be determined, six bodies are crouched and 16 are contracted, while two burials, one certainly MH, are trussed, a posture that was apparently never imposed on the EH or LH dead; in the case of Eta burial 6, trussing was used to fit the body into its cist.55 Moreover, 14 bodies, i.e. 39%, are laid supine or in an extended position, all from the older excavations. Of these, 1 2 are adults, i.e. 86%, and only two are children or infants. The increase in extended burials may be explained by the gradual abandonment of the top of the hill, where more spacious tombs could now be dug; for the richest burial at the entire site, the extended adult Alpha burial 23, was made there in MH III/ LH I, and derelict parts of MH settlements were sometimes used for burials.56 Multiple burials of very small infants or foetuses are now observed, as is the intramural burial of infants and the reuse of graves, with the bones of the previous occupant disordered or the skull respectfully placed on the cover slab of the grave below.57 Incidentally, I doubt whether the head of Delta burial 8 had been mutilated, as has been suggested,58 since the position of the mandible suggests that the cranium was dislodged from the remainder only after decomposition. The types of grave also change from those used in the EBA. Although pit graves continue in use, accounting for 23 interments (31%), six infant burials are made in jars or pithoi (8%); this type of burial is typically MH. The use of stone to protect the body also increases: it is found in 43% of all MH burials. These proportions are average for intramural cemeteries across the entire mainland.59 Cists were preferred for adults and pits for children, since (if we include the earlier excavations but exclude pithos-burials) 54% of cist burials were for adults but only 40% of pit burials: this is similar to the proportions in the mainland as a whole, where 66% of cists were for adults but only 34% of pits.60 Three entombments, all doubtfully MH, are in trenches with cover slabs, 25 are in cists, and six are in graves with stone surrounds. This type of grave was to develop in LH I-IIA into a full shaft grave with stone cover slabs.61 Two corpses, Epsilon burial 1 of MH III Late and Nu burial 12 of LH IIA, rest on beds of pebbles; these are paralleled in a MH grave at the Menelaion62 and in graves of this date at Mycenae.63 No MH grave markers were observed, although the conditions of excavation make 54 Forsén 1992, 106-7. 55 For parallels see Cavanagh and Mee 1998, 30 n. 97. 56 Cavanagh and Mee 1998, 24. 57 Taylour 1972, 237. 58 Taylour 1972, 224. 59 Cavanagh and Mee 1998, 26. 60 Cavanagh and Mee 1998, 27. 61 See §8 iv) below on Eta burial ik and JNu burial 13. 62 Catling 1981, 16. 63 Alden 2001, 19-20.</page><page sequence="169">THE BRONZE AGE BURIALS §8 143 it possible that some were missed; they are known at Lerna.64 Nor was there any sign of the grave circles known in the Argolid and elsewhere, although the same caveat applies. Grave goods are included in 16 of the MH burials, or 22%, which is less often than in the EH period; since they occur in only four of the 14 extended burials, i.e. 29%, they seem to be no commoner in these than in other types. Of the 16 burials with grave goods, seven, i.e. 41%, are of infants or children. Thus there was, perhaps, a greater readiness to inter children with grave goods than there had been in the EBA; this trend seems to continue in the Mycenaean period. The grave goods in the MH interments often comprise one or two pots, including some closed as well as open shapes, in this differing from the EH graves, where only open vessels were found. Miniature cups were buried with adults in Alpha burial 8 and Nu burial 14, as if these had acquired a symbolic value. Terracotta whorls and phyllite discs also occur with some frequency. The wealthiest burial, Alpha burial 23, is datable to MH III Late-MH III/LH I from the incised Dark Burnished pyxis 2222 found with it; this vase imitates MM III-LM IA vases in serpentine, rather than the Cycladic pyxides which have been adduced.65 The woman buried in this cist was richly equipped, as if to prove the claim that the amount of effort expended on the dead corresponds to their social status.66 She had the pyxis 2222, the goblet 2221, a one-handled cup, a biconical jar or jug, a terracotta spool, a bone needle and much jewellery: a necklace of 14 precious carnelian beads, a bronze dress pin, bronze earrings, a bronze armlet on her upper left arm and a bronze ring on her left hand.67 The adult and child in Alpha burial 28, not precisely dated for lack of pottery but possibly LH I, had a bronze dagger and tweezers, a bone pin and bone toggle, 35 obsidian blades and a chert flake.68 The plentiful objects in these graves contrast with the lack of goods in the LH I/IIA shaft grave Nu burial 13.69 (iv) Late Helladic The Late Bronze Age interments number approximately 19 in the old excavations and 43 in the new, i.e. 62 in total, representing 39% of the 157 burials found at the site. The number of adults and children among the interments declines markedly, especially after LH I; the proportion of infants and neonates rises strikingly in LH IIIAi, and there are few burials of any kind after that. Even so, there were three entombments of children or adults: Beta burial 25, which is LH IIIA, probably IIIAi; Beta burial 19, which is apparently cut through a 'LH IIIB' floor;70 and, a gruesome find, a pit containing a mass grave of four adult skulls and other bones, Beta burials 12-15, which are likewise dated to 'LH IIIB'. In both the latter cases these are probably LH IIIC Early; it has been proposed that the skulls had been 'discarded',71 but they could of course have resulted from a massacre, especially if such an event caused the abandonment of the site in LH IIIC Early. Without a complete exploration of the surrounding area, one cannot be certain whether this later dearth of adults is caused by a demographic shift, e.g. in the incidence of fatal outbreaks of malaria,72 or by a cultural practice, i.e. the segregation of adult burials in a cemetery outside the settlement.73 There is an outcrop of rock suited to the making of chamber or rock-cut tombs sw of the site near the ancient shoreline; some fig trees growing in possible tombs were apparent during a cursory exploration in 1974. Even so, I incline to link the rarity of adult burials with the apparent decline in the extent of the inhabited area, i.e. the abandonment of the hilltop until its short-lived reoccupation in the LH IIIC Early phase. Multiple interments of very young babies or foetuses continue, as does intramural infant burial and the re-use of graves, with the bones of the previous occupant chaotically scattered or, instead, the skull neatly placed on the cover slab of the grave below.74 The new excavations show that this was also true of Beta burial 1, dated to LH IIIAi. To turn to posture, extended burials become even more usual than during the MBA: among the 22 cases where the posture is known, there are 15 extended burials, i.e. 68%, as against only two crouched and four contracted interments, with a further case where the body of an adult was supine but the legs were bent vertically. Moreover, 1 1 of the extended burials, or 73%, are of infants and children, as against only four adults interred in this manner; this reverses the MH custom. 64 Dickinson 1004, 222. 65 Tavlour 1072. 216 and n. fi: Rnttpr 1 n^n 66 Tainter 1078. 67 Taylour 1972, 214-17 with figs. 5-10.

JANKO As for the types of grave, there is no difference in style between the latest MH and the Early Mycenaean burials. One tomb, Delta burial 11, was either rock-cut or a cist, and may be LH I. The LH II pithos burial, Lambda 15, is the last definite instance of this MH type of interment, unless Beta burial 24 is of the same date. Cists became less popular than in that period, accounting for 14 tombs, or 23%, with a further three interments having stone revetments. This type of grave evolved in two cases into a full shaft grave with stone cover slabs: one, Eta burial 15, is dated from its grave goods to LH IIA, while the most impressive shaft grave, Nu burial 13, is LH I/IIA. There is no evidence at all for cists after LH IIIA2, but this may simply accord with the general dearth of burials in LH IIIB- IIIC Early. Conversely, at least 32 burials, i.e. 52%, were in pits, including those dated to LH IIIC Early. One pit, that of Lambda burial 1, was filled with stones. Other graves yielded possible evidence of funerary rites. A burnt jar was in the fill of the LH IIA cist Eta burial 15, a vessel was perhaps in the top of the LH IIIA pit grave Lambda burial 7, and a figurine may have been placed in the fill or on the surface above the LH IIIAi cist Nu burial 4. But the clearest case is the LH IIA cist Nu burial 12, where vases were put at the top of the pit and covered with a cairn of stones, which served to mark the tomb of this little child; compare the cairns and pots over the MH grave 4 at Prosymna,75 the cairns over Graves Xi and Sigma in Grave Circle B at Mycenae, the graves in Circle A there and Grave 1971-3 at Asine.76 The LH I/IIA shaft grave Nu burial 13 also had a grave marker. The top of its shaft was marked by an oblong of stones laid within the edges of the shaft, with a stone platform at the se corner near the head of the burial; the stone surround subsequently sank into the soft fill. Again this is paralleled at Mycenae in Gamma Grave 15. Markers of perishable materials, like the wooden oar that Odysseus puts on the grave of Elpenor,77 may have existed in other cases. Twenty-four of the Mycenaean burials have grave goods, i.e. 39%, a substantial increase on the MBA. Moreover, and again in contrast with MH practice, such goods are notably more frequent in extended burials: of 14 such burials 9, or 64%, have grave gifts. This figure conceals an interesting development: in the Early Mycenaean period, grave goods are common in the graves of adults but not of children, but from LH IIIAi such gifts become standard in the burials of infants and children, whereas not one adult receives anything. There are, however, only eight interments of adults during the entire LBA, six of which were dated to 'LH I?', three of which had grave gifts; these might of course be MH III/LH I. The only such burial that is definitely LH I is Delta burial 4, where an elderly man was entombed with a Vapheio cup and a bronze knife.78 Of 13 infants and children dated to LH I- II, only three are buried with grave goods: thus the child in the shaft grave Eta burial 15 receives two closed vessels, a goblet and a scraper. Subsequently, however, the young become the sole recipients of such gifts: of 35 LH III infant and child burials, 16, or 52%, have grave goods. Ten are given beads, four a figurine, two an askos and one a pendant; two receive both beads and a figurine, one an askos and beads. The sexing of the children seems insufficiently reliable to test the hypothesis that only the girls wore beads. The gift of an askos or feeding-bottle was very common in Mycenaean times.79 Two infant burials are probably Medieval, Beta burials 22 and 29. One definitely Medieval adult burial, Delta burial 25, was found during the earlier excavations, and there may be others.80 Unfortunately, there is no date for the adult skeleton, Delta burial 23, found in a pit with its hands tied behind its back and its feet fastened together; Taylour suggests that 'this seems to have been the burial of some unfortunate who had been executed for some crime against the tribe or against society'.81 Since its chronology is obscure, this interment has been excluded from the statistical analyses. It might merely represent trussing to fit skeleton 9065 into the grave, as C. Duhig suggests.82 75 Biegen 1937, 37. 76 Alden 2001, 25. 77 Homer, Odyssey 12.15. 78 Taylour 1972, 222. 79 Cavanagh and Mee 1998, 36. 80 See Chapter 3 §6 below. 81 Taylour 1972, 226 with pl. 44b. 82 See Chapter 12 §1 (v) below; for parallels see §8 (iii) above.</page><page sequence="171">Chapter 3 The Medieval architecture, stratigraphy and burials W. D. Taylourt and R. Janko [Editor's note: my additions, finalised in 2004, are enclosed in square brackets.] 1. INTRODUCTION: AYIOS STEPHANOS AFTER THE BRONZE AGE [Only a few finds from surface levels suggest any human activity at the site during the two millennia between LH IIIC Early and the Medieval period. These are a worn bronze coin of Faustina II (8082), struck in ad 161-75, two pyramidal loomweights, at least one of which may be Hellenistic (8063-8064), and perhaps the terracotta astragalus 8071, if this is not Medieval. Trench Gamma 1 yielded 8064 and Area Lambda 2 yielded 8071. Both 8063 and 80825 were discovered in Area Zeta (see fig. 3.1). With the latter objects three sherds were found that the excavator, J. G. Younger, deemed Hellenistic. He described them as a roof-tile with lustrous dark paint on one side (this cannot be Medieval, since the tiles of that period are unpainted), a goblet-foot or lid with triple grooves and dark lustrous paint, and a sherd of Local West Slope Ware with incised wavy lines cut into a monochrome ground, minus its white paint. These identifications are unconfirmed. The fact that these objects were found only in parts of the site with Medieval occupation suggests that they may have been brought here by the inhabitants of that time from a humble Roman and possibly Hellenistic site that had existed nearby.1] Although evidence of Medieval occupation was found wherever excavation was undertaken, in only three Areas did architectural remains of that period survive, namely in Zeta, Beta and Lambda, all on the s side of the hill (see fig. iv). Bronze Age walls of inferior workmanship were reused in the upper levels of Zeta. There were Medieval structures in Area Beta. The most substantial walls were uncovered in 1977 in Area Lambda ^Z^.2 Elsewhere only the detritus of buildings survived in the form of fallen stones, mudbrick, tiles and the occasional vase or small object from rubbish pits like those in Areas Epsilon and Eta.3 [This Medieval occupation had been almost entirely ignored during the earlier excavations, when the trench supervisors referred indifferently to Turkish', 'Frankish' and 'Byzantine' material. Since the site was generally free of remains dating from after the Bronze Age, and the excavation was undertaken with that period in view, when later material came to light it tended to be regarded as an encumbrance. Also, although there was some dated Medieval pottery from elsewhere in the Péloponnèse, most notably from Corinth, with which it could be compared, few archaeologists had seen it, while the material from the early British excavations at Sparta was of a somewhat earlier period.4 Accordingly, what was presumably Medieval pottery from Trial Trench VI of 1963 was described as 'modern pottery fragments',5 while the Medieval drain in trench Gamma 1 was dated 'to the nineteenth century or perhaps earlier',6 and its excavator tentatively assigned the building in Gamma 2 to the 'Turkish occupation period'. However, one excavator did ascertain the correct date. In i960 R. Oakley compared the very fine silver denier 8083, whose obverse legend he rightly read as LVDOVICVS REX, to a coin he had seen in Corinth Museum with the same obverse and reverse designs; the latter coin, struck by a Duke of Athens, dated from ad 1280-87. This corresponds exactly to the date for the Medieval phase that was eventually established. However, when 8083 was first published it was described as illegible and possibly Byzantine.7 The denier of Isabella de Villehardouin 8085 was transcribed as 'ISABELLA and tentatively assigned to the Frankish period,8 but not dated more 1 See further Chanter 'a §k (i) below. 2 See §4 below. 3 See §5 below. 4 Dawkins and Droop 1 9 1 1 b. 5 Taylour 1072, 240. 6 Tavlour 10*72. 290. 7 Taylour 1072, 242. 8 Taylour 1972, 260.

Two other Frankish coins, 8086-8087, lay forgotten in the Sparta Museum. Their eventual identification, with that of the further denier 8084, supplied the vital evidence that the Medieval occupation constituted a single phase of relatively short duration.9 [Only in 1973 was interest taken in the Medieval pottery. When the Ephor, G. Steinhauer, visited the site, he assigned the stamnos 4013 to the 7th century ad. In the following year R. Ho well suggested a date in the 1 2th century, comparing the slightly earlier pottery that had just been found at Nichoria.10 Finally G. D. R. Sanders established the correct dating on the basis of material from Corinth and other parallels. The pottery of this phase is published below,11 together with the Medieval small finds and tiles, including some important objects from the earlier excavations.12 There were also at least two and perhaps as many as nine Medieval burials.13] 2. AREA ZETA (fig. 3.1) Fig. 3.1 shows the layout of walls that were all Medieval in their upper courses, but probably of MH and LH III origin; they appear in section in fig. 1.10. The building to which they belonged, uncovered in 1973, is called Structure Zeta V; for their details see table 3.1. These walls were of rubble and similar in construction to those in Area Beta.14 The plan as preserved shows a complicated arrangement of walls with NE-sw axes enclosing both large and small spaces. The largest of these, that in the sw, appears to have been open to the air and was bounded by wall id on the nw and wall ie on the se. It gave access to two small rooms, Room 1 in the N and Room 2 in the e. These rooms shared a common wall, wall ia with nw-se axis, and were divided off from one another by wall ib. Both Rooms 1 and 2 communicated with another room adjacent to them to the nw and se respectively, as well as with one another; this labyrinthine plan was continued to the nw, as is shown by wall ic. Very few tiles were found, and as the size of the rooms is small, some different material must have been used for the roofing, if indeed these rooms were roofed at all. 9 Janko 19820.

Its elevation was about -5.33 m BM. If a line be drawn at either of these levels in fig. 1.10, it will be seen that all the walls shown above the line existed during this phase. The remains of half a hearth were preserved in the centre of the Area, near the entrance to Room 1 . The trodden floor must be associated with it. The hearth had a broad raised rim that was flat on the E side but had a convex curve on the w. The diameter was c. 40 cm. In the vicinity of the hearth were fragments of mudbrick, animal bones, snails and seashells; it also yielded chicken bones (9205) and the claw of a golden eagle (9197). [The presence of this claw might suggest that falconry using eagles, which in Medieval Europe were particularly associated with royal hunts,15 was practised from the site.] Up against the ne corner of wall id was a circular stone platform (plate 25 ¿). This may have been used as a kind of working table, although in its existing form it has a very rough surface. It had a diameter of about 70 cm. The saddle-quern 8073 lay close to the platform and the stone pestle 8074 to the s. The bone pins 8058 and 8059 were also associated with the floor. The head of the former of these, found near wall id, was decorated with grooves. But more important were the remains of seven vessels seen in plate 25 c, some of which could be partly restored. These were the jug 4014, the amphora 4017, which was almost complete and found with the pin 8059, the hydria 4001a, three cooking pots (4002a, 4002b and 4003), the stamnos 4012a and the baking dish or lekane 4001, though only the base of this could be put together. Fragments of an eighth vessel, the jug 4002, were found in the sorting of the pottery from this Area; it is the only one that has a painted design. Five of these pots were found in Rooms 1 and 2, as indicated on the plan, but fragments of the lekane 4001, the jug 4002, the stewpot 4002b and the stamnos 4012a were recovered from the court in the sw. The lid 4003a, possibly Mycenaean in date, and the MH whorl 6025 also came from Room 2. The terracotta loomweight 8062 came from under the floor in Room 1. The pottery and small finds from this Area are listed in table 3.2; their find spots are plotted on fig. 3.1. When the floor was removed, some 10 cm further down, a surface was revealed on which lay concentrations of shells in three groups just to the nw of wall ib. At this level the outline of a pit was observed, which skirted the bases of walls ia, ib and id; in other words, its extent covered almost the whole of Room 1 as far as the stone platform. The depth of the pit was just under 50 cm (see fig. 1.9). It contained animal bones, including those of domestic fowl, more shells and fragments of pottery, including pieces of 4012a, as well as the bowl 4004, the casseroles 4019-4020, the stamnoi 4013 and 4013a and the stamnos lid 4012, which has a pierced knob. Other finds included two terracotta objects, the spindle-whorl 8065 and the bead 8068 (see table 3.2). This rubbish pit, below floor level, occupies most of the room. It would have been filled in and levelled up before the walls were built. [Since all this pottery was broken, these vessels were probably discarded by the builders of the Medieval walls, who dug the pit at that time. The pit also contained a Mactra shell holed from the inside.] The Medieval rooms appear to have functioned for the baking of bread, cooking, weaving, the use of stone implements and other productive efforts in which the stone platform may have played a part. The remains of fish, including spams, turtle, oysters and crab were found on the floor and in the pit. Chicken bones occur, but the only evidence of a carnivore was a tooth, apparently of a dog. The faunal evidence from other Areas shows that the diet consisted of the meat of oxen, deer, sheep and swine. This was supplemented by numerous oysters, fish, of which one variety was spams, chicken, turtle and hare.16 [There was only one period of occupation. Numismatic evidence from other parts of the site shows that this spanned the 13th and early 14th centuries.17 The unstratified find in this Area of four iron arrowheads (8009-8012) accords with historical evidence in indicating that the settlement met a violent end.18 Medieval sherds and objects, including 8046, were also found just under the surface 3 m to the E, in the abortive Trench 1.19] 3. AREA BETA, 1974-77 (fig. 3.2) A very different picture was presented by this Area, which was less than 20 m distant from Area Zeta. Its se corner was first excavated as trench Beta 3 in 1959.20 Area Beta sloped down from nw to se. [In the nw corner of the Area, the Medieval levels were directly above those of Early Mycenaean date 15 Newton loio, 701; Radcliffe 1026.

TAYLOURt AND R. JANKO (see fig. 1.26). The excavator, M. K. Langdon, proposed that any later Mycenaean occupation levels must have been terraced away here to make way for the Medieval buildings. Such terracing also affected the ne sector, as is suggested below. Two architectural phases can be recognised.] Four 'Rooms' were identified as Medieval (fig. 3.2); they belonged to two distinct buildings. Room 1 formed a separate building, Structure Beta VI, on an axis different from that of the other building; only its se corner appeared within the Area. Its well-constructed Medieval walls eh and ei conformed to its Early Mycenaean predecessor, which in turn followed the same orientation and almost identical layout of an earlier building below it of MH II date.21 For its walls see table 3.3 and plate 25 d. No entrance to Structure Beta VI was found, but very little of it was uncovered. Another Medieval wall, wall ec, extended into the area to the s of this building. It may at one time have been a more solid construction than when it was revealed during excavation. As found, it was missing many stones on its NW flank, and it is possible that these were used in the construction of Structure Beta VI. In that case the latter would be the more recent of the Medieval buildings in this Area. The remaining rooms belong to Structure Beta V (see table 3.4), together with the open yards in the sw and ne corners of the Area. Room 2, with walls ea, eb22 (called wall gk in Beta 3, 1959) and ec, was a very long and narrow room, with interior dimensions of 1.7 m by at least 6.1 m. No entrance to it was found, though one may have existed at the se end, which lay under the baulk. Wall eb abutted against the LH IIA Step I at its nw end, shown on fig. 1.23; in this stretch of it, 1.4 m in length, it reached an exceptional depth of 75 cm, but thereafter its depth diminished to c. 45 cm. A pit 25 cm deep was cut into the se corner of the room, by wall eb. It contained many shells. The depth of wall ea was shallow. Its base was some 20 cm above the LH IIIAi surface beneath, but it alone of the walls had a footing or socle projecting 15 cm into the room. Wall ec, the nw wall of Room 2, extended not only to the ne where it was robbed, as has been noted, but also for a distance of over 4 m to the sw, where it was called wall gf in the earlier excavation of Area Beta 7/2/5P It may have been a terrace wall. [Another wall, wall gg, ran exactly parallel to wall gf; together, these walls may have delimited an alley 1.25 m wide. [The collapse of Room 2 left a distinct mound, visible in the section of the s baulk: see fig. 1.24 stratum 2. The fact that no wash-line is recorded within the confines of Room 2, whereas such a line ran right along the remainder of the s and E baulks (see fig. 1.24 strata 3 and 5 with fig. 1.25 stratum 2), supports the assumption that Room 2 was roofed, whereas the spaces in the sw, se and ne corners of the Area were open to the sky.] Room 3 was formed by walls gl, el, ex and ee; the last was called wall gm in Beta 3, 1959. For the walls of this small square room, only 2.6 m in its exterior dimensions and half of that inside, see fig. 3.2 and table 3.4. [Wall ex, which seemed to delimit the se terrace of the Early Mycenaean period,24 just ran over the corner formed by the earlier walls ey and fc (see figs. 1.28 and 1.31) and continued to the w as wall ef, which was much thinner and of different construction; but the excavator, R Wright, was certain that their lower courses bonded, which suggests that wall ex was in fact built in the Medieval period. A layer of mudbrick 1 1 cm thick was found in situ over the E corner formed by walls ee and ex. This was at first thought to have been a pisé floor, but it was surely a remnant of the Medieval superstructure. The room probably had an extremely narrow entrance, 30 cm wide, in its sw corner at the se end of wall gl, where the wall appears to have been only two stones wide; this was probably a threshold. This stoutly built room was evidently the base of a tall structure, probably a bell-tower or dovecote rather than a watch-tower, since the main building was nearer the summit of the hill. The roof from which a bell could have been hung or the doves' niches harvested would have been accessible from the interior by using a ladder. Dovecotes, square in plan and often with ledges for the doves to perch on and with elaborately ornamented roofs, are common in the islands. However, no bones of pigeons have been recognised at the site.25] Wall ee continued north-eastwards into the e baulk; this extension of it is called wall ff (see the plan, fig. 3.2, and fig. 1.25 for the section). Another wall qa, of equally massive thickness, bonded with the sw corner of wall ee and continued into the s baulk (see fig. 1.24). But there was no further investigation in either direction. [Wall qa was either the corner of another room on the same nw-se orientation or simply a rectangular stone platform, which might have served as the base of a flight of wooden steps.] 21 See Chapter i §4 (iv) (c) above. 22 For evidence that wall eb is Medieval rather than LH 111 in date see Chapter 1 §4 (ii) above. 23 Tavlour 1072, 256 with 231 fig. 15e. 24 See Chapter 1 §4 (iii) (c) above. 25 See Chapter 12 §3 below.</page><page sequence="175">THE MEDIEVAL ARCHITECTURE, STRATIGRAPHY AND BURIALS §3 149 BETA 9/ 10 BETA 10, 1974 Bß^ BETA 9, 1974 ROOMI t^Ç'base ' ' iïa/W^ ' surface ^r'zw^' ''1A/ ^' '■ ' ' (+ %~^ COURTYARD c. -2.00 ^ y' ^ql V^+I 1 99 /-S&gt; base -2.52 VwVkK rj Xg)--^ base -2.07 / (/&gt;O^-N/ : • -2.72 ^^Y/'^9^j We"L97 base-2l6X^:92/^surface l ! ^WiV "2"20 i^^%ir C'"2I9? : !; ^^^A^ BAULK 1977 //v° VT^' : ^^CO^ Surface 1977 '^^Ç^C^^^^STK' ": : : COURTYARD? ^¿/^^fpv!44 c-2.08 surfaced /Wv^^^^k '' [ (R°°M 4) ^^^^V. ^[^ B ^Pb2.3e| bXS^x ! ^y b2SS'^f JP^ &gt;^X^N -2.56^'e^/&gt;^K: : ^ase AVe' j ^^ íT' I/O l/'7' L//&gt;k T /aa( ) &gt;^ ; -I-"7 KQf) ROOM 2 baseCNOc&gt;^ x^S^^x room 2 ^^ni ^ìVv ^^ V^&gt; yX / CT^/5^ BAULK 'X^^^ I ^mJ^^&gt;v passage XÍ^Ç /Y/y^'^ ^Yw^^ : • ^vu&gt;^k!8 doorV^^^V^2-31 ^HWS/V^Ovk?'^7 ^ ^ ^"^^X^v^T^^N^ WAY ('/( Á. surfece COURTYARD ^Xin^ [ [ ^X^^' basVi^6^^)^ ~2A1 I surface c. -2.24 ^ t^^+T^'6] ^^ ' ^ i surface c. -2.40 bas^tSöS ^-- - A^^ j(, P[t 11 ^ B- C ^-J h= ^ ^^ ' .2.56 y ' T BETA 8, 1 974 BETA 8 / 3 BETA 3. 1 959 A A1 BAULK, 1977 Fig. 3.2. Area Beta 3/8/9/10. Plan of rooms of Medieval Structures Beta V and VI, showing location of sections (figs 1.24-1.26). Room 4 lay se of wall ef and nw of wall eb (see fig. 3.2). [It was delimited to the nw by wall ec, to the ne by wall ef, to the se by wall el, and to the sw by wall eb, with a passageway 70 cm wide in the se corner. The interior dimensions of Room 4 were 3 x 1.6 m. It seems likely that wall ec, the end of which had been robbed out or eroded away, once formed a corner or doorway with a nw extension of wall ef, now robbed out. In any case, the shared alignment suggests that Room 4 was in use at the same time as Room 2.] The NE Sector of the Area (see fig. 3.2 and plate 6 d) was bounded to the sw by walls ef and ex, to the nw by wall eg, and by the N and E baulks. Wall ef lay to the ne of the Early Mycenaean walls ej and fc, parallel to them and only divided from them by a narrow gap. Wall ef continued to the wnw the line of wall ex and bonded with it. At its nw end it was abutted by wall eg, with a hollow structure fh built in the angle against its ne face. Both wall ef and fh overlay the Mycenaean wall fe. [When the stones of fh were removed they were found to contain LH IIA sherds, but these supply only a terminus post quern for its construction. This 'hollow structure' was not a robbed cist grave, since no bones were found in it; hence it seems likely to have been a bench. Since walls ef and eg were not removed and no occupation levels associated with either were recognised, their dating is uncertain. Both walls lay over the LH IIA alley Street Beta IV,26 and its se flank, wall eo. Since the alley, wall eo and the paved courtyard to which it led went out of use in LH IIIAi, it follows that these walls were built no earlier than then. Although W. D. Taylour deemed them LH III walls reused in Medieval 26 See Chanter i $a (''') (a) *Krwo</page><page sequence="176">150 W. D. TAYLOURt AND R. JANKO times, they match the Medieval plan so well that they should be interpreted as entirely Medieval constructions. If this interpretation is correct, the LH III levels in this sector were entirely removed, so that these walls appeared to be adjacent to Early Mycenaean strata. They are most easily understood as having formed a rectangular walled garden with a bench in the corner. As the bench faced ne, it would have been well shaded from the sun. No Medieval occupation levels were observed within this enclosure, a fact that may support this interpretation. Wall ff, a solidly built north-eastern continuation of wall ee, formed the se boundary of the enclosure.] No floors could be recognised in any of the Rooms, although every effort was made to identify them; neither did they show up in section. Everywhere throughout the Area there was a clear distinction in soil between the Medieval and Mycenaean levels, the latter showing up as light brown against the darker soil above (see figs. 1.24-1.26). The break occurred at 30 to 35 cm below the top of the walls, roughly at the point where the floors of the rooms should have been found, for the pottery below it was almost invariably pure Mycenaean. [This lack of a clearly defined surface is explicable if the area was churned up by domestic animals - sheep, oxen, horses, asses, mules, pigs or chickens - which were kept there. These bones were very common among the faunal remains.27 Compare the lack of an observable floor in Structure Lambda VII.28] The Medieval walls were of rubble, the largest stones averaging about 30 cm in length. Stones of greater size were often used for the foundations. Walls eh and ei of Structure Beta VI were the best constructed, wall el of Structure Beta V the least so. As a rule, the walls did not run to more than two courses. The excavator, P. Wright, reported that foundation trenches for them were cut into the Mycenaean levels. The superstructure of the walls was probably mudbrick; there seemed to be traces of dissolved mudbrick in the soil. Tiles were very plentiful in the upper levels. The majority of these probably belonged to the buildings, but others may have come from structures on higher ground to the N. None of the Medieval ware could be made up into any kind of pot, except the plain-ware stand 4042, which was built into wall ea. Of small objects there were only scraps of bronze, iron and lead, and an occasional piece of worked bone, including perhaps the awl 7001. We have little clue therefore as to the activities that took place in this Area. For the pottery and small finds from here see table 3.5. [Two infant burials, Beta burials 22 and 29, are probably of Medieval date: these were interred in stone cists.29] The period of occupation, according to coins found in this vicinity during the earlier excavations, is confined to the later 13th and early 14th centuries ad. [Two unworn billon deniers, 8086 of Philip of Taranto, Prince of Achaia in ad 1307-13, and 8087 of his successor Maud of Hainault, who reigned until ad 1321, came from the surface of Beta 3 in 1959, i.e. the se corner of the Area, in the vicinity of Room 3; these probably date from just before the destruction of the settlement. Glazed sherds found with the iron knife 8012a in Beta 7 in i960 confirm that occupation extended further to the nw.] 4. AREAS NU / GAMMA 1, GAMMA 2, LAMBDA 2 AND LAMBDA (figs. 3-3-3-4) The substantial foundations of a building of the Medieval period, Structure Lambda VII, were uncovered in Area Lambda 3/4 in 1977. This appears in plan in fig. 3.3 and in section in figs. 1.50- 1.52. Structure Lambda VII was initially interpreted as a church.30 It was associated with a spacious courtyard, of which two walls, forming the sw corner, were excavated in Area Lambda 2 in 1974. For a plan of the whole complex see fig. 3.4. The courtyard will be discussed first. In 1974 the removal of the topsoil in Area Lambda 2 revealed a well-built wall, lg, with roughly sw-NE axis. Tiles and glass found in it showed that it was of Medieval date. Wall lg continued north- eastwards and reappeared in trench Lambda 3, where it was called wall ma. This long wall delimited the se side of the courtyard. At its w end wall lg made a right angle with another wall, wall Ik, of similar construction, which proceeded in a north-westerly direction. The walls are seen in plan in fig. 1.46 and in section in fig. 1.47; their details are given in table 3.6. Again in that year, a minute section of wall, here called nj, was revealed in the sw corner of Area Nu / Gamma 1 and was recognised as the nw extension of wall Ik. These walls were all part of the enceinte of the Medieval courtyard, which occupied the whole of Area Nu / Gamma 1 and the nw corner of Area Lambda 2, as well as the w part of Lambda 3 (fig. 3.4). Within the angle of the two walls in the sw corner of the yard, walls lg and Ik, appeared another short wall, called li, with the same axis as lg. Its width was 60 cm as against 80 but cm for walls lg and Ik. Wall li was thought at first to have been a reinforcement of the former wall, but it is more likely to have existed in its own right as a bench, as R. Janko interpreted it; for it lay against 27 See Chapter 12 §§2-3 below. 28 See §4 below. 29 See §6 below. 30 Catling 1978, 32, followed by Wagstaff 1982, 58.</page><page sequence="177">THE MEDIEVAL ARCHITECTURE, STRATIGRAPHY AND BURIALS §4 151 the se wall of the courtyard and, indeed, in that position offered repose and protection from the midday sun. [Compare the orientation of the bench fh in the corner of the courtyard in Area Beta.31] The upper levels over the courtyard in Area Nu / Gamma i were c. 40 cm in depth and were filled with a lot of Medieval debris: medium and small fallen stones, a good number of tiles, and scattered patches of white plaster and light brown earth, the latter representing disintegrated mudbrick. These were found at the same level as the fallen stones, but lower down also (see the sections, figs. 1.50- 1.52, stratum 2). There were several fragments of glazed pottery, from which it was possible to make up the lower part of a brown-glazed closed vessel, 4093. The line of what was taken to be decayed mudbrick sloped up slightly from E to w in the section of the N face of trench Nu 1 (see fig. 1.58), and this may reflect the sloping ground surface in Medieval times. The courtyard had a rough floor of pebbles. It was at a level some 30 cm lower than that of the floor inside the associated building, i.e. Structure Lambda VII to the E. In the centre of the courtyard, actually in the se corner of Area Nu / Gamma 1, was a pit, Pit I (figs. 1.53 and 3.4). In it were found several sherds belonging to the brown-glazed vase 4093 which had been uncovered further n in Area Nu / Gamma 1 . [This pit was dug to rob stone from the Bronze Age walls for constructing the bench li not far away in the sw corner of the yard, since Lambda 1974 basket 24 from the bench and Nu 1974 basket 28 from Pit I contained sherds from the same Mycenaean vessel.] A drain in the ne corner of trench Gamma 1 is associated with the courtyard. [This drain, formed by walls db and dc, was some 1.25 m wide and built of a single course of large stones in three rows.32 It was lined with tiles. It ran wsw to ene for 1.6 m into the e baulk of the NE Extension. The drain channelled rainwater into a well or cistern at its w end, with a stone surround to the sw and a curved stone slab forming the lip of the se side of the well-head. This structure was only excavated for a depth of 25 cm; excavation ceased before its base was reached. The well underlay the stratum of white lime, tiles and yellow mortar derived from the destruction of Structure Lambda VII.33 [The well contained the unusual object HS 299. The latter is incised on top with three circles arranged as a triangle and underneath with a cross with a dot in each angle, and is in fact a terracotta stamp for holy bread. When published it was dated 'Byzantine (?)'.34 The similar stamp HS 261, bearing the same design underneath, was found in i960 to the N in a surface level in trench Alpha 8. This was termed 'probably Medieval';35 it has since been republished as a Bronze Age seal.36 However, it is probably not of Bronze Age date. The presence of these finds may indicate that there was already, somewhere on the site, a building with an ecclesiastical function in the Orthodox Church, perhaps a precursor to the chapel of St Stephen after which Ayios Stephanos is named. The terracotta burnisher (?) HS 298, found s of the drain in a mainly Bronze Age level, could be Medieval; so could the whorl HS 297. 37 A shallow circular pit, Pit II, lay to the sw of the well. This pit contained the delicately worked bone spindle-whorl or button 8061.] The yard was perhaps intended for the herding of animals brought in at the end of the day. The compound, although apparently open to the nw, could certainly have been fenced in on that side. Its full extent could not be ascertained. One must suppose that its plan was rectangular to conform with the sw-NE axis of the building, but there was no trace of a wall parallel to the se wall when Area Nu / Gamma 1 was excavated. [Presumably it lay to the nw of the drain and soakaway in the NE Extension, but how far beyond is unknown. The cist grave containing an infant found within the courtyard, Nu burial 6, might perhaps be Medieval, but as it was not excavated its date can be inferred only from stratigraphie evidence, and it is more likely to be LH IIIA.38] The foundations of the house to which the courtyard belonged, Structure Lambda VII, were revealed in Lambda 3. They consisted of six solidly constructed piers of large stones cemented with white lime plaster sunk in foundation trenches and symmetrically laid out in two rows of three. For the plan see fig. 3.3 with plate 26 b' the details of the walls are included in table 3.6. Although the axis of these walls was nw-se, the relationship of the walled-in courtyard to the house suggests a sw-ne axis for the whole complex. Five of the piers were linked with one another by low-standing walls of dry-stone, of which only two courses survived. These were built on the ground surface and abutted against the piers. [The wall connecting Piers I and VI to the nw, wall mf, was particularly insubstantial, since it consisted of a single row of large stones (plate 26 cand fig. 3.3). If the ground floor was intended for human use, 31 See §3 above. 32 Taylour 1072, 230 fis:.

Area Lambda 3/4. Plan of Medieval Structure Lambda VIL wall mf cannot have been an external wall, and the building must have extended further to the nw. However, since it served to house animals, as will be argued below, no such conclusion can be drawn.] The two north-easternmost piers had no connecting walls. Thus two gaps were left for access to the ground floor of the building from the ne. Pier IV had an abutment resting on the floor surface against its se flank (plate 26 d). Pier V had a similar construction on its nw side. In this manner the space between the two was narrowed to 72 cm. It may be that these abutments were the foundations for a doorway (fig. 3.3). [The excavators, G. D. R. Sanders and J. Motyka Sanders, rightly remark that the existence of a door is confirmed by the presence of a posthole, 40 cm deep and 16 cm in diameter, against the se corner of the abutment to Pier IV.] The superstructure borne by the piers, which must have been much higher than they are now, probably consisted of arches supporting a flat ceiling of rafters on which would have been laid the floor of the room above. [The walls were whitewashed inside and out, and the ceiling was coated also; the layer of whitewash fallen from it was at first mistaken for a floor and called Floor 1 (see the section, fig. 1.51 stratum 2). In the yard the white plaster was mixed with tumble from the walls. Pier IV collapsed neatly to the ne, and the roof fell in on top of it (see the section, fig. 1.50 stratum 3).] The house was roofed with tiles. A vast mass of these filled the upper levels of the excavation (see the sections, figs. 1.50-1.52). The tiles were distributed not only throughout the earth over the floor of the building, but to an even greater extent over the yard to the sw. As the excavators suggested, this indicates that the house had a pitched roof from which falling tiles slid into the yard. [One side of it presumably sloped down to the sw; fewer tiles fell within the building itself.] A number of floors were noted during excavation of the Area. Floors 2 and 3, which were Medieval, were found to be contemporary with each other. The floor of the building was of hard-trodden earth. There was a posthole at least 1 1 cm deep in the centre of the room (fig. 3.3); its purpose is unknown. Nothing was found in it. [Some patches of white plaster lay under the occupation level; see the section,</page><page sequence="179">THE MEDIEVAL ARCHITECTURE, STRATIGRAPHY AND BURIALS §4 153 Fig. 3.4. Areas Nu/Gamma 1, Gamma 2, Lambda 2 and Lambda 3/4. Plan of Medieval Structure Lambda VII and courtyard. fig. 1.50, stratum 5. Their presence suggests that the floor was originally plastered, but that the plaster had worn away over much of the surface by the time when the building was destroyed. Joins among the sherds prove that the floor sloped down from the N.] No complete pots were found in situ, but from the widely scattered fragments it was possible to put together partially five pots, the most complete one of which is the amphora 4073, of the same type as one found in Area Zeta, 4017. Two vases are decorated. One, the cylindrical vessel with panelled design 4053, turns out to be an Archaic Maiolica jug imported from central or northern Italy. The other is the base of a closed vessel covered with a brown glaze, published as 4093 below; this vase came from Area Nu / Gamma 1 . The other two pots are the cooking basin 4077 and the base of a Taffy- ware stamnos 4066. [The latter was found against the nw corner of Pier III (see plate 27 a). The pots were concentrated in the s part of the yard, and none was recorded to the N. However, retention was less complete in 1959, when its N sector was dug. The vessels were mostly for cooking and storage.] Study of the pottery revealed a certain number of joins between widely dispersed sherds. Those that enabled 'whole' pots to be registered came from the upper levels, and it was noticeable that, with two exceptions, these vessels all came from the courtyard. The decorated vase 4053 must have fallen from a storey above; sherds of it were found inside the building, even though the rest of them was discovered outside. Other similar joins support the interpretation that this vase was in an upper storey when the ceiling collapsed, as the building burned down. There were no registered pots from Area Lambda 2, i.e. the sw corner of the yard, but large fragments of two cooking pots (not kept) came from there. It must be assumed that all this broken pottery was household ware thrown into this corner of the yard.</page><page sequence="180">154 w* D- TAYLOURt AND R.

From the destruction levels over the building came the bone pin with a grooved head 8060 and the horse shoe 8017; from the yard came the metal clothes button 8007, the iron hinge 8044, the base of a metal box 8045, the stamnos handle with Frankish graffito 8069, the iron knife 8014, and bits of glass, lead and copper. A quantity of iron nails of different shapes was found widely scattered. The pots and small finds are listed in table 3.7. The staple diet was the meat of oxen, sheep and swine, with some venison, boar and hare, and rodents appear to have been a pest in the house.39 Several chicken bones are recorded among the fauna collected in these Areas (9202-9204). As in the other two sectors of the site discussed above, fish played an important part in the diet. There is again mention of spams supplemented by crab, Donax and cockles.40 Ornamental shells were popular: Tonna, Murex trunculus and Glycymeris have been identified.41 An olive pip (9283) was recovered from the yard in Area Nu / Gamma 1. [Burned equid bones and sawn fragments of deer antlers were also found there.42] As was mentioned above, among the lower levels of Medieval pottery that preceded the building of the house and courtyard was found the billon denier 8084 of Charles I of Anjou, Prince of Achaia, struck between ad 1278 and 1 285. It was discovered in the make-up of the courtyard between Piers II and III. In the neighbouring Beta trenches, not so far distant, three other Frankish deniers, 8085- 8087, came to light in surface levels during the 1959 and 1963 excavations. These date between ad 1297 and 1321. [The depth at which 8084 was found suggests that the terminus post quern for the construction of the building is ad 1 278, unless this coin was trampled into the surface of the courtyard after the building had been erected. The denier 8085, dated ad 1297-1301, was found on the surface of the Beta 1 2 n baulk, approximately 8 m s of this building. It could have come down the slope from this sector, but there was occupation closer at hand in trench Beta 6.43 Coins 8086-8087 are from trench Beta 3, which lay further e.] From these coins one can deduce that the house and courtyard were built during a period that covered the late 13th and early 14th century. It does not appear to have had a long life. Much of the Medieval pottery is badly burnt after fracture and has joins with unburnt pieces. Moreover, there was definite evidence of ash, melted lead (8050-8051) and burnt mudbrick in the yard, especially in Area Nu / Gamma 1. [Structure Lambda VII was destroyed by fire, whereas the buildings in Areas Zeta and Beta were simply abandoned. This may suggest that Structure Lambda VII constituted, or formed part of, the most important building at the site, whereas the other buildings were less significant. On the likely historical context of this destruction see below.44] The plan and style of Structure Lambda VII recall the tower-houses of the Mani, except that the building had only one storey for human occupancy. As in the Mani, the ground floor would have been reserved for the smaller animals such as poultry, pets and so on. Room could also be made for a donkey or other beast of burden; as was noted above, a horse shoe, 8017, was recovered from the soil. [Ian Harvey suggested in a letter to W. D. Taylour that it was a farmhouse like those still widely found in Laconia. A series of piers would have supported an upper storey, perhaps on arches, with a flat ceiling of rafters laid across. The upper storey was of mudbrick, and the entire structure had whitewashed walls and ceilings. Blocking walls between the piers were used to confine animals in the lower storey. The tops of the blocking walls could have been left open for light and ventilation; on the nw side there was only the insubstantial dry-stone wall mf to confine the animals. The people would have lived above, the animals below, where provisions and implements would also have been stored. The stabling of animals will explain the partitioning of its s corner by means of the pier abutments and postholes. This will also account for the erosion of its floor before its destruction: under Pier IV pure Early Mycenaean levels survive to an elevation 25 cm higher than in the surrounding spaces (see the section, fig. 1.50), and wall mf has its base 15 cm above the Medieval floor. There was probably an external built oven for cooking. The walled yard would have been used at night for the animals. The reservoir in it, served by the drain, collected rainwater during the winter for use during the summer months. [Byzantine houses at Mistra offer a good analogy. There 'the family led its life on the first, or upper, floor, while the lower, or ground floor was used as a store room or stable . . . Often part of the vaulted ground floor, the diavatikón, was used for transients. The upper floor consisted of one spacious room, the triklinon, with large windows all round and many niches which served as cupboards. The houses often had balconies which projected ... All the openings are arched, or are surrounded by an arched lintel. Thus the arch constitutes the principal element in the houses of Mystras. The roof was always 39 See Chapter 12 §2 and Appendix 8. 40 See Chapter 1 2 §§4-5 below. 41 See Chapter 12 §5 (ii) and table 12.20. 42 See Chapter 12 §2 and Appendix 8 (d), (k). 43 See §f, below. 44 Chapter 14 §5 (ii).</page><page sequence="181">THE MEDIEVAL ARCHITECTURE, STRATIGRAPHY AND BURIALS §4 155 gabled'.45 There are buildings of similar or only slightly later date at Mouchli in Arcadia.46 A different parallel for the style of construction, suggested by G. D. R. Sanders, is the large oblong building, dated to the second quarter of the 12th century, in the sw corner of the forum at Corinth.47 This too consisted of large piers, here at 2 m intervals, with blocking walls between, laid in foundation trenches. Its total dimensions were c 22.5 m by f. 10 m. This was the largest secular building in Byzantine Corinth. Structure Lambda VII was not similar in form to the Frankish towers of central Greece, but may, like them, have been the centre of a subordinate fiefdom.48] The full extent of the building is not known. It may have extended north-eastwards into trench Gamma 2, which was excavated in 1959. [This trench, only 1.0 m N of Lambda 4 and 5.0 x 1.5 m in extent, contained a building, Structure Gamma I, which was considered 'fairly recent',49 and was in fact Medieval (see fig. 3.4 and plate 27 b). According to a sketch made at the time by the excavator, R. Hope Simpson (no plans or sections were drawn), it contained a rectangular corner of two massive walls, some 90 cm thick, which lay just under the surface. One, now called wall pa, ran nw-se from the s baulk, while the other, wall pb, ran at right angles sw-ne into the n baulk. Although no such details were recorded at the time, plate 27 b shows that they were made of at least five courses of massive squared blocks (the best masonry found anywhere on the site at any period), and were preserved to a height of about 1.25 m. To the E of these walls, the sketch depicts a T-junction of less substantial walls, which do not join the others within the trench: one, wall pc, ran se-nw into the n baulk and was c. 32 cm thick, whereas the other, wall pd, ran sw-ne and was c. 40 cm thick. The latter wall extended into the s and e baulks. All the walls contained white lime mortar (see table 3.8). Plate 27 b even shows that a built drain ran through the foundation of one wall close to where it joins the other. However, the details are unclear, because the records are confused: plate 27 b is said to have been photographed from the w, but does not match the plan, and I believe that it may have been taken from the E after an (unrecorded) removal of walls pc and pd. There is no record that any of these impressive walls was removed, and it is unfortunate that no further investigation of them was undertaken. [Although the walls of Structure Gamma I were on roughly the same alignment as those of Structure Lambda VII and were almost certainly contemporary with them, they were sketched as being slightly off-axis in relation to the latter building. It is not certain that this is correct. If there is an error in the alignment of the drawing, it is possible that wall lx continued north-eastwards beyond Pier V to form the outer wall of the building. An upper 'white cement floor', some 30 cm below the surface, should be interpreted as whitewash from the collapsed ceiling and walls, as in Structure Lambda VII. Tiles were plentiful in the destruction levels, as were the remnants of carbonised beams; the tiles imply a pitched roof. The lower 'cement floor', some 70 cm below the upper one, probably represents the actual Medieval floor, as can be seen in section in trench Lambda 3, fig. 1.50 stratum 5. Just as in that trench, the foundations rested on Early Mycenaean levels, with some sherds dated to LH IIIC Early. No whole pots or small finds are recorded from trench Gamma 2. [It is possible that the two Structures formed a single oblong building with its long axis running ne- sw, with a timber upper storey and tiled roof. When the line of the drain that directed water into the cistern or well is projected to the se, it meets the centre of what could be reconstructed as an entrance or gateway, c. 3 m. wide, between Pier V and a missing pier opposite (see fig. 3.4). If there was a gateway here, rather than a solid wall formed, like wall lx, by piers with blocking, it would have been wide enough for horse-drawn vehicles to be brought into the yard and would have been closed by a pair of heavy wooden doors fitted with iron (cf. perhaps the iron hinge and fitting 8044-8045). If the gateway was open to the sky, the drain can be supposed to have turned so that it ran south-eastwards along the middle of the entrance-way. A drain in this location could have caught rain that flowed off roofs on either side with their ridges aligned on a nw to se axis; as we saw above, the roof of Structure Lambda VII certainly had one pitch that faced sw. In this case the two adjacent buildings could have been a pair of gatehouses with living quarters above. [If, however, there was a single building, its se wall could have been completed by a wider arch supported on piers. This arch could have presented a solid front to the exterior, since the arches could have been walled up almost to their full height; otherwise it could have incorporated a large double gate. An upper storey, supported by stout beams resting on the arches, would have provided a suitably spacious living area, at least c. 5.3 m wide by 10.5 m long. This storey was probably built of mudbrick, wattles and plaster. It is likely to have had windows fitted with solid wooden shutters; conceivably it 45 Chatzidakis 1 08 1 . 11 n-ç»Q 46 Moutsopoulou iq8r. 47 Robinson 1962, 98-102 with fig. 3. 48 Lock 1986. 49 Taylour 1972, 230, 252.</page><page sequence="182">156 W. D. TAYLOURt AND R. JANKO had one or more wooden balconies or overhangs with wooden supports, like the houses at Mistra described above. The upper floor could have been reached by an exterior flight of stone steps at the rear; such an arrangement would have afforded additional possibilities for defence. The tiled roof would have had a long ridge on a sw to ne axis and four pitches, two on its longer sides to the nw and se and two on its shorter sides to the sw and ne. Rainwater that fell on the nw pitch of the roof could have been channelled by the drain into the cistern. [If, however, Structure Lambda VII and Gamma I were separate buildings, Gamma I could perhaps be reconstructed as the base of a tower with a groined vault and a masonry superstructure, which would have offered great solidity.50] 5. OTHER AREAS [In the old Beta trenches between Area Lambda/Beta 12 and Area Beta of 1974-77 to the ne of it (see fig. 1.34), at least two walls may be of Medieval date. The first is the ne-sw wall Is, the presence of which was revealed in 1974 by erosion in the Beta i2B/Beta 11 baulk; the end of this wall overlies the point where the LH III walls ga and hm join; these walls were disused in LH IIIC Early. The second is the e-w wall hd that protrudes into the nw corner of trench Beta 6, excavated in i960 (see fig. 1.35). [Trench Beta 6 yielded many finds. These included a complete unpainted jug, HS 125,51 and a characteristic amphora base with concentric ridges, 4081a. The jug was found in a pit, which was interpreted as possibly an oven because it appeared to contain burnt mudbrick, near the n baulk (plate 27^). Bronze objects comprised the ring and hook 8004, perhaps from a harness, and the strip 8006. Two iron nails (8oi9a-b) may attest a nearby roof. There were many signs of fire, including burnt stone, ash and mudbrick, but not, apparently, white lime plaster. Given the apparent absence of tile, this was probably an open space.] The Medieval cooking pot 4081b was found in the soil that had been washed into trench Beta 12B between 1963 and 1973. [It probably came down the slope from trench Beta 6. The denier 8085 of Isabella de Villehardouin came to light just to the s in the Beta 1/1 2 A baulk. From lower down the slope in trench Beta 11 there came the buckle 8001, which is embossed with an elaborate design of fleurs de lys, and the fire-steel 8008, which may likewise be a West European artefact.] Occupation of the top of the hill is attested by the silver denier 8083, minted for Louis VIII or IX at Tours between ad 1223 and 1266; this was found in a surface level in trench Alpha 10 during the i960 excavations (see fig. 14.12). [Just to the sw in trench Alpha 8 was found the terracotta stamp for holy bread HS 26 1.52 To the E, trench Alpha 3 had two rubbish-pits with burnt matter and bones, which yielded the lid or lamp 4102. Another deep pit was cut down 1.3 m through Early Helladic levels all the way to bedrock in the E-central part of Area Eta, about 10 m se of Area Alpha. This pit, shown in plan in fig. 1.15 and in section in fig. 1.22, yielded no small finds at all. Medieval pottery was found in the upper levels of Area Delta and in Trial Trench VII, where several burials are probably of this phase. However, it is doubtful whether the built drains in trenches Beta 11 and Delta 12, together with the contemporary walls bp and bq in the latter, could have belonged to this period rather than to LH IIIC Early. A 'remarkable' amount of presumably Medieval pottery was found in Trial Trench VI, which was dug in 1963 in the north-easternmost extremity of the site, with possible traces of a fortification wall;53 the 'soapy' and heavily wheel-ridged sherds recorded from there were probably Taffy ware. Thus the fortification of the site, an important but debated question, could have taken place in the Medieval period rather than during the LH IIIC Early phase.] A further rubbish pit existed in Area Epsilon, Pit A. Containing pieces of glass and many shells, it was cut down through the LH IIIC Early wall kc to a depth of at least 1 .3 m (see the plan, fig. 1.2). Its bottom was not reached. This pit contained the iron knife blade 8013 and the terracotta whorl 8066. In it was also found the pottery pendant 7059, which appears to be Mycenaean. In plan the pendant has the shape of an axe and is pierced with a hole at the narrow end. [Area Epsilon was probably cultivated or waste ground associated with the occupation of the adjacent Area Zeta. The finds from all the above Areas are listed in table 3.9.] 50 On the function of this complex see further Chapter 14 §5 (ii) below. 51 Taylour 1972, 260 with pl. 50e. 52 See §4 above; Taylour 1972, 243 with pl. 5ie-f. 53 Taylour 1972, 249-50.</page><page sequence="183">THE MEDIEVAL ARCHITECTURE, STRATIGRAPHY AND BURIALS §6 157 6. THE BURIALS [W. D. Taylour believed that all the interments found in the earlier excavations were of Bronze Age date. There are, however, at least two exceptions that are definite and seven more that are probable or possible. See the period plan, fig. 14.12.] Delta burial 25 was the well-preserved skeleton of an adult.54 This narrow cist grave was covered with large slabs. Only around the skull was the grave supported by masonry, consisting of four flat stones resting on upright slabs, two on each side. It was on the stones protecting the skull that the discarded skull Delta burial 17 was found. The grave contained a male adult lying on his back with head to the sw and feet to the ne. The arms were folded on the chest, the left one above the right. The skeleton was in good condition. [Three factors suggest that Delta burial 25 was a Christian burial. The interment had no grave goods, the feet were orientated to the ene, and this man was laid to rest with his arms crossed on his chest; there are similar burials at Medieval Nichoria.55 The N wall of the cist ran over the Middle Helladic jar-burial 18. The latest pottery in its walls was LH IIIC Early, but this may be residual. The use of slabs shows that no coffin was used. [The lack of grave goods in most of the full-length cist-burials in Area Delta is notable;56 the upper strata there contained Medieval pottery in some quantity. In addition to Delta burial 25 three others, the adults 12 and 24 and the child 27, lay supine with their feet orientated approximately eastwards and their arms folded over their chests.57 Burial 27 overlay wall bo, which was certainly Mycenaean and probably LH IIIC Early. Burial 12 was possibly associated with a bronze object described as a miniature two-ended chisel (HS 226);58 analysis of the metal suggests that this item is of LH I date.59 Trial Trench VII nearby yielded Medieval as well as MH pottery. Three burials there, two of them in cists (burials 2, 3 and 5), were supine, orientated in this same direction and lacking grave-goods.60 Burial 3 had its arms folded across its stomach and contained a folded lead strip (HS 229); 61 burial 5 likewise had its arms folded. If a Medieval burying-ground was located on the nw slope of the hilltop, the prevailing winds would have kept any odour away from the settlement. [Two infant burials in cists found during the later excavations are almost certainly Medieval, namely Beta burials 22 and 29: these were interred among the outbuildings and in the yard.62 Thus there were probably at least nine Medieval burials in all.] 54 Taylour 1Q72, 2 27 with ol. aac. 55 Wade 108s, 308-0. 56 Taylour 1972, 227. 57 Taylour 1072, 22^-7 with 223 fier. 1«. * laylour 1972, 225. 59 Appendix 5 with table A5.1. 60 Taylour 1072, 228-q with 206 fier. 2. 61 Taylour 1072, 228-Q with dI.

For a possible piece of EH III pattern-painted ware see 2205 in Chapter 5 below. Two other items, 1856- 1857, may represent EH III or the transition to MH I. If so, however, they come from a very different ceramic tradition from that of EH I-IL] 1. EARLY HELLADIC I (1-13, fig. 4.1) The lowest levels (baskets 28 and 31) in the 1973 Trial Trench II B (S) in Area Eta3 produced a small group of sherds that are quite distinct from the standard EH II wares and forms of the site and may represent the earliest occupation of Ayios Stephanos. [The editor has since identified another deposit from Area Eta belonging to this phase, basket 68, on the basis of records unavailable to J. A. MacGillivray when he prepared this study, by means of a statistical seriation analysis.4 Pieces 2 and 12 come from this basket. Two slipped and burnished bowl- rims, 1 and ia, were found in Area Alpha; these were at first deemed Neolithic or Aeginetan, but are almost certainly of this period. Since slipped and burnished ware persisted into the earlier phase of EH II,5 these pieces may possibly be EH II Early. Item 3 might alternatively be interpreted the other way up as the base of a 'fruit-stand'. These are usually holed, as in the examples from Ayios Dhimitrios,6 and are found in Red Slipped and Burnished Ware, as in the examples from Steno on Lefkas7 or from Asea.8 Examples are now known from the Laconia Survey9 and Geraki.10 A 'fruit-stand' was published from Area Delta as HS 49, but this, in a gritty pink fabric with a cream slip and no perforation, was dated to LH I-IL11 One rim, 11, has a row of slashes incised below it; similar pieces are now known from the Laconia Survey12 and Kouphovouno.13] [1.

It is also found at Ayios Dhimitrios in Triphylia, Period Ila (= EH I/II).20] The present group is too small to allow for firm conclusions, but as it is from a level stratified below the earliest EH II levels and does not contain obvious Final Neolithic elements it seems best to regard it as belonging to a phase of EH I. The EH I period is not well documented in Laconia and western Greece, but it certainly existed in Arcadia, despite Holmberg's contrary view, although it is not stratigraphically proven.21 2. EARLY HELLADIC II EH II levels and burials were encountered at a number of locations throughout the site.22 The material from the 1959 and i960 excavations was selected during earlier study seasons, and only diagnostic sherds were kept. The remaining material was considered insufficient by the author for use as the basis for a seriation study of the type successfully employed at Phylakopl.23 Instead, the material is treated here as a whole and studied in order of its fabric, surface treatment, and form. [Owing to the excellence and consistency of the records kept by the excavator, J. B. Rutter, for Area Eta, the editor produced a statistical seriation analysis;24 these records were unavailable to J. A. MacGillivray when he prepared this study. The analysis suggests that two different phases of EH II can be distinguished. Those pieces from baskets definitely belonging to the earlier phase of EH II, here called EH II Early, are marked with an asterisk: these are 21, 46, 117-118, 129, 132, 134, 156, 159, 161, 164, 168, 175, 190, 193-194, 207-209, 211, 216, 218 and 222. Those certainly from the later phase of EH II, called EH II Late, are marked with a dagger: these are 16, 23-26, 31, 37, 43, 86, 110, 112, 126, 135, 145, 149-151, 165, 174, 184, 203, 206 and 217. The remainder are undifferentiated EH IL] (i) Fabrics and Catalogue There are two main, or common, ceramic fabrics, four minor, or uncommon, fabrics and a few pieces in singular fabrics. The two main fabrics, buff and orange, are treated first and subdivided into groups according to the quality of the clay and the nature of the surface treatment. The clay has not been analysed; identification is based on macroscopic observation. BUFF CLAY The most common clay used to make EH II pottery is a light-coloured soil that closely resembles the buff clays of the Argolid in appearance. The fine examples are well sifted and, in most cases, well fired. The biscuit varies in shades from pink to brick-red. Fine buff fabric with plain surface (14-27; fig. 4.2) A small number of bowls, saucers and sauceboats are made of fine buff clay with the surface either left plain and unfinished or self-slipped, probably the result of finishing the piece with a moist sponge or cloth. 14.

EH II Late pottery: buff clay with cream slipped surface 140-144, i46-i46a. Scale 1:3. Fine buff fabric with cream slipped surface (io7-i46a; figs. 4.6-4.7) The second most common category of EH II fabric, after the fine buff clay with monochrome coated surface discussed above (30-88), is made of fine buff clay coated with a pinkish- white to cream- coloured pigment with occasional mottling that wears to silver-grey and black. The slip is often thick and adheres much more successfully to the surface than in the previous Monochrome coated ware, but less so than in the Yellow Mottled Ware that it seems to imitate, albeit without burnishing. Only two pieces, sauceboat 130 and jar 146, have incised decoration. [According to the seriation analysis based on J. B. Rutter's records, what he calls Cream Slipped Ware, diagnostic of EH II Late, should not appear in baskets dated to the earlier phase, yet a few pieces, the saucers 117-118, sauceboat 129 and bases 13? and 134 are published from the two largest baskets of that phase, baskets 65 and 66.25 There was apparently a slight overlap here.] 107.

(ii) Commentary on Fine Wares Pottery in buff clay makes up 66% of the total and is most probably locally made. Yellow Mottled Ware is included with the buff fabrics because it cannot be distinguished visually; however, one suspects that it was imported, perhaps from the Argolid, because of the limited range of forms and the very close technical similarity to Argive pieces. The orange fabric makes up 21% of the total and could be regarded as a second local product. The other fabrics are so rare that they are probably not produced locally, although they may not be from very far away; for example, the grey-green fabric could be from the Corinthia. PLAIN WARE The fine plain wares in the buff and orange clays are produced similarly by either leaving the surface of the vase untreated or finishing it with a damp cloth or sponge, giving a thin, fine, self-slipped surface. This class corresponds at Zygouries to Blegen's Class D, 'Unpainted Ware'.26 It seems to belong to a mature phase of EH II and at Lerna is most plentiful toward the end of the period.27 PARTIALLY COATED AND PATTERN-PAINTED WARES Four vases in fine buff and orange fabrics represent this class, which stands between plain and monochrome coated wares. Three are shallow bowls or saucers with roughly painted bands at the rim. These correspond to Blegen's Class BI, 'Partially Coated Ware', in which the saucer seems to be the most common form.28 The fourth piece, 169, belongs to Blegen's Class CI, 'Patterned Ware with 26 Biegen 1028, 106-11. 27 Caskey 1960Û, 289. 28 Biegen 1928, 83-6.</page><page sequence="199">174 J- A- MACGILLIVRAY decoration in dark colour on a light ground'.29 EH II pattern-painted pottery is not plentiful at Lerna30 and forms a minor category wherever it occurs.31 MONOCHROME COATED WARES The most popular pottery at Ayios Stephanos, as at most contemporary Greek sites, is coated with a layer of paint varying in colour from red to black and in quality from dull and thin to lustrous and thick. It is very rarely burnished and cracks or peels away from ¿he surface easily. Most examples are coated throughout, but often the interiors of pedestalled bases are left plain. It Corresponds to Blegen's Class BII, 'Glazed Ware - completely coated',32 and is also known as 'Urfirnis' or 'Varnished' pottery.33 Glazed ware is the typical fine pottery of the EH II period, and while a reverse progression from high to low quality has been observed in the Argolid,34 the stratigraphy at Ayios Stephanos does not permit observations about the local development of the ware. YELLOW MOTTLED WARE The finest pottery at Ayios Stephanos is in Yellow Mottled Ware in fine buff clay. The distinctive slipped and burnished surfaces with areas of intentional mottling wearing to zones of grey and silvery- pink correspond closely to Blegen's Class All, 'Polished Ware - Yellow Mottled'.35 The techniques and forms are so similar that it seems most probable that the Ayios Stephanos examples are imported from the Argolid, as may be most of the high quality examples of this ware found throughout central and southern Greece. The ware is not found in the early stages of EH II and decreases towards the end of the period, suggesting a period of manufacture corresponding with the developed stages of EH II.36 CREAM-SLIPPED WARE The second most common group of pottery after Monochrome Coated Ware is coated with a white or cream-coloured slip varying from thin and almost transparent to thick and lustrous, depending on the quality and quantity of the slip. It technically resembles Monochrome Coated Ware; visually it resembles Yellow Mottled Ware and could be taken as a poor imitation. This class does not seem to have been treated by Biegen, but is similar to the 'White Slipped Ware' of Asine37 and may be linked to Class DD at Berbati.38 (iii) Forms SHALLOW BOWL Shallow, slightly rounded bowls with flat or lightly indented bases occur in Plain and Cream-Slipped wares in fine buff and orange fabrics. Heights vary from 4.3 to 4.6, and rim diameters are between 15.0 and 18.0. They are very similar to bowls of Type IIA at Tiryns,39 a standard EH II form also known from Lerna,40 Corinth,41 Boeotia42 and Messenia.43 SAUCER Small footed bowls, commonly known as saucers (Taylour refers to them as 'miniature stemmed cups' in earlier publications of the site), are the most common EH form at Ayios Stephanos. The relative paucity of complete examples does not allow for a comprehensive typology; however, two general types may be distinguished on the basis of manufacturing techniques. The first has a simple rim ending in a blunt point (18-91, 30-45, 112-117, 160-164, 168, 170-174). Complete examples sit on both ring and pedestalled bases. The second type has a tooled or shaved rim with flat surface (46- 54, 118-121, 175, 180). Type I occurs in all the fine wares except Yellow Mottled Ware and displays the same variation in profile as saucers of Type II from Tiryns.44 Type II is less frequent and occurs only in Monochrome Coated and Cream Slipped wares. 29 Biegen 1928, 103-4. 30 Caskey 10600, 202. 31 E.g.

The EH II osteotheke at Perachora also contained roughly made and finished ceramics, which suggests that EH potters may have been producing a range of hastily made pieces exclusively for funerary use.45 SAUCEBOAT The distinctive spouted bowl known as the sauceboat, hallmark of the EH II period, occurs in all the fine wares except Partially Coated Ware. Comparison with Caskey's typology46 is difficult, as there are no complete examples. However, the vertical strap and double handles on fragments 23, 55-56, 93- 94 and 126-129 look as though they may have belonged to examples of Type III. Two fragments, 124-125, have high-swung arched horizontal handles like those found on Types I and II. None of the characteristics of Type IV could be identified. BASES OF SAUCERS OR SAUCEBOATS A large number of fragments of bases in all the fine classes except Partially Coated Ware could belong either to saucers or sauceboats. They range from having a low ring foot (25-26, 97-105, 132-137 and 165-166) to a high pedestalled foot (63-78, 106, 138-139 and 167). The ring foot is typical of Argive saucers and sauceboats.47 The pedestalled foot is rare in the Argolido-Corinthia,48 but common in central Greece and Attica and perhaps also in Laconia.49 ASKOS There are six fragments that probably belong to askoid jugs in Yellow Mottled Ware (96) and Cream- Slipped Ware (140-141 and 185-187). They have strap or double handles, a common feature of this form in EH II,50 and similar to those on sauceboats of Type III, e.g. 56, and large cup 79. [A duck- askos with simple linear patterns in black on a light-brown slip has been found at Geraki.51] SPOON There are four fragments of the characteristic EH II clay spoon in Monochrome Coated (84) and Cream-Slipped wares (143-145). The form consists of an elongated bowl roughly 8 to 9 cm. long with a short rectangular handle. Although not in great quantity, spoons are found at most EH II sites in central and southern Greece. LID There are two examples of small lids with pierced handles on top, 85 and 188, but no evidence for the jars they would have closed. Similar lids are found at EH II sites throughout central and southern Greece.52 LARGE CUP 79 is a large cup with one vertical double handle preserved, although it may have had two. It is not a common EH form, as sauceboats probably served as drinking cups, but certainly belongs to EH II because of its fabric and the similarity of the double handle to those on sauceboats and askoi. LARGE HANDLED BOWL 1 1 1 is the rim fragment of bowl that is unique in having a handle set on the side below the rim. It may be a local variation of the pedestalled bowl with two handles known from Asea in Arcadia.53 BRIDGE-SPOUTED JAR 146146a is a problematic piece because of its poor state of preservation and apparent singularity. The upper part, 146, comprises fragments of the rim and bridged spout of a large open jar. 146a is a 45 Hatzipouliou-Kalliri 108«, 370-7 k. 46 Caskey 1960a, 290. 47 Caskey 10600, 200 fig. ib, d, e). 48 Fahy 1062, 104. 49 E.g.

A. MACGILLIVRAY high pedestalled base in the same fabric and class and found together with the upper part, although it is difficult to see how they join. The bridge-spouted jar is certainly not a well-known EH form. There is a spout from Asea that may be from a similar vase and also appears to belong to the EH II period.54 FRYING PAN Two fragments of EH frying pans occur in uncommon fabrics and are probably imported. 219 is part of a barred handle of the type most common on mainland frying pans of the EH I and II periods.55 223 has a rectangular pierced handle and decoration of the type found in a mixed Neolithic-EH layer at Asea.56 Both pieces are probably of mainland manufacture, 223 most likely from Asea. SCHEMATISED WARE 222 is a schematised vase very like EM ILA examples from Koumasa57 and Tomb II at Lebena (Lenda).58 The fabric, hatched pattern in Dark-on-Light ware, and painted spots are very much at home in EM HA Early Central Crete.59 In all likelihood 222 was imported from central Crete and provides a useful chronological link between EH II Early and EM IIA Early. The majority of the EH pottery from Ayios Stephanos comprises the full range of wares and forms common to most sites of the EH II period in mainland Greece. There are no striking local variations; instead we may assume close contact with the centres of EH society. Ayios Stephanos may have been occupied first in EH I and then continuously until a mature stage of the EH II period, after which there is no evidence until the MH I period, although this apparent gap may be misleading given the small area tested by excavation. 54 Holmberg 1944, 72-3 fig. 74g. 55 Coleman 108*, 108-201. 56 Holmberg 1944, 87 fig. 88b. 57 Xanthoudides 1924, pl.

ABBREVIATIONS AND DEFINITIONS OF TERMS In addition to the usual abbreviations (see the 'List of Abbreviations' at the front of this volume), the technical ceramic vocabulary used here is derived primarily from Shepard 1956, and Gibson and Woods 1990. Burnish: manipulation of the surface area of a vessel with a hard-edged tool that leaves visible marks, in order to produce a compacted layer with lustre (opp. polish). Central Area: the Central Area encompasses the north-east Péloponnèse (Argolid, Corinthia) and central Greece (Attica, Boeotia, Euboea, Phocis).1 Ceramic Group: see below, §3. Clay: unfired clay with its mineral inclusions (both clay in its natural state and clay as prepared by the potter, sometimes with tempering materials). Cycladic. the adjective is used to refer to the islands of the Cyclades, home of one of the three distinct cultures in the MBA, along with Minoan and Helladic DB: Dark Burnished ware. D-o-l: dark-on-light, decoration of dark paint on a light ground. DP: Dull Painted ware. GM: Grey Minyan ware. Fabric, the fired clay, best visible on a fresh fracture of a sherd. Handmade or made by hand: no visible signs of turning on the wheel or of throwing with centrifugal force (opp. turned, wheel-thrown). Helladic: three traditions, considered to have cultural rather than exclusively geographic significance, are recognised here: Helladic, Minoan and Cycladic. Unlike the island areas, the mainland is very large and characterised, especially in the late EBA and MBA, by regional variation and diversity. When used here (other than in chronological designations such as EH, MH and LH), Helladic refers to the material culture as represented at sites in the Central Area. Impressed: designs executed by pressing with a utensil or material of some kind into the surface when the vessel was still moist enough to receive it. When the designs are individual marks made by repeatedly pressing in rather deeply the pointed end of a tool, they are termed punctate. Incised: designs drawn with a hard-edged tool (with pointed or squared end). Lamination: term used to describe the surfaces of vessels that have flaked off in a multitude of thin layers or plates (laminae). LD: Lustrous Decorated ware. L-o-d: Light-on-dark, decoration of white paint on a ground of dark paint. 1 In this I follow Dickinson 1977, 17. 177</page><page sequence="203">178 C. ZERNER Matt Paint the capitalised words Matt Paint designate paint that contains a large percentage of the mineral manganese, which causes the colour to remain dark brown, grey or black in both oxidising and reducing firing conditions2 and produces a dull or matt appearance. The term Matt distinguishes it from paint composed primarily of iron oxides, which fires to a light colour in an oxidising atmosphere or to a dark colour in a reducing one. This iron-oxide paint can be lustrous or can appear dull or matt, either because it was applied in a thin layer or because, after use and deposition, its lustre has worn off. Minoan: the adjective is used to describe a person or object from the island of Crete or to refer in general to a tradition that originated on the same island (i.e. Minoan potting techniques). Minoanising. this term has been used to designate a class of pottery or a style of decoration that derives from Minoan styles.3 The pot in question may have been manufactured anywhere except on the island of Crete. There is room for confusion here, for example when one wishes to refer to the traditions of the settlers of Kythera in EB II/III who are presumed to have been Minoans. In this text, these people are referred to as Kytherans and their style or tradition as Minoan. MP: Matt Painted ware. Paint (see also slip): there is a distinction between the two procedures of slipping, the coating of surfaces of vessels with a fine clay in suspension with water (i.e. a slip) and painting, the decorating of surfaces with a colourant (i.e. paint or pigment). This becomes confusing when a slip is coloured with a pigment and is used both to slip and to decorate or paint. In this text, the term paint designates a coloured pigment used to draw patterns and sometimes to coat large areas. Slip designates a coating of the surface, whether its colour is indistinguishable from that of the fabric or totally different, which is not used to draw patterns but is always applied as a solid or semi-solid coating (e.g. Red Slipped and Burnished). In other words, these terms describe the appearance of the surfaces, not the composition of the materials used. Polish: manipulation of the surface area of a vessel by rubbing with a soft material (e.g. cloth, leather, fingers) that leaves few visible marks, in order to produce a compacted layer with lustre (see also burnish). Potter's mark a mark or sign, incised or impressed on the surface of a vessel before it was fired. The word 'potter' is used for the sake of convenience, although it is not known who actually made these marks or why they were made. Punctate-, see impressed. Slip (see also paini): a coating of fine clay over all or most of the surface of a vessel. This coat may be of a colour close to that of the fabric, intentionally added to give the surface a smoother, finer appearance or to prepare it for decoration with paint, or of a colour very different from the fabric (e.g. Red Slipped and Burnished ware). Spalling term used for the pitting or flaking of the surface of vessels, caused by raising the temperature too quickly during firing or by the blowing out of inclusions of limestone or other carbonates after they had absorbed water and expanded. Turned: this term is used to describe a pot manufactured with the help of a turn-table or tournette, which was rotated but not with the speed sufficient to produce centrifugal force and throw the vessel. Pots made in this way may be termed wheel-made or turned but not wheel-thrown. Ware (also 'Decorative Class'4): a decorative style or type of surface treatment, e.g. Dark Burnished or MP ware. Wheel-thrown: a term used when there are definite signs on the walls of a vessel demonstrating that it was made on a potter's wheel capable of providing the centrifugal force necessary for throwing. None of the pottery from Ayios Stephanos that is considered to be of local manufacture was wheel- thrown. The use of this technology was not widespread in the MBA: evidence for it exists only on Crete (and in Minoan potting traditions elsewhere) and in central Greece (e.g. true GM). YM: Yellow Minyan ware. 2. CHRONOLOGY The designations used here for the phasing of the MBA on the mainland of Greece derive from a detailed study of the pottery from Lerna and Ayios Stephanos. In many ways it is a difficult period to understand, and the attempt to standardise terminology and chronological sequences is a perplexing 2 Farnsworth and Simmons 1063. 3 Rutter and Rutter 1976, 10-12. 4 Zerner 1993.</page><page sequence="204">THE MIDDLE HELLADIC POTTERY §2 179 and frustrating enterprise.5 One reason for this difficulty is the lack of excavated sites that have a long, well-stratified series of deposits; another is the regional diversity of wares, fabrics and shapes characteristic of the period. At one particular site, such as Ayios Stephanos or Lerna, there may be a number of different traditions represented in the same chronological assemblage. One cannot base the sequence on one feature alone, for example, a vessel shape (such as the carinated cup) or a manufacturing technique (such as wheel-throwing), because potters working in different traditions and in different regions produced the same shapes and employed the same techniques at different times. A solution adopted for the Lerna material and then applied to the ceramics of Ayios Stephanos is a sequence for each ceramic group (defined below), which is then set into a larger framework in general MH terms. I have divided the MH period at Ayios Stephanos into three phases corresponding to early (MH I), middle (MH II) and late (MH III). A tripartite system that refers to the mainland as a whole is more difficult to establish, for the same reasons concerning ceramic chronology that are outlined above. Although it may now be best to discard that system for the mainland, since it is not generally agreed upon, I find it the most convenient way to refer to the phases of the two sites I have been working on, Lerna and Ayios Stephanos. Since the first attempt by Wace and Biegen6 to link their mainland sequence to those established for Crete and the Cyclades, scholars have tried to refine the relative chronology on the basis of Minoan and Cycladic imports and their influence on trends in ceramic production on the mainland.7 This has not always been successful: confusion about the divisions abounds, and the manner in which the correlations are made is partly to blame (primarily, our practice of basing chronology on stylistic influences and on pots designated as imports but rarely examined or confirmed as such by scientific means). Even so, I prefer to continue to link the Helladic sequence of the Central Area and the southern Péloponnèse to the Cretan one, because I am basing the correlation neither on a small number of Cretan imports at mainland sites, nor on instances of stylistic influences of Minoan on mainland ceramics, but on imports and the sequence of LD wares in the ceramic group Mudstone and Chert. The development of wares in this group can be compared to that of lustrous painted Middle Minoan pottery from Kythera, to which its fabric, its manufacturing and its stylistic characteristics are (macroscopically) closely related. Although the site or sites where LD was produced cannot be identified at this stage in our research,8 Laconia and Kythera are the most likely candidates.9 Whether its potters were working in one of these areas exclusively or at different sites and in different areas, they were constantly in contact with one another, using the same technologies and styles. Minoan in inspiration, LD is best described as a provincial ware which mirrored the Minoan sequence in general but had a restricted repertory, utilising only a few of the shapes and decorative patterns popular on Crete. Using as a model the site of Lerna, where all of the major Helladic, Cycladic and Minoan wares appear together in stratified contexts throughout the MH period, one can incorporate the other wares into the LD (i.e. Kytheran and Minoan) sequence. Thus the mainland chronological sequence presented in this text is linked, through Kythera, to the Minoan. The major divisions and correlations are EM III/MM IA = MH I, MM IB-II = MH II, and MM III = MH III. Because of the restricted nature of the Minoan elements in the LD repertory, only a general outline may be applied. At Ayios Stephanos, LD was one of a number of different ceramic wares in use throughout MH and early LH: changes in one of them that signified a separate chronological stage were not always accompanied by noticeable changes in another ware. The chronological sequence presented here is based on indicators, some clear, others uncertain, in the stratigraphical record. (i) Middle Helladic I (= Early Minoan III/Middle Minoan IA) This phase is equivalent to Kythera Deposit Gamma, with a possible import from Ayios Stephanos at Kastri, a base that may be DP ware.10 It corresponds to EH III/MH I through MH I at Lerna. MH I is well represented at Ayios Stephanos. Although the stratigraphical record is not clear or consistent from Area to Area, there were two main subphases, MH I Early and MH I Late. Three early MH levels in Area Zeta may provide evidence for occupation of the site from Transitional EH III/MH I, which would represent a third subphase. The two upper levels date to MH I Early and Late; in the lowest level, there were sherds of ceramic types similar to those found in Transitional EH 5 Zerner 1993, 39-40. 6 Wace and Biegen 1017-18. 7 For recent discussions of tripartite schemes and relative chronology see Rutter 19930, 776 with n. 132; Dickinson 1994, 9-17. 8 See Rutter and Rutter 1976, 64; Rutter and Jones 1977; Tones 1086. a2 1-a. 9 See Tones and Whitbread in Annendix 2. 10 Coldstream and Huxley 1972, 94, no. 39.</page><page sequence="205">i8o C. ZERNER III/MH I deposits at Lerna. A few other examples of these early types were also found in later baskets in Area Zeta and elsewhere on the site. Almost all the pottery, both local and imported, was handmade. The ceramic assemblage, although containing some wares found in the Argolid and elsewhere, differed from contemporary assemblages in the Central Area. The ceramic features characteristic of each subphase are described in §§(a)-(c) below. (a) TRANSITIONAL EH Ill/MH l(?) All of the wares most characteristic of MH I Ayios Stephanos appear in this earliest phase: DB, DP, LD and Coarse. Typical of this transitional stage are DB cups and bowls with everted rims, either with rounded profile and pronounced swelling of the shoulder (1037, and 2214 from the earlier excavations) or with convex angular profile (1036). A GM bowl (1064), probably an import from the north-east Péloponnèse, can be dated to late EH III or very early MH by its wide, nearly vertical rim. (b) MH I EARLY DB cups and bowls of MH I Early have two characteristic profiles: angular, with shoulders tending to the concave (1054, 1057, 1191); and carinated, characterised by deeply concave shoulders (1055- 1056, 1058). The DB carinated cup was handmade and preceded the appearance of the same shape in LD and Minoan wares, which is dated to MM IB/II and was wheel-thrown. Another vessel represented in these deposits is a small jar with wide mouth and everted rim (1060-1061). Decorative plastic ribbing (1197-1198) and incised (1057) and impressed (1062) patterns may belong to MH I Early but were more typical of the next phase, MH I Late. In DP, the most common shape is a bowl with in-turned rim, in small (1066) and large (1069) sizes. Although d-o-1 was the usual style of decoration, in this phase there is also bichrome (1069) and 1-o-d (1074). Simple, linear patterns, horizontal, diagonal and vertical lines and bands (1073, 1204) and diagonally hatched triangles (1073) are most common although garlands (1071), crosses (1074) and arcs (1206) are also found. LD was produced in fine and medium coarse fabrics, in the shapes of rounded cups (1075-1076), jugs (1078) and narrow-necked jars with flaring rims (1079). All were decorated with simple, linear patterns, similar to those found in DP, in 1-o-d (1078), d-o-1 (1080), and polychrome (1076) styles. Potters' marks were incised on jugs (1077) and jars (1081). Coarse ware vessels for use in the kitchen, with burnished or unburnished surfaces, were produced in two basic shapes that changed little over the course of MH: a rounded bowl with everted rim and high-swung handles (1004), sometimes decorated with incision (1086-1087); and a wide-mouthed jar with everted rim (1046), often with knobs on the shoulder (1049) or incised decoration on the top of the rim (1088). The first imports from Crete appear in contexts of MH I Early (1082-1084, 1218-1221). All were handmade and date to MM I; however, the precise subphase of MM is difficult to determine. Goblet 1082 is certainly MM IA;11 rounded bowl 1084 may be MM IB.12 However, it is clear from correlations with material from MH I Lerna and from a MH I Early mainland import to Knossos in MM IA (the DB rounded bowl with everted rim and swollen, grooved shoulder similar to 1196 from the Royal Road South fill deposit)13 that contact between Crete and the mainland began in the prepalatial period. This contact continued uninterrupted into the early palatial period which may overlap in time with MH I Late, a well-documented phase at Ayios Stephanos. (c) MH I LATE In DB, the carinated cup (1237) and bowl or basin with ribbed or ridged shoulder (1009-1010) continued from the earlier phase. New shapes were introduced: a jar with horizontal belly handles (1849) and a flask (1851-1855). New decorative patterns were incised or impressed: especially common is the garland (1102-1103), a motif that was popular throughout MH and into LH. The decorative patterns on DB are usually simple and rectilinear, but more complex decorative systems appear on flasks (1851-1852). This phase was the heyday of DP ware, which was produced in a variety of shapes: cups and bowls with rounded profiles and everted rims (1858-1859), bowls or basins with in-turned rims (i860), jugs 11 Momigliano 1991, fig- 1:3. 12 No shape of this kind appears in prepalatial contexts published in Momigliano ìqqi and 2000 or MacGillivray 1998. 13 See Momigliano 2000, 102-3 wit^ nn- 64"5-</page><page sequence="206">THE MIDDLE HELLADIC POTTERY §2 181 with beaked spouts (1117), and narrow-necked jars with flaring rims (1122-1123). Decorative patterns continued from the earlier period, with the addition of cross-hatched double garland (1122), fir tree (1123) and lozenge (1330). All LD pottery was handmade in both fine fabric, in the shape of a cup with angular (1 124-1 126) or rounded (1127) profile, never coated on the interior; and in medium-coarse fabric, in the shape of a jug (1265) and a narrow-necked jar with flaring rim (1130). The last, one of the most characteristic vessel forms in LD, was usually decorated in d-o-1 style with horizontal zones of patterns, including the diagonally hatched triangle (1270). The shape and decorative scheme are also found in contemporary DP (1255). The other LD shapes were decorated predominantly in 1-o-d but also in d-o-1 and polychrome. Patterns are mainly rectilinear, comprising horizontal, vertical, and oblique bands and lines (1265-1270) and hatched triangles (1270); but there are a few others, such as drips and small filled circles (1873). Decorative bands of clay were added to shoulders (1872) and small clay dots applied to surfaces in barbotine style (1124-1125). Potters continued to mark their products (1015). Minoan imports, sherds of two MM IB/II cups or bowls with rounded profiles and everted rims (1878-1879), were found in MH I Late baskets in Area Nu, indicating that this phase extended into the early palatial period on Crete. (ii) Middle Helladic II (= Middle Minoan IB-II) This phase is equivalent to Kythera Deposit Delta with a possible import from Ayios Stephanos, a DB strap handle.14 MH II at Ayios Stephanos, like MM IB/II at Kastri on Kythera, is not well represented.15 In the Argolid, it corresponds to Dietz Phase MH II Late and final.16 MH II is a well-defined phase at sites in the Central Area where it is characterised by the appearance of the carinated cup shape in GM, MP and LD wares, a chronological indicator that cannot be applied at Ayios Stephanos. The carinated cup was first produced in DB ware in MH I and the MP carinated cup is not attested in any phase at the site. The same shape in LD, which was not produced before MH II, continued in later phases.17 Although this is a difficult phase to identify stratigraphically at Ayios Stephanos, there is some evidence for it in the following sequences in Areas Nu, Zeta and Eta: Over the MH I Late apsidal building Nu I lay Rutter Deposits A and B,18 both with LD carinated cups, and Deposit B with a LD rounded cup with everted rim, shapes characteristic of MH II in the Central Area. Although there was not a large amount of material in these deposits, neither contained anything that could be dated to MH III. Two LD carinated cups (not catalogued here) came from Nu 1977 baskets 45 and 27 that lay above MH I Late and below MH III Early. In Area Zeta, basket 78 with LD carinated cup 1168 overlay destruction debris of MH I Late date (which contained handmade LD cup 1124). In Area Eta, basket 55 which overlay basket 58 of MH I Late date, was contaminated by later material but also contained material that may be described as MH II in character. The ceramic characteristics of this phase are described next. A new shape in DB was the hole-mouthed jar with thickened rim (1295-1296). Other shapes continued but exhibited new features: for example, shoulder-handled bowls were fashioned with more complex rim profiles (1294), and a thicker, shorter and slightly more upright shoulder was given to the carinated cup (1911), a progression toward the goblet shape characteristic of MH III. The flask and jar shapes of MH I were no longer produced and there seems to have been a concentration on production of drinking and mixing vessels (cup/goblet and bowl or basin with ridged shoulder). DP ware, so prevalent in MH I, continued but there is no indication of changes in shape or decorative patterns. In this phase, the potters of LD first began to use the wheel for new shapes in fine fabric: a carinated cup (1168, R27-28, R36) and a rounded cup with everted rim, also known as a semi-globular cup (1938). Both were of Minoan origin as was another new shape in medium-coarse fabric: a hole- mouthed jar (1950). On cups painted in 1-o-d and polychrome styles, both interior and exterior surfaces were coated with dark paint for the first time (1168). A few new curvilinear and spiraliform patterns related to those popular on Kamares ware were added to the decorative repertory (these are represented stratigraphically at Lerna but not as clearly at Ayios Stephanos). The spiral was drawn exclusively in 1-o-d (R22); the d-o-1 dotted filled circle (1345) may belong to MH III Early. Also in this phase or in 14 Coldstream and Huxlev 1072. q&gt;7. no. a^. 15 Coldstream and Huxlev iQ72, 278. 16 Dietz 1 99 1, 44-57. 17 See Coldstream and Huxlev 1072, 27Q. 18 Rutter and Rutter 1976, 16-19.</page><page sequence="207">i82 C. ZERNER the next, the hatched triangle, one of the most common patterns on the jar with narrow neck and flaring rim, was replaced by the hatched or cross-hatched semicircle (cf. 1391). The plastic decoration used in MH I no longer appears. The wide-mouthed jar with everted rim continued to be the preferred Coarse ware vessel for cooking with no apparent changes (1989-1997). Micaceous Minoan ware, typical of latest MH and early LH, may have first appeared in MH II (1308).19 (iii) Middle Helladic III Early (= Middle Minoan IIIA-IIIB) Like MH II, this phase overlaps with Kythera Deposit Delta.20 After MH II at Ayios Stephanos and at Lerna there is evidence for two phases of MH III. The first is here termed MH III Early; the second has two possible subphases, MH III Late and Transitional MH III/LH I. At both sites, there were significant changes in the ceramic repertory that signal the beginning of MH III, a phase in which new shapes and decorative patterns related to MM II Late and MM III were added to the LD repertory. However, the identification of separate phases within MM III has been a problem for scholars since Evans divided the period into MM IHA and IIIB.21 Because of this and because of the unclear nature of MM II and early MM III on Kythera, it is difficult to date this phase on the mainland in Minoan terms. The ceramic features characteristic of this phase are described below. New in this phase is a ring-stemmed goblet with T-rim (1364, 1485). The usual DB cups and bowls in various sizes continued to be used for drinking, eating and mixing, but there are new variations in their profiles. The shoulder-handled bowl or basin, now termed a goblet, has a straighter shoulder and small, slightly everted or nonexistent rim, and handles that were laid up more closely to the shoulder (1920, R4). The carinated cup also developed a shorter, more upright rim (2007). DP ware was no longer produced and a new ware, MP, soon took its place. In MH II Late or MH III Early, there may have been an experimental stage of MP with gritty fabric (1930, 1978, 1980-1981), which, if 1929 is not an intrusion, was first introduced in MH III Early (1368, another sherd of MP gritty in a basket that dates primarily to MH III Early, is clearly an intrusion). However, MP gritty was not at all common until the next phase, MH III Late to Transitional MH III/LH I. MP fine appeared even later. In this phase, new shapes of Minoan origin were added to the LD repertory: in fine fabric, the Vapheio cup in dark ground style (1370) and hole-mouthed jar (1373). The carinated cup (1399) and semi-globular cup (1939) continued in dark ground style, with the following exceptions: an undecorated carinated cup (1932) and one in light ground style (1935, which may be later as it came from the contaminated unit Nu 1977 basket 34), and an undecorated semi-globular cup (1936). New shapes in medium-coarse fabric were a large basin (1376-1377, 3627) and jug (i947"1949)- A^0* decorative schemes became somewhat more complex (as 1388), incorporating new motifs: the quirk (i960), narrow wavy line (1389, 1391), and cross-hatched loop (1393). The spiral, still only in 1-o-d (1498), and joined arcs (1965) were drawn more thickly than before. The diagonally hatched and cross- hatched triangle, common in MH I and II, was now completely replaced by the hatched and cross- hatched semi-circle (1388, 1391). Other motifs, which may have been used first in MH II but were more likely to have been introduced in this phase, were the d-o-1 dot row, consisting of tiny dots, both horizontal (1954) and encircling filled circles (R127), and the circle, thick like a doughnut (1953). Other changes were technological rather than stylistic: the interior rims of typical LD narrow- necked jars were fashioned with more complex profiles: hollowed (1388) or ridged (1384). Coarse vessels in Micaceous Minoan ware appear for the first time on Kythera in MM IB-IIIA Deposit Delta.22 Jar 1977 probably belongs to MH III Early, but most examples of this ware in its coarse form from Ayios Stephanos date to the Shaft Grave era. (iv) The Shaft Grave Era: MH III Late through LH IIA This general designation for the end of the prepalatial period on the mainland covers three chronological phases, MH III Late, LH I and LH IIA.23 Although of crucial importance for the development of 19 For discussion see § (iii) below. 20 Coldstream and Huxley 1972, 94-8.

The stratigraphical sequence at Ayios Stephanos, while not completely unambiguous, provides valuable evidence for some of the questions that have been raised in the numerous studies of this period.24 In the early phases (MH III Late and Transitional MH III/LH I) MP and YM, both in gritty fabric and in late MH forms, began to be produced at Ayios Stephanos. Before this time, ceramic styles similar to those common at Ayios Stephanos (i.e. DB and LD wares) did appear in other areas of the mainland north of Laconia but there was no corresponding exchange of pots or styles characteristic of the Central Area (e.g. GM and MP) in a N-s direction. This change in the ceramic assemblage in late MH may indicate a closer relationship with other areas of the mainland. The local elite may have desired YM and MP wares, especially in the form of cups and bowls for drinking and feasting, which were similar to those used by their peers in other areas of the mainland.25 This would help to explain the ceramic changes and, perhaps, other innovations as well, such as a new way of laying out the dead in an extended position for burial (perhaps dating to this period, cf. the skeleton of Alpha burial 23)26 and the production of miniature vases for use as burial offerings for children (Lambda burial 2), a practice begun in late MH in the north-east Péloponnèse. Other changes date somewhat later, to the end of LH I and the beginning of LH IIA, including the introduction of the shaft grave form itself and the importation of Aeginetan vessels. By that time many of the wares current in the contemporary Argolid were in use at Ayios Stephanos, either made on or near the site or, like Minoan and Aeginetan, imported from elsewhere. These, along with other material remains, may be signs at the site of the growing power of an elite group, now more fully engaged in the emerging cultural and political entity known as Mycenaean. Of the three subphases in this period (MH III Late, Transitional MH III/LH I, and LH I Early), the first two are taken together below. (a) MH III LATE AND TRANSITIONAL MH III/LH I (=MM IIIB-MM mH/LM Ia) This is equivalent to Kythera Deposit Epsilon dated to MM IIIB,27 as well as to some sherds from Deposit Zeta dated to MM IIIB-LM IA.28 The MH resettlement of Tsoungiza in the Corinthia29 and of other sites in the Central Area also dates to this phase.30 In the Argolid, it corresponds to Dietz' Phases MH IIIA, MH IIIB and LH IA,31 which include the earliest graves in Circle B at Mycenae. The catalogued vases may be divided into two groups based on stratigraphical distinctions found in the 1977 excavations of Areas Nu and Lambda, with some corroboration in Area Beta: MH III Late and Transitional MH III/LH I. In Area Nu, Structure Nu II contained pottery that is clearly LH I but probably a very early stage of the period (Rutter Deposits H and L). Below this, Rutter Deposit G and basket 13 contain good examples of a transitional stage between the latest MH and the earliest LH I (although basket 13 has one fragment of LH I, 3634). Underlying basket 13 was basket 30 and below that 34. Because these two deposits precede basket 13 stratigraphically and because they contain different ceramic material, they may be slightly earlier in date, i.e. basket 30 dating to MH III Late, and basket 34 to the earliest stage of MH III.32 In Area Lambda 1977, baskets 68 and 88 contained the first LH LD; below them, basket 97 dates to the Transitional MH III/LH I phase; underlying 97 were MH III Late baskets 98 and 99, and below these was basket 104 of MH II or III Early. In Area Beta 1977, basket 96 (above basket 101, which cannot be dated but which overlay MH III Early baskets 130 and 134) is primarily MH III Late (although contaminated by later LH). It underlies basket 90 which, although LH I was also found in it, has good Transitional MH III/LH I. Because the two groups have similar ceramic characteristics, they are treated together here and their differences noted. In DB, the goblet (1484) and smaller cup/kantharos (2001) were still predominant, but other shapes and decorative patterns, some imitating Minoan prototypes, were added to the repertory: a straight- sided cup (2009), a conical cup (2010), a cup on pedestal foot (2012), a hole-mouthed jar («0558), and miniature rounded cup with vertical handle (3391). All have Minoan prototypes with the exception 24 For bibliography and discussion see Rutter ìqqso, 78^-07. 25 For discussion of the emerging elite and for bibliography see Rutter îqqqa, 78r-q6. 26 See Tavlour 10*72. 21/1-1*7. 27 Coldstream and Huxley 1972, 98-104. 28 Coldstream and Huxley 1072, 104-14. 29 Rutter lqqoß, 4*2-*. 30 Rutter îqqqa, 781. 31 Dietz lQQi. r8-iof;. 32 See § (iii) above.</page><page sequence="209">184 C. ZERNER of the rounded cup, which is similar to late MH and early LH kantharoi from the Argolid.33 The incised foliate band (3391, R88) was a new motif added in this phase. For the first time vessels intended as offerings in graves of children were manufactured in miniature size (1482). This is also a feature of grave goods from the Shaft Grave era in the Argolid.34 Also possibly of this phase, or LH I Early, are the DB vessels placed as offerings in a burial with the body in extended position in Alpha burial 23.a5 All the vessels in this rich grave are unusual. A DB goblet with rounded profile (2221) was incised with garlands in the MH manner but the underside of Sie base was also incised with parallel and crossing lines of no apparent pattern. A very small pyxis (2222), incised with typical MH patterns, is unique in the DB repertory of shapes. Another vessel from the grave, the biconical jar HS 20,36 was incised with patterns that were not typically MH but resemble elaborate patterns on MP vessels from the Shaft Graves of Circle B, Mycenae.37 This unusual vessel as well as the fourth pot from the grave, HS 18,38 may have been imported to the site. The grave itself certainly dates to the Shaft Grave era. The first vessel from secure stratigraphical contexts, MH III Late Nu 1977 basket 30, that may be termed YM (with light-coloured, burnished surface) is a deep basin in gritty fabric (2047), in a shape like 2046 with lugs and an upright handle on the rim, which was unusual in this ware. It is probable that production of YM gritty in shapes that resemble those popular in the Central Area began in the Transitional MH III/LH I phase, e.g. a flat-based cup or bowl (3401) and a cup or goblet with slightly raised base (3402). If R242 and R243 are not intrusions, the production of YM fine also began in the Transitional MH III/LH I phase, but it is most securely dated to LH I Early. MP in gritty fabric, decorated in d-o-1 style, was produced in shapes that resemble those of Central Area MP: kantharoi and goblets with angular (R246-247) or rounded profiles (2054), jugs and jars (1685, 2067). Typical patterns are alternating thick and thin bands (2057) and pendent row or multiple rows of loops or semicircles (2050, 2052). The latter were often drawn in haste, degenerating into a pendent squiggly line (R247). These motifs are important chronological indicators of MH III Late and Transitional MH III/LH I.39 Goblet or globular jar 2059, if not an intrusive sherd, is an early example of the bichrome style which became popular at Ayios Stephanos only in LH I/IIA. In the Central Area, however, bichrome MP decoration was typical of late MH, on both local vessels and Cycladic imports. This is a truly transitional phase in Minoan lustrous painted ware, represented by Kythera Deposit Epsilon, in which, although polychrome and 1-o-d styles continued, more vases were being painted in d-o-1 style.40 Patterns include foliate bands, often with pointed ends; groups of vertical strokes or bars, some in imitation of Cretan ripple; wavy lines; arcs; filled circles; quirks and a single running spiral.41 Added purple or red was mainly used for lines and bands, some painted directly on a reserved surface. At Ayios Stephanos, the first stratified examples of the new style in LD medium-coarse were found in MH III Late Nu 1977 basket 30. Jar 2119 was decorated in characteristic MH style with a combination of 1-o-d, polychrome and d-o-1 decoration on a burnished ground, but there is also a new motif, the foliate band with pointed leaves. Bowl 2091 (possibly a semi-globular cup?), with deep band on interior and exterior rim, is decorated with a single row of leaves above a thick wavy line. In this phase, red was no longer used for designs but was restricted to horizontal bands, often on a reserved surface (3431). Examples of other LD medium-coarse vessels with these new d-o-1 designs are jars with imitation ripple (1445) and single running spiral, also called a running loop (2125). It is important to note the introduction of a new decorative scheme on vessels in fine fabric. In MH II through MH III early, semi-globular, carinated and Vapheio cups were decorated in dark ground style, on interior and exterior surfaces that were completely coated with dark paint. By the Transitional MH III/LH I phase, the carinated cup was no longer produced and other shapes were painted in light ground style with designs in dark paint on a reserved surface, usually with added white and/or red: on semi-globular (1443-1444, 3602), Vapheio (2083) and straight-sided cups (2140). As in the medium-coarse variety, red was used for horizontal lines and bands, some painted directly on the reserved ground (R414). Patterns are the same as those found on medium-coarse vases: foliate band with pointed leaves (1444); foliate band with rounded leaves (3606, R414); d-o-1 and polychrome in combination (1443, 2083); and d-o-1 ripple imitation (R412). One feature of a number of these fine ware vases is that their interior surfaces were not completely coated like those of their MH II and 33 Dietz 1QQ1. fig. 47: AA-i. 34 Zerner 1990, 24. 35 Tavlour iQ72. 214-17. 36 Tavlour 1072. 216 fig. 8. 37 Cf. no. 15 from Grave Beta (Dietz 1991, fig. 56: AG- 1.4) and no. 44 from Grave Gamma (ibid., fig. 60: AK-6.1). 38 Tavlour 1972, 216 fig. 8. 39 Cf. late MH Tsoungiza, Rutter 1990Û, fig. 7: 8. 40 Coldstream and Huxley 1072, 0,8-104. 41 Coldstream and Huxley 1972, 282-3.</page><page sequence="210">THE MIDDLE HELLADIC POTTERY §2 185 MH III Early counterparts. There was usually a band at the rim (2083), as found on fine LD cups in MH I, a feature of MM IIIB cups from Kythera.42 Evidence for an intermediary stage between MH III and the earliest LH LD ware is an important contribution of the excavations at Ayios Stephanos. At Lerna, for example, there are few signs of it: this may be explained by the fact that Ayios Stephanos, in addition to being closer to the island of Kythera, was also closer than Lerna to the production area of LD itself. It is also important because it is the same stage represented by Kythera Deposit Epsilon which predates the earliest LM IA in Deposit Zeta and confirms the distinction between these two deposits made by Coldstream.43 The first Minoan imports with d-o-1 ripple decoration may belong to MH III Late (an uncatalogued cup in fine ware from Nu 1977 basket 30), as does the use of red paint on a light ground (an uncatalogued jar from Nu 1977 basket 30). Other imports of MM IIIB or MM IIIB-LM IA transitional are fine cups (2135-2136, 2140 and 2142, which has a band on the lower interior) and medium- coarse jars (1464 with foliate band with pointed leaves, 3441 with red band and d-o-1 foliate band with rounded leaves, 1763-1764 with d-o-1 ripple and purple on a light ground, and uncatalogued fragments from Nu 1977 baskets 13 and 30 with d-o-1 ripple). Jar 3631 from Nu 1977 basket 13 decorated with a rosette may be LM IA. A new ware that appears for the first time in these deposits is Oatmeal Coarse in the form of deep basins, unpainted but often decorated with applied impressed coils (1765-1766, 2157). In fabric, shape and decoration, they are similar to MM IIIB vessels from Kastri, Kythera,44 which suggests that they are imports from Kythera or Crete. In local Coarse ware, the wide-mouthed jar with everted rim remained the preferred pot for cooking (2177-2179). Its base had become smaller and like a toe, either flat on the underside (2192) or slightly concave (2193). The coarse basin in Micaceous Minoan ware surely began to appear at the site in latest MH and early LH I. Many examples were decorated with thumb-impressed coils (R519 and uncatalogued fragment from Lambda 1977 basket 98). The earliest tripod bases in the same ware may also belong to this phase.45 Imports of GM ware were rare at Ayios Stephanos; almost all appeared in latest MH and early LH deposits (spouted jar 2039 and an uncatalogued fragment of a bowl from Lambda 1977 basket 98). (b) LH I EARLY This is equivalent in part to Kythera Deposit Zeta.46 In the Argolid, there is no corresponding phase in Dietz 1991. (Two baskets that are not stratigraphically secure, Lambda 1977 baskets 83 and 85, are included here because the catalogued material from them dates to LH I Early: 1710 from basket 85 and 34i4-34i5&gt; 3424-3426, 3440, 3443, 345&lt;&gt;-345i&gt; 3458 from basket 83.) The ceramic characteristics that distinguish this phase from the preceding transitional phase are described below. Both YM and MP wares continued in gritty fabric and the first cups and bowls in fine fabric were manufactured (3381, R240 in YM, and R289-291 and an uncatalogued fragment from Lambda 1977 basket 68 in MP). In these deposits are a few sherds that are either intrusive or the first examples of types that are more usual at a later date: two bichrome MP fine (R293 and one uncatalogued from Lambda 1977 basket 68) and a large goblet with rounded profile in MP gritty (R249). This is the first time that fine LD was produced in recognisably LH I form.47 Like contemporary LM IA pottery from Kythera, LD ware was better made than before, the clay was well levigated and fired to a harder consistency and the surfaces were often burnished. This burnishing of the surface, a feature of LM IA,48 has been cited as the criterion for distinguishing LD, fine, from Mycenaean.49 However, some cups of this phase have unburnished surfaces (3423), like similar LM IA cups from Kythera.50 When discussing wares characteristic of LH I, I use the term LH LD for LD ware produced in this phase; it is called LH I by Mountjoy51 and Early Mycenaean by Rutter and Rutter.52 The distinction made between LD and LH I or Mycenaean is purely one of nomenclature and chronology: the fabric and 42 Cf.

ZERNER overall character of both is the same, but, as can be seen in the development of the ware throughout its long history which began in early MH, shapes and decorative patterns as well as methods of manufacture changed in accordance with changes in Minoan pottery. In the same way, LH LD is equivalent to LM IA. Thus I do not call the ware Mycenaean because it is LD ware, the same ware produced in MH, and I prefer not to call it LH I because it would be confused with other wares of LH I. Stages of development of LD ware (called Minoanizing wares in Rutter and Rutter 1976) from MH to its LH form corresponding to LM I were put forth by Rutter, who argued that what he calls the earliest Mycenaean pottery of LH I may have developed in Laconia rather than in the Argolid.53 The additional stylistic and scientific analyses presented in this volume lend strong support to this argument. Examples of LH LD from these deposits include semi-globular cups (3458, R428) and Vapheio cups (3455-3456, R462) without a midrib. Decorative patterns, primarily in d-o-1 style with additional patterns in added white, include a foliate band with fine leaves (R483), ripple (3423) and what appears to a spiral (3428, 3458). It is important to note that very few shapes and decorative patterns belong to this early phase; it was not until LH I/IIA that the repertory expanded to include the well known types illustrated by Mountjoy.54 Fewer shapes were produced in medium-coarse fabric, and production of the jar with narrow neck and flaring rim which had such a long history, beginning in early MH, may have ceased altogether in early LH. Patterns popular in the transitional phase continued to be used, including imitation ripple (3432, 3442) and single running spiral (R382). (c) LATE HELLADIC i/lIA (LATE HELLADIC I LATE WITH EARLY LATE HELLADIC HA) TO LATE HELLADIC IIA (=LATE LM IA) This is equivalent to later Deposit Zeta55 and to Deposits Eta and Theta56 on Kythera. Two MP imports from the mainland in Deposit Eta, both decorated with spirals, date to LH I Late or LH I/IIA.57 A bichrome MP cup from Deposit Omega, said to be from a LM IA context, 58 is very similar to LH IIA cups from Ayios Stephanos. The overlap of late or mature LM IA with early LH IIA has been discussed recently by Warren.59 It is in this phase that the assemblage of pottery from Ayios Stephanos began to closely resemble contemporary assemblages in the Central Area, e.g. in the Corinthia at Korakou,60 and in the Argolid Dietz' Phase LH IB, which includes the Lerna Shaft Graves and the latest graves in Grave Circle B at Mycenae.61 Delicate cups in YM and bichrome MP fine, YM and MP gritty goblets with rounded profiles, spiraliform decoration on MP vases, LH LD in various new shapes and decorative schemes and imports of Aeginetan and Mainland Polychrome wares are all found for the first time. However, all of the baskets included in this section contained pieces of LH IIA decorated pottery.62 Although none may be said to be purely LH I Late (Dietz LH IB), the few baskets that are stratigraphically lower than the others are dated here to LH I/IIA, a phase at Ayios Stephanos that resembles the early LH IIA phase recognised by Rutter at Tsoungiza in the Corinthia.63 The rest of the material is dated LH IIA. Because there is very little difference between the two, both phases are discussed together and the main distinctions between them are noted. The ceramic features that distinguish this phase from the preceding are described below. Although not as common as YM, DB was still made both in goblet form and in new shapes or variants of older ones: semi-globular cup (1418, 1514-1516), straight-sided cup with vertical handle (1518) and carinated cup on tripod base (1519). In both fine and gritty fabrics, YM shapes mirror those of LH I and early IIA in the Argolid: semi- globular cups (1424) and goblets with rounded or angular profile and low feet (3382-3383, 3404). 64 The semi-globular cup and rounded goblet with shoulder handles (e.g. 1614) are the most common shapes and become the standard form for drinking goblets in lustrous painted ware in LH II and later.65 High-swung handles (1321) are not usual. The feet of these goblets are low and concave underneath (3404, 3406-3407) or on a low stem (1321). In later LH I and early LH IIA stems are hollowed on the interior (3387). 66 Other characteristic features of this phase are concave or hollowed 53 Rutter and Rutter 1076, 63-4. 54 Mountjoy 1986, 10-16. 55 Coldstream and Huxley 1972, 104-14. 56 Coldstream and Huxley 1972, 115-123. 57 Coldstream and Huxley iQ72, pl. 30: 72 and 73. 58 Coldstream and Huxley 1972, 179, with pl. 54: 19. 59 Warren 1999, 894-5. 60 Davis 1079. 61 Dietz lQQi. 103-Pv 62 See discussion and catalogued items in Chapter 6. 63 Rutter 1993^, 24-5. 64 Cf.

MP in fine fabric is common only in LH IIA and appears primarily in the form of a semi-globular cup decorated in d-o-1 (1579) or bichrome (many with wavy lines or zig-zag patterns, especially characteristic of LH IIA, e.g. 1588, 1594, 1596, 1598, 1600). Other shapes are rare and include a single example of an eggcup (1593), very close to the Mainland Panelled cup of LH I,68 and two fragments of a squat jug (1605-1606, not well stratified). New in MP gritty is a cup or goblet with rounded profile and everted rim, low foot concave underneath, and vertical handles that attach to rim and shoulder (1649). Another shape characteristic of LH IIA is a large goblet with everted rim, rounded profile, often swollen on the shoulder, and decorated in d-o-1 (1652). Jugs (beak-spouted 1323) and jars (1681) were also produced. The patterns used in late MH and early LH continued but new motifs were added to the repertory: the dot row (1681-1682) and cross-hatched triangles (1690, not well stratified). The most striking new motif is the spiral which embellishes the shoulders of goblets (1653, 1656) and jugs (1323). Also appearing in this phase is the imitation of features of Aeginetan pottery: circles drawn around the bases of handles of jugs and jars (1691) and a new bichrome spouted basin (1695). Most of these baskets contain LH LD and LH IIA fine decorated pottery, discussed by Mountjoy in Chapter 6 §§3 (ii) and 5 (ii). Micaceous Minoan ware continued from MH II or III. The cooking pot with tripod base may have first appeared at Ayios Stephanos in the Transitional MH III/LH I phase (R592, R594) but, as at Lerna, it is more common in LH I and II (R593). The tripod is a typical feature of Minoan vessels dating back to EM II but appeared for the first time on Kythera in MM IB-IIIA in the new red micaceous fabric.69 Imports from the island of Aegina were an important element in the ceramic assemblages of sites in the Central Area throughout MH and well into early LH, i.e. the Shaft Grave era in the Argolid.70 At Ayios Stephanos, however, the first securely dated appearance of Aeginetan pottery is in LH IIA (with the exception of two fragments that might date to LH I/IIA, R723 and an uncatalogued sherd from Lambda/Beta 12 1974, basket 40, and one possible sherd 1404 in Beta 1977 basket 134). Although few examples were found, the full range of Aeginetan products of the early LBA was represented at Ayios Stephanos: Red Slipped and Burnished goblets and kraters (1782); Bichrome MP kraters (R723); MP jars and/or hydrias (1783-1784) and coarse ware cooking-pots (1794). A few potters' marks (1792), an important feature of Aeginetan wares, were also found. It is not known how these pots came to Ayios Stephanos, whether directly by means of Aeginetan ships sailing to Laconia or as a result of trading by mainlanders among themselves. If the former was the case, it would indicate a significant alteration of trading patterns in the Aegean: for centuries, beginning in the early years of MH, the distribution of Aeginetan pottery had been confined to the Central Area. Only one fragment of imported Mainland Polychrome ware (R717) has been recognised at Ayios Stephanos. Jars in this ware were especially common in the Shaft Graves of Mycenae and Lerna.71 Other wares characteristic of these graves have not been identified, namely Theran and Melian imports.72 (d) excursus: on the date of deposits at knossos and kea In 1991, Warren published a new pottery deposit from Knossos, which he dated to the MM IIIB-LM IA transition and to which he linked deposits from a number of sites, including Rutter Period III, especially Deposit L, from Ayios Stephanos, and Kythera Deposits Epsilon, Zeta and Eta.73 At Ayios Stephanos the Transitional MH III/LH I and LH I Early phases presented here correspond to the Knossian deposit; at Kastri, Deposit Epsilon is also Transitional and was sealed by a LM IA floor.74 Deposits Zeta and Eta, however, are more closely comparable to later LH I or Dietz LH IB (with the exception of earlier material in Deposit Zeta75). 67 Cf.

ZERNER I also do not agree with Warren76 on the dating of Period VI (Ceramic Phase G) on Kea77 to his MM IIIB-LM IA transition. I think the Keian material from Room 18 of House A,78 like Kythera Deposits Zeta and Eta, is closest to the LH I/IIA phase at Ayios Stephanos and to Dietz Phase LH IB in the Argolid. It was in this later phase that many of the characteristic LH shapes and motifs were added to the LD repertory.79 Among the new motifs are solid centre spirals, either linked or tangent, with large blobs in the field found in the Keian deposit,80 in the Lerna Shaft Graves81 and at Ayios Stephanos in LH I/IIA.82 Other features of Period VI correspond to LH I/IIA, including the importation of Mainland Polychrome83 and Aeginetan wares in later LH I to LH IIA form.84 The fine MP semi-globular cup and the GM semi-globular cup on a low stem85 both date to the LH I/IIA phase as defined here. 3. THE FABRICS: CLASSIFICATION AND TERMINOLOGY A study of MH pottery has revealed that trade or exchange among various areas was widespread from the earliest years of the period.86 This conclusion resulted from the identification of a number of different ceramic wares that were distributed extensively on the mainland. Two of these, LD and Aeginetan, both apparently systematically incised or impressed with potters' marks, indicate that ceramic production had become highly specialised, at least in the areas in which these wares were produced. Therefore, because a study of the pottery can lead to a more informed view of MH society, it is important, first, to define the ceramic groups accurately, and then to attempt to locate the regions in which they were produced and to which they were exported. In order to define the ceramic groups accurately I use a system of classification based on the most fundamental activities engaged in by potters: on the choice of raw clay, on how the clay is prepared, and on the techniques used to form the vessels. Applying this system to the ceramic material from Lerna and Ayios Stephanos has enabled the grouping of wares that appear to be products of the same centre of production: for example, Oatmeal Minoanizing, Fine Minoanizing and the Lustrous dark- on-light wares defined in Rutter and Rutter87 can now be referred to as products of the LD ceramic tradition or centre of production. A centre of production is defined as a workshop or workshops in which potters made use of similar clays and similar methods of manufacture. Different centres of production, using clay of like composition, may quite possibly have been located in the same geographical area, but if the methods of preparing the clay and producing pots are different, they are separated and described as different ceramic traditions. The term 'ceramic group' as used here is technological, since it includes the various factors present in ceramic production - the type of clay, its rock and mineral inclusions and the methods of manufacture. The work of Jones and Whitbread88 has helped to define these. The term 'ware', a subdivision of a ceramic group, is used to refer to the external appearance of vessels, i.e. how the surface was treated and decorated, for example MP ware. A further division is based on the texture of the fabric itself and the number and size of inclusions: fine, medium-coarse and coarse. In the following descriptions the wares are placed in ceramic groups that are arranged geographically by the area in which they are thought to have been produced, such as Aegina (Aeginetan) or Crete (Minoan). In the catalogue (§5 below) and discussions, wares are referred to either by the name of the ware along with the geographic location, if it is known (e.g. Aeginetan MP), or by the name of the ware alone when the area of production has not yet been determined (e.g. LD). Thus there exists a considerable degree of uncertainty and terminological inconsistency, which reflects our present state of knowledge of MBA ceramic production and the very early stages (infancy would not be too strong a term) at which our researches presently stand. My system of classification uses most of the descriptive terms for the ceramic classes from Ayios Stephanos employed in the publication of the excavation of Area Nu in 1973 and 1974.89 A few have been replaced where they deviate from the terminology established for the same classes represented at the site of Lerna, e.g. LD instead of Minoanizing.90 The classification of ceramic groups and wares can be outlined as follows:91 76 Warren iqqi, si$8-q. 77 Cummer and Schofield 1984. 78 Cummer and Schofield 1084, 82-7, pls. 61-5. 79 See examples in Mountioy 1986, 10-16. 80 Cummer and Schofield 1084., pl. 62: k-q. 81 Caskey 1955, pl. 16: e. 82 R861, R866 in Rutter and Rutter 1976, fig. 17. 83 Cummer and Schofield 1984, pl. 63: 835. 84 Cummer and Schofield 1984, pl. 61: 825, pl. 64: a. 85 Cummer and Schofield 1984, pl. 64: 837-8. 86 Zerner 1993, 50-1. 87 Rutter and Rutter 1976, 10-12. 88 Appendix 2, with plates 61-2. 89 Rutter and Rutter 1976, 6-15. 90 Zerner 1003, 45-6. 91 See Zerner 1993, 42, for groups identified at Lerna.</page><page sequence="214">THE MIDDLE HELLADIC POTTERY §3 189 (i) Southern Péloponnèse: quartz and mica Group I: Dark Burnished ware Group II: Dull Painted ware Group III: Matt Painted and Yellow Minyan wares, fine and gritty (ii) Southern Péloponnèse: weathered igneous rock Group IV: Coarse wares (iii) Southern Péloponnèse (Kythera?): mudstone and chert Group V: Lustrous Decorated ware, fine, medium-coarse and coarse (iv) Southern Péloponnèse (Kythera?): Red Silver Micaceous (white mica) Group VI: Micaceous Minoan Painted and Coarse (cooking pot) wares (v) Crete: various fabrics Group VII: Painted and Plain wares, fine, medium-coarse and coarse (vi) Southern Péloponnèse (Kythera) or Crete(?): schist, phyllite, mica series Group or groups not determined (vii) Aegina, volcanic: Green/ Yellow, fine and medium-coarse, and Red coarse Group VIII: Green/Yellow, fine and medium-coarse Group IX: Red coarse (kitchenware) (viii) Other mainland: various fabrics Group X: Grey Minyan and Matt Painted wares (i) Southern Péloponnèse: Quartz and Mica Prominent characteristics include numerous tiny silver particles on the surface and in the fabric, often not obvious to the naked eye, particularly when the surface has a heavy burnish.

Fabric Reddish brown (5YR 4/3) to dark grey (10YR 4/1) to black, often with sandwich-like effect of grey core and vari-coloured layers - red or dark orange - on the fracture; rough and grainy-looking, it can feel rather soft but is always firm; very fine to fairly coarse, depending on the size of vessel and number of inclusions, of which the most obvious to the naked eye are quartz and white mica appearing as tiny silver particles scattered over the surface and in the body; other dark red, orange, black and grey inclusions; white limestone occurs more rarely and often in large chunks up to 2 mm. Surface Black (5YR 4/1) or dark grey (10YR 4/1) to (less frequently) brown, buff or red. The exterior of all shapes was burnished, often to a very high degree of lustre; burnishing on the interior of open shapes was often incomplete or sloppily executed or, in some cases (e.g. 2214), nonexistent; generally some areas on the exterior, such as underneath the shoulder handles, were not burnished. Lamination and spalling are common. Manufacturing techniques AU DB vessels appear to have been made by hand. Handles were attached by pressing them against the exterior of the body wall; where they have broken off, there is a distinctive wavy rim of clay either on the lower end of the handle or on the surface of the vessel at the point of attachment (2026). Decoration Decoration is by the application of ribs or ridges of clay, usually on the shoulder of basins (e.g. 1325); by incising or impressing. One type of decoration may appear alone or in combination with others. Incised patterns: most common are straight lines, incised with either a sharp-pointed tool or one with a blunt end that formed grooves ((lines are both horizontal - single (1057) or double (1191, 15*37) - and vertical, in a series (1109)); curved lines draped as widely looped festoons (1247) or concentric semicircles or arcs (1519, 1911, 2232); double curved lines or bands, which are hatched, placed horizontally and obliquely (1007), vertically (1327) and draped as garlands (1161) or dotted</page><page sequence="215">îgo C.

Impressed patterns: concentric circles, with two (2213), three (2220) and four (1854), sometimes arranged in rows (1062, 1851, 1854); lozenges (1851). The concentric circles are so regular in form that they appear to have been made with the same tool, the end of a hollow cylinder, perhaps of a bone or a reed, which had been cut down and smoothed. Other: the incised V on the underside of the base of 1162 was probably not intended as decoration but was rather a potter's mark. Whether the multiple incisions (which do not appear to form any pattern) on the underside of the base of 2221 were meant to be decorative is unclear. Shapes Most prevalent were open shapes, small cups or bowls and larger bowls or basins, all probably used for drinking, eating and mixing. Both the shapes and the burnished surfaces indicate that they may have been used primarily for liquids. Details of the profiles vary, and in some cases these differences can be used as chronological indicators. The earliest type has a rounded or angular body and everted rim. Carinated profiles appear somewhat later in MH I (in other wares of other traditions, e.g. in GM, the carinated cup does not appear until MH II). The goblet was the most popular shape in later MH. Other types of cup or bowl occur rarely, e.g. the bowl with in-turned rim and the straight-sided cup. Closed shapes such as flasks and small jars, perhaps used for storage, were also made in DB. A few shapes - the pyxis, for example - are rare or unique. Cup/bowl with everted rim. This general term covers a variety of shapes that can be categorised by size (small = cup, medium = bowl, large = basin), by the position of their handle(s) (shoulder handle, high-swung handle) or by the profiles of their bodies (rounded, angular or carinated). They were probably intended for use at table and, as their surfaces had been burnished and were thus rendered impermeable, were suitable for holding liquids; the smaller sizes may have been used for drinking and eating, and the larger ones for mixing. Cups and bowls in this category had either one or two high-swung handles (1831, cup/bowl with two high-swung handles, = kantharos, and 1237, cup/bowl with one high-swung handle), or may have been handleless. Most examples, however, are sherds that do not retain evidence for the type of handle attachment. 1) Rounded cup/bowl with everted rim. Cups and bowls with rounded profiles appear throughout MH at Ayios Stephanos, beginning in the earliest deposits. 1037-1039, from the first MH deposit in Area Zeta, may represent an early variety which has a sharply offset rim and globular body; late in MH and in the Transitional MH/LH phase, the rims are longer and more upright, the body less globular (e.g. 1418, 1514, 2008, 2015). Among the earliest DB vessels, bowl 2214 has a high-swung strap handle (only one handle is preserved), flat in section, attached to the exterior of the rim and with the vestige of a tab-like attachment on the interior. This method of attaching handles to rims seems, at least at Lerna, to date to the very beginning of MH and to be confined to DB vessels. Few are preserved with their bases: 1094 is a plain, flat base; 1343 is flat and slightly concave underneath. Incised decoration appears on some examples, both in early (2206, 2207 and 2209) and later MH (1514). By the end of MH the shape is usually small in size and is also referred to as a semi-globular cup.92 It is common in LH I, usually in Fine and Gritty Plain and MP and LD, although rare in DB (e.g. 1516). 1154 has an unusual profile, almost an S-curve like that of Minoan rounded cups of MM II date,93 and may date to MH II. 2) Angular cup/bowl with everted rim. The term angular is used to designate a profile with an everted rim and an angle or carination approximately midway on the body. The profile, from lip to carination, has flat planes forming angles, not a continuous curve like the carinated cup. In the early phases of MH the shoulder was long and the handles high-swung above the rim (2208); the only base that was surely from a cup of this shape is flat (2210). In the late phases the shoulder was shorter and the cups generally smaller and squatter (1517, 2211). Incised decoration appears on a few, usually on the shoulder zone: horizontal lines on 1191; lines and multiple triangles on 2209; lines and diagonally hatched triangles on 2211. On one example, 2210, the decoration of horizontal lines and rows of 92 Mountjoy 1986, fig. 7. 93 MacGillivray 1998, fig. 2.14, type 2 rounded cup.</page><page sequence="216">THE MIDDLE HELLADIC POTTERY §3 191 punctate dots covers the body from shoulder to base (2210 is classified as an open shape because of the burnished interior surface). Carinated cup/bowl. The term carinated is used to describe a profile that forms a continuous concave curve from the lip to a point on the body where there is an angle or carination; unlike vessels with everted rims, there is no point that can be identified as a rim separate from the rest of the upper body. Carinated cups may have been handleless, or may have had one high-swung handle. Many have two high-swung handles and are termed kantharoi. Unlike the similar shape manufactured on Crete in MM IB/II, DB carinated cups appear to have been made by hand. Bases are either flat or slightly offset and concave underneath, or were fashioned as taller feet. One tripod base (1519) was preserved and may reflect Minoan traditions: the tripod base is not in the repertory of shapes typical of MH and, when it appears at MH sites, belongs to vessels imported from elsewhere, whether from Kythera, Aegina, Crete or the Cycladic islands, where tripod bases are common, especially in coarse cooking ware. This shape first appears in MH I and is characterised by a long, deep concavity (2212); in the later phases of MH the shoulder is often shorter and more vertical and the carination much less pronounced (1912). Early MH handles were thin and flat in section (e.g. 1831); later in the period some were thickened and troughed down the centre (e.g. 1484, 1520). A few examples were incised with decorative patterns: horizontal lines just above the carination (1237, 1831); two horizontal lines above and below a zone of triple triangles (1830); lines above carination and garlands below (1484, 1519); rows of punctate dots, lines, and groups of double triangles or zigzags (1417); rows of dashes (1416); and wide cross-hatching and impressed concentric circles (2213). Bowl or basin with everted rim and shoulder handles (also, shoulder-handled bowl). This shape appears only in larger sizes and may have been used for the mixing of liquids. The earliest example, 1196, has a plain, everted rim and a swollen shoulder (the maximum diameter is high on the shoulder of the bowl, which appears very wide and swollen - a feature of the earliest MH vessels at Lerna) and is decorated with incised lines. This shape has a long history, beginning in EH III with the Bass Bowls of Lerna IV.94 All types have an everted rim and strap handles, probably two in most cases, usually flat in section, placed vertically on the shoulder. The bases were flat or slightly offset, either plain or concave underneath. In the early phases of MH both ends of the shoulder handles were attached to the body, below and separate from the rim; by late MH the handles were attached to the rim itself and the shoulder; they were also squeezed up close to the body-wall and do not form as wide a curve as the earlier type. In earlier examples of this shape the rims are sharply everted and pronounced, often with a series of planes or facets (1095-1101). One small fragment (1196) preserves the beginning of a pronounced swelling of the body just below the rim and resembles the earliest MH type found at Lerna (there considered to be Transitional EH/MH). In the later phases of MH, rims are less pronounced and everted, and the profile of rim and shoulder is in general straighter. Early MH bowls have rounded or angular bodies (1036); the shoulder is plain or decorated with low, rounded ridges. MH I Late examples have ridges with sharper edges (1325). Low, rounded ridges were usual in the later phases. Decorative patterns were preserved on some of the bowls: in the most usual scheme, pendent garlands (in groups of double, triple or quadruple swags) were incised on the lower body. Goblet This shape is a later version of the carinated cup: the profile has a shorter, less pronounced and more upright curve; a spreading foot, concave underneath; two shoulder handles (i.e. handles which do not rise above the rim and are attached to the rim and body). Some examples are decorated with incised patterns: horizontal lines and festoons (1351, 1484, 1911, 2008). A few have low ribs on the shoulder (e.g. 1522-1524). The shape first appears in later MH deposits. Straight-sided cup. This type appears in an LH I deposit: 1518 has a strap handle and is the only example in DB from Ayios Stephanos. Rounded cup. This shape belongs to LH I; however, the example 3391 is MH III/LH I. This is incised with horizontal lines above and below a zone with foliate band, had a vertical handle that rose slightly above the rim. 94 Rutter 1995, Form XII.</page><page sequence="217">ig2 C. ZERNER Bowl with in-turned rim. There are only two rims that belong to this shape in DB from Ayios Stephanos: 1059 and 2035, which is incised with double eye-like pattern. It is common in other wares, e.g. Dull Painted as well as Aeginetan (possible example from Ayios Stephanos, 2328) and Cycladic wares,95 but was not regularly produced in mainland DB and GM. Pyxis. 2222, with a flat base and holes pierced in the rim for the attachment of a lid, is the only example of this shape from Ayios Stephanos. The decoration consists of both incised designs (horizontal lines separating a zone of chevrons and a zone of multiple triangles) and impressed designs (row of concentric circles). Although the shape is unusual in the ceramic repertory of the mainland, the decorative patterns of 2222 are typical DB motifs. Pyxides, plain and decorated, with or without holes in the rim and with tripod bases, have been found in MH contexts at other sites, namely Eutresis,96 Eleusis and Aegina.97 The flat base of an incised pyxis was found in MH levels at Lerna. This shape is typical of Early Cycladic,98 and similar examples in Dark-faced Incised ware with plain rims, tripod bases and white-filled incisions were found at Knossos." Like the flask, the pyxis is connected with Crete and the Cycladic islands.100 Small wide-mouthed jar or kantharos. This shape, represented by two rim sherds (2228-2229), is also found in DB ware in early MH levels at Lerna. It is possible that they belonged to a type of kantharos with a tall, fairly straight rim found in early MH contexts in Messenia.101 Flask. No complete examples remain from Ayios Stephanos, although fragments of possibly 13 different flasks have been identified: 1110, 1252, 1327, 1475, 1851-1855, 2223-2226, and 2227(?). Two types are represented: one with a thick, projecting rim pierced with string-holes (1851), the other with a plain, flaring rim and pierced neck (2223). One example was undecorated (1855), but the rest of the fragments were decorated with incised and impressed patterns. Motifs include rows of punctate dots, horizontal lines, diagonally hatched triangles, herringbone, concentric circles, vertical rows of impressed lozenges, concentric semicircles, and zigzags. This shape is known from MH deposits at Lerna, where 2 1 whole or fragmentary flasks have been identified;102 others have been found at Argos,103 Voïdokoilia,104 Aegina,105 Kirrha106 and one from an unidentified site, possibly Mycenae.107 They are all similar in fabric and in details of shape and decoration and thus may be said to belong to the same ceramic tradition. Like the pyxis form and the patterns incised on DB pots, the flask resembles a Cycladic type108 and a similar shape from Crete,109 both dating to the EBA. The projecting rim of many examples is very like that of the Cycladic duck vase and unlike any other rim type of mainland ceramics. The characteristics of fabric and style lead to the conclusion that these flasks were produced in the southern Péloponnèse, where potting traditions containing island elements existed.110 Two-handled jar. This small jar has a wide neck with everted rim, two up-tilted horizontal handles and a flat base. One complete example, 1849, was undecorated; another fragmentary one, 1108, was decorated with incised horizontal lines. Barrel jar. This is a deep, open-mouthed jar with slightly in-curving walls. Like its Cycladic and Aeginetan counterparts,111 there is a flange just below the rim. Only one fragment of the shape, 1022, an unusual one in the DB repertory, was found at Ayios Stephanos. Hole-mouthed jar. There are a few examples of this shape from late MH to early LH deposits (1021, 2028). The configuration and thickness of the rims vary, but the shape resembles one made in LD ware112 which, like 1021, has ribs on the shoulder. 95 Cf. Zerner iq88, figs. 1-2, 5. 96 Goldman 10*1, pl.

Its fabric appears to be DB type (although somewhat finer than usual), but the handle type is unusual at Ayios Stephanos. It is, however, a typical feature of MP ware at Lerna in MH II. 1485 is a fragment of a ring-stemmed goblet, a shape characteristic of the later MH period in the Argolid and central Greece in both GM and DB wares113 but rare at Ayios Stephanos. Comment DB ware from Ayios Stephanos is similar in many ways to burnished, dark-faced wares from other sites on the mainland. The manufacture of the same basic shapes and the dark surfaces and fabrics make identification of different wares and traditions difficult. Fortunately, there are a number of features of DB that are not characteristic of other dark-faced wares in other traditions: a red, micaceous fabric; a variety of unusual shapes, such as the flask, pyxis and tripod base; and incised and impressed designs. These features identify DB as the product of a different tradition. The term DB was chosen for the ware from Ayios Stephanos in order to distinguish it from GM. The surfaces of DB vessels were burnished with a hard tool that left visible streaks; often the burnishing was incomplete or nonexistent on the interior of open shapes. In contrast, the surfaces of GM vessels usually have few visible traces of the finishing techniques used, and both interior and exterior surfaces of open shapes were treated in the same way. The problems involved in the proper characterisation of this group were first pointed out in the analysis by Jones and Rutter.114 On the basis of archaeological criteria, the DB pottery of Ayios Stephanos had been unhesitatingly identified as local, until chemical analysis revealed that the clay type was different from other varieties of clay that were also considered local. Petrological work has confirmed that the clay of DB ware stands apart, mineralogically, from that of other ceramic wares from the site.115 Geologically, the clay could have come from a Laconian source. Therefore, rather than suggest a different region of manufacture, I consider it to be a local (i.e. Laconian or southern Peloponnesian) ware, but one belonging to a different tradition from that of other wares found at the site. Similar vessels from Lerna have also been analyzed by Jones and Whitbread and may be imports from this same area. Although many of the shapes represented at Ayios Stephanos were common throughout the mainland in GM and DB wares (such as the kantharos and shoulder-handled bowl), others, for example the bowl with in-turned rim, pyxis, flask, barrel and hole-mouthed jars, reflect Cycladic and/or Minoan influence. Parallels for other features can also be found in the islands, such as the tripod base of 1519 and the decorative patterns incised and impressed on many vessels, e.g. hatched triangles, spirals and impressed concentric circles that do not seem to have been used by potters of wares in other groups. These island connections, particularly with Crete, are found in other ceramic groups from Ayios Stephanos and, when viewed together, are quite striking.116 (b) GROUP II: DULL PAINTED WARE This is termed Dull Painted in Rutter and Rutter.117 Samples R40, R45 (= Set 1 Class 1 in Appendix 2). The clay used in this group is similar to that of groups I and III; however, the manufacturing techniques are different and justify the identification of three different groups within the same general classification by fabric. Unlike DB ware, which was produced throughout MH, DP was produced only in the early and middle phases of MH. Vessels in this ware were decorated with an iron-oxide- based paint (designated Dull Paint). Another painted ware, MP, appears to have replaced DP at Ayios Stephanos by the end of MH. These two wares, chronologically separate, were also stylistically distinct: decoration of the earlier, DP, was executed in an iron-oxide-based paint in a manner that resembles Minoan techniques, while the later ware was decorated with Matt Paint and appears closer to mainland or Helladic traditions. Fabric White (10YR 8/2), light grey (10YR 7/2) to light red (2.5YR 4/6) or yellowish red (5YR 5/6); very fine, porous-looking, soft-feeling; some tiny white inclusions, light red roundish bits, and dark grey chips but on the whole not many grits; some silver flecks visible on the fracture. 113 E.er.

Manufacturing techniques All DP vessels appear to have been made by hand. Handles were attached to the body by cutting a hole in the wall into which the ends of the handle were pushed. Unlike the practice of potters of LD, the makers of DP ware did not push the handle ends all the way into the interior of the pot, nor did they fashion the ends into plugs. The end of the handle of 1117 was carelessly pushed down, perhaps in order to seal the hole. Decoration Thin, dull-looking paint, red (2.5YR 5/6), reddish-brown (2.5YR and 5YR 5/4) on a pink surface, grey (7.5YR 3/0 to 4/0; very dark grey) to dark brown (7.5YR 4/2 to 3/2). Other colours were rarely added to produce a bichrome or polychrome style: white on 1074, red on 1069. Patterns: horizontal and vertical bands or stripes are the most common and were used both to divide areas of the surface into zones (e.g. 1066, 1117, 1255) and in rows or groups of either vertical or diagonal stripes, in rows (1255) or in groups, both in a limited, banded zone (e.g. 1255, 1301) and covering large areas (e.g. 1117). Other common patterns are triangles, both diagonally hatched (1255) and cross-hatched (1864); less common are the dotted cross (1074), drips (1262, 2041), garlands (1071), cross-hatched racquet (2238), lozenge (1329), cross-hatched double garland (1123), fir tree (1123) and ladder (1002). Some of these patterns are not found in the repertory of decorated pottery (i.e. MP) in the Central Area but are found on Minoan pottery: drips, cross-hatched racquet and dotted cross, for example.118 Shapes The most common were deep bowls with in-turned rims and narrow necked jars with flaring rims. Cup/bowl with everted rim. Two rims belong to this type (1859 and 2040). The reconstruction of a complete profile, however, is uncertain. One body sherd, 1858, probably came from a rounded cup or bowl with everted rim, a shape typical of DB. Double cup/bowl Only two certain fragments were found at Ayios Stephanos: connecting stems, 1065 and 1111. Neither gives any evidence of the profile of the cups or bowls that it joined. Although not a common shape in the MBA, complete examples of the double bowl come from Koryphasion,119 in MP ware, and from Malthi,120 in Plain ware. Incomplete vessels of this type in MP and GM wares were also found at Lerna. Cup/bowl with in-turned rim. This shape is the most common in DP ware. Rim profiles vary considerably: from plain and tapering (1068), to plain and slightly thickened (e.g. 1067, 1070), to thickened in T- form or on one side only (1245, 1254)- A number have spouts preserved. (a) Spouted cup with in-turned rim and handle upright on rim. The rim of this cup, 1066, was pulled out to form a simple spout. This practice of pulling out a rim before the clay was dry and hard was common on Crete and in the LD workshops.121 (b) Bridge-spouted cup with in-turned rim. Rim 1067 is the only example of this type. The shape of the spout is typically Minoan.122 (c) Bowl with in-turned rim and two horizontal handles. Each example of this type varies slightly from the others in the configuration of rim and curvature of the body walls. 1070 has straight sides; 1204 and i860 are more sharply incurved; 2236 has straight, almost flaring walls and a rim with concave or grooved upper surface. All probably had flat bases (e.g. 1069, 1071, i860). One fragment, i860, 118 Betancourt 1985, fig. 56h. 119 Biegen 1954, pl. 37:5. 120 Valmin 1938, fig. 68. 121 Cf., at Knossos, Wilson 1985, fig. 13: 96-7. 122 E.g. bridge-spouted jar, Betancourt 1985, hg. 05.</page><page sequence="220">THE MIDDLE HELLADIC POTTERY §3 195 preserves a spout. The number of such bowls is hard to estimate, because the interior surfaces of both bowls and jars were finished in similar fashion, and one cannot easily distinguish between them. The shape and decorative schemes are reminiscent of Early Minoan bowls from Myrtos and Knossos.123 Plate. There are two examples of this shape: 1166 with a slightly offset base and thickened walls, and 2235 with plain, slightly flaring walls. The surface of the first is very worn but appears to have had 1- o-d decoration; the second has d-o-1 decoration that extends to the underside of the base. This shape is found in LD at Ayios Stephanos (2274), Lerna124 and Kastri on Kythera.125 It is common on Crete;126 see further under the same shape in LD ware. Jug with beaked spout The only complete example of this shape, 1117, has a wide neck and low spout, globular body and round-sectioned handle. The body is decorated with groups of diagonal lines that run from neck to base. The shape and the decorative scheme resemble EM II jugs from Myrtos.127 Jug handle 2237 is marked with incised lines at the upper end of the attachment to the rim. Potters' marks are a characteristic feature of LD and Aeginetan workshops; this is the only mark on a DP vessel thus far known to me, and it may have been merely decorative.128 Wide-mouthed jar. The rims of two jars with wide mouths and short, slightly flaring necks have been recognised. 1208 has a plain lip with a groove along the top edge; the rim of 1209 is thickened on the exterior. Both examples have a pair of loops painted on the interior rim. A restoration of the complete profile is not possible, but 1210 is probably the base of 1208. Globular jar. The jar, represented by rim fragment 1263, has a wide neck and short rim, flattened on top, that projects toward the exterior. A trace of paint is preserved on the body. Jar with narrow neck and flaring rim. The body of this jar is globular: its shoulder slopes in a gentle curve up to the point from which the rim flares out; there are no definite transitions defining shoulder, neck and rim. The shape, which is very distinctive, is characteristic of wares in three other groups about which I am certain (I have not actually handled all examples, such as the jar of the same shape from Koryphasion,129 which may be of a different fabric group, one local to Messenia): these are Group V, LD (e.g. 2281), Group VI, Micaceous Minoan (2303), and Group VIII, Aeginetan MP.130 The DP shape and decorative schemes are closely related to those of LD; the Aeginetan, although similar, can be easily distinguished from both, stylistically and technologically. This shape was not made in potting traditions that I consider to be typically Helladic. Comment The name of this ware refers to the dull appearance of the pigment used in the decoration, which is not Matt Paint. The shapes and decorative patterns, as well as other features such as the use of added red and white paint and the incised mark on one of the handles, have Minoan parallels. Many of these parallels or similarities, however, date to EM II, unlike those for LD, which, at the time of its first appearance in the earliest phases of MH, date to MM IA. This resemblance to styles from an earlier period in another area (a phenomenon that also seems to occur in DB ware, which has stylistic parallels in the EM and EC II ceramic repertories) is striking and may help to elucidate the vexed problem of chronology.131 (c) GROUP III: MATT PAINTED WARE AND YELLOW MINYAN WARE, FINE AND GRITTY By the end of MH two styles that were popular in other areas of the mainland began to be produced in the southern Péloponnèse: YM and MP, in both fine and gritty fabrics. Matt Paint had been popular in the Central Area from the beginning of the period; the light-coloured burnished or polished surfaces that characterise YM were produced throughout the period, but they only began to replace in popularity the darker-coloured surfaces of GM late in MH.

ZERNER Ayios Stephanos coincided with the appearance of other ceramics that had been common in the Central Area of the mainland throughout MH, most notably Aeginetan imports and GM ware. Matt Painted, fine, and Yellow Minyan, fine Although these are two different wares, they are treated together here because they share the same basic descriptions and shapes. They are termed Fine Matt-painted and Fine 'Yellow Minyan' in Rutter and Rutter.132 Fabric Yellowish red (5YR 5/6), light red (2.5YR 5/6) to red (2.5YR 5/8), occasionally with a grey core (one fragment has a buff core, 7.5 YR 7/4 pink); usually very fine but occasionally with noticeable inclusions: tiny bits of silver (rarely visible in the biscuit), some dark red and tiny bits of white. Surface Reddish yellow (5YR 6/6) to brown (7.5YR 5/4) or buff (7.5YR 7/4 pink) or red (2.5YR 5/6); sometimes with white slip that looks ivory-coloured (10YR 8/3, very pale brown); almost always burnished or polished on the interior and exterior. Manufacturing techniques There are no features visible on fine vessels in this group that indicate how they were manufactured. On the other hand, rilling and other signs of wheel-throwing are lacking and lead one to assume that they were made by hand, possibly with the help of a turntable. Decoration Both wares have light-coloured, burnished surfaces; MP ware has added painted decoration. Undecorated fragments, especially from rims or bases, may have belonged to vessels that were either plain or painted. Decoration with Matt Paint (dark brown to black) was usually in d-o-1 style. However, designs in two or three colours also appear: bichrome, using red (10R 5/8 to 10R 4/6) or yellowish red (5YR 5/6) iron-oxide-based paint together with either dark brown or black manganese-based paint, is the usual combination, but on some fragments a thickish white paint is combined with the red and black in a polychrome style (1606). The most common motifs are the horizontal band (e.g. 1597) and zigzag (e.g. 1428, 1588); less common are the pendent loop (2246), wavy line (2247), pendent concentric semicircles (1592, 2245) and cross-hatched triangle (1590). One example (1606) has white dots on a dark horizontal band. The interiors of rims were often decorated with groups of vertical lines or stripes (e.g. 1595). Shapes Most shapes in fine YM and MP are open drinking vessels, primarily semi-globular cups and goblets. It should be noted that because of the fragmentary nature of the material, many sherds could not be classified as from one particular shape or another. Typical of LH I are the following: Semi-globular cup. Only one profile of this type, 1367, can be restored from rim to base. Many other rims and a few handle fragments belong to the type from Grave Circle B at Mycenae,133 with rounded profile, everted rim, and loop handle (attached to rim and body) rising slightly above the rim, sometimes with a clay pellet at the point of attachment to the rim (1540, 1553). Pellets of clay applied to vessels at this point of attachment are considered to be imitations of rivets on metal vases and date to LH I.134 This type of cup from Mycenae has a low foot, concave beneath, but no bases certainly of this shape have been preserved at Ayios Stephanos. The configuration of the rim varies: it may be plain, flaring (1543), hollowed on the interior (1540) or thickened on the exterior (1541). 135 Angular cup. Only one example, 1535, has been recognised, and it may have belonged to a kantharos or one-handled cup.136 132 Rutter and Rutter 1976, 9-10. 133 Mylonas 1973, pl. 231: T 24 and M 148. 134 For this date at Tzouneiza see Rutter 1080, 11. 135 For the shape see Davis 1979, fig. 9: 163-73; Mylonas 1073, pl. 231: F 24 and M 148. 136 For the shape see Dietz 1991, fig. 47: AA-7; Davis 1979, %• 9: ^õ'» Mylonas 1973, pl. 232: S 187.</page><page sequence="222">THE MIDDLE HELLADIC POTTERY §3 197 Kantharos. 1321 from Eta burial 15 is a complete example of this type, which represents a continuation of the popular DB shape into LH I, when the light-coloured surface of YM was preferred. There are two types of profile: carinated (1554-1555) and rounded (as the semi-globular cup). Strap handles rise high above the rim and are either fairly thin and troughed, or thick, almost square in section, and troughed; a few examples of tripartite handles were found (e.g. 1559). Feet are concave underneath (132 1).137 Goblet The distinction is made here between a kantharos, a cup with two handles that rise high above the rim, and a goblet, a cup on a foot with one or two handles that either do not rise above the rim or rise very slightly above, e.g. 1566. Most fragments from Ayios Stephanos do not preserve evidence of the handle type and therefore cannot be classified as one or the other. The goblet in Fine YM or Fine MP does not appear until LH I. The profile is rounded, the rim slightly everted, at times hollowed; the handles are troughed straps, and sometimes a clay pellet is added at the attachment with the rim (e.g. 3385). 138 Squat jug or jar. Two fragments, 1605 with a band of white on the lower body, and 1606 decorated in polychrome style, belong to this LH I shape. Two others, 1572 and 1573, may belong to the same type.139 Comment Fine YM and MP are characteristic of the latest phase of MH, transitional to LH, and early LH phases in the Central Area. At Ayios Stephanos they appear to belong to LH I, and their shapes replace those of DB. Yellow Minyan, gritty, and Matt Painted, gritty These are termed Gritty MP and Gritty YM in Rutter and Rutter 1976.140 Samples 2265, 2321 (= Set 3 Class 1 in Appendix 2, with plate 61 è). Fabric Pinkish grey (7.5 YR 6/2), light grey (10YR 7/2), pale brown (10YR 6/3) to orange, sometimes a dirty brown colour; often layered with a grey core, orange toward the interior surface, and brown toward the exterior; firm and hard, slightly grainy-looking; inclusions range from microscopic to large: white (limestone), tiny black, grey and other colours, some round ones that look like raisins pressed into the biscuit, also silver bits. Surface Reddish yellow (7.5 YR 7/6-6/6) to light grey (10YR 7/2) or pink (7.5 YR 7/4); often pitted; either well burnished or partially burnished (e.g. the interior of goblets); a fine scatter of silver bits, some larger pieces of quartz visible. Manufacturing techniques As in DP ware, the most distinctive feature of these wares is the manner of attachment of handles: holes were cut in the walls of vessels, into which the ends of the handles were inserted; they do not protrude into the interior of the vase. This technique was not practised by potters in the Central Area (I have not yet found evidence for it) and supports the assignment of this group to the southern Péloponnèse. Decoration Same as described above under fine YM and fine MP. Only two pieces are decorated in a bichrome style; the rest are d-o-1. Shapes The most common are goblets, kantharoi and jars, but the fragments, like those of fine MP and YM, often cannot be assigned to one particular shape. 137 For the shape see Dietz 1991, fig. 47: AA-6, AA-4 (3); Davis 1979, fig. 9: 190; Mylonas 1973, pls. 234: A 7 and 235: E 182. 138 For the shape see Davis 1979, fig. 9:187-9. 139 For the shape see Dietz 1991, figs. 53: AF-14 and 54: AF- 13a; Davis 1Q7Q, fiff. a: u; Mvlonas io'?*, ol. 221;: A8. 140 Rutter and Rutter 1976, 6-9.</page><page sequence="223">ig8 C. ZERNER Vapheio cup or straight-sided cup. Only one fragment belongs to this shape (1633). See Dietz 1991, fig. 48: AB-10-13. Semi-globular cup (see above, fine YM and fine MP). The profile of this shape is very like that of the rounded goblet and can be distinguished from it by its smaller size. Only rims are preserved (1607, 1635-1637) l41 Carinated cup. 3401 is the only complete example of this type: it has a slightly flaring convex upper body and, below an angle, a concave lower body. The type is related to the earlier MH one in DB ware. Double cup/bowl. 2267 is a fragment of a double vessel, probably two joining cups or bowls, decorated in bichrome style. Like the same shape in DP (1065 and 1111), it appears to be a mainland type of late MH and early LH. Goblet and/or kantharos. Complete examples of kantharoi were found in Area Nu, both with carinated (R246) and rounded profiles (R297). However, because most of the examples presented here are sherds and cannot be assigned to one shape, they are classified as goblets, with both angular (e.g. 1638-1648) and rounded profiles (e.g. 1649-1672). They may have one (e.g. 1649) or two (eS- 1614) handles, the position of which varies in relation to the rim: level with the rim (e.g. 1649) or rising slightly above it (e.g. 1669). Only 1672 is high-swung and may also be a kantharos. The configuration of the rim may also vary: plain and tapering (e.g. 1614) or squared, with a groove along the top (e.g. 1619). The bases are all low feet, concave beneath (e.g. 1620-1623). Examples decorated with Matt Paint are common: d-o-1 is usual; only one is bichrome (2059). The typical scheme consists of a band around the interior and exterior of the lip, decorated on the exterior with pendent loops (1654); a band around the base of the rim on the exterior, plain or trimmed with pendent dashes (1652); a shoulder, either plain or decorated with triangle(s) (1658), hatched triangle (1651) or spiral (1656); and band(s), plain or with pendent loops, around the point of widest diameter (e.g. 1649). The handles are barred (e.g. 1669); some also have pendent loops (1672) and cross (1649). The underside of 1649 *s painted with a cross.142 Spouted bowl Bichrome rim 1695 is the only example of this shape, described as a 'deep bowl with wide opening and heavy flat rim'143 or 'krater'.144 Unlike these examples, 1695 has an opening for a spout just below the rim.145 Deep bowl or basin. A few rims are catalogued here as deep bowls or basins. Their rims and profiles vary considerably. 2046 and 2047 have wide mouths and rims that are slightly thickened on the exterior. Rim 2250 protrudes toward the exterior, 1432 is thickened on both sides, 2257 has a pronounced T-shape, and 2251 is hollowed on the upper edge. 2046 has a crescent handle, slightly uptilted, on the rim where there is also a lug, as on bowl R217 in DB ware. The shape is related to one in LD146 that also has small lugs on the rim.147 Globular jug. 1322 has a fairly wide neck with flaring rim, globular body, troughed strap handle and slightly convex flat base. Similar jugs are known from Grave Circle B at Mycenae and many other sites in the Argolid, but there is quite a bit of variation in the details of this shape.148 Beak-spouted jug. 1323 is another shape familiar from burials of the Shaft Grave period. The angular profile and decorative pattern of running spirals date it to LH I.149 Globular jar. Examples of this shape (1436, 1673-1674, 2259) have a wide mouth with everted rim and globular body. 2260 has an almost straight rim that is hollowed slightly on the interior. 141 For the shape see Dietz 1991, fig. 48: AB- 17. 142 For the shape see Davis iQ7Q, fig- q: 184-q. 143 Bleeen 1021, ^o, no. *. 144 Davis 1Q7Q, fiff. *: ^2-^. 145 For the shape see Mylonas 1972, pl. 230: O 189; Davis 1979» 243» 247. 146 Zerner 1988, fig. 30: 20-2. 147 For discussion see Rutter and Rutter 1976, 37 n. 26. 148 See Mylonas 1973, pl. 66: A y; Dietz 1991, 173, Jug with Horizontal Spout, figs. 53: AF-15 (1) and 54: AF-15 (2). 149 For the shape see Dietz 1991, 172, Beaked Jug, fig. 54: AF-4.</page><page sequence="224">THE MIDDLE HELLADIC POTTERY §3 199 Hole-mouthed jar. Rim 1677 has the same configuration as a bridge-spouted hole-mouthed jar from Area Nu, Deposit N (R690); both date to LH I/IIA. Jugs/jars/hydriai. Many fragments of the rims, necks and flat bases of jars or jugs were found in early LH deposits. The rim thickness varies, from thin (e.g. 1024) to fairly thick (e.g. 1929). One cannot reconstruct whole profiles with certainty, but they belong to types of jugs, jars and hydriai found in the Argolid.150 Some of the fragments have decorative patterns in Matt Paint: horizontal banding (e.g. 1688), some bands having a pendent fringe (1684) or pendent concentric semicircles (2266); groups of lines, placed obliquely (e.g. 1681, 2066); rows of dots (1681); double zigzag filled with dots (2259); hatched (1686), cross-hatched (1690) or solid (2263) triangles; running spiral (1689); cross (1693); and double concentric circles with a circular mass of dots in the centre (1025). A similar circular mass of dots appears on 2264. One fragment, 1930, has a vertical panel decorated with oblique and crisscrossing lines; 2074 with a similar pattern may belong to this ware and group. 2073 also has an unusual pattern, herringbone within vertical bands, which is closest to the Aeginetan MP style of early LH.151 Circles were drawn around the base of round-sectioned vertical handles (e.g. 2065); on horizontal handles one circle was drawn around each base (e.g. 1691-1692) and was not drawn as a figure-of-eight like that typical of the Aeginetan style.152 Comment By Transitional MH/LH or the Shaft Grave period, YM and MP had completely replaced DP and had almost replaced DB in popularity. Unlike the two earlier wares, which had their own particular shapes, the same shapes were used for both YM and MP. (ii) Southern Péloponnèse: Weathered Igneous Rock The most prominent characteristic are the plates of dull copper- and silver-coloured material on the surface. GROUP IV: COARSE WARES Sample 2319 (= Set 6 Class 1 in Appendix 2, with plate 62*). The wares are all coarse, and either burnished or unburnished, plain or incised. They are treated together here because they share the same shapes, as well as the same fabric and surface descriptions. Fabric Orange (2.5YR 5/6), red (2.5YR 4/8) to reddish brown (5YR 5/4) with grey core, but very often dark grey throughout; coarse, gritty-looking; many visible inclusions, from large-sized chips of dark colour to smaller dark red, whitish-grey, black and orange grits. Surface Red (2.5YR 5/6), yellowish red (5YR 5/6), reddish brown (5YR 5/4), dark grey (5YR 4/1) to dark reddish grey (5YR 4/2), very rarely light-coloured (buff); sometimes burnished. Manufacturing techniques All vessels were made by hand. One handle, broken off at the point of attachment, had been pressed up against the wall in the same manner of attachment as handles in DB ware. Decoration Small knobs were sometimes attached to the shoulders of jars and perhaps cups/bowls; designs, usually groups of horizontal and oblique lines, were incised on some cups/bowls. There is one example of an incised or pie-crust rim, a feature of MH I. A few pithoi have incised decoration on the shoulder zone. Painted decoration is rare: one jar (1005) has a band around the neck. 150 Dietz 1991, 189-94, fìgs. 58-Q. 151 Cf. Mountjoy 1981, fig. 321-. 152 Cf. Mountjoy 1981, fig. 11: 102.</page><page sequence="225">2OO C. ZERNER Shapes The most common were cups or bowls and wide-mouthed jars with rounded profiles and everted rims, which were used in cooking and probably for other purposes in the kitchen. Other vessels were used for storage, i.e. the pithos, and have lighter-coloured surfaces. Cup. There are a number of examples of a small, roughly-made cup with fairly straight walls (although the profile varies and the walls either flare out or turn in), with one handle (1337) or no handles (1136, 1887-1888, 2312-2313). Rounded cup. 1507 is the only example of this shape, a cup with rounded profile and high-swung strap handle. It probably dates to LH I. Rounded cup/bowl with everted rim. This shape appears to have been the most popular small vessel in the kitchen, for cooking and perhaps other uses as well, throughout MH. It has a rounded body, everted rim, flat base and one strap handle (there is no evidence for two-handled cooking pots) that swings high above the rim. As in the similar shape in DB, early examples have a swelling shoulder, e.g. 1 177, 1277. In early MH the base was flat and the rim sharply everted (e.g. 1 140); in late MH, it had a shorter and straighter, less everted rim and smaller base (2314). Some were decorated with incised patterns (e.g. 1177-1179) usually drawn all over the exterior surface. In the earlier phases of MH, patterns were more carefully drawn (e.g. 1086-1087), whereas in later MH they were more sloppily executed (e.g. 1986). Rounded bowl with everted rim, pierced One fragment, 2315, may have belonged to a strainer. Such vessels appear in EH III at Lerna;153 in early MH Lerna the shape is similar, but the holes no longer penetrate the body wall and are merely decorative. This fragment may date to Transitional EH III/MH I. Straight-sided bowl. Rim-fragment 1224 may belong to a deep bowl with straight sides. The exterior surface is decorated with incised, crossed lines. Bowl with in-turned rim, or basin. A number of fragments belong to a shape that may be described as a deep bowl or basin. Profiles vary considerably: 1017 and 2157 are deep and rounded with a rim flat on top and protruding toward the exterior or interior; 1797 and 2158 are deep and straight-sided with a T-shaped rim; 1798 and 2159 are deep with in-turning walls and a plain rim; and 1800 is a wide-mouthed bowl with a rim bevelled on the interior. Plate (?). A few fragments, 1234, 1801 and 2000, may belong to a shallow bowl or plate with flaring walls. Shallow bowl or plate (?). 2199 is the plain rim of a shallow bowl or plate with straight sides.154 Jug. A few sherds are designated as jugs, either because they have vertical handles or because of the formation of their rims, e.g. 1890 and 1891. Hole-mouthed jar. Only one example of this shape, 1804, was identified: its date is early LH. Two-handled jar. 2316 has an upright rim, globular body and two vertical handles attached to the top of the rim and shoulder. Wide-mouthed jar with everted rim. This shape was common at MH sites all over the mainland throughout the period and continued to be made in LH. It was certainly used for cooking (traces of burning remain on most examples) and surely for other purposes in the kitchen. The rims are usually everted (e.g. 1046), but some are almost straight (e.g. 1047, 1814). The body has a rounded shoulder tapering to a flat base, usually small. Sizes varied from small, with a rim diameter of 13, to very large, 41 (1901). Some shoulders look almost swollen, e.g. 1033; others have a straighter profile, e.g. 1049. Most are handleless: only one fragment, 1229, has evidence of a vertical handle, attached to rim and shoulder; and one small jar, 2317, has two horizontal up-tilted handles. Bases are small, and either 153 Rutter 1995, 43, Form VII. 154 For the shape see Dietz 1991, fig. 16: 109-10 (MH IIIA).</page><page sequence="226">THE MIDDLE HELLADIC POTTERY §3 201 flat (e.g. 1283, 1508) or quite small and knoblike (1284, 1411-1412). Knobbed projections were added to the shoulders of some; in the earlier phases of MH these were long and projected quite a bit (e.g. 1049); by the later phases they were smaller and less conspicuous. One example of a pie-crust rim, a very early MH type, was found (1088). One fragment (1005) with a painted band around the neck may belong to this shape. Jar with horizontal belly handles. A few body-sherds with the remains of horizontal handles, e.g. 1048, 1182, 1226, belong to some kind of jar. The shape is not certain but may have been different from the typical wide-mouthed jar with everted rim, which does not usually have handles. Jar with T-rim. 1802 has an undulating profile and a T-shaped rim. It is unusual but reminiscent of the rims of pithoi (e.g. 1150). Pithos. Like the other coarse-ware shapes, profiles vary: one has a high neck and out-turned rim, usually flat on top and thickened on the exterior (e.g. 1018, 1315); another has a short out-turned rim (e.g. 1409); a third has a straight neck that narrows at the mouth and a vertical handle attached to neck and shoulder (e.g. 1150, 1235). There is evidence on a few sherds for horizontal handles placed high on the shoulder, near the rim (e.g. 1034). A few fragments were decorated: spirals incised on the neck of 2203, a zone of herringbone on 1034 and 2204, a horizontal row of oval impressions made by a finger-tip on 1341. A few fragments have a horizontal band of clay applied at the base of the neck (1152, plain), on the shoulder (1409, decorated with finger impressions) or lower on the body (e.g. 1410, decorated with finger impressions, and 2202, decorated with incised vertical lines). Other. 2201 is a thick fragment with a hole cut before firing; it may have belonged to a pierced stand. (iii) Southern Péloponnèse (Kythera?): Mudstone and Chert Prominent characteristics are the Minoan nature of the shapes and decoration, the multitude of white and vari-coloured inclusions identified as sand155 in the biscuit of the medium-coarse and coarse fabrics, and the incised and impressed potters' marks. The only ceramic ware is Lustrous Decorated, which appears in fine, medium-coarse and coarse fabrics. The name is that given by J. L. Caskey, who was the first to identify it as a MH ware;156 it refers to the type of paint used to decorate vessels in the group (very few undecorated ones have been recognised). GROUP V: LUSTROUS DECORATED WARE, FINE, MEDIUM-COARSE AND COARSE Fabric The fine variety is very fine, and it is often difficult to tell it apart from true Minoan. Even the coarser varieties resemble certain Minoan fabrics, particularly the 'Northeast Crete Temper Group'.157 1 cannot be certain that all the sherds catalogued here as LD are in fact that, but I have tried to single out those of which I am unsure and mark them with a query: LD(?) or Minoan(?).158 Manufacturing techniques A number of technical details set this ware apart. On one jug rim, 1870, a fine, untempered clay was chosen for the lip and added to the gritty or sand-tempered clay of the neck. Similar rims have been identified among LD vessels from Lerna. The potters regularly pushed handles through the body-walls of vessels so that the ends protruded into the interior. On jugs, the pointed end that came through the wall was left as it was; this may have been because the handle, which was attached vertically to the neck and body, could not be affixed until the neck and rim had been joined to the rest of the body, at which point in the forming process the potter would have been unable easily to reach inside the pot to smooth over the protruding point. In the case of jars, since the potter could attach these belly handles before joining the neck, the two ends of each horizontal handle were smoothed over to form rounded bumps on the interior. In contrast to the triangular wedge handles on similar jars in Aeginetan ware, LD horizontal handles were coils, the two ends of which were thrust through the body wall of the vessel. 155 See Appendix 2 §2 (ii) (f). 156 Caskey 1954, 29-30; 1955, 35 n. 19. 157 Zerner, Betancourt and Myer 1086, 6o. 158 See §4 (i) below for further discussion.</page><page sequence="227">2O2 C. ZERNER Another characteristic feature of jars and jugs is visible on interior surfaces, which bear the marks or striations left by a hard-edged scraping tool and, often, impressions of the fingertips of the potter. By MM IB, the potter's wheel was used to throw small vessels in this ware. Although potters continued to throw small forms during the remainder of the period, they continued to make larger shapes by hand. Decoration Almost all vessels in this ware were decorated with a paint of iron oxide that sometimes appears lustrous (most sherds are very worn by use and deposition) and, as a result of firing, varies from black (very dark grey, 7.5YR 3/0) to dark brown (7.5YR 3/2), and dark reddish brown (5YR 3/2) to red (2.5YR 5/6-5YR 6/6); often other patterns were added in thin white and red or purple (10R 3/4, dusky red) paints. Other decoration was applied with clay, either dots (barbotine) or horizontal ribs. Although LD potters followed styles current on Crete, their repertoire was limited, and few of the more complex Minoan schemes were adopted. In the earlier phases of MH, patterns were primarily linear, and polychromy did not become usual until the middle of the period. Lustrous Decorated, Fine This is termed Fine Minoanizing in Rutter and Rutter.159 Fabric Pinkish buff (7.5YR 8/4) to light red (2.5YR 6/6), often with a light grey core. Smooth, compact and firm-feeling; very few visible inclusions, mainly small bits of white (limestone), and rarely dark-coloured particles; a few fragments have a noticeable quantity of silver particles (quartz). Surface Light brown (7.5 YR 6/4), pinkish buff (5YR 8/4-7/6 to 7.5 YR 8/4); in some cases, the exterior was lightly burnished. Decoration Vessels were decorated with lustrous paint and added designs in dull white and red or purple, or with applied decoration. Painted decoration: early MH cups are decorated on the exterior in d-o-1 and l-o- d styles, and usually with a band of dark paint on the interior of the rim (on the exceptions 1334 and 1476 see below) and around the perimeter of the underside of the base. By MH II, both the interior and the exterior surfaces are solidly coated with lustrous paint; the exterior is decorated with added patterns in white and red. Plastic decoration in applied clay is found on a few vessels and is limited to row of small dots of clay (also called bosses)160 attached to the surface in the barbotine style. Shapes These are the same as those popular on Crete in the Middle Minoan period. Footed goblet or egg cup. One cup decorated in the barbotine style, 1334, was preserved. The shape is Minoan;161 the date is MM IA. Angular cup. This MH I type, hand-made and lacking the concave profile of the MM IB-II wheel- thrown cup (here called a carinated cup), has a straight rim, at times in-turned, an angle in the profile and a low foot (1476 is coated on the interior and may perhaps be a Minoan import). L-o-d fragment 1126 has a spout formed by slightly pulling out the rim. 1124, 1125 and 2269 are decorated with barbotine dots. The shape is Minoan;162 the date is MM IA. Rounded cup. This shape has an incurving, plain rim and rounded profile from rim to flat base: d-o-1 1075, l-o-d 1170 and 2268, and polychrome 1076 and 1477. Some may have had one handle or may have been without a handle altogether. 2268 has a bit of the vertical handle originally on the cup and part of a potter's mark on the body under the handle.

Carinated cup. The MH II type was thrown on the potter's wheel and was usually decorated by a coat of paint all over the interior and exterior. White paint is discernible on some fragments; most sherds are too worn and do not retain added decoration, e.g. 1344, 1933, 2076-2077. A bit of a vertical handle is preserved on 1932.

The shape is Minoan;166 the date is MM I- III. Semi-globular cup. This shape, thrown on the potter's wheel, has an everted rim, rounded or globular body and flat base. It begins to be produced in late MH, in both 1-o-d (e.g. 1937) and polychrome (e.g. 1441) styles, a combination of d-o-1 and polychrome (e.g. 2270) and, by LH I, in d-o-1 style that follows LM IA (e.g. 3458). The shape is Minoan;167 the date is MM III. Although the shape was produced in earlier phases of MM, the examples from Ayios Stephanos most closely resemble those of MM IIIB from Kastri on Kythera. Straight-sided or Vapheio cup. This wheel-thrown shape was produced by LD potters at the end of MH and in early LH. 1697-1705 are examples in d-o-1 and 1-o-d styles from the latest MH and Transitional deposits on the site. The shape is Minoan;168 the date is MM III-LH I. Hole-mouthed (bridge-spouted?) jar. 1373 is the only example of ajar of this shape in fine fabric examined here.

ZERNER Semi-globular cup. Two examples of this shape in medium-coarse fabric, 1714 and 1943, decorated in 1-o-d style, have vertical loop-handles; that of 1714 rises above the rim. The shape is Minoan, the same as LD, fine (see above). Bowl or basin. A number of fragments of this large open shape, with rounded body and everted rim, were recognised. The contour of the rim varies considerably, from everted (e.g. 2095), faceted on the interior (e.g. 2094) and thickened on the interior (e.g. 1376), to T-shaped (e.g. 1378) and hooked (e.g. 1448). All have either 1-o-d or polychrome decoration on the exterior, unlike the Kytheran in-and-out bowls and basins, which are of similar shape but patterned on the interior.172 Only one, 1716, is plain and has a small lug on the rim. They date to MH III. The shape is Minoan, MM III.173 Plate. Only one fragment, 2274, of this MH I shape in LD ware is known from Ayios Stephanos. The exterior surface, including the underside of the base, is decorated in 1-o-d style. The shape is Minoan; the date is MM I.174 Jug. Although many fragments of jugs were found, few were rims, and the spouts cannot be reconstructed. It is likely, however, that the shapes resembled those in LD ware, both beaked and round-mouthed jugs, from Kythera and Lerna, decorated in d-o-1, 1-o-d and polychrome styles. Fragments 1872 and 2275 belong to the MH I type of jug with beaked spout and ribbed shoulder. An intact example of this early type was found on Kythera.175 Other complete or almost complete examples of the same shape but with a handle that ends in a point at its upper end have been found at Lerna176 and Papoulia in Messenia.177 The vertical handles were round in section in early MH (e.g. 1870), or flattened ovals (e.g. 1948) in later MH. In MH I and II they were pushed through the body-wall, and the points protrude on the interior (e.g. 1871); by late MH this practice began to disappear (1717). Like the jar with narrow neck and flaring rim, LD jugs were often marked by the potters. Two such potter's marks have been identified at Ayios Stephanos: 1077, on the neck below the handle; and 2276, on the upper side of the handle. The shapes are Minoan, MM I- III.178 Hole-mouthed jar. Six rims belong to this well-known Minoan shape; only one, however, preserves a bridge-spout (1722) and the stub of a basket-handle. 2109 and 2277 have simple rims; 1950 is slightly everted at the lip; 2110 is flattened on the exterior; 2108 curves inward above a ridge on the exterior body-wall. They appear in deposits of MH I- III date. The Minoan shape dates to MM I-MM HI.179 Jar with narrow neck and flaring rim. This storage vessel has a flaring mouth, narrow neck, globular body, two horizontal handles that tilt upward on the belly, and a flat base. The handles were round or oval in section; their two ends were pushed through the body-wall and the rough ends then smoothed over. Its most characteristic feature is a shoulder that slopes gently up to a point from which the rim or mouth flares out; the neck is not set off from the shoulder. This shape is one of the most popular in LD throughout MH, and in contrast to most of the other shapes in the ware, there does not seem to have been a similar Minoan shape. In addition to LD it was produced in Group II, DP ware,180 Group VI, Micaceous Minoan ware181 and Group VIII, Aeginetan MP ware.182 The shape was produced throughout MH and was always made by hand. In earlier phases the rim was plain and often long (e.g. 1079); in the later phases it became shorter, and sometimes on its interior there were grooves or ridges (e.g. 1384 and 1388). This shape can be decorated in d-o-1, 1-o-d and polychrome styles. Many jars, especially in MH I and II, were decorated in d-o-1 style, usually in the following pattern: a narrow band around the 172 Coldstream and Huxley 1972, pl. 23: 29-34. 173 Betancourt 1985, fig. 77; cf. at Kythera, Coldstream and Huxley 1972, Deposit Epsilon nos. 29-34, fig. 38; and at Lerna, Zerner 1988, figs. 27-8: 6-12. 174 Cf. at Knossos, Momigliano 2000, 95, fig. 18 no. 78; at Kythera, Coldstream and Huxley 1972, Deposits Gamma no. 32, fig. 37, and Delta no. 28, fig. 38; and also found at Lerna, Zerner 1988, fig. 29: 13-15. 175 Coldstream and Huxley 1972, 258, L Chance Finds no. 2, pl. 82; for fragments of similar jugs with ribbed shoulders in MM IA see ibid. 92, Deposit Gamma, nos. 8-9, 11. 176 Zerner 1088, fie. «1: 2*. 177 Korres 1080, fig. 27- 178 Betancourt 1985, figs. 39, 65, 77; Coldstream and Huxley 1072, pls. 72-3, nos. 60-68, pl. 82, nos. 1-2. 179 Betancourt 1985, figs. 48, 65, 77; cf. at Kythera, Coldstream and Huxley 1972, Deposit Delta nos. 23 and 27, pl. 22; at Lerna, Zerner 1088, figs. 33-4. 180 See §s (i) (b) above. 181 See §3 (iv) (a) below. 182 See §3 (vii) (a) below; Zerner 1988, fig. 13.</page><page sequence="230">THE MIDDLE HELLADIC POTTERY §3 205 interior of the rim; a coat around the exterior rim, covering the entire flaring rim down to the point where the shoulder begins; the upper body divided into zones by horizontal bands, each zone decorated with patterns; the lower body left undecorated from just below level of handles (over which the lowest horizontal band passed) to the base. Early MH motifs include diagonally hatched triangles, thin diagonal lines in groups of three, four or five, and wide diagonal lines. MH II motifs include thick wavy lines (i960), drips (1262), rosettes (1951), quirks (2115), fat circles (1953) and filled circles (1955). Certain patterns belong to late MH: the hatched or cross-hatched semicircle (e.g. 1388), replacing the earlier hatched triangle; row of dots in a horizontal line (1397) or around the perimeter of circles (1345); row of dashes (1456); and thick or thin wavy lines, drawn as deep loopings or scribbles (1389 and 2289). 183 Earliest LH motifs are foliate bands (2119) and big looping spirals (2288). In Transitional MH/LH or earliest LH, there are foliate bands (2119) and ripples (1728-1729). Some details were added in white paint on the dark decoration: narrow horizontal bands or lines (1388, 1452), a filled circle in the centre of a dark filled circle (1388), loops (1388) and rows of dots (1388). In the 1-o-d and polychrome styles the exterior surface (either the whole surface or the top half, down to just below the handle zone) was coated with paint, and decorative patterns were added in white and red or purple paint (in 1-o-d only white was used, whereas in polychrome both colours were used). The interior of the rim was also coated and at times decorated. The patterns are the same as those in the d-o-1 style. Many jars of this shape bear marks incised by the potters on the handles or on the body- wall just below the handles. Three have been identified at Ayios Stephanos: 1081, a slash on the upper side of the handle; 1015, a horizontal row of six gouges on the wall of the vessel just below the handle; and 2283, a vertical row of four gouges on the wall below the handle. The shape is Kytheran(?), dated to MM IA-III.184 Jar, unidentified shape, 1213 is a closed shape, a jar of some sort with a vertical strap handle. No decoration is preserved on the fragment. Lustrous Decorated, coarse Fabric Same as that for LD medium-coarse, but inclusions in larger sizes and more abundant. Decoration Same as LD medium-coarse. Shape Pithos. One fragment of a rim of a pithos, 1272, and a body fragment from another with a plastic rib, 2128, were found at Ayios Stephanos. 1172, also with a plastic rib, may have come from another or from a coarse jar. The shape dates from MH I through MH III and is Minoan.185 Comment The most interesting question that arises from a study of this group is where LD was produced. Analyses of the shapes and decorative patterns, as well as the clay type186 of LD vessels dating from earliest MH through LH I, have shown that the centre of production was not on Crete but somewhere in the Péloponnèse or on Kythera, where geologically compatible clay deposits can be found. Unfortunately, we cannot be more precise at this point. For archaeological reasons I should like to locate it in the southern Péloponnèse, either in Laconia or on Kythera. LD was one of the most typical wares at Ayios Stephanos throughout MH; it appears alongside other wares that have peculiar, that is to say, regional characteristics, such as DP and DB wares. None of the usual MH products of the Central Area, such as GM and MP, nor Aeginetan wares, were found at the site until the end of period. On the contrary, imports to Ayios Stephanos came from the south, from Crete and Kythera (Minoan imports and Red Silver Micaceous Group VI) by way of the sea-route that linked western Crete to Kythera and the coast 183 Cf. Coldstream and Huxley 1972, pl. 23 = Epsilon 2%- a. 184 Coldstream and Huxley 1972, fig. 37:Gamma 33; fig. 40: Zeta 138; horizontal handles of same shape, pl. 21: Gamma 27- 29; cf. at Aegina, a complete example in polychrome style, Welter 1938, fig. 17; at Lerna, Zerner 1988, figs. 35-40. 185 Betancourt 1985, fig. 77; parallels at Kythera, Coldstream and Huxley 1972, Epsilon 105 (MM IIIB), fig. 38, and Zeta 148 (MM IIIB-LM IA), fig. 40, pl. 28; at Lerna, Zerner 1988, fig. 41 (MH I-III). 186 See Appendix 2 §§2 (iii), 3.</page><page sequence="231">2o6 C. ZERNER of Laconia. LD pots, along with DB and Minoan imports, would also have been transported by sea to sites further to the north, such as Lerna, from the south, the area in which they were probably produced. LD ware is Minoan not only in inspiration but also in technology. Potters working in Minoan potting traditions may have worked in different areas outside Crete, but because the clay type of all LD vessels analysed thus far is essentially the same, it seems reasonable to consider this ware as the production of one general area, i.e. the southern Péloponnèse. It is important always to keep in mind the presence of Minoans on Kythera. There may have been potters working on that island and potters working on the mainland nearby, both in the Minoan tradition. This tradition would have been close to its counterpart on Crete but would have had a character of its own. Thus LD pots are not to be regarded as Minoan imitations but as products of workshops working in Minoan traditions. The makers of LD kept in contact with Cretan ceramic styles and technology throughout the MBA and early LBA. Although this contact was continuous and close, LD potters had their own styles and traditions, which they continued to maintain until well into the LBA. (iv) Southern Péloponnèse (Kythera?): Red Silver Micaceous (white mica) Prominent characteristics include massive amounts of silver-coloured particles, identified as white mica, that thickly cover the surfaces of vessels and make them sparkle, as well as the Minoan appearance of the shapes and decoration. Wheel-throwing was practiced by potters of this group, another characteristic that sets it apart from most other groups described here. GROUP VI: MICACEOUS MINOAN PAINTED AND COARSE (COOKING POT) WARES This is termed Micaceous Minoanizing in Rutter and Rutter.187 Samples 23O2a-23&lt;&gt;3, 2305 (= Set 5 Class 3 in Appendix 2, with plate 62 ¿). Fabric Usually from bright orange (2.5YR 4/8 red), often with grey core, to dark grey (7.5YR 4/0-4/3); rarely pinkish-buff. Very hard and rough-feeling; bright white and dark red inclusions and a massive amount of silver mica, especially visible on surfaces. Surface Reddish brown to dark grey (7.5YR 4/0-4/3 or 2.5YR 4/0), sometimes mottled with both colours. Manufacturing techniques In addition to the important evidence for throwing on the wheel, a few other technological observations can be made. To prepare the surface for the attachment of bands of clay, the surface was scored (2308 preserves the scored surface, the applied band having broken off). There is very little evidence for the method of handle attachment, but it appears that holes were cut in the body-wall and the handles inserted into them in the manner of DR The ends did not protrude into the interior like those of LD ware. Decoration Either plain or decorated in a dark-ground style with a coat of dark grey or black paint and added designs in thick white (7.5YR 7/4 pink) and red (7.5R 3/4). A number of the plain cooking-pots were adorned with edging on the rims - impressed with the finger (1776) or cut with a tool (1174) - or with applied bands of clay that were also impressed or cut (1777). Micaceous Minoan Painted Shapes Cup or kantharos(?). Two fragments, rim 1175 and low foot 1176, come from the same cup with rounded body and short, everted rim. The cup is plain and dates to late MH. Semi-globular cup.

Fragment 1770 may have been 1-o-d and from a shape like that of the LD angular cup (see §3 (iii) above). Bowl or basin. There are a number of examples of a deep bowl or basin, usually with a globular profile and sharply everted rim, wide and flat on top, and decorated in 1-o-d and polychrome (e.g. 1028- 1029, 23°°)- At least one, 2301, had a spout on the shoulder. Unlike the other fragments, 2302 has a plain, markedly out-curved rim. The decoration is plastic: a finger-impressed band around the neck. Bowl(?). Fragment 1771 is an open shape with straight sides, but the shape to which it belonged cannot be identified. Jar with narrow neck and flaring rim. The shape of 1772, 2303 and 3435 is the same as that described for DP and LD wares.188 The one handle preserved from Ayios Stephanos is a flattened oval (1772) and was not pushed through the body-wall. Hole-mouthed jar. 1031 has a rim flattened on top, projecting on the exterior, and a horizontal handle, a flattened oval, tilted upward. Jar. Two large fragments of the lower body and base of jars, 1324 (low, flaring foot) and 1781 (offset base, concave underneath) belong to shapes that cannot be more precisely identified. Micaceous Minoan Coarse (Cooking pot) ware Shapes Jug. 1402 and 1403 belong to jugs with plain surfaces. Kitchenware basin, jar and cooking pot. The profiles of these utilitarian vessels varied, particularly in the formation of the rim - either plain, tapering (1775, 1778, 1779, 2306), thin, T-shaped (2307), or thickened, flat on top (1174, 1776, 1777) - and type of handle - either horizontal, up-tilted (1174, 2306), or vertical, flattened oval (2309). Some of the cooking pots must have had tripod feet like their counterparts from Kythera, but very few were found (R972). Rims often have an edging of finger- impressions or incised slashes: two, 1051 and 1052, may actually date to the EBA.189 From the same deposit, 1053 is a basin with everted rim, edged on the outside with oblique slashes. 1468 is an odd fragment that may have belonged to a similar basin, as the preserved portion is a spout formed by pulling out the rim. MH III and later examples, e.g. 1174, have up-tilted horizontal handles that are flattened ovals in section. 1174 also has a decorative edging along the top of the rim. One early LH example, 3434, has a potter's mark, an X incised on the body wall just above the handle. Some examples of this shape are similar to basins or jars in Coarse Micaceous from Kythera, which appears to be the same fabric as the Red Silver Micaceous described here.190 Jar(?). 1085 is either a base with a hole in it or a rim with a very narrow opening. It is either EBA in date and belongs with the other fragments in early MH baskets (1050-1053), or it is a flowerpot dating to the MBA. Comment The excavators of Kastri on Kythera describe a new red micaceous fabric that appeared in MM IB- IIIA and became more common for cooking vessels than Oatmeal fabric by MM IIIB.191 I think this is the same as Red Silver Micaceous described here, even though the vessels from Kastri are undecorated and mainly cooking-pots, while a number from Ayios Stephanos are decorated and not intended for or used over a cooking fire. Micaceous Minoan vessels appear at Ayios Stephanos most commonly in MH III and later (but may perhaps have appeared in MH I) in shapes that resemble those from Kastri. Many of those mentioned in the Kythera volume (for example, hole-mouthed jar, jars, jugs, basins) seem to be the same as those described here from Ayios Stephanos, but because profiles are not illustrated one 188 See §3 (i) (b) and (iii) above for description and discussion. 189 Cf.

ZERNER cannot be certain. Other shapes found at Kastri, such as baking-trays, lamps and censers, are not attested at Ayios Stephanos, a phenomenon characteristic of mainland sites in the MBA in general, where specialised vessels are noticeably absent. Special vessels intended for activities related to fire (baking, roasting, lighting etc.) are not found, and the few that were used for these activities were multi-purpose. The question of the existence of domestic vessels with specialised functions in the typical MH household is vexing, since one rarely finds them in mainland fabrics. For instance, where are the tripod cooking-pots, baking-dishes, lamps, braziers and other implements that would have been of such practical use in the kitchen? When such shapes do appear at mainland sites - and this occurs rarely - they are imports from Crete or the Cyclades. Obviously the domestic practices of cultures in different parts of the Aegean varied; and despite proximity to and contact with, for example, Minoans, the mainlanders imported their pottery but not their ways of life. The name has been changed from Micaceous Minoanizing192 to Micaceous Minoan because the term 'Minoanizing' implies an imitation of Minoan styles, and it is not yet possible to say that this ware was not actually made by Minoans (in this case, Kytherans). The source of the clay and the area of production of this ware, however, are not yet known: outcroppings of micaceous schist exist on Crete and Kythera and in the southern Péloponnèse. (v) Crete: Various Fabrics group vu: painted and plain wares, fine, medium-coarse and coarse These fall into several fabric groups, which derive from a number of different areas or clay sources on Crete. Thus, since a general description cannot be given, the fabric of each fragment is described in the catalogue entry. It is often difficult to distinguish between a piece of LD, fine ware and an import with fine fabric; therefore problematic pieces are placed in a separate category. MM IA imports (hand-made footed goblet and angular cup) appear at Ayios Stephanos in the earliest MH deposits (those in Area Zeta); such imports continue throughout the period and into the LBA. Relations with Crete were close and contact frequent, either directly or via Minoans living on the island of Kythera. The Minoan and/or local pottery of Kastri is identical to that of Minoan or Minoanising classes from Ayios Stephanos: LD, Micaceous Minoan and Minoan Imports. It is possible that Minoans came to the coast of Laconia as early as they had come to Kythera, i.e. in EM II, but we have no evidence from this period of imports to the mainland. See §4 (i) below for further discussion. Fine fabrics Shapes Footed goblet or egg cup. The MM IA piece 1082 is the earliest Minoan import identified at Ayios Stephanos. In contrast to the same shape in LD, the entire interior surface of this cup is coated with dark paint. (For discussion and parallels, see same shape in §3 (iii) above, LD). Angular cup. The MM IA sherd 1083 was hand-made and decorated in 1-o-d. I have adopted the term 'angular' for this shape in LD ware (see §3 (iii) above) in order to distinguish it from the wheel-thrown carinated cup (see below). The latter term is used by Minoan specialists for both shapes.193 Carinated cup. This wheel-thrown shape dates to MM IB/II, a period that is difficult to isolate in stratified sequence at Ayios Stephanos. Most of the examples are in MH III levels (e.g. 1399).194 Straight-sided or Vapheio cup. A few examples of this wheel-thrown shape date to MM IIB-IIIA (e.g. 1971 and 2290). One cup with deep rim band and ripple decoration (3438) belongs to LM IA.195 Semi-globular cup. The first examples of a rounded cup or bowl with everted rim appear in deposits of MH I (1878-1879). They may be antecedents of the well-known later semi-globular cup of MM III found in MH III to LH I deposits at Ayios Stephanos. Decoration is in 1-o-d (e.g. 1461) and polychrome (e.g. 2136). 192 Rutter and Rutter 1076, 11. 193 Betancourt 1085, figs. 48 and 65. 194 For discussion and parallels see the same shape in §3 (iii) above, LD. 195 For discussion and parallels see the same shape in §3 (iii) above, LD (cf.

Other fragments are from cups that may be characterised as deep cups, e.g. 2143; cf. the MM III 1-o-d cup from Knossos.196 Conical cup. Three plain conical cups, 2130-2132, date to MM III or LM IA. The rim of 2132 has an internal bevel like a MM III cup from Knossos.197 Bowl. MM I(?) fragment 1084 is the rim of a hand-made shape that was found in an early MH I deposit. Medium-coarse to coarse, painted Shapes In-and-out bowl or basin. This scheme of decoration, used on bowls and basins of varying profile, first appeared on Minoan imports to Kastri on Kythera in MM IIIB198 and continued into LM. At Ayios Stephanos such Minoan bowls and basins appear in deposits of the same date, e.g. 1462, 1747, 1752, 2145. Other fragments that may belong to the same type are 2144 and 2146.199 Basin. In MH III this shape was very popular in LD; two 1-o-d rims of Minoan imports in this shape were also identified. 1753 is shallow, with a rim flat on top and thickened on the exterior. 1447 has a T-shaped rim; its shape is very similar to that of in-and-out basins (see above). Jug. One whole Minoan beak-spouted jug, 2296, was published from the earlier excavations.200 Other jugs may be represented among the many body-sherds of closed shapes that are catalogued as jugs/jars. Jar. A number of rims may be assigned to imported Minoan jars, here also called necked jars (e.g. 1756-1758, 2147-2148); many other fragments, both body-sherds and bases, may also belong to such jars but are not diagnostic and are categorised as jugs/jars. Jug/jar. Body and base fragments of Minoan jugs or jars were found in deposits from MH I, e.g. 1306- 1307 and 1885, through MH III, e.g. 1763-1764 (ripple decoration). Medium-coarse to coarse, unpainted Shape Basin. This shape has walls that either splay out, e.g. 1765, or turn in, e.g. 1767. Rims are thickened either on one side, e.g. 1467, or on both sides, e.g. 1765. On a few, finger-impressed bands were applied to the exterior surface just below the rim as decoration, e.g. 1766-1767. These fragments, of MM III to LM IA date, come from late MH and early LH deposits at Ayios Stephanos (with the exception of 1016, which may be MH I).201 (vi) Southern Péloponnèse (Kythera) or Crete(?): Schist, Phyllite, Mica Series Some fragments catalogued as possibly Minoan or Micaceous Minoan have a fabric and other characteristics that make it difficult to assign them to either class.

It has been determined that the clay is volcanic, and its source has been located by chemical and petrological analyses on the island of Aegina.202 Imports from Aegina were very common at sites in the Centred Area from early MH, continuing throughout the period and well into LH. There are no definite fragments from Ayios Stephanos of Aeginetan imports dating to the MH period (1404 may be EH I). As the remaining imports from Aegina belong to LH I and LH IIA, that must be considered to be the time when contact between the two areas began.203 Manufacturing techniques As with LD wares, a number of technical details characterise Aeginetan ceramic products. However, because of the paucity and fragmentary nature of imports from the island found at Ayios Stephanos, many of these characteristics cannot be illustrated here.204 All of the vessels appear to have been hand-built, probably with the help of turning wheel or tournette, throughout the MBA and into the LBA. In the MBA, handles were pushed through the body wall in the manner described for LD medium-coarse wares; by the end of the period this practice was discontinued. One special feature of the Aeginetan industry that was also practised by the LD potters was the regular marking of pots before they were fired.205 (a) group vin: green/yellow, fine and medium-coarse Red Slipped and Burnished Fabric Light-coloured but sometimes quite orange or reddish, from white (5 Y 8/1) to reddish-yellow (5YR 6/6) to very pale brown (10YR 7/3); sandy, sometimes powdery feeling; porous-looking; fine to medium-coarse with many inclusions (white, black and red), most notably shiny, gold-coloured platelets (biotite) visible on surface, although usually very sparsely scattered. Surface Often described as green (2.5Y 7/2 light grey) to light brown (7.5YR 6/4). Decoration Covered with a coloured slip inside and out, either red (on the average, light reddish-brown 5YR 6/ 3) or dark-coloured (dark grey, brown or black); burnished well or cursorily; sometimes plates or flakes of biotite are visible. Shapes Goblet 1782 is the rim of a LH I goblet with rounded profile. 1404, if it is in fact Aeginetan, may belong to a goblet with angular profile.206 Basin or krater. One example of this shape was found in a LH I deposit (1469 with everted rim, flattened along its outside edge). It is usually decorated in d-o-1 or bichrome Matt Painted styles.207 Matt Painted/Plain Sample 2328 (= Set 6 Class 2 in Appendix 2, with plate 62 /).

Surface Same colours as the fabric, with patches or large areas of grey to black where burned in cooking fires. Although the fabric is coarse, the surfaces were well-finished and smoothed. Shape Wide-mouthed jar with everted rim. This is the most usual shape for cooking-pots on the Greek mainland, beginning in EH III and continuing throughout MH and well into LH; it appears in many different fabrics and in different sizes, from small to large. The Aeginetan variation represented at Ayios Stephanos is of LH I date, as is shown by its rim, which is concave on the interior (1794, 2330). Straight or plain, tapering rims are also found on late MH and early LH jars, e.g. 1793. Base 2331 from Asteri bears a potter's mark (three small incisions in a T-pattern), a common feature of Aeginetan wares, including Red coarse kitchenware, throughout MH. In the early part of the period, marks were placed on the upper body of the vessel; in the Shaft Grave period and early LH, the area near the base was usually marked, either the body-wall just above the base, on the edge or on the underside of the base itself. The latejar shape may have vertical handles, round or oval in section (2329).209 (viii) Other Mainland: Various Fabrics GROUP X: GREY MINYAN AND MATT PAINTED WARES Ceramic styles typical of the MBA in the Central Area - GM and MP - were not found at Ayios Stephanos until late in the period, when MP, at least, was made locally. GM, however, appears never to have been produced in Laconia. A few sherds from pots perhaps imported from the Central Area, both MP and GM, were found on the site; one, 1064, was fr°m the very earliest years of the MBA. 4. CONCLUSIONS The general conclusions presented here are based on an analysis of ceramic data and on the assumption that the existence of distinct ceramic traditions has cultural significance. How far this kind of evidence, i.e. pottery styles (surface decoration and form) and technology, can actually be pressed in an evaluation of prehistoric societies depends a great deal on the quality and quantity of the available data. At this point in our researches into the MBA on the mainland, any evaluation is limited by a lack of published bodies of ceramic material that investigate all the parameters of production and design, from fabric to manufacturing technology to styles of decoration. These must be considered together with all the other evidence from a site and compared to other, similarly researched sites. This cannot be done 208 Cf.

Thus, the following observations are recommendations for the course of future study in the culture of mainland Greece in the MBA. (i) Early Helladic III and Middle Helladic, Early to Middle Although certain features of Lerna and Ayios Stephanos can be compared (i.e. the existence of a complete sequence of LD along with Minoan imports), the ceramics from the two sites are very different. In fact, MBA pottery from Ayios Stephanos differs in significant ways from most other published MH sites on the mainland. The most striking difference is the almost total absence at the Laconian site, during most of the period, of the Aeginetan and Cycladic imports so common at MH sites in the Central Area. Cycladic imports have not been recognised among the excavated material, and Aeginetan pottery does not appear until the very end of the MBA or the beginning of the LBA. True GM ware is extremely rare, and the technique of decorating vessels with Matt Paint, one of the hallmarks of the MH period from its very beginning at other sites, was not regularly employed until MH III/LH I. Most of the groups presented here are considered to be either of local manufacture, i.e. in the area of Laconia itself (Groups I-IV), or imported from nearby, i.e. from the island of Kythera (possibly Group V, LD ware, and the other Minoan or Minoan-like Groups with red micaceous fabrics). Unlike the ceramic finds from the site of Lerna, a large number of which were from other areas of Greece and the islands, there are few imports from further away than Kythera. These few imports were from Crete and may themselves have come via Kythera; imports from other areas did not begin to appear at the site until later in the MBA, and even then were not numerous. In other words, although Ayios Stephanos was a mainland site with typical Helladic features, there was a distinctly non-Helladic, or Minoan, component to the ceramic industries. Many differences in the ceramics of the different areas, both on the mainland and in the islands, may have been the result of historical events that took place at the end of EB II. The EH II settlement of Ayios Stephanos corresponds to other contemporary settlements on the mainland; however, the artefactual assemblage of the following period, well known at Lerna, where the most complete EH III sequence (Lerna IV)210 has been found, is missing at Ayios Stephanos and has not yet been found elsewhere in Laconia.211 This phase, although perhaps only its latest subphase,212 is represented in other areas of the Péloponnèse, for example in the west, at Nichoria in Messenia, whence examples of typical EH HI wares have recently been published.213 In the areas of excavation at Ayios Stephanos where EH II levels were reached, these appear to have been followed immediately by levels dating to early MH. Admittedly, these areas were very few and small in extent, but no sherds resembling those of Lerna IV were found anywhere on or near the site (with the exception of a few vessels that, although not canonical, may belong to Lerna IV types, i.e. a painted bowl, ««05, early DB profiles 1036-1040 and 2214, and a Coarse incised strainer, 2315). These, along with the GM bowl rim 1064, could also be categorised as Transitional EH III/MH I. Was Ayios Stephanos abandoned at the end of EH II and not re-inhabited until the beginning of MH? Or did the end of EH II at Ayios Stephanos not correspond chronologically to the end of this period in the Argolid, so that EH II styles continued to be produced at the same time as EH HI styles were being produced at Lerna? Or were the ceramic remains in Laconia, from the period that would correspond to EH III in the north-east Péloponnèse and elsewhere in the Central Area, so similar to early MH wares that they have not yet been recognised? Many questions concerning the end of EB II and EB III on the mainland, Crete and the Cyclades have not been satisfactorily answered.214 The sequence at Ayios Stephanos does not provide the answers, but it does add a few more pieces to the puzzle. The ceramics from the earliest deposits of the MBA from the site have many characteristics in common with those of the Minoan settlement of Kastri on Kythera, e.g. LD, Micaceous Minoan, and Minoan imports; they also have features not present at Kastri, but which are more reminiscent of Minoan than Helladic ceramics, e.g. DP. Even DB ware, while exhibiting typical mainland characteristics, displays features that find their closest parallels in Cycladic and Minoan pottery of the EBA. These characteristics are not merely stylistic, i.e. details of form and/or decoration that could be the result of borrowings, but are fundamental to the potter's craft; they are not features that could have been easily borrowed, but would have more reasonably resulted from the travelling of potters themselves, who may have worked in different areas and may have trained potters from these same areas in their own traditions. 210 See Rutter iqqr. 211 Cavanaeh and Crouwel iqq6, 16. 212 Rutter 1995, 773. 213 Howell 1QQ2 bf fig. 3.2: P 2047-8. 214 Manning 1995, 51-72.</page><page sequence="238">THE MIDDLE HELLADIC POTTERY §4 213 In fact, it would appear that the southern Péloponnèse, at least from the end of EH II, had some characteristics of a separate cultural sphere, one that may be defined as that of an intermediary zone, one between different cultures, sharing features with, on the one hand, island cultures (Minoan and Cycladic) and, on the other, typical Helladic culture represented at sites to the north of Laconia. At least in its ceramic assemblage, the site had more in common with that of the island of Kythera, where the typical EH II settlement at the site of Kastraki was abandoned and that at Kastri settled in EM II- III, from which time Minoan culture prevailed on the island. Problems arise when attempts are made to link up the three sites of Kastraki, Kastri and Ayios Stephanos. Kastraki was inhabited until some time in EH II and then abandoned. Kastri was settled somewhat later, perhaps in EM II as the excavators state. However, excavation has revealed scanty remains from the early periods of occupation of the site: a few pots and sherds from EM II and EM III, rather more from MM IA, IB and II. Ayios Stephanos was occupied in EH II. There is no evidence for an intervening phase corresponding to EM II or III or EH III: the phase following EH II is dated to what we now call Transitional EH/MH or early MH. These problems relate to those evident on Crete and in the Cyclades in the same period.215 The data from Kythera and Ayios Stephanos may add something to this discussion. It should be noted that, although the evidence is problematic, the settlement at Pavlopetri, with its Cycladic and Kytheran connections,216 shares many of the features of a site in an intermediary zone and must be taken into account in a reconstruction of this important phase. If, as I assume, what is called LD on the mainland (found at many sites, in Laconia, Arcadia, the Argolid, Attica, Euboea, Boeotia and the Cyclades)217 is the same ware as the pottery that was considered by Coldstream and Huxley to be local Kytheran and was produced in that same place, i.e. Kythera, then some of the problems may be resolved. If the EM II and EM III vessels were brought to Kastri as imports from Crete and the new inhabitants began potting themselves and producing LD, then a long gap in occupation at Ayios Stephanos becomes less of a possibility. The DP tradition raises more questions: the existence of another workshop following MM trends (LD) at the same time as one that followed earlier Minoan trends (DP) may simply reflect the fact that it was more open to contemporary influences from Crete, while the DP tradition was not affected by that kind of influence. For example, one might imagine a LD workshop on Kythera, where Minoans were living, and a DP workshop on the mainland. A number of ceramic features shared by the workshops of Aegina and southern Laconia were not characteristic of groups and wares in the Helladic tradition, and can be traced back to styles and traditions of an earlier period, both EM II and EC II: e.g. the systematic marking of vessels by the potters, manufacturing techniques such as push-through handles, certain forms such as the narrow- necked jar with flaring rim (thus far recognised only in Aeginetan MP, DP and LD), the flask and the pyxis, and other forms and decorative patterns of DB ware. All these characteristics point to a situation of change and movement in the southern Péloponnèse and the islands, but not to a total replacement of the culture by a different one. This observation brings us to another and larger question: who were the people who built the houses at Ayios Stephanos in the early years of the MBA, and who were the potters? Many questions must be answered before we can even begin to understand the most fundamental aspects of this mainland culture. The period is a tangled web of correlations and contradictions, and in order to untangle it we must study not only the pottery but all the other evidence from the point of view of materials and technology. Some of these problems will certainly be resolved with the use of scientific analyses. Jones and Whitbread have shown that LD sherds from at least three sites, Lerna, Ayios Stephanos and Kastri, are very similar and could have been produced in the same area.218 But questions remain. Can we pinpoint the exact place(s) of manufacture of LD? Are the EM II and III vessels found at Kastri imports brought to the site by Minoan immigrants, who somewhat later set up their own workshops and produced LD wares? A study of the pottery from Ayios Stephanos is a study of the particular relationship between the peoples of the mainland and those of Crete and, at the earliest stage, the Cycladic islands. From the early period, the end of EB II, a movement of peoples or shifting of populations among the peoples of the mainland, the Cyclades and Crete may be postulated. These movements caused great changes, and the resulting cultural transformations have caused us great difficulties as we try to link up the various sequences at different sites in different regions. A similar phenomenon may also be observed in the ceramics of the MBA at the site of Kolonna, on the island of Aegina, where many styles and 215 For a detailed discussion see Marinino- iook. 216 Harding, Cadogan and Howell 1969. 217 See Zerner logs, 4^-7. 218 See Appendix 2 §§2 (iii), 3.</page><page sequence="239">214 C. ZERNER manufacturing processes are non-Helladic and close to Cycladic and Minoan, while other practices, e.g. architectural and burial, are in the Helladic tradition. Both areas, Aegina in the Saronic Gulf and Ayios Stephanos on the southern border of mainland Greece, are in intermediary zones on the border between different cultures. (ii) Late Middle Helladic and Early Late Helladic In the early and middle phases of the MBA, pottery from Ayios Stephanos displays many features that set it apart from that of sites in the Central Area. By the end of the period, however, the range of wares and forms, both locally produced and imported, is similar to that of the rest of the mainland. By then, MP and YM have become usual in the households, and even Aeginetan pots were being used. This change in the ceramic assemblage is consistent with a change in trading patterns in the Aegean and may reflect the altered state of society on the mainland. Variety and diversity in ceramics characterise the MH period all over the mainland and may have resulted from the existence of different social groups in separate geographical areas, in contact with one another but not controlled in any way by any one group. By the end of MH, there may have been a more cohesive social structure that encompassed all the geographic/social groups. Or it could be that the cohesion evident in ceramics may simply indicate the state of the potter's craft: in early and middle MH the potters were isolated from one another, but, by late MH and early LH they were in closer contact and working in a common tradition. Whatever the reason, the state of ceramic production and distribution indicates that there was a definite change at the end of the MBA, at a time when other changes were taking place in MH society, particularly evidenced by the wealth of the Shaft Graves in the Argolid. 5.

ZERNER dating to EH II Late, are we to assume that the site was abandoned during the EH III phase, or that pottery typical of EH III elsewhere was not made in the southern Péloponnèse (i.e. south of the border of Arcadia) and that EH II types continued to be made at sites such as Ayios Stephanos until the new culture had penetrated further south? The earliest MH pottery appears in basket 108 from sector beta (W), a hard layer of dark reddish earth, carbon and rubble associated with walls it and io. This contains EH and early MH, probably examples of the earliest MH on the site, to be dated to MH I by the lack of Dark Burnished bowls/ basins with ridged shoulder and by the presence of a Coarse Burnished jar with a pointed knob on the shoulder (1049).221 Dark Burnished (fig. 5.4) Forty sherds not illustrated, black and some reddish-brown (7.5YR 6/4-6/6); flat strap handles.

(b) MH I EARLY (1054-1088) In sector beta, against the SE face of wall io and over wall iu and the destroyed SE portion of wall is, there were three levels of destruction fill (yellowish-brown clay and earth with carbon and ash) directly overlying basket 108; the lowest stratum ends with the third course of large stones in wall io, whereas the top stratum ends with the top of wall io and slopes up to the N. The pottery in this fill is not very different from that of basket 108, and I assume that they both represent the building and destruction of a house (with walls in, io and iq) in the earliest phase of the MH period. The sherds are still MM IA and MH I Early, but include material from a phase later than basket 108: a ridged Dark Burnished body sherd with incised garlands (not illustrated); no carinated Lustrous Decorated and only one polychrome Lustrous Decorated or Minoan; and a MM IA broad goblet rim. The Grey Minyan bowl 1064, probably an import from the north-east Péloponnèse, can be dated to late EH III or MH I Earliest by its wide, nearly vertical rim. Baskets are 100, 101 (upper); 101-103 (middle); 104, 106- 107 (lower). No basket number is given for the sherds that were not labelled before they were mixed together to form a study collection.222 Dark Burnished (fig. 5.4) 1054. Carinated cup.

(c) MH I LATE (1089-II53) Baskets 37, 38, 40, 44, 45, 60 and 67 (all mixed with later MH and LH), and baskets 58, 79, 84, 88, 89, 90, 91, 93, 96, 97, 98 and 105 (all unmixed), contain a MH I Late pottery deposit in a thick destruction fill of that date. [This is the third phase of MH I in Area Zeta. It includes the inventoried vases 1122, 1123, 1136 and 1140 (from baskets 37, 38, 40, 45, 58 and 60, over walls ig and ih).223] Because the original level of this deposit was not recognised in the first baskets to be excavated, for example basket 38, there was contamination from later levels, e.g. body fragments of Dark Burnished shoulder-handled bowls with incised garlands. Most of the inventoried pots were burned in the fire that destroyed the two buildings of this phase (walls ig, ih and il, ir, ip respectively), and for the most part the sherds belong to the same chronological phase. The date for these falls in MH I but slightly later than the baskets described above. From the same phase derive baskets 43, 76 (mixed) and 77 (unmixed): these form a yellowish- brown stratum in the NW sector that ended with basket 77. Baskets 84, 85, 87 and 88 (unmixed) from sector alpha/gamma/epsilon are probably of the same date. Dark Burnished (figs. 5.6-5.7) 1089. Angular cup with everted rim. Interior burnished only at lip.

From sector zeta (= 'Room 4') came baskets 75, 81, 87, 94 and 99; no MH sherds were kept in either of the latter baskets, but 99 from sector zeta (E) was mixed with LH IIIC Early. From sector zeta there also came baskets 71, 72, 74, 83, 85 and 86 (no sherds were kept from 86). Sector alpha/ beta/zeta (W) produced baskets 34 (contaminated by a Medieval pit) and 44 (no sherds kept). From sector delta came basket 60 (not kept). Other sherds from mixed deposits are also included here: baskets 34, 49, 55, 57, 61, 64 and 69. A large building was constructed above the remains of another dating to MH I Late (third phase). This building comprised walls if, ii and ib, as well as ia. Unfortunately the pottery cannot tell us a great deal. Only basket 78, to the bottom of wall if and over basket 79, just above the ash of the great destruction debris, was not contaminated by later material; it is important in that it contains a wheel- made carinated cup (1168) and a DB rounded cup of MM II type (1154) that date the basket to MH II. This basket came from sector beta.

(iii) Area Eta 1973 (a) MH I EARLY (1191-1236) EH remains were found above bedrock,225 with early MH above them; wall do is the only EH wall preserved in this area. The succeeding structure to which wall dj belonged dated to MH I Early.226 Material of this period came from baskets 23, 25, 38, 42, 54, 58, 63 and 70. These are as follows. MH above EH levels, nw of wall dj: basket 23 (above the EH II Late basket 30 and basket 70), 42 (above the EH II Late basket 53), 63 (above the EH II Early baskets 65 and 66). MH above EH levels, se of wall dj: basket 25 (above the EH II Late basket 27). Basket 38, se of wall dj and sw of wall dg, is below basket 16 (a basket containing MH I Late mixed with LH) and appears to be primarily early MH; it lies above baskets 54 and 70, also early MH mixed with EH (see 1277 below, from basket 54). Basket 58, below basket 55 (MH II- III), n of walls di, dm, and dp (but not in the ne corner) in Trench III, is mainly MH I but includes some EH I- II. 225 For the EH remains see Chapter i §§3 (vi)-(viii) above, and for the pottery see Chapter 4 and Appendix 1 . 226 See Chapter 1 §3 (v) above.</page><page sequence="255">23O C.

(b) MH I LATE, AND EARLY MH IN MIXED DEPOSITS (1237-1287) Another structure, Structure Eta I, was built upon the ruins of wall dj - walls dg and dh belonged to it - but the baskets associated with it from within the walls, 18 and 41 and, above them, 14 and 40, have since been lost (basket 62, the removal of walls dg and dh, was undiagnostic). The only vase that may date the walls is an early MH Dull Painted narrow-necked jar (1255) from baskets 10, 14 and 20. The excavator suggested that the jar belonged to Eta burial 7, but this is not necessarily so. [Burial 7 may in fact be LH.227] The Area was riddled with burials, and this certainly accounts for a mixing of the levels and baskets. Other mixed baskets include basket 20, above good earliest MH (with LH contamination). Basket 25 came from S of wall dj. Basket 46 in Trench III was contaminated. Basket 47, and above it basket 16, both contained LH I material. Dark Burnished (figs. 5. 1 4-5. 1 5) 1237. Carinated cup. Incised. Dark grey.

(c) MH III LATE TO LH I (2OOI-22O4) Following further study of the pottery, four ceramic phases from latest MH through earliest LH have been distinguished: MH III Late, Transitional MH III/LH I, LH I Early and LH I/IIA. The sequence in Area Nu appears to be the following, taken in reverse chronological order: 1. The shaft grave, Nu burial 13, was cut into the remains of Structure Nu II in the phase following LH I Early, here termed LH I/IIA and represented by Rutter Deposit N;252 wall na may belong to the same phase.253 2. Structure Nu II, published in Rutter and Rutter 1976, was built in what is termed here Transitional MH III/LH I to LH I Early: material of LH I Early associated with the building itself is found in Rutter Deposits H, L and perhaps F.254 3. Below Structure Nu II were levels of Transitional MH III/LH I date: Rutter Deposit G255 and the 1977 baskets 13 (2009-2011, 2014, 2018, 2020, 2030, 2051, 2053-2056, 2058, 2067, 2072, 2144» 2153, 2155, 2160, 2168-2169, 2176, 2178-2180, 2187-2191, 2198, 2200-2201, 2203, 3598-36o4&gt; 36o6-36o7&gt; 36o9&gt; 36ι1"36ι*&gt; 36l4"36l6&gt; 3620-3623, 3626, 3631, 3634), 14 (2017, 2037, 2065, 2069, 2117, 2123, 2152, 2162, 2170, 2174), 22 (2039, 2096, 2114, 2151, «157? 2171, 36l7"36l9&gt; 36*4&gt; 3635)&gt; 3* («046, 2049, 2083, 2105) and 33 (2062, 2095, 2110, 2130, 2138).256 The Lustrous Decorated, LM IA and Mycenaean (i.e. Lustrous Painted) pieces from these baskets are published as 3598-3637 below. 252 Rutter and Rutter iq&gt;?6. 22. 253 See Chapter 1 §§8 (iii)-(iv) above. 254 Rutter and Rutter 1976, 19-21; see Chapter 1 §8 (v) above. 255 Rutter and Rutter 1 n^fi ?n 256 See Chapter 1 §8 (vj above.</page><page sequence="301">276 C. ZERNER 4. Below this there is evidence, although scanty, of the MH III Late phase: 1977 basket 30 (2001, 2003, 2006, 2012, 2019, 2026-2028, 2032, 2034, 2047, 2050, 2052, 2057, 2059, 2063, 2068, 2091, 2094, 2097-2099, 2119-2120, 2128, 2134-2136, 2140-2143, 2158, 2177, 2185, 2192, 2193).257 Baskets from the removal of the walls of Structure Nu II and other contexts dug in 1977 which may have been contemporary with Structure Nu II but which included earlier material are also catalogued here. The following phases are represented: MH III Early: 1977 baskets 26 under walls nc, nk and nm (e) (2007, 2133, 2163, 2166, 2175, 2186, 2197, 2199, 3627) and 37 from wall nu (2108). MH III Late through LH I Early: 1977 baskets 15 (2002, 2004, 2154, 2172), 16 (2139), 18 (2005, 2036, 2038, 2048, 2071, 2149, 2159, 2161, 2182-2183, 3608, 3610, 3613, 3625, 3628-3630, 3632-3633, 3636), 23 (2015, 2022, 2040, 2074, 2084, 2087, 2202) and 25 (2113, 2167, 3637). LH I/IIA: basket 1 (2085, 2101, 2132). Unfortunately, eleven baskets from the first three phases were contaminated by the cutting for the shaft grave, Nu burial 13, the existence of which was not recognised until late in the excavation, and the date of which is itself controversial - MH III according to the excavator (J. B. Rutter), but LH 1/ IIA according to the chronology advanced here.258 This grave contained hardly any LH I pottery, but much from earlier phases. The grave itself was dug with baskets 29, 39, 48, 51 and 55. Basket 29 contained primarily MH HI Early or Late (2013, 2021, 2103, 2106, 2126, 2147, 2150, 2164, 2204), but two gritty MP fragments may date to LH I/IIA as defined here (2064, 2066). Basket 39 had MH III (2060, 2109, 2115) and Transitional MH III/LH I or LH I Early (2008, 2156). Basket 48 had MH III Late through Transitional MH III/LH I (2035, 2073, 2075-2076, 2137, 2145-2146). One fragment from basket 51 (2102) cannot be dated more closely than MH II- III. Other baskets that may contain sherds from the cutting of the shaft grave are: 1977 baskets 3 (LH I 2118), 5 (MH III through Transitional MH III/LH I 2077-2078, 2088, 2100, 2127, 2129), 9 (MH III 2093 with LH I Early 2082, 2131), 1 1 (two Transitional MH III/LH I fragments 2079-2080), 14 (MH III Late), 19 (MH I Late to III Early 2023-2024, 2031 with a LH I Early YM sherd mixed in), 24 (MH III Late through LH I Early 2029, 2033, 2042-2044, 2070, 2090, 2092, 2104, 2121-2122, 2148, 2173, 2181, 2184, 2196), 40 (MH III Early 2025, 2041, 2089, 2111-2112, 2116, 2124, 2165, 2194-2195 mixed with LH I/IIA or LH IIA bichrome cup 2045), 47 (MH III Early 2016, MH III Late 2125, mixed with LH I/IIA 2081, 2086) and 55 (LH I/IIA uncatalogued).

(vii) Material from the 1959-63 Excavations and Area Nu 1973-74 Sherds 2323-2325 are from the Antiquities Collection of the British School at Athens and were added to the pétrographie and chemical analyses published in Appendix 2 in order to fill out the sample of LD wares. They are typical of LD ware, medium-coarse variety. [All the pieces marked 'AS sample' are analysed in Appendix 2. Sherds not from Ayios Stephanos, including 2331 from the excavations at Asteri in 1959, are marked with a dagger. Contextual information is added from the excavation records, reinterpreted in the light of the increase in our knowledge.] (a) EARLY HELLADIC IIl(?) (2205) Pattern Painted (fig. 5.51) 2205. Bowl.

THE SHERDS WITH POTTERS' MARKS (i) Introduction The term 'potter's mark' is used here to designate a non-decorative mark that was incised, impressed, applied or painted on a vessel before it was fired. This term implies that the maker, or someone closely associated with the production of the vessel, was the one who made the mark; it is distinguished from the term 'user's mark', which designates a mark that was placed on the vessel after it was fired, whether the vessel remained whole or was made use of in pieces (e.g. Athenian ostraka of the Classical period). The identification of a non-decorative mark as distinct from a decorative one is often impossible to make: not only can the intent of the ancient potter never be known, but some marks may have served both purposes. Most of the marks included here, however, may confidently be termed potters' marks, as they belong to two potting traditions characteristic of the MBA that regularly employed potters' marks: Aeginetan and Lustrous Decorated. The term 'marking system' is used here to designate a collection of types of mark similar in design and placement on vessels that appear to have been produced in similar potting traditions. This term has been chosen for the sake of convenience and should not be confused with the term 'writing system'. Although the purpose of the marks is not known, most of them cannot be directly linked to the writing systems, hieroglyphic and linear, used in the Aegean world in the MBA (although some of the potters' marks are the same as or similar to script signs). Potters' marks of the kind discussed here, especially incised lines, are very simple and easy to make, and the same combinations of strokes may be found in different marking systems. Both of the main potting traditions of the MBA, the Minoan and the Cycladic, used marks in a way that may be classified as systematic. Their offshoots, the LD and Aeginetan, employed the same kind of marking systems: i.e., LD using a Minoan system, the Aeginetan using a Cycladic system. Potters operating in the other traditions on the mainland do not appear regularly to have used such marks. For example, a number of marks have been identified on Grey Minyan and Dark Burnished pots, but there are so few that we cannot at this time classify them as belonging to marking systems. Of the twelve vessels catalogued in this volume that have such potters' marks, six are in LD ware, one is gritty DP, one is DB, three are Aeginetan, and one is Micaceous Minoan. Other marks that are not considered potters' marks are the scratchings on the underside of the base of DB goblet 2221 (see §(iv) below, DB ware) and the painted cross on the underside of 1649, a goblet in MP, gritty. The practice of painting crosses and other patterns on the underside of the base of drinking vessels was usual in the MBA, especially on MP and LD wares. Because these patterns are bold and highly visible, I consider them to have been intended as part of the decorative scheme, meant to be seen when the cups were raised for drinking or were placed upside down on a table or low shelf. They do not appear to have any other meaning or purpose. [3703 is also incised.] (ii) The Aeginetan Marking System The marks that have been found on pots produced on the island of Aegina appear to belong to the Cycladic system of marking, consisting primarily of small impressions (circles, dots, wedges), short incised lines or strokes and small bits of applied clay. Marks of this type had been recognised early on</page><page sequence="322">THE MIDDLE HELLADIC POTTERY §6 297 among the MBA ceramic wares from Phylakopl.259 Since then the number of marks recognised and specialised studies of them have increased.260 The meaning and function of these marks have been extensively explored by M. Lindblom261 in his study of a large corpus of Aeginetan pots from the island itself and other sites on the mainland and islands. The marks were employed from early in the MH period all the way through the later LH period, at least through LH IIIB. Unable to correlate the marks with the fonction of a vessel, its destination, measurement or capacity, he concluded that they are probably trade marks or makers' marks. On the basis of ethnographic parallels, such marks are related to the organisation of pottery manufacture, corresponding most closely to marks used by producers, i.e. potters, working closely together, sharing both ceramic traditions and work spaces (e.g. firing in the same kilns), who distinguish their own products from those of other groups by placing their special marks on their own pots. Aeginetan imports to Ayios Stephanos appear to have been few and to have arrived only sporadically, primarily in the early years of the LBA. The three marked pieces, two of Matt Painted or Plain, one of coarse cooking pot fabric, date to LH I at the earliest. The marks themselves are simple, made up of two or more short linear elements, two of them made up of impressed lines. These lines are either circular or oblong in shape and are later versions of the impressed cupule characteristic of the early and middle phases of MH. 1791. Matt Painted/ Plain, medium coarse, jar. Mark on lower body at edge of base, incomplete: three gouges preserved, one at edge of base, two in horizontal row above (cf. Lindblom 2001, 62-3, mark type A60). 74-844. plate 38, fig. 5.35. 1792. Matt Painted/ Plain, medium coarse, jar. Mark on underside of flat base at edge: two gouges in horizontal row near edge of base (cf. Lindblom 2001, 78, mark type G26). 74-845. PLATE 38, FIG. 5.35. 2331. Coarse cooking pot. Mark on underside of base: three small impressed oblong lines forming a shape like the letter T. Cf. Lindblom 2001, 79, mark type G29, although the example that he illustrates from Lerna appears to have been made up of two separate impressions: the two that form the horizontal element of the Τ join and appear to be one continuous line, plate 37, fig. 5.57. (iii) The Lustrous Decorated Marking System Unlike the work on the Cycladic and Aeginetan marking system, the LD marking system has not yet been studied in depth, owing to the lack of a large corpus from a number of sites. The examples from Ayios Stephanos, however, compare well with those from Lerna, where 82 marks have been recognised, and from Kastri on Kythera.262 To judge from the evidence now available, the corpus of marks from LD workshops is and will be smaller than that of the Aeginetan, for the following reasons. The practice of marking among LD potters appears to have been relatively short-lived, lasting from early MH through MH II, unlike the long-term use of marks by the Aeginetan potters. The range of wares produced by the LD potters was more restricted than the Aeginetan, confined to vessels for eating and/or drinking and storage. And the distribution area for the LD potters appears to have been more limited, confined mainly to the Péloponnèse. The LD marking system differs from the Aeginetan in other ways: the marks are similar to the Aeginetan but are more simple, made only by incising with a pointed tool, and restricted to lines and dots or circles.263 Recognisable patterns include crosses, Vs or chevrons. Six marks on LD ware were found among the sherd material from Ayios Stephanos. 1015, 1081 and 2283 belonged to jars; 1077 and 2276 to jugs, and 2268 to a cup (the only example of a mark on fine fabric from the site). 1015. Polychrome LD, medium coarse, jar with narrow neck and flaring rim. Mark incised on horizontal handle: horizontal row of six circular gouges, last one on right higher than the rest on body wall just below ledge handle, plate 38, FIG. 5.1. 1077.

ZERNER Although conclusions about the LD marking system are premature at this stage, some observations may be made. Probably located on Kythera and/or the mainland, the LD industry was Minoan in inspiration and may be a result of the movement of Minoans, either men with their families who colonised new areas such as Kythera, or women who moved for the purpose of marriage to new homes, possibly at Ayios Stephanos. If the use of marks in communal firings, for example, was customary among potters on Crete, it would have been practiced by their daughters or sons who had moved away. As the generations passed and the industry changed, the practice may have become unnecessary among these potters, who would have discontinued it. (iv) Other Marks (a) DARK BURNISHED WARE The criss-crossing, haphazard scratches on 2221 do not form a discernible pattern of any kind (although they may have meant something to the ancient potter); see similar scratchings on the underside of a lamp from Petras, Siteia.264 The V-shaped mark incised on the underside of bowl 1162 appears to be a potter's mark, as it is unlikely to have been intended as decoration. Marks on DB ware are very rare, and the practice, therefore, cannot be considered usual among its potters. 1162. Bowl/jar. Mark incised on underside of base: two opposed oblique lines, forming wide chevron or V. 73-030. PLATE 38, FIG. 5.11. [1365a. Shape not recorded. Mark not described. Sherd lost. 77-055.

The type of mark and its position on the vessel are very similar to marks on LD ware and suggest that it may qualify as a potter's mark. Also like LD, DP ware has Minoan features in vessel shapes and decorative patterns.265 This incised mark is another similarity, for a similar mark, a zigzag, appears on a jug from the West Court at Knossos.266 2237. Jug. Mark incised on top of upper side of handle: two oblique lines opposed to three oblique lines, forming an uneven pattern resembling two superimposed chevrons. Fig. 5.52. (c) MICACEOUS MINOAN Vessels in Micaceous Minoan painted and coarse wares were not commonly used in the households of Ayios Stephanos. Like that of LD ware, the area of production has proved to be elusive. 3434· Cooking pot (jar with wide mouth). Mark incised on body wall just above handle: small, neatly drawn X. A close parallel may be found on a MM IIIB tripod cooking pot from Knossos which bears an incised cross near the handle (Catling et al 1979, no. 165, fig. 26). fig. 6.26. (v) Conclusions These marked vessels are consistent with others from similar assemblages elsewhere on the mainland of Greece. The preponderance of LD is to be expected, as Laconia was certainly very close to, if it was not the actual production centre of this ware. The few Aeginetan sherds from the site in comparison to the large numbers of imports recognised at Lerna and other sites, beginning already in the early years of the MBA, indicate that contact between these areas was maintained, but that Laconia throughout most of the MBA was not in the same cultural sphere as the north-eastern Péloponnèse. 264 Tsipopoulou lqqo, fig. 1.1. 265 See §3 (i) (b) above. 266 Wilson 1985, 322, Ρ 2ΟΟ, fig. 27, pl. 36.</page><page sequence="324">Chapter 6 The Late Helladic pottery P.

The monochrome underside of the base of the goblet 3014 suggests that it should belong here. The basin 3016 is also coated underneath and has a flat base, as opposed to the ring base of the LH IIIA2 basins; the rim 3015 with its fat, heavy everted lip should also belong to this phase, as, too, the flat concave bowl base 3017.

Rather more LH IIA sherds were found in the upper levels; they include examples decorated with stone pattern, a couple with ogival canopy, a couple with curved stripes (3020) and one with rock pattern; a bridge-spouted jug neck portrays running spiral, and a body sherd shows serpentine loop and foliate band (3021); a body sherd from a goblet has a figure-of-eight shield (3022) very close to that on the jug 3253.

(iii) Late Helladic IIIA2 Early The levels of this period consist of about 50 cm of wash, which is deeper at the ε and hardly apparent at the w end (baskets 31, 32 and 33), since there is a slope of about 70 cm from the Ν to the se corner. In contrast to the LH IIIC material, there are widespread joins not only horizontally but also vertically, suggesting that the wash was all deposited at more or less the same time. Much of the material is worn. A fair amount of Early Mycenaean and MH I Late pottery is present in all baskets. The material from these levels is presented as a unit, together with stray finds from the upper levels.</page><page sequence="328">THE LATE HELLADIC POTTERY §1 303 Walls that may belong to this phase are ke and kg. They are parallel to each other and probably contemporary, the difference in their height being due to the slope. LH ΠΙΑ fill drifted in down the slope between the two walls and covered the stumps of these walls; this provides a terminus ante quern for the collapse in LH IIIA2 Early. However, precise dating of the walls is difficult. Wall ke was removed; it contained only two sherds (basket 82) - one MH and one black monochrome that was not kept, either EH II or Mycenaean. In terms of height, the bottom of wall ke seems to be level with basket 69, which is LH IIIA2 (dated on one kylix rim too fragmentary to illustrate) and which seems to provide a terminus ante quern? The material consists very largely of open shapes, especially the kylix and the basin. The majority of these pieces are monochrome, as also are sherds from other shapes, such as the mug, stemmed bowl etc. Decorated material is scarce; nevertheless, the deposit has to be dated on the commonest decorated shape, the kylix: the examples present belong to FS 256 and are LH IIIA2 Early, apart from a couple of examples of FS 257 which would suggest a terminus post quern in mid-LH IIIA2. A large group of FS 256 kylikes can be isolated; these have a small, fine everted rim and heavy stem banding. These features, together with the decoration on these vases, suggest strong Minoan influence.8 The small, fine everted rim appears on other shapes, such as the amphora/hydria and stemmed bowl, as well as on the monochrome kylikes, indicating that the whole deposit is homogeneous and should belong to this date.

The kylikes of Group I (3042-3043, 3045-3047) include the canonical FS 256 with the usual fat, short everted lip with a band over it22 and FS 257 (3040-3041, 3044), where the decorative zone reaches below the handles and, in the case of 3041 and 3044, probably down to the top of the stem.23 FS 257 begins in LH IIIA2 Late,24 but as the majority of kylikes here are FS 256 a date in the middle of LH IIIA2 may well fit the deposit. The kylikes of Group II are FS 256 but have the small, fine everted rim noted above on the amphora/hydria, a monochrome interior, and stems with large amounts of solid paint interspersed with narrow reserved bands; even when the reserved bands are thicker, they are still not very wide and are set close together (3061-3062). Bases have one or two concentric circles and a reserved edge (3064-3066). This group corresponds closely to the Minoan kylix.25 The solid painted stem could be a legacy of the LH IIIAi goblet,26 or it could be the result of the Cretan influence, together with the monochrome interior and the fine everted lip.27 Unfortunately, there are few published LM IIIA2 kylikes for comparison,28 but apart from the absence of the Minoan hollow stem there are examples very close to the kylix of Group II in the decoration of the stem.29 Moreover, the running spirals on the example from the Dictaean Cave30 are a replica of those on 3051 in the arrangement of a fat outer coil surrounding thinner ones. A search on the mainland for antecedents of Group II reveals that the short, everted lip of the LH IIIAi kylix is similar to that of Group II,31 although somewhat longer, but it has a very shallow bowl and a tall stem with equal bands of painting and reserved surface, whereas the pieces from Ayios Stephanos have a deep FS 256 bowl and the stem described above, as well as a monochrome interior. The closest parallels to the stem, but not to the lip and monochrome interior, come from Rhodes,32 and there is one from Vourvatsi in Attica,33 whereas the remaining Attic examples published have a 17 Papadopoulos iq7q, 122-3. 2*0 fier. 274a. 18 Furumark 19410, 623. 19 Mountiov iq88, 186. 20 See Mountiov io8n' Hi ίίσ. ioq for tfip usual tvnp 21 Popham 1084, pl. 171.8. 22 Mee 1Q82, pl. iR.i-a. 23 Cf.

A selection of stems is depicted in 3059-3064 and bases in 3065-3066. The base 3047 from Group I is heavily painted and should belong to Group II but does not have a monochrome interior; the example from Vourvatsi, however, shows that stems of this type may also belong to Group I.

Two linear examples are shown, both with rounded overhanging rims: 3083 has two large horizontal handles on the upper body, and 3084 has a wide band of paint over the rim similar to the CUP 3560. There are many monochrome sherds, but no whole profile can be restored. This once again illustrates the local preference for solidly coating vases which would be linear or unpainted elsewhere. Rims are flat (3085), T-shaped (3086), rolled over (3326) or in-turning (3328); bases are ring, in contrast to the flat ones of the earlier examples (see above). The early and more recent excavations at the Menelaion have produced basins with three short legs, which appear in LH IIIAi contexts.40 Two examples of legs have been found (3087-3088) as survivals in the LH IIIC Early levels. The paucity of LH IIIAi material at the site and in Area Epsilon in particular suggests that these pieces may go with the LH IIIA2 monochrome basins.

Miscellaneous bowl (fig. 6.8) Piece 310«, with the fine everted rim of this period, could belong to a dipper; the high handle stub and the blobs on the rim would fit this shape, but the bowl is very shallow, the diameter rather large and the banding rather heavy. It is out of context. The other pieces are monochrome. 3103, with a longer but very everted rim, could have a stemmed or a flat base. The tall rim 3104 could be LH II, but it does not correspond well to the more everted rims of the LH II group (see above). 3105 could belong to a rounded kylix, but the diameter is very small, and it is more likely a bowl. 3106 is a miniature bowl. The base 3107, with a streak across the bottom, may belong to a bowl with horizontal or vertical handles. The almost complete profile of the monochrome krateriskos 3108 is a small version of FS 279, although the bowl is much narrower than is the LH HIAi shape. There is a late LH IIIB monochrome parallel from Achaia.43 The bases 3109 and 3110 may also belong to this shape, since they are rather deep and narrow for that of the basin. 3102.

(v) Transitional and Late Helladic IIIC Early (3135-3197; figs 6.11-6.13) The surface levels in Area Epsilon, which were 40 cm thick, produced a mixture of worn Byzantine and LH IIIC Early pottery together with some LH IIIBi and LH ΠΙΑ. The LH IIIC Early levels consisted of about 50 cm of wash above collapsed LH IIIC Early buildings (3143 and 3179 date wall ka). No floor levels survived, and the pottery cannot be associated with any walls.48 LH IIIC Early pottery from the surface levels is published here together with that from the LH IIIC Early wash levels in order to give a more complete picture of the material, which consists mostly of deep bowl sherds decorated with local versions of standard Mycenaean motifs (see also fig. 6.44).

Deep bowl FS 284 (3153-3184; fig. 6.12) A large selection of deep bowl sherds is illustrated, partly as it is the commonest LH IIIC shape and partly to give an idea of the local variation at Ayios Stephanos on the normal Mycenaean patterns.57 Very few pieces do not have a monochrome interior. 3153, 3162-3163 and 3173 have a second wide band below the interior rim, which is a LH IIIC feature at Tiryns58 and Phylakopi;59 the second outer rim band on 3160-3161, 3164, 3168 and 3179 is also a LH IIIC feature,60 in imitation of the LH IIIB stemmed bowl. 3168 is the Type 1 Transitional deep bowl, while 3170 and 3193-3194 are Type 2.61 Fragment 3155 exhibits a local use of FM 29, the trefoil pattern. 3159 is decorated with a spiral with a fill similar to that on a LH IIIC Early straight-sided alabastron from Perati;62 it also has the flaring rim and bell-shaped upper profile typical of LH IIIC.63 3160-3163 portray versions of quirk, that on 3161 being close to that on the collar-necked jar 3135. Antithetic spiral is depicted on 3164- 3167: 3164 has a dotted fringe similar to that on a LH IIIC Early krater from Korakou,64 3165 a flaring rim, 3166 a chevron between the spirals instead of a panel and 3167 a filled spiral. Wavy band appears on 3168-3171, zigzag on 3172-3173, the former with a bell-shaped body. 3174 has a horizontal foliate band, to which there are parallels from Tiryns65 and Phylakopi66 in LH IIIC Early, and 3175- 3176 a vertical foliate band.

AREA ZETA 1973 The Mycenaean deposits in this Area have suffered through later building, when the MH and LH IIIC Early walls were re-used for the Medieval structures.71 Furthermore, the Late Mycenaean building activity destroyed the Early Mycenaean levels, with the result that the few Early Mycenaean sherds illustrated here are unstratified. One LH IIIC Early deposit can be isolated: sector delta produced a stony level running over and from the NE face of wall ig s to wall id (baskets 49, 50, 54 and 56), but very little pottery was kept, and even less is worth illustrating: three deep bowl sherds are depicted (3213-3214 and 3220) and a krater sherd (3211).

The flaring lip and bell shape of 3213, decorated with panel pattern, date it to this period, as likewise the similar rim of 3214. The two linear bases (3219-3220) both have a fairly high ring. 3212.

In the sw of the Area the fill immediately below the Byzantine was LH IIIB-IIIC to an average depth of 30 cm, but in the rest of Area Beta Early Mycenaean was found immediately below a few LH IIIB-IIIC baskets. Apart from the LH IIA-IIIAi Floor 1, the remaining architectural features in the trench rarely form a coherent pattern: patches of floor cannot be associated with walls, and walls have no floors to go with them.81 Most of the interments in this Area were of children without grave goods, but burials 26 and 28 contained noteworthy pottery. With the exception of these graves, the pottery from Area Beta is published chronologically rather than stratigraphically in order to give an overview of the material, since the stratigraphy is so complex. Cross-references to the published sherds are made in the introduction to each section, but most of the material illustrated comes from fill. All baskets are from the excavations of 1977 unless stated. (i) Stratigraphic Contexts (a) THE ALLEY AND STEPS (LH HA) In the ne corner of the paved area in the SW Sector lies the entrance to the alley, Street Beta IV, that continues ν in the line of wall ed, flanked by wall es and eo with two steps upwards: Step I = basket 83, Step II = basket 84. These date to LH IIA (3246 and 3282 are the dating sherds). (b) PLASTER FLOOR IN THE SE SECTOR (LH UB) This floor (baskets 42, 49, 66 and 78) may be associated with wall ep, since the stones showing through after the floor was removed were from an earlier level. The floor covered wall ey and belongs to the last period of Mycenaean occupation in this sector. [A LH IIB floor in the Central Sector was dug with 1974 basket 37, w of the Medieval wall el.] The latest sherds on the floor are LH IIB (3295-3296); other sherds published are LH I (3244), LH IIA (3249, 3252, 3260-3264, 3268, 3274-3281, 3283, 3285) and Late Matt Painted (3299). There is a join between baskets 49 and 66. (c) BURIAL 28 (LH IIB) This interment (basket 107) contained a child in a cist against wall em. The child had a bead bracelet on each wrist and three vases buried with it: the askos 3289, the jug 3290 and the goblet 3291. These are LH IIB/IIIAi in date. (d) FLOOR 1 (LH IIA-IIIAl) The Mycenaean wall ed delimiting the sw part of the trench is associated with Floor 1, refurbished in LH IIIAi (baskets 17, 39, 52, 59, 63, 65, 68-9, 72, 74, 76, 82, 89, and 1974 baskets 19, 21). Sherds 81 See further Chapter ι §4 above.</page><page sequence="350">THE LATE HELLADIC POTTERY §4 325 published here come from baskets 72, 76, 82, 89: LH I (3235, 3238, 3240-3242), LH IIA (3247); baskets 17, 69, and 1974 baskets 19, 21, 25: LH IIA (3250, 3258, 3270), LH IIIAi (3300, 3304- 3306, 3308). Floor 1 also extended under the LH IIIA2 area of stones ev, both inside and outside its ν corner (baskets 63, 65 and 68 with LH IIA sherd 3248 and LH IIIAi sherds 3303-3304, 3309- 3310 and 3312). Basket 59, which is above 63, includes two whole pots (3306 and 3313) of LH IIIAi date, which are also associated with Floor 1. Beneath this floor, basket 72 outside stones ev in the SW Sector came down onto what is possibly a rubble floor of LH I- II date. Sherds illustrated are LH I (3235&gt; 3237)· [Floor 1 was laid in LH IIA.82] (e) BURIAL 26 (LH IIIA2 EARLY) This burial (basket 67) was inside a re-used cist by the Ε baulk of the trench. It contained an infant together with a jug (3338) and an askos (3339). They are LH IIIA2 Early. (f) FLOOR-DEPOSITS OR FILL (LH IIIA2-IIIC EARLY) A possible floor deposit (baskets 15-16, 28-9, 1959 baskets 4-5 and 1974 baskets 6-7, 12-14, 23), consisting of a rubble floor(?) and containing two whole pots (LH IIIB 3342 and LH IIIC 3357), lies in the SW Sector. It contains much LH IIIA2 material. It overlies material from another possible floor, the 'light brown floor' (baskets 10, 40, 1959 baskets 6-7 and 1974 baskets 8-10, 18, 24), and a pit beneath it (baskets 48, 56), which contains the LH IIIC Early pot 3380 but also earlier material including LH IIIA2. Basket 40 has a join with basket 48, a pit dug below this level into that of basket 57; there is another join between basket 48 and the lower deposit (1974 basket 24). The pottery from this level and from the pit is also LH IIIA2-IIIC Early. Published sherds include LH IIA (3254, 3256), LH IIB (3294), LH IIIA2 fôs16^^ 33*1-33*6, 3329, 3331, 3333~3337&gt; 334Ο-3341)* LH IIIB (3340-3355), and Transitional LH IIIB2-LH IIIC Early with LH IIIC Earlv (3357-3380). It came down onto the V-shaped area of stones ev. This feature dates from LH IIIA2 (basket 73, with dating sherd 3323). It went below the level of basket 57 (LH IIIAi) and further down to the LH IIIAi floor (Floor 1). [The editor takes the stones ev and these deposits to be layers of rubble and fill dumped at a single time during the LH IIIC Early phase.83] Elsewhere the baskets are still a mixture of Byzantine and later Mycenaean material (baskets 10 and 11). Sherds published are LH II (3245, 3265, 3286-3287) and LH IIIA2 (3320). (ii) Pottery (a) LATE HELLADIC I (3234-3244; FIG. 6.1 5) The only stratified LH I material comes from basket 76, the removal of the slabs eu of Floor 1 in the S Central Sector (3242), and from basket 72, a possible rubble floor under Floor 1 in the SW Sector (3235, 3237). The sherd 3242 is a LM IA import; the rest of the material consists of a few monochrome and unpainted goblet rims, giving a date of MH III/LH I to the layer into which the slabs of Floor 1 were bedded.

(c) LATE HELLADIC IIB (3289-3299) Vases from burial 28 (fig. 6.18) This child burial (baskets 102 and 107) contained the askos 3289, the miniature monochrome juglet 3290 and the miniature goblet 3291. There are no parallels to the shape of the askos except the much later duck askoi from Achaea, which do not have the strap handle on the back but a spout.89 The juglet 3290 is a small version of FS 135, but with a short neck that merges into the body. There is a LH IIB parallel from the Agora at Athens.90 The shape does not appear after LH IIB. The small goblet 3291, which is monochrome under the base, has the early type of conical foot with a short everted rim. The burial would seem to be LH IIB,91 but a date early in LH IIIAi cannot be ruled out, since our knowledge of the division between the two phases is still imperfect.92 Askos (fig. 6.18) 3289.

Material from other contexts (fig. 6.19) Apart from burial 28, there is very little recognisable material of this period. The pottery illustrated below comes from the LH IIB floor in the SE Sector (3295-3296). Further material comes from the floor in the Central Sector in 1974 basket 37, w of the Medieval wall el (3292-3293), which also yielded LH I (3234), LH IIA (3251, 3269, 3288) and Late Matt Painted (3299). There is also LH IIB in another basket from this Sector (3297); 3294 and 3298 are from later fill. 89 Papadopoulos 1979, 231-4 figs. 255-8. 90 Immerwahr 1971, T.VII.19. 91 Mountiov iq88, i8r. 92 Mountjoy 1986, 51.</page><page sequence="356">THE LATE HELLADIC POTTERY §4 331 Fig. 6.18.

AREA LAMBDA 1973-77 The pottery from all the Lambda trenches is presented here as one group arranged chronologically rather than stratigraphically (apart from floor deposits and burials), since a large proportion of it is unstratified. (i) Stratigraphic Contexts (a) LAMBDA 1, 1973 AND LAMBDA / BETA 12, 1974 This Area slopes steeply and heavy erosion has taken place. Nonetheless, there is a considerable depth of deposit, and bedrock was never reached. The effects of the erosion are illustrated by joins between surface layers from the Ν to the s end of the trenches. Mycenaean layers are directly under the surface everywhere, and only small amounts of LH IIIC Early pottery have been washed down from higher up.109 Late Helladic IIA No walls earlier than LH IIIC Early were removed, and only a few Early Mycenaean baskets were dug. [The following walls and floors are now assigned to LH IIA-IIIAi Early: walls mj, la, lp and gc, with Floors 18 and 19 of 1963, Floors 1 and 3 of 1973, and Floor 3 of 1974 (fig. 1.36). The discussion is keyed to the plan of the MH III-LH I phase, fig. 1.43.] 109 See further Chapter ι §5 above with figs. 1.34-1.45.</page><page sequence="367">342 P. A. MOUNTJOY Room 6 (1973 baskets 13, 14, 15, 21, 23) These LH II-IIIAi levels overlie wall le. Baskets 13 and 14 come from above wall If; 14 seems to be tumble. There are no whole pots, but the lower half of a goblet was recovered (3558); its tall stem suggests a LH IIIAi date. Sherds illustrated are LH I (3481-3482), LH IIA (3497, 3515, 3525) and LH IIIAi (3549, 3558). Room 7 (1974 baskets 30, 32, 34, 69, 73) Baskets 69 and 73 join with 1973 baskets 14 and 2 1 from Room 6, demonstrating that all four baskets postdate the destruction of wall If, which separates them. This wall is higher than wall gd, which suggests that it is a later (but still Early Mycenaean) addition to the building plan. The other baskets, together with 1973 basket 13 from Room 6, represent confused LH IIA levels associated with the collapse of wall If. The heights of baskets 69 and 73 show they are still deeper than the preserved top of wall If; the baskets associated with the wall itself are MH III/LH I from the deepest levels reached in 1973. As baskets 69 and 73 are large deposits with portions of whole pots, they may represent the floors associated with walls la and lp. [Similarly, baskets 30 and 32 represent the LH IIA slab floor called Floor 3 of 1974.] Sherds published from these baskets are LH I (3467, 3480, 3484, 3487, 3489), LH IIA (3490- 3491' 3494, 35O1&gt; 35X3&gt; 35l6&gt; 35X9&gt; 35«6&gt; 353*)&gt; and Late Matt Painted (354O-3541) Room 8 (1974 baskets 71, 74) Only the tops of walls gd, ge and hx=hw were exposed in 1974; the material in the two baskets is LH II apart from basket 74, which contained the LH IIIC amphoriskos base 3593. The floor levels may not be far below. Pottery published consists of LH I (3475), LH IIA (3503, 3514, 3529-3530, 3537) and LH IIB (3539). Room 10A (1973 basket 12) Although separated by wall le, basket 12 joins with basket 13 in Room 6, which confirms that the LH IIA levels either side of le are contemporary. The LH IIA whole pots 1693 and 3511 come from what must have been a LH IIA floor level associated with wall le=hx and probably wall Id. Illustrated material consists of LH I (3472, 3486) and LH IIA (3511, 3528). Room 10B (1973 baskets 17, 20) Basket 20 was used for the removal of the badly eroded Floor 2 of 1973; its latest material is LH I- II, apart from one LH IIIA2 sherd that is probably contamination from the burial beneath (burial 1). There is a join in the LH IIIA2 piece 3560 between this basket and 1974 basket 66. Only six sherds have been kept from basket 20, and basket 17 contains solely MH; 3560 alone is worthy of illustration. Room 10C (1974 baskets 66, 75) The latest sherds in basket 66 are LH IIIAi (two sherds), but these are probably contamination from burials 7 and 10; the remaining sherds are LH I- II. There are joins between this basket and 1973 basket 20 in Room 10B (3560), which lies at the same level, and with 1973 baskets 26 and 33. Of these, basket 26 is from Room 10B beneath basket 20, and basket 33 is the removal of wall lc. Basket 75 from the ε end of the Area contains material overlying the tops of walls ht and lr. The stratigraphy is disturbed, the latest sherd being LH IIIA2. Material illustrated from this area comprises LH IIIAi (3555) and LH IIIA2 (3566). Late Heüadic III [The discussion is keyed to the plan of the LH II- III phases, fig. 1.36. Walls lb and lo are now assigned to LH IIIAi; the other walls in fig. 1.36 are LH IIIC Early.] Room 3 (1974 baskets 20, 23) Each of these baskets contains a couple of LH IIIAi pieces as the latest sherds. They come from ν of wall lb and go down roughly to its base; but the pottery is very mixed, including much Early Mycenaean, there is no evidence for a floor, there are no whole pots, and the basket heights are known only by inference. One LH IIIAi piece from basket 23 is shown (3545). [This LH IIIAi room was cut by the LH IIIC Early building to the s and Ε (Rooms 2 and 4).]</page><page sequence="368">THE LATE HELLADIC POTTERY §5 343 Area w of wall la (1973 baskets 3, 4, 6, 8) The pottery is mixed LH IIIAi -2, with some LH IIIB-IIIC sherds from basket 3 and earlier material. Sherds illustrated from here are LH I (3483), LH IIIAi (3548, 3551, 3558) and LH IIIC Early (3583)· Room 1 (1973 baskets 7, 10, 27; 1974 baskets 35, 37) The baskets from this room, including the area s of wall lb, contain material from mixed surface levels. To the sw, in the area of the underlying Room 10A, 1973 baskets 7 and 10 were used. The pottery is mixed LH IIIA1-2, with earlier material. Sherds illustrated from here are LH IIA (3510, 3528) and Late Matt Painted (3543). Three LH III burials were cut down into Room 1: (i) Lambda burial 1 (1973 basket 30) The MH sherds in this basket probably come from the stratum into which the burial was cut, as the whole pots found with the burial are LH IIIA2 (3573-3574)· There is a good deal of LH ΠΙΑ in the overlying baskets 20 and 26 and even in basket 7, which is higher still and constitutes the lowest level from which the grave could have been cut. The LH IIIA2 flask 3575 may also be associated with this burial.110 (ii) Lambda burial 7 (1974 basket 70) This interment is dated by the LH IIIAi sherd 3555; it joins with baskets 37 and 66 above it, which must have been contaminated by the burial. It was perhaps an intramural infant burial deposited during the use of Room 1. [The bowl 3569 should probably be associated with this interment.111] (iii) Beta burial 20 (1974 basket 42, not retained) The excavator suggested that this burial belongs to the late phase, i.e. LH ΠΙΑ, in the use of Room 1 . It is cut into 1974 basket 37, which contained mainly LH I-IIA material, but had a few LH IIIAi sherds, possibly contamination from the burial. [This interment is now dated to LH IIIC Early.112] Room 2 (1974 baskets 36, 38, 39, 41, 50, 51) Baskets 36 and 38 contain tumble from the collapse of wall hu and give it a terminus post quern of LH IIIA2 (a kylix rim decorated with octopus with added white in basket 38). The room had a slab floor, Floor 4, represented by baskets 39, 41, 50 and 51. It is a LH IIIC Early floor with a couple of pots in situ and much LH I-IIA wash, which has come down on top after wall hu collapsed. A conical kylix rim decorated with distinctive splashes across the handle is illustrated from basket 51 (3595) and a dipper rim with the same handle splashes from baskets 39 and 50 (3594) together with the cup 3596, which joins HS 119.113 [The amphoriskos 3701, alabastron 3704 and unpainted shallow bowl HS 106114 also come from Floor 4.] Room 4 (1974 baskets 31, 43, 45, 52) The upper levels (baskets 31 and 43) are mixed with LH I-IIA wash from a floor higher up the slope. The walls seem to have collapsed first, and then the wash came down over the tumble. The LH IIIC slabbed floor (Floor 5) was excavated in baskets 45 and 52 and produced the amphoriskos 3593 and the bowl 3597. [Floor 5 also yielded the LH IIIB amphora 3694 and the LH IIIC Early amphoriskos 3700, stirrup jar 3707, deep bowl 3738 and lid HS 122. 115 The LH IIA goblets 3667 and 3670 are from the Early Mycenaean wash.] Otherwise there are half a dozen LH IIIAi decorated sherds from all the baskets, the remaining pottery being LH I- II. Unstratified material The remaining pottery illustrated from Lambda i/Beta 12 comes from surface levels or is unstratified. It includes LH I (3463-3466, 3468-3470), LH I-II (3524, 3527, 3533), LH IIA (3493, 3500, 3504- 35Ο5, 3518, 3521, 3538), LH IIIAi (3546, 3550, 3552, 3554), LH IIIA2 (3561, 3564-3565, 3568, 3570) and LH IIIC Early (3592). 110 See Chapter 2 §5 (i) above. 111 See Chanter 2 S κ (i) ahnvP 112 See Chapter 2 §5 (ii) above. 113 Taylour 1972, 254-5, 259&gt; wh° dates the floor too early. 114 Tavlour 1072. 2*8 with fier. *a. 115 Taylour 1972, 259, 245 fig. 22.2, pl. 47a.</page><page sequence="369">344 ρ· Α· MOUNTJOY (b) LAMBDA 2, 1974 This trench, which slopes steeply southwards, was excavated only to a depth of 8o cm. The surface levels (baskets 2 and 18) were dug all over the trench; below the surface in the ν sector the baskets (3, 5, 28, 33 and 46) contained a mixture of Byzantine and Mycenaean pottery. Sherds illustrated from these baskets are LH IIA (3507, 3517), LH IIIA2 (3563), LH IIIB (3582) and LH IIIC Early (3585,358g).116 Early Mycenaean, first phase Wall lj is the earliest wall in the trench, but nothing is known of its date, apart from the possibility that the putative Floor 1 may be associated with it, in which case it too was built in, or in use in, the Early Mycenaean period. Early Mycenaean, second phase (baskets 13, 14, 15, 16) Earlier levels survive in the shelter of walls lh and lj. The tumble from wall 11 (basket 26) also has Early Mycenaean as its latest material. Apart from LH I and some LH IIA, the baskets all contain worn MH; basket 15 has two intrusive LH IIIA2 sherds, one of which joins with baskets 7 and 11, and basket 16 has a LH IHBi sherd, which also joins with basket 1 1. No floor levels have survived, and basket 16, which rests on Floor 1 (if it is a floor), probably belongs to the first phase of Early Mycenaean. Pottery illustrated consists of LH I (3462, 3473, 3476-3477) and LH IIA (3508). Late Helladic III (baskets 4, 6-11, 22, 25, 47, 54, 65) Below the surface levels there is a fairly deep LH ΠΙΑ fill over the trench. Most of the sherds are worn Early Mycenaean, but there is a small proportion of LH IIIA2-IHB sherds in a relatively unworn state. In the s part of the trench the fill occupies the entire lower end as deep as was excavated. The surfaces on which the lowest baskets 1 1 and 47 rest, called Floors 1 and 2, are suspect as floors, as there are no whole pots to go with them. Pottery published from this phase is LH I (3474, 3485), LH IIA (3498, 35Ο9, 3520), LH IIIAi (3547, 3553), LH IIIA2 (3559), LH IIIB (3576-3581) and LH IIIC (3587- 3588. 3590-3591) (c) AREA LAMBDA 3/4, 1977 Early Mycenaean levels and structures A series of LH I surfaces (Floors 4=6=7) produced three whole pots. The building in association with these floors, Structure Lambda I using walls me, mh and mb, was built late in MH and continued in use in LH I, when it consisted of two rooms with floors at different levels linked by a step md, which was a later insertion. These floors were in the s room (Room A/B). The layers immediately over the floors contained a mixture of LH I-IIA pottery. The whole pots were the naviform objects 6078-6081 on Floor 7, and LH IIA 3522 on Floor 6. The baskets from the floors are as follows: Floor 4, basket 106 with basket 54 above it; Floor 6, basket 85 (3522, but otherwise lost) over 86 (sherds 345«"3453) and 89 (including 3457), with basket 83 above the floor; and from Floor 7, baskets 90, 94 and 105 (the latter two baskets were not retained). The collapse of the mud-brick walls, and perhaps more deliberate activity, led to the deposition of a LH I-IIA fill over the entire area of the building. [Items 3457 and 3522 show that the building went out of use in LH IIA Early. Pieces 3391-33925 3396&gt; 3401, 3405, 3427 and 3442 from the Ν room, Room C, found on the MH III/LH I-LH I Early Floor 8 (basket 91) and over the MH III Late Floor 9 below it (basket 97) are also included below.117] Lambda burial 15 This interment was made in the jar 1781, which should be MH/LH I. It overlies mb, which is MH III but continued in use until LH I. Therefore the burial must belong to late LH I/LH IIA. Late Helladic III levels These levels have been extensively disturbed by Byzantine building activity. There are no definite LH IIIB-IIIC levels, and LH ΠΙΑ levels also hardly existed in the excavated areas, or have been eroded 116 For the stratigraphy see Chapter ι §6 above with figs, ι .46-1 .47. 117 See further Chapter 1 §7 (iii) with figs. 1.49-1.52.</page><page sequence="370">THE LATE HELLADIC POTTERY §5 345 away. Possibly wall me in the NW Sector belongs to this phase, but any surfaces related to it lie to the Ν and have not been excavated.118 Lambda burial 14 (1977 baskets 32, 34) This was a cist grave cut down into Early Mycenaean levels. It was reached in basket 32 and removed in basket 34. One LH IIIA2 vase is associated with it (3572). There was no LH IIIA in the levels above, so the pit must have been shallow or eroded away in pre-Byzantine times. The stones of the cist grave, basket 49, contain nothing later than the surrounding Early Mycenaean. Lambda burial 16 (1977 baskets 48, 52) Basket 48 came down to this cist burial, which was removed with basket 52. The burial should stratigraphically be LH III, but the pottery in basket 52 was undiagnostic. Pottery published from the baskets of the LH III levels consists of LH I (3488), LH HA (3496), LH IIIAi (3544) and LH IIIA2 (3567, 357*)· (ii) Pottery (a) TRANSITIONAL AND LATE HELLADIC I FROM AREA LAMBDA 3/4 (3381-3433) The stratified LH I in the Lambda trenches comes mainly from the upper floor deposits (Floors 4a=4b=6=7) of Room A/B of Structure Lambda I in Area Lambda 3/4 that continued in use from MH III to LH I or even LH IIA. [1710 is also from Floor 6. This section also includes sherds from the LH I Early fill over Floor 8 in Room C of this building (baskets 68 over 88). Six LH I Early pieces found on Floor 8 itself (baskets 91-3, 96) are also published here (3392, 3396, 3401, 3405, 3427 and 3442). The MH III/LH I sherd 3391 was found in the fill over Floor 9 (basket 97) below Floor 8.119] The Helladic material is published as 3381-3433, and the Minoan imports as 3434-3461. These deposits contained a range of wares: Fine Yellow Minyan, Dark Burnished Micaceous, Grey Minyan, Gritty Yellow Minyan and Matt Painted, Lustrous Decorated (fine and gritty), Micaceous Minoan and Coarse. A few Minoan imports and a little Lustrous Painted (i.e. Mycenaean) LH I pottery were also present. The imported Minoan sherds date to MM IIIB through early LM IA.120 The wares of the MH period continued to be produced in the early years of LH, and one cannot be certain in many cases whether sherds belong to the end of the earlier period or to the beginning of the next. What is clear, however, from the evidence in this building is that the production of Fine Yellow Minyan in the shapes catalogued below and the Dark-on-light style of Lustrous Decorated ware belonged to the LH period. [In consultation with C. Zerner, the following dates are now given to the items in §(a) and in §(b) below: [Transitional MH III/LH I: 3391, 3402, 3411, 3435, 3448.

The fine Lustrous Decorated material includes a sherd from a Vapheio cup (3416) and sherds from rounded cups or bowls decorated in light-on-dark and dark-on-light techniques (3417-3430). They may sometimes be decorated with purple bands (3424"3425&gt; 34^9) or with ripple and added white (3423, 3427). 3428 is decorated with a cross on the base, a feature relatively frequent in this period.</page><page sequence="373">348 P.

AREA NU / GAMMA 1, 1977 The 1973-74 excavations of this Area are already published and a series of pottery phases worked out (Periods I-IV, of which Period III is MH III/LH I and Period IV is LH IIA).157 In 1977 the area was further excavated by J. B. Rutter, particularly the trenches Nu 1 and Nu 2, and his earlier conclusions were slightly modified in the case of Periods III and IV. Since there are no whole pots belonging to these periods from the excavation of 1977, a few pieces dating to Period IV from the excavations in 1973-74 are re-illustrated in §7 below in order to give an overview of the Early Mycenaean from Area Nu. (i) The Middle Helladic III/Late Helladic I Transition (Rutter Period IIIB) In 1977 trenches Nu 1 and Nu 2 were further excavated; the removal of the walls of Structure Nu II showed that it was constructed right at the beginning of the Mycenaean period. The excavator then divided his Period III into IIIA and IIIB (i.e. MH III and MH III/LH I), the construction of the house belonging to Period IIIB. The baskets involved are 26 (walls nc, nk, nm), 15 (ne), 16 (nd), 25 (no), 18 (nf), 13 (upper fill of the foundation trench for wall nf in trench Nu 2) and 22 (the lower fill of this trench). The 1977 excavation further revealed that: (a) wall nf does not stop short of the s baulk of Nu 2, but has been robbed out at the S end by Nu burial 12; (b) the Period IIIB floor W of wall nf in trench Nu 2 slopes from ν to s; (c) the Period IIIB surface s of Room 2 is now clear in the s baulk; and (d) there is no Period IIIB surface or floor ε of wall nc/nk and Ν of wall nm, but a cutting visible in the Ε baulk may have been made ν of nm for the construction of such a surface.158 The pottery from the removal of the house walls consisted of much Fine and Gritty Lustrous Decorated (3598-3628), some LM IA (3629-3633) and some LH I (3634-3637). [Many sherds in other wares from these baskets and others of the same date are published among 2001-2204 above.159 C. Zerner now dates 3627 to MH III Early. The context of the following pieces from basket 18 cannot be dated more closely than MH III Late-LH I Early: 3608, 3610, 3613, 3625, 3628-3630, 3632-3633. The rest are MH III/LH I.] (a) LUSTROUS DECORATED, FINE (3598-3611; FIG. 6.34) There is one piece from what must have been a handsome closed vessel (3598), decorated in brown, red, white and black paint, but as in the 1973-74 deposits, most of the sherds belong to open shapes, either the Vapheio or rounded cup.160 The 1973-74 excavation suggests that the Vapheio cups were painted monochrome with added purple or white bands. Three Vapheio cup rims can be recognised from this deposit, of which 3599 has a reserved band on the exterior rim, 3600 has added white bands and 3601 a foliate band in added white on a brown-purple surface. The rounded cups are decorated in dark-on-light and light-on-dark techniques; those illustrated all have added purple bands at the exterior rim except 3602, which has a reserved rim with a purple band below. Only three cups have the body preserved: 3608 is monochrome, 3606 has foliate band in dark-on-light and 3607 in light-on-dark. The base 3609 is banded in and out but has no white or purple bands added to the exterior base band, as on the examples from the earlier excavation.161 Finally, a bowl-rim is present with added white decoration (3611) and a sherd from a carinated cup (3610).

The edge of the band round the lower handle-joint can be made out to the left of the large sherd. This decoration normally appears on stirrup-jars,167 but the position of the handle precludes this shape for 3644; the interior junction of the neck and shoulder rules out the bridge-spouted jug,168 but both the decoration and the shape would fit the beaked jug. There is a parallel from Kea169 with the same decoration, but with solid bands rather than foliate band between the registers, which is called FS 132 or FS 143.

SUMMARY, INCLUDING MATERIAL FROM THE 1959-63 EXCAVATIONS Much LH I, LH IIIA2 Early and LH IIIC Early pottery is present at the site, along with some LH IIA and LH IIIB, whereas LH IIB, LH IIIAi and LH IIIA2 Late are barely represented. In the subsequent discussion an overview is given of each pottery phase; material, mostly unstratified, from the excavations of 1959-63 is included to enlarge the corpus. (i) Late Helladic I (3649-3662; fig. 6.36) Apart from the early LH I building in Area Lambda 3/4 , Structure Lambda I,172 there is no other good LH I stratigraphy from the site. Since Structure Lambda I is early LH I, most of the pottery belongs to the Matt Painted / Minoanising class, with very little of the Lustrous Painted, i.e. Mycenaean, ware discussed here (figs. 6.25-6.27, with Lustrous Painted LH I sherds of Mycenaean fabric in fig. 6·27&gt; 3454~346i)· The shapes represented at the site are the piriform jar FS 27, the alabastron FS 80, the squat jug FS 87, the hole-mouthed jar FS 100, the rounded cup FS 211, Vapheio cup FS 224 and the straight-sided cup, in fact all the usual LH I shapes, together with the rarer straight- sided alabastron 3467. Most of the LH I sherds belong to the Vapheio cup; there are very few sherds present from closed shapes. The repertoire of patterns includes all the common LH I motifs, often used in different combinations according to the shape of the vase; there is much use of added white paint. The piriform jar sherd 3462 is decorated with linked spiral, but the other representations of the spiral are all of the tangent or running type. A piriform jar sherd from the earlier excavations is illustrated (3649), decorated with large urchins separated by cross tangents. The three published examples of the alabastron FS 80 have joining semi-circles (3464), wavy band (3463) and a degenerate form of iris (3234); the latter is unusual as a main decoration. The few examples of the squat jug FS 87 have running spiral (3235 and 3465) and cross (3466). The hole-mouthed jar sherds are decorated with vertical foliate band (3311 and 3468) and stone pattern (3469), both predictable motifs for this shape. Sherds from rounded cups are also not common: 3470 has a wavy band, 3471 spiral and 3237 a large example of tangent spiral with blob fill. Three cups are illustrated from the earlier excavations: 3650, decorated with spiral, shows the metallic pinched-in handle-base current in this phase, 3651 has joined blobs, and 3652 foliate band; 3237 and 3650-3651 have the typical LH I cup profile with the tall rim and deep, clumsy rounded body best exemplified by examples from Lerna.173 The shorter rim of 3470 and 3652 may belong to the stemmed type FS 212, which also seems to have a narrow decorated zone.174 The Vapheio cup is decorated with a wide variety of LH I motifs in different combinations; spiral and foliate band variations are the most popular. The tangent spiral with blob fill is especially common (3222, 3238-3239, 3474-3475 and 3645), but of greater interest is the spiral with multiple tangents, a decoration very popular on Kythera.175 It is found on two examples from Ayios Stephanos, 3012 and 3653; the latter is a complete example from a burial excavated in i960. This and, presumably, 3012 belong to Type I, the earliest type with a deep band over the rim, rib and base and a tall narrow shape.176 The addition of the Laconian examples to the corpus suggests a south Peloponnesian distribution. Other sherds may also belong to this type but are too small to be identified with certainty. Another form of spiral, a running spiral with a small blob or dot fill, is also used on the Vapheio cup 3478 and on the squat jug 3235. The foliate band appears as simple foliate (3481-3482), in combination with wavy line (3654) or in a non-foliate version, as in 3483 (joining circles) and 3013 (joining circles and crocus). Tortoise-shell ripple is also a popular motif: there is a complete example (3240). Isolated motifs are often used in combination, such as 3655 (urchin with crossed tangents), 3485 (urchin with panel) or 3241 (urchin in circle); 3472 has a double-axe. 172 See §5 (i)-(ii) above. 173 Caskev iq*7, pl. ^Qff. 174 Mountjoy 1986, 14 fig. 7.3. 175 Coldstream 1078, 303. 176 Coldstream 1978, 393.</page><page sequence="395">37O P.

The straight-sided cup decorated with the LH I version of double-axe with single straight shaft is present (3656-3657), as well as a complete profile (3658) decorated with ripple, which is a Minoan import. There are two examples of the miniature cup or bowl, one from a burial in Area Delta (3659), decorated with running spiral with small blob fill, and one from Area Gamma decorated with ripple (3660); it may be a LM IA import. 3659 is an early version of this shape.177 Another Minoan import is a large basin with a pie-crust rim (3661); it is decorated inside and outside with double-axe. All the vases below are painted, with the exception of one goblet (3662); it is dated to LH I from comparison with parallels from Lerna.

(ii) Late Helladic IIA (3663-3670; fig. 6.37) The LH IIA pottery consists mostly of unstratified sherds, apart from a small deposit in Area Epsilon.178 The decorated LH IIA is very fragmentary. Among the closed shapes, larger pieces include the hole- mouthed jar rim 3495 decorated with elaborate ivy leaves with spirals or urchins in the coils. The decoration is unusual for a hole-mouthed jar, and more in the Minoan tradition than the Mainland one,179 but the fabric and paint of 3495 do not suggest that it is a Minoan import. A smaller version of the shape (3497) has curved stripes. Other large fragments from closed shapes come from bridge- spouted jugs: the arcades round the base of the bridge-spouted jug 3201 have parallels in the islands from Phylakopi,180 Seraglio181 and Kythera.182 The parallels from Phylakopi and Seraglio are decorated with groups of three motifs in an open field, in the same manner as the group of three shields on the bridge-spouted jug sherd 3253; the latter may also have had arcades round the base.183 The shields on 3253 have a dot fill like the triton on the bell cup 3259; it is suggested above that they are by the same hand. Shields are not a common motif, but 3022 is another example. Marine Style is only sparsely represented: in addition to the fragments already published,184 two more are shown here (3663-3664), both from closed shapes and both having a tentacle, that of 3664 next to weed that is probably growing from a large trefoil.185 Only one open shape can be restored on paper in full (except the handle), the cup 3511, FS 211, decorated with double-axes, the usual motif for this tall type of cup. Open shapes from the earlier excavations include the goblet 3666 with two rows of wavy bands; its size and two decorative zones are similar to an example from Orchomenos.186 The bell cup 3665, which has the edge of a hatched crocus, is probably decorated in the Alternating Style against an open ground.187 The small deposit in Area Epsilon gives a good idea of the monochrome shapes in vogue during this phase (3001-3010); other monochrome and unpainted shapes are illustrated (3261-3288). The most interesting monochrome shape is the goblet 3667, which, in contrast to the decorated version, is very large with a deep body, tall rim and hollowed base painted underneath.188 Some other examples still have a carinated upper body, a survival from the MH goblet (3003, 3264, 3267-3268 and 3528). Unpainted material from the earlier excavations is illustrated (3668-3670); fragments 3669-3670 are burnished wares. The material from the Athens wells189 shows that burnished wares continued alongside Mycenaean ones as late as LH IIB/IIIAi. These two pieces are assigned to the first half of 178 See§i (i) above. 179 See Niemeier 1985, 68-9 fig. 22 for the Minoan ivy leaf, and Furumark 19410, 270-1 figs 35-6 for the Mycenaean one. 180 Dawkins and Droop 191 ifl, pl. 11.140. 181 Morricone 10.72-3. î^f; fis:. 324. %J 9 S-r ' KS «_S %-* '*S KS Λ. 182 Coldstream and Huxley 1072, pl. 40, no.

(iii) Late Helladic IIB (3671-3674; fig. 6.37) This phase is barely represented at the site. One interment, Beta burial 28 (3289-3291), seems on balance to belong to this period, but could just be early LH IIIAi. Among the other material, profiles survive of a rounded alabastron (3292) decorated with the LH IIB version of rock pattern,191 and of the ring-handled cup FS 237, one of the hall-marks of LH IIB.192 There are two monochrome examples of this (3295-3296), and a piece decorated with argonaut inside and wavy band outside (3539); a further small monochrome example is included here (3673) and a decorated one (3672); the interior rosette of the latter is very similar to that found on the Ephyraean goblet,193 another of the hallmarks of LH IIB but not present at Ayios Stephanos. A third definitive feature of this phase, the goblet with rock pattern pendent from the rim, is illustrated by the rim-sherd 3025. The concave base of the krater 3671 suggests a date in LH II rather than LH IIIAi, since the LH IIIAi krater has a torus base;194 large open shapes such as the krater are not usual in LH II, so I date this piece to the second half of the phase. The monochrome goblet 3674 probably also belongs to this period, as its stem is too short and fat for the LH IIIAi goblet195 and its lip too short for those of the earlier Mycenaean phases. It is similar in shape to the linear example 3647. The miniature cup 3298 is unusual in having a high handle on the rim; it belongs to a class of miniature vessels that may begin in LH II A but are most popular in LH IIB.196 The Late Matt Painted pieces 3299 and 3540-3543 are also assigned to this period. The material from the Athens wells demonstrates that this class of pottery continues as late as LH IIB/IIIA1;197 since the pieces are difficult to date out of context, these unstratified pieces could belong to the previous or to the following phase.

(iv) Late Helladic IIIAi (3675-3676; fig. 6.37) There is very little LH IIIAi ; with the exception ofthat dating some floors in Area Beta (fig. 6.20), it is unstratified. Of the four commonest LH IIIAi motifs, stipple, spiral, scale and net,198 spiral is the best represented at Ayios Stephanos, followed by stipple. No closed shape can be restored, but several open ones can be reconstructed on paper, such as the shallow cups 3301, 3555 and 3675, all decorated with stipple. All three examples are idiosyncratic: 3301 has no outer band over the lip and two widely 191 Furumark 104.10, ^2^ fis:, fu.iq. 192 Dickinson 1072, 106. 193 Mountjoy 1986, 48 fig. 54.2. 194 Mountjoy 1986, 60 fig. 70. 195 Mountiov iq86. 6 k fief. 7£. 196 Mountiov 1086, 4Q fiff.

There is obviously much local variation here. The goblet 3676 is also decorated with stipple. The large krater 3648 has the krater rim typical of Ayios Stephanos, with a rounded inner lip instead of the usual everted one;200 this rim- variant continues at the site through all the Mycenaean phases until LH IIIC Early.

(ν) Late Helladic IIIA2 Early (3677-3688; fig. 6.38) The LH IIIA2 material from Ayios Stephanos is of great importance because it belongs to the first half of LH IIIA2, a phase for which there is as yet no stratified settlement deposit from the mainland, the two LH IIIA2 Early domestic assemblages cited by Furumark coming from Qatna and Ayios Iakovos;201 his remaining deposits for this phase come from tombs.202 The pottery from Ayios Stephanos is of further interest because, apart from having parallels in material from Achaia, most of it is a hybrid product combining Mycenaean and Minoan elements.203 In the light of the Minoanising material from the LH I strata at Ayios Stephanos, this feature need not cause surprise; it is not apparent in the LH IIA-IIIAi pottery, but there is very little of this at the site. The LH IIIA2 Early material comes mostly from a large wash deposit in Area Epsilon (3027-3 121), from the stones of the feature ev (3323), and from the interments Beta burial 26 (3338-3339), Lambda burial 14 (3572) and Lambda burial 1 (3573"3575)· The material consists largely of open shapes, especially the kylix FS 256, but a few closed shapes can be restored. Instead of being unpainted or having the usual linear decoration, the jugs and jars are painted monochrome, e.g. the amphorae/hydriae 3028-3029 and the jug 3677; these shapes have a short everted rim. Smaller closed shapes include a cutaway-neck jug (3572) and a small jug of FS 112 (3338), both from burials and both painted monochrome, but with a normal lip. A few sherds from stemmed kraters are present. The rims 3032-3033 have the Ayios Stephanos rounded inner lip and monochrome interior. Two sherds (3206 and 3318) have spirals with a fat outer coil similar to those on the kylix 3051; this is a Cretan version of the motif (see below). Two sherds from the earlier excavations (3678-3679) are decorated with papyrus and flower respectively; the papyrus is fringed with a dotted outline. A dipper is shown (3680) from Beta burial 19; its short everted rim suggests that it belongs to this phase. Many of the open shapes are monochrome, such as the mugs 3034, a large example, and 3035, a small one, and the cylindrical cup 3037. The last two vessels have monochrome parallels from Achaia.204 The kylikes nearly all belong to FS 256, the kylix shape typical of LH IIIA2 Early,205 with a decorative zone that ends at the handle-base, in contrast to that of the LH IIIA2 Late kylix FS 257, where the decorative zone ends lower down the body. They are separated into two groups.206 Group I consists of both the usual FS 256, with a short thickened rim with handles rising above it, an unpainted interior and a banded stem (fig. 6.4), and some examples of FS 257. Group II is a hybrid Minoan/Mycenaean type with a short, fine everted rim, as on the closed shapes, a monochrome interior and a monochrome stem with a few narrow reserved bands (fig. 6.5). The kylikes of this hybrid group correspond to the Minoan kylix except for the stem, which is not hollow, and the handles, which do not rise above the rim. The monochrome interiors and fine everted lips of the examples from Ayios Stephanos are also Minoan characteristics.207 The decoration of the hybrid kylikes from Ayios Stephanos is generally too fragmentary for a full picture of the motif represented to be obtained. However, on the few examples where this is possible the motifs are not the usual Mycenaean ones, but a local adaptation of Mycenaean 199 French 1064, pl. 72a. 1-5, 7-9; Mountjoy 1986, 62-3 fig. 72. 200 Mountioy 1086, 60 fig. 70. 201 Furumark 104.1^ f»6- 7. 202 Furumark 1041b, 56-64. 203 Mountjoy 1987 and 1988. 204 Papadopoulos 1979, 244 fig. 268c, 250 fig. 274a. 205 Mountioy 1086,67. 206 See §1 (iii) above. 207 See Popham 1969, 299-304 for some of the few published Minoan kylikes.</page><page sequence="400">THE LATE HELLADIC POTTERY §8 375 elements and a blending of Mycenaean and Minoan ones; for example, 3051 has spirals with a fat outer coil (as also the kraters 3206 and 3318 above) paralleled on an example from the Dictaean Cave.208 This is not a LH IIIA2 Mycenaean spiral. Again, 3048 is decorated with a horizontal Mycenaean flower; unusually, it has a fringe of dots edging the leaves and stem (the papyrus on the krater 3678, discussed above, has a similar fringe). This is not a Minoan feature in LM IIIA but seems to be a local one: whorl-shells on a krater from Melathria are comprehensively fringed.209 Four pieces from the earlier excavations are included here to fill out the corpus, 3681-3682 both with stems, 3683 with chevrons and 3684 with flower; all have a monochrome interior, and the three rim-sherds exhibit the fine everted lip typical of Ayios Stephanos. Monochrome painting is used as much on open shapes as on closed ones. There are many kylikes, mostly FS 264 and 267, but some FS 266 are present (figs. 6.6-6.7); these shapes are unpainted elsewhere until LH IIIC.210 There are also many monochrome basins (fig. 6.7), including a three- legged type (3087-3088) as well as linear examples; two of these are included here (3685-3686), having blobs on the rim and being linear in and out. 3326 is a similar example; there is a parallel on a cup from Achaia.211 Monochrome bowls and ring-based kraters also appear (fig. 6.8); there is a good parallel to 3108 from Achaia, also monochrome,212 which is dated to LH IIIB but need not be so late. Stemmed bowls are generally monochrome or decorated with wavy band (fig. 6.8), but other motifs may be used, such as the chevron (3687). Minoan influence is also reflected in some of the cups. 3039 with pendent semi-circles with fill is a Minoan import; it has the fine everted rim and monochrome interior of LM IIIA cups.213 Two cups (3573-3574) from Lambda burial 1 are hybrids. 3573 has a Minoan shape214 with its deep globular body and wide low base; its monochrome paint is not a Minoan feature, however, but one local to Ayios Stephanos. 3574 compares to LM IIIA2 examples in shape,215 but the 2.5 cm band over the rim is also a local feature; it appears again on a cup (3560) that also has a Minoan shape, and on a basin (3084). Another monochrome cup with a Minoan shape is 3334; it has parallels from Knossos.216 The askos 3339 from Beta burial 26 has very wide bands that could be a local feature, since askoi are normally decorated with many narrow bands.217 The stemmed bowl 3567 has a similar fat wavy line. This bowl also seems to have a monochrome lower body, a feature shared by an example from the Menelaion;218 this is not a normal Mycenaean method of decoration at this time, and may also be local to Laconia. A small selection of unpainted LH IIIA2 is shown from the wash deposit in Area Epsilon (3111- 3117, fig. 6.9), with a further piece from the earlier excavations (3688); the fine everted rim typical of Ayios Stephanos can be seen on this piece and on the dipper 3114, the carinated kylix 3116 and the rounded kylix 3337, but other LH IIIA2 pieces have the normal lipped rim, such as 3115 and 3571.

Most of the sherds belong to open shapes, but there is one fairly complete closed shape, a jug (3340); it has a thickened and unusually incurving lip. Another closed shape present is the small hydria FS 1 29 (3342); this specimen is decorated with a very elaborate hybrid flower flanked by antithetic whorl-shells, with barred bodies instead of the usual dots, and with lozenge fill; this shape often has a pierced base.219 A sherd from a piriform jar (3123) is decorated with the small scale found in LH IIIB; the curve of the section below the shoulder suggests that the stirrup jar sherd 3689 belongs to the piriform FS 167.220 Three stemmed krater sherds decorated with flower (3343-3345) all have a monochrome interior, as does the sherd decorated with whorl-shell (3690). The latter has large thick dots similar to those on the LH IIIA2 flower (3048); however, since it is not diagonal, as the LH IIIA2 whorl-shell generally is, and does not have dots around the head in the manner of an example from Melathria,221 it is assigned to this phase. The miniature dipper 3691 has the usual dotted rim and also a barred handle. The best- represented shape is the kylix: it is generally decorated with whorl-shell (3126, 3128, 3349-3351 and 3576-3578), but there are also examples with flower (3127, 3348 and 3692), sometimes in combination with whorl-shell (3579). There is one example of a Zygouries kylix (3352), one of the hallmarks of LH IIIB 1.222 Deep bowls, the commonest LH IIIB shape elsewhere,223 are scarce or difficult to recognise: 3353-3354 are decorated with hybrid flower and whorl-shell respectively, and 3130 is a fine example with a bird. 3131 has horizontal whorl-shells and should, therefore, be LH IIIA2, but the bodies are disintegrated, which suggests a later date. The stemmed bowl 3693 has U pattern and possibly a chequer panel. Only two pieces of LH IIIB2 can be recognised: 3133, a cup with triangular patch with the edge of a rosette and a monochrome interior, and 3134, a deep bowl probably belonging to Group B,224 also decorated with triangular patch.

It was found in the porch of the 'megaron' and further N.226 The excavator suggests that the porch was rebuilt at this time using the 219 Biegen 1037, fig· 200.702. 220 Mountiov 1086. iof; fier. 12*7.2. 221 Demakopoulou iQ77, pl. ioz. 222 Mountjoy 1986, 93. 223 Wardle 1073, 305-6. 224 Wardle 1073, 315-17. 225 Tavlour 1072. 2AA-6. 226 Taylour 1972, 244.</page><page sequence="403">378 P.

This is normally a feature of LH IIIC Late and Submycenaean, but its context does not allow 3695 to be dated so late.228 The linear collar-necked jar 3696 and the deep bowl with zigzag 3697 are canonical LH IIIC Early types. The monochrome interior and bell shape of the latter confirm its date; there are parallels to its decoration from the recent excavations at Tiryns.229 Two unpainted pieces are included. 3698 belongs to FS 1 1 1, a LH IIIC shape.230 The carinated kylix 3699 has the flaring concave upper body with lipless rim that can also be associated with LH IIIC.231 Amphoriskos FS 59 (fig. 6.39) 3695.

Apart from 3695, discussed above, pieces from three other amphoriskoi can be recognised. Two of them, 3701- 3702, are both decorated with wavy lines; the latter has a narrow decorated zone and seems to have a monochrome body in the manner of 3695. The third, 3700, is decorated with semi-circles with small blobs above; the ornament is drawn with fine narrow lines, unusual for Mycenaean decoration. A rare example of FS 62, the amphoriskos with vertical handles (3593), comes from the LH IIIC floor in Area Lambda / Beta 12; it too is decorated with wavy line. The collar-necked jar 3703, like 3696, has two vertical handles high on the shoulder instead of on the belly as is usual.232 Two other fragments can be recognised, 3357 decorated with tassels or an early form of necklace and 3135 with joined quirk: both are local variations of the motifs. One straight-sided alabastron can be restored on paper (3704); it belongs to FS 98, the uncommon type with handles beginning on the lower body instead of on the shoulder. This type of alabastron first appears in the Transitional phase; its decoration, hybrid flower, is an earlier motif. Unusually, its sides are not painted.233 A sherd from the same shape (3136) is decorated with fringe. Two sherds with added white paint (3705-3706) are possibly from hydriae; they are assigned to this shape rather than to the amphora because the latter is not normally decorated, but linear. The use of added white paint first appears in LH IIIC Middle,234 but would seem to have begun earlier at Ayios Stephanos. There is an almost complete linear stirrup jar (3707), and a sherd from another example (3708); its decoration indicates that blobs by themselves or as fringes continue to be popular at Ayios Stephanos; its filled loop, similar to those on 3195, is an antithetic spiral derivative. The rhyton 3709 is assigned to this phase from context, but LH IIIC rhyta are very rare, and it is probably a LH IIIA2 survival. Open shapes are much better represented than closed shapes. The stemmed krater can be recognised in sherd material from its tall everted rim, often the Ayios Stephanos version with a rounded inner lip (3583 and 3710-3712) and straight upper body. 3710 is dated to LH IIIC and not to LH IIIB because the hybrid flower is disintegrated and the whorl-shell rather spindly and short of coils, in contrast to LH IIIB whorl-shells.235 The very thick section of this sherd might suggest that it belongs to the ring-based krater FS 282, which normally has a thicker section than that of FS 9, but the tall rim suggests the stemmed type. 3713 has an extraordinary decoration for which I can find no parallel; it is too incomplete for the whole motif to be made out. A linear mug is illustrated (3140) and a small linear cup (3714); two pieces possibly from cups are shown (3715-3716). These have a shallow body that would better fit the shape of the rounded kylix, but this shape is not decorated in LH IIIC. The small dipper 3141 is unusually painted with wavy band. The dipper 3594 has a barred handle, while 3361 has diagonal stripes. An example of FS 242 is published (3142). 3717 is the canonical LH IIIC kylix FS 274, but it has an uncanonical slight lip to the rim. Three other examples of FS 274 are 3145, a large one, 3146 and 3595. All have a monochrome interior and unpainted exterior except for a rim-band; the stems are presumably monochrome.236 An almost complete ring-based krater FS 282 (3718) from a LH IIIC floor is illustrated, as are some sherds (3147-3152, 3362-3364 and 3719-3722). The most interesting is 3719, decorated with a man possibly carrying a fish; 3720-3721 both have fringed main motifs, as does 3362, and 3722 is decorated with chequer panel, a popular decoration at this site. The rim 3149 is thick, flattened and down-sloping; 3152 is decorated with panel and bow-tie fringe, another local motif. The best idea of the LH IIIC range of motifs at Ayios Stephanos is gained from the deep bowls, the commonest shape in this phase. A good number from the early excavations are illustrated here and more in fig. 6.44, to show the local variations. Very few pieces do not have a monochrome interior. Some sherds have a second wide band below the interior rim (3153, 3736); this is a LH IIIC Early feature at Tiryns.237 The second outer rim-band on such sherds as 3159-3161, 3164 and 3179 is also a feature of LH IIIC Early.238 Some profiles can be partially restored on paper: 3723 has stemmed spirals, 3213 and 3725 both have panel, and 3212 has joining semi-circles below a very deep rim- band, as does 3731; the lower edge of the decorative zone of 3212 is present, showing it to have been unusually narrow; 3370 with wavy lines and 3737 with zigzag are similar examples. Linear profiles present are 3726 with a very wide belly band, 3728 with a dotted rim, 3727 and 3729; the latter has 232 Bletren 1021, 68 fie. 08. 233 Mountjoy iqqq, 1 283. 234 See Ponham and Milburn 10^1. ni. kq.6. 235 Mountjoy 1976, pl. 13c. 236 For parallels from Lefkandi Phase 1 see Popham and Milburn 10,71, 3^ fig. 1.2. 237 Podzuweit 1078, 47R fig. 28.6, 8, 12. 238 Podzuweit 1978, 490 fig. 38 column 4.</page><page sequence="405">38o P.

Scale 1:3. a reserved band below the interior rim, a feature that begins at Lefkandi in Phase 2 a239 but is obviously earlier here (it is the only example from the site). Some of the deep bowls are unusually large, as is shown by comparison of 3724 with 3725, which is of normal size. These large bowls are thick-walled and generally have two or three thick belly bands instead of the usual single medium band or fine line group (3725). Body-sherds belonging to this larger type include 3231, 3374-3376 and 3750. The deep bowl motifs follow the LH IIIC pattern, in that spiral and panel patterns and narrow horizontal patterns are common, but there is also much local variation; unfortunately most sherds are too fragmentary to allow a reconstruction of the complete motif. Fourteen groups of local variants on motifs can be isolated at Ayios Stephanos; although found on all the shapes, they are mostly taken from deep bowls. These motifs are illustrated and discussed below (fig. 6.44). Three kalathos sherds are published (3185-3187), large basin sherds (3188-3190) and three shallow angular bowls (3191-3192 and 3752). The latter all have a monochrome interior, whereas in the Argolid the shape has linear decoration inside.240 No complete stemmed bowl is present, but two half-profiles (3753-3754) can be restored on paper, and a number of sherds can be assigned to this shape. A group of rims is isolated (3193-3196, 3221, 33785 3592, 3753 and 3755-3756), which have a thick rim-band of 1-2 cm instead of the usual stemmed bowl decoration of a second outer band below the rim; the thickened lip, which is a criterion of the stemmed bowl, is present. The diameter may be as large as 25 cm. The thickened lip suggests that these rims do indeed belong to stemmed bowls, but one cannot exclude the possibility that they come from large deep bowls. The linear piece 3754 is assigned to this shape on the criterion of its heavy everted rim, but it could also be from an uncanonical deep bowl. The only recognisable LH IIIC monochrome shape is the carinated kylix FS 267 (3143-3144)· Unusually, no sherds can be assigned to the monochrome deep bowl, so common elsewhere. Unpainted pottery dated securely to this phase comes only from the LH IIIC floors in Area Lambda / Beta 1 2 (the cup 3596 and bowl 3597) and from the deposit in Area Delta (the kylix 3699). 239 Popham and Milburn 1971, 340. 240 Mountjoy 1986, 153 fig. 197.1.</page><page sequence="406">THE LATE HELLADIC POTTERY §8 381 Amphoriskos FS 59 (fig. 6.40) 3700.

Since then I have spent considerable time at Corinth working with Roman, Byzantine and Frankish pottery, and at Sparta on Byzantine and Frankish, but have not been able to incorporate more than some of the information gathered from this experience into this Chapter. I would like to thank Dr Charalambos Bakirtzis for permitting me to read his unpublished dissertation, and Dr Κ. W. Slane for constructive criticism of this paper and for her extensive support. Special thanks are due to Jan Motyka Sanders for her help with the drawings and for reading drafts of the text. [Editor's note: I have added in square brackets a few pieces that have stratigraphie significance; these have not been studied by the author.] 1. INTRODUCTION The Medieval remains at Ayios Stephanos, including part of a house, the outer wall of its courtyard with a bench built along one corner of it, a drain and a bothros, began to be uncovered in 1959 (see Chapter 3 above); at the time they were deemed to date from either the Turkokratia or the Late Roman period. Large quantities of broken stamnoi and some glazed pottery were also found. In 1977 the area was further explored, revealing the lower walls of a building, Structure Lambda VII, which was at first thought to be the Medieval antecedent of the chapel of Ayios Stephanos.1 Despite a recent attempt to portray the settlement as an entrepôt trading in Constantinopolitan ceramics during the 10th century,2 the site and its material culture are not only much later but also considerably humbler. The walls and material culture on the hillock probably represent the remains of a short- lived, late 13th to early 14th century rural domicile. Only the lower walls of the house and court were preserved; the upper walls must originally have consisted of mudbrick or even wattle and daub. The walls were built with founded piers, connected by stretches of rough walling laid directly on the ground surface. Inside, the floor was much abraded and covered with a thick layer of lime, which had washed from the walls. The building probably had either two storeys or even one storey with a mezzanine, with accommodation for animals below and for humans above. After its desertion the plaster peeled off the walls, and the beams and reeds of the roof rotted and collapsed inwards, bringing down a mass of roof tiles. The unprotected mud or wattle of the upper walls then disintegrated, leaving only the stone socles standing. Although it concerns a single-storied structure, the description of a cottage at the Kalivia of Feniki (modern Asopos), in which Leake lodged for one night in 1805, is enlightening: The house is constructed, in the usual manner, of mud, with a coating of plaster; the roof is thatched, which is not a very common mode of covering the cottages of Greece. There is a raised earthen semicircle at one end for the fire, without any chimney; towards the other, a low partition, formed of the same material as the walls, separates the part of the building destined for the family from that which is occupied by the oxen and asses used on the farm, one door serving for both apartments. The usual articles of furniture of a Greek cottage are ranged, or hung, around, namely, a loom, barrel-shaped wicker baskets, plastered with mud, for holding corn, a sieve, spindles, some copper cooking-vessels, and two lyres. The floor is bare earth covered, like the walls, with a coat of dried mud. An oven [is] attached to the outside of the building . . .3 In a later passage Leake remarks that the houses at Leimonas, south of Skala, are made of mud and wicker.4 1 See Chapter s §4 above. 2 Armstrong 1996, n. 90. 3 Leake 1830, 1 222-3. 4 Leake 1830, 1 232. 389</page><page sequence="414">39O G. D. R. SANDERS The construction of Structure Lambda VII can be dated by the pottery in the foundation trenches of the piers. This is all late 13th century, as the associated coin of Charles I of Anjou confirms.5 Its destruction can be dated by pottery and coins on the floor inside, sealed under the fallen roof-tiles. The pottery probably fell with the floor of the room above, although the coins perhaps fell through cracks in the floorboards. Both pottery and coins6 date the abandonment to c. 1325-35. There is no archaeological indication of what caused the desertion, but these were violent times. The Catalan mercenaries, who had based themselves in Athens, raided widely in the Aegean and along the coasts of the Péloponnèse in the 1320s, and the Turkish admiral Umur of Ay din attacked the settlements of the Laconian gulf and the Sparta plain in 1334.7 If the Catalan raids spared segments of the population in the coastal area, many of the survivors doubtless fell victim to malaria and the Black Death, or fled, never to return.8 The finds from Ayios Stephanos are interesting for various reasons. The locally-produced ceramics are limited to plain wares, and it seems that the production of glazed pottery had become a specialty of centralised workshops, perhaps foreign rather than regional. A similar pattern has been noted at Corinth, where, in the later 13th century contexts, a majority of the pottery consists of Italian and other imports.9 The glazed pottery is very fine, and most, if not all, is of Italian origin. There is some sgraffito of types corresponding to that built into the late 13th century church of Ayios Demetrios at Krokeai.10 Other sgraffito was imported from northern Italy. A most important find is an Archaic Majolica jug from Tuscany in central Italy. Local stamnoi are very common in local and Spartan fabrics, while some small imported amphorae for wine or oil are rather less common; one of the latter, in a marl fabric, may have come from the northern or western Péloponnèse. The ceramic assemblage is similar to those of Sparta and Methone but very different from that of Corinth. This latter material also shows strong Italian contacts, but with Venice and the Kingdom of Naples, whereas the material from Ayios Stephanos seems to reflect contact with the central Italian states. As at Sparta, the cooking pots do not conform to central Greek fashions such as those at Corinth. Instead of the usual standardised wheel-made forms, Laconians seem to have preferred handmade cooking pots with a very coarse fabric, perhaps because they did not break so easily in the fire. The shapes are reminiscent of earlier 'Slavic' styles, perhaps still being made and traded by the Hellenized descendants of the Melings and Ezeritoi.11 2. POTTERY STUDIES IN THE PELOPONNESE Until comparatively recently, much of the existing literature on Medieval pottery in southern Greece was provided by the publication of finds at Corinth.12 This material was supplemented by less comprehensive sources, including Sparta,13 Kythera14 and the Argolid,15 and by small but valuable assemblages from Nichoria16 and Methone,17 both in Messenia. Since the late 1980s there has been a spate of new material from Corinth,18 as well as from excavations in Sparta and Laconia.19 In addition, data has been published from surface surveys in Laconia,20 central Arcadia21 and western Corinthia.22 Many problems exist with incorrect identifications and erroneous chronology, which require urgent attention. New publications on Corinthian contexts should help resolve chronological problems for many 9Ü1 to 14th century ceramics,23 and planned publications will redress the heavy bias in favour of glazed over unglazed ceramics. As it stands, however, much of the survey data being produced is giving a distorted or erroneous picture of the development of settlement patterns and of the rural economy, partly through the misidentification of finds and partly through possible misinterpretation of their relevance. It is generally held that settlements and population increased in the middle Byzantine period but, following Blake,24 one may suggest that we are merely seeing an increase in wares that were cheaply produced and marketed in the countryside for the first time. Corinthian contexts suggest that, in that regionally important city, glazed pottery makes up no more Manko 1982, 188. 6 See Chapter 1 1 § 1 1 below. 7 Zakythinos 107*, ι 181. 8 See further Chapter 14. §fl (ii) below. 9 Sanders 1087. 10 Sanders 1080. 11 Sanders 'QQ^b 12 Morgan 1042; MacKay 1067. 13 Dawkins and Droop 1 q 1 1 b. 14 Coldstream and Huxley 1972, 175-7. 15 Pierart and Thalmann 1080. 16 Rosser 1983. 17 Pallas 1068. 18 Sanders 1987, 1995a and 2000; Williams and Zervos 1987, 1-46; 1988, 95-146; 1990, 285-369; 1991, 1-58; 1992, 133- 01; 1QQ3, 1-52; 1QQ4-, i-*6; loo*, 1-60; iqq6, 1-56. 19 Armstrong 1992; Etzeoglou 1989; Sanders 1989, 1993, 1995^; Vassi 1993. 20 Armstrong iq8q and iqq6. 21 Pikoulas 19880; Forsén, Forsén and Lavento 1996. 22 Sutton 1QQ0. 23 Sanders 1QQ50, 2000. 24 Blake 1978.</page><page sequence="415">THE MEDIEVAL POTTERY §4 391 than 0.7% by weight of 10th and nth century contexts, rising to about 2% in the early 12th century, 6% in the mid- to late 12th century and about 20% in mid- 13th century deposits.25 Since survey relies heavily on the published record of stratified pottery for dating, it necessarily identifies many more later sites than early ones. Documentation of pottery from rural settlements like Ayios Stephanos is rare. The site seems to have been a small hamlet, isolated farmstead or wayside inn, similar in some respects to a structure in Elis, dating to the 12th or perhaps early 13th century.26 The discovery of early 14th century strata at Ayios Stephanos provides us with an assemblage to which we can compare surface finds from survey, and with a useful corpus of coarse ware shapes and fabrics. 3. THE EXCAVATIONS Evidence for post-Roman occupation at Ayios Stephanos came to light in the first season of the excavation. In 1959 two trenches were opened on the top of the hill in Area Gamma. In one a drain, two walls and two pits were uncovered, while in the other a rubble-covered floor and the walls of a structure were found. These features were tentatively dated to the 19th century, the Turkish period, or perhaps earlier.27 In 1963, in Trial Trench IV on the Ε side of the hill, a remarkable number of fragments of 'modern' pottery were found in the surface layers;28 Area Alpha and Trial Trench VII on top of the hill also contained pottery. From these earlier excavations only a small, three-quarters preserved jug and some small finds were published;29 because of its apparently late date, practically no pottery was kept. The resumption of excavations in 1973-77 fed to the discovery of more sherd material and of the remains of a substantial structure, which together have clarified the nature of the later occupation of the site. In 1973 an almost complete amphora (4017, fig. 7.10) was uncovered in Area Zeta. This was tentatively dated to the 7th century, despite its association with a number of glazed sherds with a red fabric that suggested a date of at least the late 10th century or probably later.30 In 1977, excavation in Area Lambda 3/4 revealed the remains of the building with which the rubble, surface and pits in the adjacent Area Nu / Gamma were associated. In the rubble from the collapse of this structure a second amphora (4073, fig. 7.10), which is similar to that from Zeta, an Archaic Majolica jug (4053, fig. 7.2), and many sherds of locally produced Taffy Ware were found. Sherds of both types of amphora and of Taffy Ware were found in all the major deposits of later material on the site; this supports the evidence of the glazed wares that these deposits were roughly contemporary and that the Medieval occupation was of short duration. 4. CHRONOLOGY There is considerable evidence for dating the bulk, if not all, of the material very late in the 1 3th or early in the 14th century, particularly in and around Structure Lambda VII. There are a number of sherds reminiscent of Zeuxippus Ware (4025, 4027, 4049, 4055, 4057, 4064 and 4080, fig. 7.1), of which only rare examples may safely be called such. Although the Zeuxippus Ware family was thought to have been found exclusively in early 1 3th century contexts,31 fragments of certain varieties have been found in secure late 13th century deposits at Corinth, where they are called Late Sgraffito or Glossy Ware,32 and built into late 1 3th century churches.33 In addition to these 1 3th century wares, a slightly worn billon denier of Charles I of Anjou, Prince of Achaia from 1 278 to 1 285, was found in a context predating, or perhaps contemporary with, the construction of the building. Numismatic evidence for the period of occupation of the structure was also recovered from nearby Area Beta. Three billon deniers minted in the reigns of Isabella de Villehardouin (1297-1301), Philip of Taranto (1307-13) and Maud of Hainault (1313-21) were found in the upper layers of Area Beta, in association with much poorly stratified pottery of the same type as that found in Area Lambda.34 Earlier occupation on the site may be attested by two small deposits, that below the floor of Structure Lambda VII and the floor deposit in Area Zeta, as well as by sherds surviving into later deposits.

Stray finds (4051, 4101, fig. 7.5) of a matt painted closed vessel type, called Geometric Ware, may also belong to the late 1 2th century, but at Sparta this type certainly lasts well into the 13th century.37 This ware, from macroscopic examination of imports of known provenance such as Rouletted/Veneto Ware, appears to have been imported from the northern Adriatic. 35 Morgan 1042, 8*. 36 Unpublished work by Dr W.

Scale 1:3. The matt painted jug 4002 (fig. 7.6) from the floor in Area Zeta is conceivably late 12th century, but better parallels exist with the late 1 3th century pieces at Corinth.38 Thus the evidence of both the pottery and the coins indicates that Structure Lambda VII was built and occupied for a short period, perhaps only for the first third of the 14th century. The other major deposit, that in Area Zeta, can be dated only by similarities between the plain wares common to both. In both there are numerous sherds of matt-decorated Taffy Ware stamnoi, a ware found only in the very latest of the 12th to 14th century deposits at Sparta.39 In Area Lambda, substantial fragments of an amphora (4040) of the same type as those found in Zeta were found in the tumble. It is reasonable to assume from these common elements, and from the shape of 4017 (fig. 7.10), that the pit in Zeta also dates to the early 14th century and followed a late 13th century phase. 38 Williams and Zervos 1992, no. 32 and 145-9, pi· 3^ί&gt; g and h. 39 Sanders 1993, 268 and 283-4, contexts 2002, 1051 and 2008.</page><page sequence="418">394 G· D· R· SANDERS The most important deposits excavated were in Areas Lambda, Gamma and Nu, deriving from the remains of the rectangular Structure Lambda VII with its associated walled yard. The yard and the floor of the building were so compacted and eroded by use that the surface, as found, was below the level of the original ground surface marked by the bottom of the partition walls. Into this surface pits and post-holes had been excavated, whereas above it there was a disturbed interface layer containing material belonging both to the occupation period and to the preceding period. When the structure was destroyed, tiles slipped from the roof onto the surface of the yard, and white lime plaster washed from the walls onto the surface inside the structure, on top of which more tiles fell. Finally the walls collapsed, covering the immediate area with boulders mixed with broken tiles. The pre-structure level can be dated by fragments of Geometric Ware pottery and Green and Brown painted ware to no earlier than the latter part of the 12th to early 13th century. The occupation, dated by the coin of Charles I of Anjou that was found in the disturbed interface layer of the yard, perhaps began before the third quarter of the 1 3th century and ended, to judge by the amphora and Archaic Majolica jug in the tumble, as well as by the concentration of later coins, soon after the first quarter of the 14th century. In Area Zeta, stubs of walls of a late 1 3th century structure were uncovered. Associated with these was a floor, on which fragments of a matt-painted jug were found. Into the floor was cut a deep pit, which contained fragments of pottery contemporary, or nearly so, with the occupation in Area Lambda. In Area Beta no stratified deposits were apparent; but at least some of the walls, which must have stood above ground level during the period of occupation, may be Medieval. The fill in this Area contained large quantities of glazed and plain wares, as well as coins of the early 14th century. The amphorae and the imported jug types can both be closely paralleled and dated. The amphora (4073, fig. 7.10) found in the debris of Structure Lambda VII is of similar shape but of different fabric from that from Area Zeta (4017, fig. 7.10). The former closely resembles amphorae found in underwater contexts off the Adriatic coast, which have been dated to between the gth and 12 th centuries.40 One amphora was found with ballast stones in a few metres of water off the east coast of the island of Vela Arta close to the island of Murter. A little more than half-preserved, it has an elongated, wheel-ridged cylindrical body and high-swung handles that join the short neck just below the rim.41 The second amphora is in the collection of the Franciscan monastery of Krapani, an islet close to the island of Hvar. It was given to the monastery by sponge divers; although the provenance is unknown, it probably comes from somewhere in the eastern Adriatic. This almost complete amphora stands c. 45 cm tall and has a wheel-ridged, narrow cylindrical body with high-swung handles joining at the lip.42 The date assigned by Brusic is certainly too early for the examples from Ayios Stephanos. Better dated is a twin of these in the Museum of Mistra near Sparta. This piece, and another like it, were found built into the angle of the dome and into an arch of the church of Afendiko of the Brontochion Monastery at Mistra.43 The amphora, c. 35 cm tall, is contemporary with the construction of the church, which began before 1311, probably in 1310.44 Five identical amphorae were recently found in a pit at Corinth; these were dated by the excavator to the second decade of the 14th century.45 Another specimen from Corinth may be late 13th century,46 and a typologically similar amphora with a pronounced rim from a well in the Athenian Agora may, to judge from the associated glazed ware, be mid- 12th century.47 The jug 4053 (fig. 7.2) is very similar to three pieces in Corinth,48 all of which have bichrome decoration of manganese purple and a copper-based blue on a tin-glaze background. The jug catalogued by Morgan is comparable in shape to that from Ayios Stephanos. It has a design of dotted scales and chevrons within registers defined by vertical lines, all executed in manganese; the decoration is highlighted with added blue circles. Unfortunately Morgan did not illustrate it, nor did he assign it to any class, though it properly belongs to his Group II, Archaic Majolica. Morgan dates the piece by context to no later than the 14th century,49 while Williams dates all three to immediately before the Catalan sack of Corinth in 1312.50 All three have parallels in northern and central Italy. In the Civic Museum in Montalcino, for instance, there are a number of tin-glazed jugs decorated with manganese and blue or green, and with buff to salmon-pink fabric. Their form is identical to that of the jugs from Corinth and Ayios Stephanos, since they have a globular body on a pedestal base with a trefoil mouth and a strap-handle. Most stand between 19 cm and 27 cm tall. These pots were built into the vaults of 40 BrUSiC IO76. A2-9&gt;. 41 Brusic 1076, pls.

FABRICS (i) Glazed Wares The fragmentary condition of the glazed pottery limits the discussion of forms and wares. In addition to small fragments of Metallic Ware, the remains of a number of bowls of Late Sgraffito/Zeuxippus Class Ib/Glossy Ware were found. These generally have a red or reddish-yellow fabric (often with sparkling inclusions) and a white or pale pink slip, and are covered with a thick, glossy yellow or pale green glaze. The slip and glaze never cover much of the outside of the vessel, and the decoration is typically limited to a simple incised line inside at the centre of the bowl or on its lip. This ware is relatively common in late 13th and early 14th century deposits at Corinth.54 A bowl from the pit in Area Zeta (4004, fig. 7.1) is similar in many respects to Glossy Ware but lacks the incised decoration and has a relatively angular shape. It has a parallel from Methone.55 There are a number of unusual wares at Ayios Stephanos. The Archaic Majolica jug 4053 (fig. 7.2), imported from central or northern Italy, is paralleled in Greece only at Corinth, as is a single sherd of Olive-Brown Ware, 4078 (fig. 7.1).56 There are also fragments of wares that have not been reported at other sites. These include three sherds with a dark grey, almost black glaze (4023, fig. 7.1), three rims with a dusky red decoration on a background of red slip (4026, 4046 and 4082, fig. 7.1), some incised slip-painted body-sherds (4027 and 4065, fig. 7.1), varieties of Green and Brown Painted Ware (e.g. 4006, 4047 and 4088, fig. 7.2) not described by Morgan,57 and two fragments of a unique character (4008 and 4011, fig. 7.1). The commonest shapes are finely potted bowls with almost vertical walls and very narrow offset lips or a sloping body with plain rim and rounded lip. Bases tend to be low, simple ring-bases. Fragments of plain glazed jugs were also found. (ii) Plain Wares (a) TAFFY WARE (FABRIC l) This fabric was christened Taffy Ware' by John Younger because of its resemblance to 'salt-water taffy', a soft, silky confection popular in New England and similar to British 'rock'. The fabric is fine, with a distinct grain to the core that runs parallel to the surface. The surface, smooth and soapy to the touch, has a silky sheen caused by minute sparkling inclusions in the clay. Generally the biscuit is softly fired, and the laminar breaks are easily worn. The colour varies greatly from pot to pot, and even from place to place on the same vessel, depending on the extent and evenness of firing. It ranges from pink (Munsell 5YR 7/4) through reddish-yellow (7.5 YR 7/6) to very pale brown (10YR 8/4), with higher hue values belonging to harder-fired examples. This fabric is known in small quantities from recent excavations at Sparta, where it has not been found in strata earlier than those of the mid- 13th to early 14th century;58 1 have noted a single fragment from the late 13th to early 14th century complex excavated by Charles Williams at Corinth. Although Armstrong does not describe the fabric, it is clear from her discussion that she equates it with Constantinopolitan White Ware. On the strength of this association, she assumes that Ayios Stephanos was importing Constantinopolitan plain wares in the 1 ith century.59 Although the colour range of this type of fabric overlaps with that of Constantinopolitan White Wares, colour alone is a poor measure, since it varies with firing temperature and atmosphere. Table 7.1, derived from fairly detailed macroscopic descriptions of White Wares60 and of Taffy Ware, shows that the Constantinopolitan products are harder, lack the characteristic laminar break and have a small number of a variety of large inclusions, 51 Blake iq8o» 02-* fies. 2-*. 52 Bertacci 107 s. ol. 4. fies. 1-2. 53 Prinele 1084., 100 fie. o no. 87. 54 MacKay 1067, 2*2-4; Sanders 1087, 10s. 55 Pallas 1068, no. 10*. 56 Cf.

Scale 1:3. whereas Taffy Ware has a lustrous sheen generated by the tiny sparkling inclusions in it. Except for the obvious differences in appearance, there is no evidence from controlled, stratigraphie excavations that Taffy Ware predates the mid- 13th century. In fact, there is hard evidence to the contrary. Approximately half of all sherds saved from the Medieval levels were Taffy Ware, and most of these belonged to a distinctive 'stamnos' shape. Rims of simple bowls (e.g. 4028-4030 and 4068, fig. 7.4) and, more rarely, fragments of glazed vessels are also represented (e.g. 4009 and 4010, fig. 7.2). The fabric is generally so soft and the breaks so worn that no whole shapes could be assembled. The appearance of the predominant form can be approximated, and is illustrated in a pastiche of large sherds from different parts of the site (fig. 7.3). A typical Taffy Ware stamnos is piriform and stands about 40 cm tall. The neck is short and the mouth oval with a plain vertical rim. From the number of handles found, two broad, vertical strap- handles attached to the shoulder and at or just below the lip are assumed. The plain, flat base has vertical sides and is usually heavily constructed. The outside surface is smooth and is either covered with a thin matt grey or matt red wash, or decorated with broad, randomly applied lines of wash. Sometimes the handles are incised with zigzag lines (e.g. 4069, fig. 7.3), and occasionally the neck has a plastically rendered zigzag running vertically (e.g. 4035). Inside there are pronounced wheel-ridges, small and narrow at the neck but becoming broader and heavier towards the base. Stamnoi have not yet been identified in print at Corinth, though doubtless they exist. At Nichoria, bases identified as possibly belonging to jugs, and an amphora-neck and handle, may conceivably be from stamnoi of the 12th or 13th centuries.61 An early 14th century stamnos with an ovoid body and 61 Rosser 1983, fig. 10.18, 19, 23 and 75.</page><page sequence="421">THE MEDIEVAL POTTERY §5 397 jÁ' IP '. 4062 / te' 1 40 1 3 1 [j^f 406 1 V__L^4067 ' ^' ^ '___MEM 4032 L___IBI^B 4070 I I JJ 4083 ' -M ^ I /4028 ' ^V«33 ^ I -J™ ' -J ^ I /4O3O Fig. 7.4.

Stamnoi were probably used exclusively for the storage and portage of liquids, particularly wine, water and olive oil. It is conceivable that they also served as transport vessels, eventually replacing the 62 Orlandos ιοακ. 2O4 ni. 6. 63 Sanders 1993. 64 Bakirtzis 1989, 138-45 pls. 25-6.</page><page sequence="422">398 G.

The fabric is so common at Ayios Stephanos that it may have been locally produced. The riverine deposits of the Eurotas have a high content of fine sparkling silt, comparable to the clay of Taffy Ware. The prevalence of the stamnos at Ayios Stephanos suggests that the site may have been somehow involved in the production, storage or transport of various liquids, probably wine and oil. (b) fabric 2 The second most common fabric is that of the amphora found in Area Zeta (4017, fig. 7.10). This accounts for about 20% of all the sherds kept from the Medieval levels and was particularly common in Areas Beta and Zeta. Although much of the material belongs to amphorae and jugs, bowls are also represented. The fabric is fine, hard-fired, and with a smooth surface; it only rarely has inclusions or voids. The colour is usually reddish-yellow (Munsell 5YR 6/6 to 7/6) or pink (7.5YR 7/4), but many of the amphora fragments were lighter in colour, close to very pale brown (10YR 7/3). The range of colours and general appearance suggests that these were made from a marl clay. Such clays are extremely common throughout the Péloponnèse, including Laconia. Although no firm provenance can be suggested, it is likely that these are local. Indeed, isolated hillocks of marl are to be found along the edge of the Helos plain between Skala and Stephaniá, and more extensive beds border the ε side of the plain from Phlisio (see fig. 13.1) to well south of Asterio. The amphorae have pronounced wheel-ridges on both the interior and exterior. The ridges on the outside have sometimes been flattened or pared with a sharp tool. Where present, the surface decoration of the amphorae is of matt red or grey wash lines. The amphorae are ovoid, with a short neck and flat</page><page sequence="423">THE MEDIEVAL POTTERY §5 399 y^ ^' a b 11 ab Fig. 7.6. Medieval pottery. Matt-painted Ware: pitcher 4002. Scale 1:3. loop-handles attached at the shoulder and lip. The mouth is oval, and there is no base; rather, the body probably terminated in a point, as does 4073 (fig. 7.10). A finely potted jug (4015, fig. 7.5) has a flaring pedestal base, an ovoid body smooth on the outside and pronounced wheel-ridges on the inside. A decorated jug (4002, fig. 7.6), apparently of this fabric, has a plain flat base with an ovoid body coming up to a short neck and trefoil mouth. The exterior is smooth, and again there are pronounced wheel-ridges on the inside. It is decorated with a linear floral(?) design, rendered in matt brown on a pale self-slipped surface. Piece 4001 (fig. 7.9) has a similar fabric to Fabric 2, but with considerably more inclusions. (c) SPONGY WARE Spongy Ware and varieties of it account for approximately 1 3% of the kept Medieval material. It was found mainly in Areas Beta and Zeta, usually in the lower levels, which contain Medieval glazed sherds. The fabric is coarse and comes in two varieties - with and without large white inclusions. The colour, when not affected by contact with fire, is a light reddish-brown (Munsell 5YR 6/4) or pink (7.5YR 7/4); when burnt, it is generally dark grey (10YR 4/1). The first variety has numerous large white grits, varying from 0.02 to 0.2 cm in size. The second type has a large number of voids, ranging in size from small pin-holes to c. 0.2 cm in diameter. Sometimes this variety has small white inclusions,</page><page sequence="424">4OO G. D. R. SANDERS V -I mm Ao'9 ' 1 ^^4020 ' ^^ma^m^^^mmmJ 4077 Fig. 7.7. Medieval pottery. Cooking Wares: casseroles 4019-4020, 4077. Scale 1:3. leading to the conjecture that cleaning in an acid-bath (the excavators' usual practice) may have created some of the voids. The quality of the fabric depends to some extent on the function of the vessel. Stewpots with handles (e.g. 4022, fig. 7.8) are rather finer than the globular bowls (e.g. 4037- 4039, fig. 7.8) and casseroles (4019-4020, fig. 7.7). A variety of shapes is made in this fabric. The casseroles, between 4 and 7 cm tall, are flat-bottomed, with flaring sides coming to a rounded lip. The bodies of 4019 and 4020 have irregular surfaces; the latter has pronounced ridges, and both have irregular lips. 4077 (fig. 7.7) is better made and deeper. A type of hand-made baggy stewpot was common in Area Beta (e.g. 4037-4039, 4044 and 4098, fig. 7.8). There is no evidence that these had bases, and it is assumed that they were round-bottomed. The body is spherical and thin, turning in towards an irregular, thickened, rounded lip. In many examples there is a moulded ridge just below the lip on the outside. Traces of handles are exceptional, and may as easily be traces of lugs or ledges. Wheel-made bowls of Spongy Ware with handles are also present. They have a spherical body, out-turned rim and a broad strap-handle attached to rim and shoulder. A three-quarters preserved jug, HS 125,65 found in Area Beta in i960 seems, from the description and photograph, to be of Spongy Ware. It has a splaying rim, globular body, flat base and broad strap- handle. It has a coarse black to pink-brown body with a pitted surface. Spongy Ware has also been identified at Nichoria, in two forms: grey in colour with pinholes, and a similar red ware without pinholes. These are assumed by Rosser to date from the late 10th to early 11th centuries, and to have survived into the 13th century.66 12th century Spongy Ware sherds were found in deposit Psi in Tomb H on Kythera.67 A sherd identical to those from Area Beta was found in recently excavated 14th century deposits at Sparta.68 This vessel is one of many handmade pieces from the site.69 Spongy Ware sherds were also recovered from the 1923 excavations in the area of the theatre at Sparta; although these have not been published, they are still stored in Apotheke Delta at Sparta Museum. In discussions of Laconian handmade pottery at Sparta, I have stated that its forms and tradition are 'Slavic'. In justifying this view, which I have not changed subsequently, I have regrettably misrepresented Dr Ε. Etzeoglou's position on the question;70 she considers her handmade ceramic finds from Karyoupolis to be most definitely in a Roman and not a 'Slavic' tradition, and cites parallels from Athens to support her argument.71 65 Taylour 1072, 260, pl. 50e. 66 Rosser 1083, 370, 383. 67 Coldstream and Huxley 1972, 176 nos. 16-18, pl. 50. 68 Sanders 1993, no. 62. 69 Sanders 1003, 277-81; iqqk£. 70 Sanders iqqsi. 27o; and loopik 4.^6. %J *J %J * 1 %J ' %S *S KS ' M.%^ 71 Etzeoglou 1989, 151-6.</page><page sequence="425">THE MEDIEVAL POTTERY §5 401 X'/ ^U Γ ~^^~ " 4037 ' m vV 4039 » ,f 4022 ' •ft 4098 Fig. 7.8.

(d) OTHER FABRICS Of the remaining fabrics only two merit mention in terms of their frequency. One is fine, red (Munsell 2.5YR 5/6) with small sparkling (micaceous) inclusions; the fabric turns grey when burnt. The most complete vessel in this fabric is a jug from the pit in Area Zeta (4014, fig. 7.5). It has an ovoid body, flat base and a vertical strap-handle. The body has been distorted during manufacture, and the fabric burnt to red on the surface and grey in the core and on the inner surface. The second fabric is that of the amphora found in the rubble of Structure Lambda VII (4073, fig. 7.10). Elsewhere only small fragments are found, all apparently from the amphora shape, and these may thus provide valuable evidence for dating. The fabric is fairly fine, hard-fired with numerous, very small, soft, yellow-white lime inclusions. The colour is generally reddish-yellow (Munsell 5YR 7/ 6 to 6/6), fired to pink (5YR 8/4) or grey on the surface. The amphora resembles 4017 (fig. 7.10) but has a thinner body. It has pronounced wheel-ridges inside and out, except in the upper parts and at the tip of the bottom. 6. CATALOGUE The catalogue is arranged by Area. For each Area there is a summary of the Medieval levels excavated and the baskets used. Within each Area the glazed wares are presented first, the plain wares after, starting with vessels registered during the excavation and followed by catalogued sherds. For each catalogue entry there is also a reference to the basket (#) in which the piece was found and, if illustrated, the figure number. Dimensions are in centimeters unless stated. Wherever possible, Munsell soil colour chart references (e.g. 5YR 6/4) have been given to describe fabric, slip, wash and glaze colours, to</page><page sequence="427">THE MEDIEVAL POTTERY §6 403 ensure a standardised description.72 As no analyses were undertaken, 'sparkling' has been used in preference to 'micaceous' when describing reflective particles in the fabrics. For glazed sherds, the extent of the slip and the glaze on the outside of the vessel is shown in the figures by broken and dotted lines respectively. Conventions used to represent different glazes and washes will be found under individual catalogue entries. (i) Area Zeta 1973 In Area Zeta the remains of a pit and of a surface, lying between the stubs of walls built on earlier walls, were uncovered.73 The material lying on the floor included a number of almost whole vessels. The almost total lack of glazed sherds and Taffy Ware in the kept material from the floor deposit, and the exact nature of its relationship to the pit, makes it difficult to date. The pit contained both glazed wares and Taffy Ware, and must have been roughly contemporary with the occupation in Area Lambda. Substantial fragments of vessels were found, confined to the area of the pit and slightly above the level of the surface, and are probably part of the same deposit as the pit. These include an amphora (4017, fig. 7.10) similar in form to the early 14th century amphora in Area Lambda (4073, fig. 7.10), and a matt-painted jug (4002, fig. 7.6). Sherds of the jug were also recovered from the make-up of the surface. The form and decoration are similar to late 1 3th-century jugs from Corinth.74 No tile or tumbled stones were reported in the Area. It seems that the Medieval material in Area Zeta was deposited outside an as yet unexcavated structure. The date of the stub-walls is not clear, but they seem to have been in use at the same time as the surface and perhaps went out of use with the digging of the pit. Baskets were removed as follows: earth above floor: # 25; floor deposit: # 29, 30, 32; make-up of hearth: #31; make-up of floor: # 33; contents of pit: # 34-6; earth below floor: # 38.

SANDERS (iii) Area Lambda 3/4, 1977 The remains of a substantial building (Structure Lambda VII) were found below a layer of collapsed stones and tiles. This structure was associated with features found in Areas Gamma, Nu and Lambda 2, including a walled enclosure, a drain, a stone-lined pit and a hard surface.77 Foundation trenches for the piers of the structure were dug into a layer containing earlier Medieval material, including Late Green and Brown Painted Ware and a coin of Charles I of Anjou (1278-85). Connecting walls were built between these piers. Inside, the floor was much eroded to below the level of the connecting walls. It is possible that the lower storey served as a stable. On the desertion of the building, lime mortar washed from the walls and irregularly covered the earthen interior surface. Fragments of the Archaic Majolica jug 4053 were found immediately above the surfaces inside and immediately outside the structure in the mortar and in fine earth that accumulated before the collapse. Presumably this vessel had fallen from an upper storey. Many more tile fragments were found in the tumble outside the walls than inside, a fact suggestive of a pitched roof. Within the tumble, perhaps once built into the wall itself, was an amphora (4073) of a type that can be securely dated to the early years of the 14th century. Baskets were removed as follows: tumble and tile: baskets 10-13, 15, 18-19, 76, 77; earth under tumble but above the surface: baskets 16-18, 21, 22, 78, 79; surface make-up: baskets 25, 26, 31, 81; below surface: baskets 32, 33, 36, 37, 47, 48, 85, 87; foundation trenches of piers: baskets 29, 30, 42, 82.

Janko [Editor's note: this chapter, finalised in 2003, includes all the EH small finds from the excavations of 1973-77, together with the figurines from those of 1959-63. The latter group, originally thought to be Mycenaean, was to have been the topic of an article by W. D. Taylour and Ε. Β. French, as was promised when the excavations of 1959-63 were published.1 Ε. Β. French's present publication fulfils that promise. The entire corpus of EH small finds is in fact much larger, and less heavily weighted towards figurines, than appears here. This is because the later excavations cleared only very limited areas of the EH settlement, whereas considerable parts of it were dug in 1959-63, when the heavily eroded Areas Alpha and Delta on the hill-top were cleared. Accordingly, the editor has added references to the finds from the earlier seasons, to convey a more accurate impression of the range of objects that were in use at Ayios Stephanos during this period. No EH metal objects were found in the later excavations, but among the finds of 1959-63 the bronze tweezers HS 2032 from Alpha burial 10 are from a context that was probably EH II Early, since it had both Burnished and Yellow Mottled sherds.] 1. TERRACOTTA WHORLS AND BASKET IMPRESSION IN CLAY (5001-5003, fig. 8.1) E. C. Banks Two terracotta convex conical whorls, of a form characteristic of EH II, were the primary small objects from the later excavations of the EH settlement. Also included here is the base of a pot with an impression on it of the reed mat or textile on which the vessel was placed for drying. 5001. Whorl. H. 2.9. D.

Beta 1974, #16 (over Floor 1). Context LH IIIAi with some LH I- II. 74- 020. PLATE 44, FIG. 8. 1 . The whorls are examples of a type immediately recognisable from their shape as EH II: large convex conical with well-rounded sides and varying degrees of truncation at the distal end, where there is frequently a depression around the perforation. They are normally well finished, with surfaces smoothed but never polished or burnished. In contrast to Neolithic and EH III whorls, these appear to conform to a widely disseminated standard. By far the majority of the Lerna III whorls are of this class.3 Two variations of the type are illustrated from Asea;4 Holmberg notes the distal depression as a characteristic of the group. When the excavations at Akovitika are fully published, one would expect to find the type well represented there. [Three further terracotta whorls (6033, 6035 and 6036 below), of convex conical shape, may be EH cast-ups in late MH levels. Another convex conical whorl dated to EH was found in Trial Trench VA, namely HS 293B;5 this has orange fabric and traces of black paint. The convex conical discoid whorl published below as 7040 may be EH, since a parallel considered probably EH (HS 224)6 came from Delta burial 1; its context contained EH and MH sherds and the celt HS 223 of dark green 1 Taylour 1072, 208. 2 Taylour 1972, 211; AD 16 (i960) Bi pl. 83a. 3 Banks 1967, 487-92, pl. 16.1230, 1238, 1250. 4 Holmberg 1044, 118-10, fig. 1 13.6 and esp. 7. 5 Taylour 1972, 249. 6 Taylour 1972, 221. 411</page><page sequence="436">4ΐ2 Ε.

Another common EH II artefact is the pot base with the impressions of the mat or piece of fabric on which the pot was set to dry. It is another example of the commonality of features of the culture, as are the whorls just discussed. There are parallels for this feature in EH II vessels of plain ware,14 and bases similarly impressed have also been noted on vessels from Lerna.15 [Three jar bases with mat impressions comparable to 5003 were found in the earlier excavations, namely HS 15 (context EH and MH), HS 62 (context undiagnostic) and HS 63 (context EH II).16 Before the potter's wheel was introduced, mats were used not only for drying but as turntables.17 A more unusual terracotta object is the possible fire-dog terminal or leg of a zoomorphic stand HS 252. 18 Its context was EH II. The conical terracotta seal HS 278 may also be EH.19] 2. TERRACOTTA FIGURINES (5004-5024, fig. 8.2) Ε. Β. French The EH figurines from Ayios Stephanos are the most intriguing group of figurines to come from the site. Three types not previously recorded from that period (the Phi body, the polos hat and the bird) appear here in what seem to be good EH or EH/ΜΗ contexts. All would by shape be happy in a Mycenaean context, but the fabric is distinctive and the contexts are sure. Birds of similar type are otherwise known only in LH III contexts, including 7116 from Ayios Stephanos, an elaborate example of LH IIIAi from Mycenae, and close parallels of LH IHB from Tiryns and LH IIIC from the Amyklaion.20 [A possible EH bird's head has now been found at Kouphovouno.21 7 See Chapter q §5 below. 8 Taylour 1072, 242, pl. 42C.3. 9 Taylour 1072, 242. 10 Tavlour 1072, 211, ol. 4.2a, left. 11 Tavlour 1072, 242. 12 Taylour 1072, 243. 13 Taylour 1072, 242, pl. 42a, rieht. 14 Holmberg 1944, 81, fig. 82J-k. 15 Wienrke 2000. κτο. κ8ο. rot. - - _ - - - 7 kJ β ZJ7 %J * %J ïJ # 16 See Taylour 1072, 21s fig· 4-3, pi· 41b. 17 Zachos 1987, 210. 18 Taylour 1972, 242, pl. 51J, bottom. 19 See CMSV Suppl. ιΒ no. 342, with Pini 1993, 335. 20 French 1071, 160. 21 Renard 1989, 158 (no. 478 = Κ 2485), pl. 46:2.</page><page sequence="437">THE EARLY HELLADIC SMALL FINDS §2 413 Fig. 8.2.

It was studied by H. Blitzer, who has kindly allowed us to benefit from her notes. Ground stone objects of this period from the earlier excavations include two pestles made of black and white marble, namely HS 262, probably from a pure EH II context, and HS 263 from a layer that mixed EH II with MH.22 The small celt HS 264, made of blue-black haematite, was found in a context datable to EH II Late.23 The limestone pestle HS 204, which has been considered EH,24 came from a mixed surface level. The flat cup-base HS 273, probably of dark green serpentine rather than gabbro, came from a context that mixed EH II Late with MH, but should be MH rather than EH. 25 Two drill cores of gabbro (6091-6092) apparently from EH levels are probably MH in date.26] 22 Taylour 1972, 243, pl. 42b, right 23 Taylour 1972, 243, pl. 51c. 24 Taylour 1972, 212, pl. 42b, left. 25 Pace Taylour 1972, 243. 26 See Chapter 9 §5 below.</page><page sequence="439">THE EARLY HELLADIC SMALL FINDS §4 415 Fig. 8.3.

CHIPPED STONE (5026-5045, fig. 8.3) R. Janko, using the records of J. B. Rutter This section comprises all 20 chipped obsidian pieces found in the pure EH levels in Area Eta. These pieces were inventoried and carefully recorded by J. B. Rutter during the excavation. In some cases I have identified from the records the different types of tool recognised in Appendix 6, which offers a synthetic analysis of the chipped stone from all periods of the Bronze Age. Several more obsidian blades (all given the single inventory number 73-032), whose quantity and types were not recorded, were found in Area Zeta 1973, baskets 109 and 110, contexts which were, respectively, (i) EH II Late with some MH I, and (ii) EH II Late. Given the inadequacy of their recording, these are not listed here, but they were presumably counted for the statistical tables of Appendix 6. No other EH levels were reached during the later excavations. Other chipped obsidian pieces of this period were found during the excavations of 1959-63; they are mentioned in Taylour 1972 but not included here, as the relevant Areas have not been reinterpreted for the present study. Since the items are catalogued according to the latest chronological period represented in their contexts, the quantities of EH pieces are certainly understated, as there are likely to have been many cast-ups in later levels, especially those that mix EH with MH I.

This lithic material appears to be typical of a site of this period. That the finds are not more numerous is owed to the small extent of the EH layers uncovered during the excavations of 1973-77· The only chipped stone tool definitely of EH date published from the earlier excavations seems to be HS *75,27 an unusual obsidian 'chisel', probably an end scraper; its context included EH II Late. There may well be more. That there are no finds of worked chert, which apparently occurred locally, may not be coincidental; in later periods, this was used for sickle elements in particular. The absence of hollow-based projectile-points may also be no accident28 27 Taylour 1072, 243. 28 I thank P. N. Kardulias for catching some serious errors in this section.

BONE (6001-6009, fig. 9.1) With the exception of the fine bone pin (6008), the bone objects from MH Ayios Stephanos comprise a small group of largely fragmentary awls and pins. These are divisible into two groups: awls designed for utilitarian functions and pins that were at least in part decorative. Awls were made of splinters of ovicaprid or Bos leg bones worked into tapering shafts triangular to elliptical in section, but usually circular just at the tip of the point, and small whole bones tapered to a point at one end. There is little or no polish except at the pointed end. Pins were crafted of splinters of ovicaprid or Bos leg bones worked into approximately cylindrical shafts, usually with a slight taper throughout; this taper is accelerated at the point, which has a fairly sharp to somewhat blunted tip; the proximal end is plain or finished with a conical or segmented head. Surfaces are usually well polished all over. 6001. Pin. Intact in final use; head end broken off. L. (max. ex.) 7.5. D. (max. ex.) 0.45.

Not illustrated. Little can be said about the extremity-bone awls and crude pins of MH Ayios Stephanos. They are a staple of EH and MH sites throughout the Aegean. More distinctive is the very well finished pin 6008, with its elegantly articulated head. This general type of pin begins to appear early in the MH of the mainland, if the examples from Lerna may be considered typical. A rich assortment of fine pins was found there, the best concentrated in the early part of the period.1 They continued to be produced into the LH period.2 The pin from Ayios Stephanos is one of a group with a long barrel element as its central feature, which is flanked by one or a pair of smaller reel-like elements. One of the three- element pins, probably erroneously dated as EH, was reported at Malthi.3 From Lerna came comparable 1 Banks 1967, 378-92; Zerner 1978, 194. 2 See for example the Mycenae Shaft Graves, Mylonas 1 973 passim. 3 Valmin 1938, 362, pl.

METAL (6010-6015, fig. 9.1) Only six objects of metal are entered into the inventory of MH small objects from the later excavations at Ayios Stephanos. Two were copper or bronze punches and borers of types common in the Bronze Age Aegean, simple shafts of square or circular section pointed at one end. Another was a fragment of a lead mending-clamp found still attached to a sherd of a plain vessel mended in antiquity. The last object, a rivet, probably from a clamp, was also apparently of lead. For residues from metal-working see items 6067-6069 below. [A pin and a wire from the early excavations are added, since these are analysed in Appendix 5, and so is the fine pin 6012a which W. D. Taylour intended to republish here.] 6010. Arsenical copper punch. Distal end broken off(?); heavily corroded. L. (max. ex.) 6.9. W. (max.) 0.35. Th. (max.) 0.32.

Both punch 6010 and borer 6011 are tools of types found from EB I onwards in the Aegean and are well known throughout the Bronze Age on Crete, in the islands and on the mainland.5 Nichoria6 and Malthi7 each yielded one fragmentary punch of MH date. At Lerna several borers and punches were found in MH contexts and have been catalogued as awls and pins.8 The examples from Ayios Stephanos are absolutely typical and represent a minor addition to a well-known and large group of implements. Likewise the lead bar-and-rivet mending clamp 6015 belongs to a class of objects well known in MH contexts; both Nichoria9 and Malthi10 produced examples in MH or mixed Middle/Late Helladic contexts. To the north-east, at Asea, one fragmentary MH clamp was found,11 and there were several from MH Lerna.12 It is perhaps worth noting that no parallels for these metal objects have been published from nearby Kythera. [Pins similar to 6012 a, but not so well finished or preserved, were found at Thermi,13 Eutresis,14 Sesklo,15 and, the best example, in a tomb at Kephalovryson in Messenia.16] 4 Caskey 1956, 160, pl. 47a = 1009; Banks 1967, 388-9 and 397. 5 Branieran 1074. 26-7. 6 McDonald and Wilkie 1002, 610. 6i*7. no. 1707. ol. 10-2. 7 Valmin iq*8. 570. ol.

C. BANKS, WITH R. JANKO 3. TERRACOTTA, REUSED POTTERY AND CLAY (i) Whorls (6016-6036, fig. 9.2) The few spindle whorls from Ayios Stephanos of reasonably well documented MH date present no unusual features when they are compared with those from similar contexts at other sites. The whorls were produced in simple geometric forms and were executed in mostly dark-faced coarse fabrics, burnished and unburnished, like those of the ordinary cooking pots from the site. Occasional bits of lapis lacedaemonius observed among the non-plastic inclusions suggest local manufacture. The whorls are usually fairly well formed, with the vertical perforation centrally placed and the surfaces even, regular and undecorated. The whorls in the catalogue below are divided into type by shape. Following Carington Smith,17 those objects classified as whorls have a weight of 10 grams and above and/or a diameter of at least 2 cm. It has been demonstrated that even a whorl of 5 grams is serviceable for the production of very fine thread,18 and it is evident that many small objects frequently called 'buttons' or 'clothing weights' are probably whorls. Most of the whorls from the site weigh between 30 and 60 grams. Two weigh more than 100 grams and perhaps served as weights, but since Carington Smith19 has observed that whorls as heavy as 160 grams may be used effectively on the spindle, they are listed here.

Since there is rarely more than a single representative of each type, no statistical significance can be extracted from the distribution of the whorls in MH Ayios Stephanos. Moreover, with so little stratified MH material published, it is difficult to say what whorl types are diagnostically of that period. The material from Lerna suggests, however, that the straight-sided conical whorls with various degrees of truncation may emerge as the most characteristic types of MH whorl.20 Types 2-4 from Ayios Stephanos are of this form. Though at Nichoria only Type 10 really represents the group in MH,21 the bulk of the whorls from the site are LH, and at that time the straight-sided biconical whorl is prominent and may represent a development from the truncated straight-sided conical type. The straight-sided truncated conical whorl was apparently fairly common at Malthi, but no dates were supplied for those illustrated.22 Examples of MH date are known from Asea.23 Carington Smith provides a general listing of places where the conical whorl was found in probable MH contexts.24 The cylindrical whorl, here Type 1, appears to have had some currency in the MH period. It is found at Nichoria in a large version,25 and at Malthi a form with shallowly concave sides is illustrated;26 a similar form appears at Asea,27 and there is a single example, also with very shallowly concave sides, from MH Lerna.28 Spherical whorls, full and depressed, had a long life in the prehistoric Aegean, as did various forms of biconical whorl.29 Of the biconical specimens at Ayios Stephanos only Type 7 (6030) is worth mentioning. Distinguished by its medial rib, the whorl finds a close parallel in the MH/LH specimen no. 2585 at Nichoria.30 Perhaps we have a southern Peloponnesian speciality here. Whorls with rounded contours like those listed in types 9, 1 1 and 1 2 are common in EH contexts,31 so that an absence of good MH parallels is not surprising. Quite possibly these whorls are cast-ups from the EH settlement documented at the site. Generic cylindrical disc 6034, of Type 10, could be either EH or MH; variants of the type were found in both EH and MH contexts at Asea.32 20 Banks 1967, e.g. pl. 16.1401, 1417, 1422; also McDonald and Wilkie 1002, 682. 21 McDonald and Wilkie 1002, 680 fie;. 1 1.2. 22 Valmin 1038, 33s, fie:. 71. especially TvDes A and D. 23 Holmberg 1944, 119, fig. 113, especially 15 and 17. 24 Carinerton Smith 107?;, 30,2-3. 25 McDonald and Wilkie 1992, 679, fig. 11.1, Type VI. 26 Valmin 1038, fie. 71, F 1. 27 Holmberg 1044, fie. 113.22. 28 Banks 1067, 518, no. 1430. 29 McDonald and Wilkie 1002, 681-2. 30 McDonald and Wilkie 1002, 700 fie:. 1 1.2, Type 3. 31 Carineton Smith 107*. 100-208. 32 Holmberg 1944, 118-19, %· λχ&lt;*&gt;·% 1Ο and 21.</page><page sequence="448">424 Ε.

Their date of manufacture could be either MH or Early Mycenaean.] (ii) Spools (6037-6057, fig. 9.3) The distinctive flaring-ended, longitudinally-pierced spool or reel of terracotta, associated primarily with the MH period, is well represented at Ayios Stephanos. Produced primarily in Dark Burnished and dark-faced coarse fabrics of MH date, the spools were formed and finished with some care, attention being given to balanced proportions, finely articulated edges and surfaces well-smoothed and often polished or burnished. Found primarily in domestic contexts, they show signs of heavy wear and were often reduced to mere shanks with little or nothing of the ends preserved. No completely compelling explanation for the use of the reels has yet been offered. Carington Smith has suggested that they might have served to hold thread on warping frames on which warps were prepared for horizontal looms, and she provides illustrations from both modern Greek and ancient Egyptian practice.33 More recently, Elizabeth Barber has offered ajapanese cord-making method known as kumihimo as a possible explanation for the use of some concave cylindrical weights found in the Aegean.34 Here the weights are used with a small table and serve to tension the thread in the cording process. The weights swing free off the edge of the table and are subject to the kind of edge damage seen on the flaring ended spools from Ayios Stephanos. Moreover, the Japanese weights have a range of c. 28-1 13 grams, comparable to that of our spools. Though none of the Ayios Stephanos spools is complete, a well preserved Lerna example found in a MH (Lerna V) grave weighed 63 grams.35 A primary division of the reels into three types is based on the form of the shank: short convex (Type 1), tall convex (Type 2) and cylindrical (Type 3). The depth of the concavity of the ends is employed as a secondary criterion for further subdivisions within the primary types.

Because they were produced in characteristic MH wares, particularly Dark Burnished and local orange fabrics,36 1 include here all those found in both M H and LH contexts and suggest that the shanks were reused as spindle whorls in the LH period. The MH date of these objects has already been suggested by Carington Smith.37 Because of the reuse of the spools, any conclusions about the distribution of the types in the MH period are of no great cogency. But it is perhaps worth noting that Type 2 a was clearly in use early, Type 3 was represented in MH II/III Early, and all the types and sub-types were in use by MH III. The quantity of spools found at Ayios Stephanos is remarkable, given the comparatively small extent of the MH excavations at the site; it may suggest a local industry. The number is comparable to that from MH Lerna, which yielded over 30 spools.38 Two varieties were found at Asine in the Argolid.39 It is surprising that none has been found on Kythera or at Nichoria, Malthi or Asea, the neighbouring sites. They are known, however, in the Cyclades at Phylakopi and Ayia Irini on Kea, at both places in quantity, and scattered probable MH examples are known from Olympia, Ithaca, Levkas and Dodona in the west and at Eutresis and scattered Thessalian sites in the east.40 The primary use of the spools must, for now, be viewed as uncertain. They have not been found in groups, as one would expect if they were used in weaving or for plaiting. Well preserved examples come singly and primarily from graves. In the 1963 excavations at Ayios Stephanos a spool41 was found in burial Alpha 23, said to be probably that of a woman, which also contained an incised pyxis with Cycladic affinities. At Lerna a spool was an offering in another woman's grave.42 Since women were the primary fabric-makers, this kind of burial offering is not surprising, if we assume that the spools were used in some kind of textile production; moreover, the practice of burying spools in females' graves is paralleled beyond the Aegean.43 Other grave spools, of types generally comparable to those from Ayios Stephanos, were found on Kea in graves at Ayia Irini,44 in Thessaly at Petra45 and Sesklo,46 and on Levkas.47 Lerna spool no. 1483 was found on a floor, but nothing in the associated material gave a clue to its use.48 (iii) Weights and Loomweights (6058-6059, fig. 9.4) Only one object (6058) that can with assurance be classified as a weight was found at Ayios Stephanos, unfortunately in a mixed context. It was, however, of the common discoid variety known in Crete and the Aegean from EM II times and common in MM contexts,49 so that a MH or early LH date is likely for our example. If these objects were loomweights used in groups, as is generally accepted, it is difficult to understand why only one turned up at Ayios Stephanos. Perhaps it was brought in as a possible item of future trade by a Minoan or local merchant. Certainly a possible source for weights of this form was at hand in nearby Kythera, where they were described as being 'especially numerous in the LM IA to Β Deposit kappa'50 and where late MM deposits are known. Two were found at Nichoria, ovoid and with a grooved top like the Ayios Stephanos piece, from a mixed deposit containing MH.51 Not surprisingly, none was reported from inland Malthi and Asea, but on the coast at Lerna three were found, two of them in early MH contexts at a time when Minoan pottery was being imported, possibly from western Crete.52 A pyramidal loomweight resembling Classical types was found in a good prehistoric context and may be an indication of the appearance of this type at the end of the MH or the beginning of the LH period. 6058.

(iv) Crucibles and Metallurgical Residue (6060-6069, fig. 9.5) Fragments of at least six different crucibles of two types were readily identifiable as objects serving the work of the metallurgist, from both the copper residue that they contained and the fire-blackening and partial vitrification of their surfaces (for metallurgical analyses see Appendix 4). One crucible was sufficiently well preserved to allow a reasonable restoration of the original form (Type 1), but fragments of a second variety (Type 2) were inadequate to permit a clear understanding of die shape. Both types were made by hand in a porous, coarse fabric with thick walls and roughly finished surfaces, which were usually more uneven on the underside of the base than on the sides and interior. Three droplets of metallurgical residue were retrieved by water-sieving (none of these was subjected to chemical analysis). (a) CRUCIBLE TYPE 1 A very shallow, scoop-like vessel of possibly oblong plan with thick walls that curve up from a biconvex base and taper only slightly to a squared-off rim; toward one end, a heavy basket-handle of rounded rectangular section rises directly from the rim with a distinct slope toward the back of the crucible; the other end probably opened into broad, trough-like spout for pouring molten bronze into moulds. 6060.

Context MH III Early (Lower Pebbled Road) with a little LH I. 77-232. Not illustrated. Even at a village like Ayios Stephanos, metallurgical activities were carried on, either by members of the community itself or by itinerant specialists who came in by sea. Analysis of the residue in crucibles 6061-6064 indicates that the crucibles were being used for the melting of bronze, either arsenical tin bronze or tin bronze with low arsenical content (see Appendix 4); there appears to be no correlation between the composition of the bronze and the form of the crucible. Since only a very few bronze objects and no moulds were found in the excavations, we have no way of telling what kinds and range of implements were being produced here. The state of preservation of the crucibles from Ayios Stephanos is so poor that is hazardous to attempt comparisons with crucibles from other sites. It would appear, however, that the Type 1 crucible with its basket handle (or bridge spout?) was unlike the more common variety known at MH Nichoria53 and at Lerna from EH III times.54 These crucibles were heavy, round-bottomed, broad-spouted bowls, from which projected a heavy oval or squared-off tang with a rectangular or square opening for the insertion of a wooden handle, which allowed for the safe tipping and pouring of the hot metal. The Ayios Stephanos Type 1 crucible, on the other hand, appears to be in the Minoan tradition.55 Crucible 6061 most resembles those of Evely's Type 2,56 either spouted Type 2a, especially no. 6, or Type 2b, especially no. 12, with a basket rather than a solid handle. The Type 2 crucible fragments from Ayios Stephanos may also belong to one of the Minoan types, but too little is preserved to allow serious speculation. How the Ayios Stephanos crucibles were manipulated can only be conjectured. Evely suggests that the Minoan round-based crucibles were tipped with withies, a practice represented in Egyptian wall painting, or gripped by tongs on the rim or by a hook on a handle or spout.57 (v) Reused Pottery (6070-6076, fig. 9.6) A few sherds of pottery were provided with secondary perforations and might have served as rough whorls; 6070, a heavy triangular fragment fashioned from a pithos-rim, might have been used as a weight. 6070.

The perforated reused sherd is ubiquitous at sites in the Neolithic and Bronze Age Aegean. That it at least sometimes functioned as a whorl has been suggested by, among others, Carington Smith.58 However, 6070 is much too heavy and unbalanced to have served as a whorl and probably was employed as a weight, either for a loom or for a net. For the marked sherds see Chapter 5 §6 above. (vi) Miscellaneous (6077-6083, figs. 9.6-9.7) (a) pottery anvil(?)

Context MH II (?). 77-051. plate 48 (two views), fig. 9.6. The wear of the flat underside and the potential manoeuvrability of the three upturned edges of the piece are what suggested the possibility of its use as an anvil in pottery production. The potter could grasp the handle and move the piece along the inside of a large vessel, using now the flat surface, now one of the upturned edges, as she beat the exterior with a paddle. Though Shepard59 documented the use of mushroom-shaped anvils ethnographically, this piece might also have served the purpose. It is quite possible, however, that it was used to close the oval mouth of a jar. (b) NAVIFORM CRUCIBLES(?), LAMPS(?) OR MODEL BOATS(?) Of uncertain function is a small group of shallow naviform vessels, one of which (6081) is almost complete and provides full information on the shape. The plan of the low open vessel is that of an elongated, somewhat irregular ellipse with a shallowly biconvex base, from which the short, thick sides rise to a plain rim that varies from slightly rounded and tapered to bluntly squared-off. The sides are highest at the central part of the vessel, and at one end they are stretched out to form a broad trough-like termination. The handmade vessels are executed in a coarse fabric; the finish is uneven, the exterior walls lumpy and irregular with prominent wiping marks. The interior surfaces are more even and regular. The vessels contain no metallic residue, nor do the surfaces give any evidence of having been exposed to fire in use. No precise prehistoric parallels for these enigmatic receptacles have been found. While it is possible that they were crucibles which were not yet put to use, the absence of any pouring mechanism makes this unlikely. It is not impossible that they were crude local versions of the kind of boat models produced in various materials found in Bronze Age contexts, particularly in Crete and the Cyclades.60 6078.

Personal ornaments of various fabrics: carnelian beads 6084, 6086; schist pendant 6088; terracotta bead 6089. Scale 2:1. Stone and paste beads like those from Ayios Stephanos are well known in the EBA and MBA Aegean. The source of these types of beads was probably Crete, where they are particularly numerous in a variety of materials and forms; the Mesara tholoi yielded quantities of beads of EM and MM date.61 On the mainland we see the continuity of the tradition from late MH to early LH at Mycenae, in the Shaft Graves of Circles A and B.62 Malthi, Asea and Nichoria have little to offer in the way of MH parallels; at Lerna both stone and paste beads were found, primarily in MH graves.63 Clay beads were reported from Malthi,64 and a necklace of pear-shaped clay beads was found on a Lerna V floor.65 A well formed collared bead from a Lerna V grave provides a loose parallel for 6089.66 [The carnelian bead 6084 is MH II or later, since hard semi-precious stones were not worked on Crete until MM IIB.67 The other carnelian beads (6086, 7147, 7214-7216 and 7219) derive from later contexts.] The phyllite pendant 6088 may be a remnant of a perforated disc,68 which by accidental wear took on the form of a pendant. [The perforation is drilled from one edge only according to H. Blitzer, who considered this probably a fragment of an originally circular disc] 5. GROUND STONE (6090-6121, figs. 9.9-9.10) [The artefacts in ground stone found in 1973-74, together with those retained from the excavations of 1959-63, were examined at the site in 1974 by H. Blitzer, who drafted a report on them for Lord William Taylour. She kindly permitted us to benefit from her observations in preparing this publication. Some pieces (in square brackets) have been added by the editor.] Only a few objects of ground stone were found in MH contexts at Ayios Stephanos. The majority were pounders or rubbers of basic geometric shapes made on slightly modified cobbles. Most distinctive among the stones were the large shaft-hole axe 6090 and the small, well-finished celt 6103, both of which may have been imported to the site, though the presence of drill cores made by a cylindrical borer, 6091-6099 from the earlier excavations and 6100-6101 from the later ones, indicates that this class of shaft-hole stone axe was manufactured at the site.69 The perforated phyllite discs 6115-6121 possibly saw primary use as spindle whorls or lids.

Not illustrated.] The most distinctive of the polished stone tools are the shaft-hole axes like 6090 and the celts like 6102. The class of the former has been the subject of much discussion, the tool having been considered an Indo-European artefact and a marker of the advent of the Greeks from some homeland in the Russian steppes, the eastern or northern Balkans or Dalmatia. Forsén has provided a brief overview of the question with relevant bibliography, and Maran comments on the tool in his extensive treatment of the transition between EH II and EH III.70 Forsén notes the occurrences of the tool in this area of the Péloponnèse in reasonably solid EH ΠΙ/MH contexts at Lerna, Asea and Malthi, as well as axes from less well documented contexts at Pylos and Leuktras in Messenia, and at Palaiopyrgi on the Spartan plain.71 One from the earlier excavations at Ayios Stephanos, published as EH/ΜΗ, is included in her list, where she correctly dates it to the MH period. [This came from a mixed surface context. Another specimen, HS Í567,73 is likewise of 'greenstone' and is large, with an oblong shape tapering towards the butt; the bit is broken off. Its context contained EH II Late, MH and LH material.] To these shaft-hole axes we may add the three MH examples from Nichoria.74 Unfortunately these are not illustrated. With its short, broad outline and large bore at about mid-length or closer to »the bit than to the butt, the axes from Ayios Stephanos closely resemble two MH axes from Maltha aMtJ and axe from Asea also appears to be of this shape.76 The same type is represented in both EH III and MH contexts at Lerna, where it is designated 'type a'.77 [Such axes are now also known from both 70 Forsén 1992, 227-32; Maran 1998, 286-8. 71 Forsén 1QQ2, 220-30. 72 Taylour 1972, 247, HS «84. 73 Taylour 1072, 243. 74 McDonald and Wilkie 1992, 729, 752-3, nos. 3337, 3341 %J %J X *J _ _ « ·ν-^"«^Υ W Α 1 75 Valmin 1938, 346, fig. 73.2 and 3, pl. λλνΐ.Α.3 ana 4. 76 Holmberg 1944, 123, fig. 115.14· 77 Banks 1967, 100-110.</page><page sequence="461">THE MIDDLE HELLADIC SMALL FINDS §5 437 Fig. 9.10.

Geraki78 and the area of the Laconia Survey north-east of Sparta.79 Another was found at the EH III site of Deriziotis Aloni near Pylos.80] The small, well finished woodworking celt, such as 6102, has a long life in the Aegean, appearing in Greece in the Neolithic period. The form represented by 6102 falls in class Delta of the Wace- Thompson typology81 and is represented in our area among the Neolithic finds from Kouphovouno, just outside Sparta.82 When examples of the type appear in MH contexts at sites such as Lerna or Asea, they easily can be explained away as a cast-ups from lower Neolithic deposits. But where there are no significant underlying Neolithic remains, we can reasonably assume they were products of MH toolmakers, as in our examples at Ayios Stephanos and other examples from Malthi.83 [Other greenstone examples from Ayios Stephanos are HS 223,84 from a mixed EH/ΜΗ context, and the pierced specimen HS 285,^ found in a surface level. The adze HS 286,86 from a MH III to LH I context, is made of a dark blue-green stone, perhaps schist. Another celt, HS 266,87 made of black stone with some red specks, came from a surface context with MH and EH sherds. However, Taylour regarded the greenstone cup HS 273 as possibly EH,88 and the haematite celt HS 264 is definitely EH II.89] The pounders or rubbers represented in the corpus from Ayios Stephanos are of types ubiquitous in Neolithic and Bronze Age contexts in Greece. At Lerna, for example, six types of pounders or rubbers and two types of rubber were identified in EH III and MH contexts, with a distribution that was not chronologically significant.90 The objects presented here add nothing significant to our knowledge of this sort of utilitarian, probably multi-purpose tool, except the fact that they were used here as well. Perforated phyllite discs are typical of the sort of object not well reported in the literature. So they are mentioned, without indication of date, at Malthi.91 At Lerna they were numerous in EH III contexts, 78 Crouwel et al 1996, 103, pl.

[One specimen from Ayios Stephanos, 5025, was found in an almost pure EH II Early level.] 6. CHIPPED STONE (6122-6153, fig. 9.11) R. Janko, using the records of J. B. Rutter This section includes all 29 chipped stone pieces from pure MH levels that were inventoried during the excavations of 1973-77. Since only a selection of the chipped stone is catalogued in Appendix 6, and E. C. Banks could not study the objects in Sparta, this section has been compiled by the editor on the basis of the records made at the time, identifying from them where possible the different types of tool recognised in Appendix 6. The clearest and most detailed of these records are the work of J. B. Rutter; I have bracketed all descriptions that do not derive from him, where I have had to develop them myself from notes made by others.94 Appendix 6 below offers a synthetic analysis of all the chipped stone from all periods of the Bronze Age; this was based on a hands-on study of all the pieces that were inventoried and of the many other items that were recovered after the excavations during the analysis of the pottery, bone and shell remains. Some pieces listed in Appendix 6 that in fact derive from MH contexts may have been omitted here, because the contextual information that pertained to them was not available. Unfortunately, this applies in particular to the obsidian and chert cores, the find spots of which are not usually recorded. Chipped stone of this period was recovered in far greater quantity than is catalogued here. (7284 is also MH.) Since items are listed under the latest chronological period represented in their contexts, some pieces actually of EH date are probably published here. There must certainly have been some EH cast-ups in MH contexts, especially in Areas Eta, Zeta and Nu, where EH levels underlie those of MH I. However, the methodologies used at present do not permit us to identify them. (i) Obsidian Cores (6122-6123) 6122. Details not recorded. Nu 1973, # 27. MH III/LH 6123. Details not recorded.

Not illustrated.] In this assemblage, objects in obsidian are much more common than those in chert, which is used for preference only in sickle elements and denticulates. This distribution is the reverse of the situation that prevails at Nichoria.97 No doubt it reflects the greater proximity of Ayios Stephanos to the sources of obsidian on Melos. Lapis lacedaemonius was perhaps first used for saw blades in LH I- II;98 the context of 6142 is suspect. The only other objects from a MH context in this stone, the cobbles 6107 and 6111, are probably raw material. That this stone was not worked locally until LH I- II is a remarkable conclusion, given that its source is so close to the site, but one that accords with finds of the stone from elsewhere in the Aegean, which are limited to the LBA." The greater frequency of hollow-based projectile points relative to that of barbed and tanged points is comparable with MH Lerna.100 7. THE LINEAR A INSCRIPTION (6154, fig. 9.12) R. Janko During the excavation of 1973 there came to light in a surface level the small stone object 6154, which bears two incised signs that appear to be Linear A. According to the standard system of numeration,101 where HS stands for 'Hagios Stephanos', this text is numbered HS Zg 1.102 The schist tab mentioned in publications soon after its discovery103 as possibly inscribed in Linear Β is this same object. Study of the stratigraphy reveals that this find is likely to have originated in MH III-LH I levels.104 1 remain most grateful to the late John Chadwick for advice about the original publication of this piece.

C. BANKS, WITH R. JANKO Fig. 9.12. Middle Helladic small finds. Carved stone: tab with linear A inscription 6154. Scale 1:1. The purpose of this artefact is mysterious. It is difficult to believe that anything has been lost at the ends; the nature of the stone explains why these ends are not neatly finished like the other surfaces. There is no trace of any perforation, and unless such traces have been completely broken away, the stone cannot have been any kind of label. To suggest that it is an amulet is a counsel of despair. There is no similar inscribed object in Brice 1961, but the inscribed terracotta counters from Ayia Tríada105 are somewhat similar in shape and size. One possibility is that the object is a weight. An inscribed broken terracotta tab from Kythera, Ε 1 1 o (KY W 1 , from a MM IIIB stratum), which bears Linear A sign L 1 1 o, has tentatively been described as a weight, but it is pierced at the surviving corners; the clay bars from Mallia and Palaikastro, to which this has been compared,106 bear no resemblance to 6154. The nature of the artefact makes it much less probable that the inscription is in Linear Β than in Linear A: to date, Linear Β texts are almost exclusively limited to clay tablets and inscribed stirrup jars. The tab was found in trench Lambda 1, dug in 1973. The top of the hill upon which the Bronze Age settlement stood has been heavily eroded. Lambda 1 is situated on its sw slope, and the modern surface had a steep gradient (fig. 1.39). Joins in sherds between the top (n) and bottom (s) ends of the trench show that the slope was itself undergoing erosion. The tab was found in the mixed grey soil that constituted the surface level, near the s end of the trench. The associated pottery consisted mainly of Early Mycenaean wash (LH I-IIA), with a certain amount of LH IIIA-IIIC Early. There were two building phases in this sector, MH III Late-LH ILA and LH IIIC Early; the latter has been largely eroded away, and the walls and floor levels of the former were close to the surface. All the floors of this earlier phase had been eroded to some extent. While it is conceivable that the object belongs to LH III, a late MH or Early Mycenaean origin is more probable. (ii) The Signs The two signs are readily identifiable as Linear A: (a) as the 'double-axe' sign (L 52 in the transcription of Pope and Raison 1977 and 08 in that of Godart and Olivier 1976), and (b) as the 'cat's head' sign (L 95 Pope/Raison and 80 Godart/Olivier). The form of the 'double-axe' would be acceptable as Linear B, but that of the 'cat's head' is not found in the latter script. This type of the 'double-axe', 105 Brice 1961, pl. XV. 106 Coldstream and Huxley 1972, 205.</page><page sequence="467">THE MIDDLE HELLADIC SMALL FINDS §7 443 where there is no cross-piece at the top and the central upright does not cross the horizontal, is known at Zakros (ZA 7a.2) and possibly at Khania and Thera (KH 5.1, TE Z 2). Pope and Raison classify it as their Type L 52d.107 This type of 'cat's head', with single lines representing the cat's 'ears' and no attempt within the circle to represent the animal's 'eyes' or 'nose', is known from Ayia Tríada, Phaistos and perhaps Gournia (HT 6b.2, 31.3, 1 i6a6, etc.). Pope and Raison classify this as types L 95c or L 95d. Both signs are reduced to the barest essentials. The hardness of the stone used for the inscription may partly account for this extreme simplification, but I would suspect also that the signs are late and belong to the final stages of the script. The inscription thus reads: .1 08-80 Transcribed according to their Linear Β equivalents, the signs read: . 1 a-ma This sign group is common enough in the Linear Β tablets át Knossos, where it often precedes a large quantity of grain.108 Morpurgo Davies109 suggested that it might there be a substantive in the nominative. But its incidence in Linear Β is irrelevant, especially since the group is frequent in Linear A.110 It occurs as first group on a clay bar from Mallia, where the forms of the signs are both more archaic. A tablet from Zakros has these signs at the start of a badly damaged text: 08-80 Mallia, MA lb.i (first sign group) o8-8o[ Zakros, ZA 7b. 1 (first sign group) The two signs also occur with different 'suffixes',111 as follows: 08-80-57 Khania, KH 14.1 (first sign group) o8-8o-6o-24-[ Skhinia, SK Zb 1 (start of inscription) 09-80-54-41 gold pin, origin unknown, CR(?) Zf 1 (first sign group) These are rightly transliterated according to the system of Pope and Raison 1977 as α-ma (twice), a- ma-ja, a-ma-ra-?[, and a-ma-wa-silu The use of 57 (L 32), i.e. ja, as a 'suffix' is particularly well established. (iii) Conclusion Both the form of this inscription and the fact that it is incised on a stone object support the hypothesis that its script is Linear A rather than Linear B. It is a pity that it lacks a clear archaeological context, but its discovery is a further valuable indication of the close links between this part of southern Laconia and Minoan Crete. Linear A is already known from Kythera, and study of the pottery from Ayios Stephanos has revealed early and prolonged Minoan influence, mediated via Kythera. The very existence of this first scrap of Linear A from the Laconian coast is itself informative.113 107 Pope and Raison 1077, 40. 108 E.ff.

B. French, with R. Janko [Editor's note: this Chapter was largely completed in 1995. A few unpublished items from related contexts in the earlier excavations have been added in cases where the stratigraphy is re-examined in the present volume, or metallurgical analysis has been done (see Appendix 5); their descriptions depend on the excavation records only, and they have not been studied by the author. I have also provided an account of the objects in chipped stone from Mycenaean contexts. In addition, a fragment of an ostrich eggshell from a Mycenaean context, an exotic item presumably used as or destined for a luxury object, is published as 9214. A number of shells of the species Glycymeris (dog cockle), Cerastoderma and Acanthocardia (cockle), found in MH and LH contexts, were probably used as ornaments (9255-9274)·1] Author's note: the Mycenaean small finds from Ayios Stephanos were to have been the contribution of Billy Taylour himself, but this chapter was not even drafted, apart from some notes on the beads, although he commissioned drawings from Anna Poelstra-Tragá and others and discussed the chapter with colleagues, including myself. After his death I offered to deal with these items, because I was in the best position to visit Sparta and cope with the problems of access to the objects for a basic restudy. In completing the task, I realise how much I do not know about the various categories of find, but it would have been unrealistic to import specialists for this small quantity of material, even had repeated access to it been possible. For some entries the catalogue is based on notes made by Betty Banks, who has kindly allowed me to make use of her original catalogue and has added notes from which I have benefited. Helen Hughes-Brock went through the original records and added notes from which I have also benefited. I also thank Jane Cocking, Rosemary Payne and John Younger for being prepared to answer questions. The range of small finds that can be considered to have been manufactured in Mycenaean times is similar to, but not identical with, that from other comparable sites, particularly Nichoria,2 which was excavated at a similar period. The account of Mycenaean Lerna,3 which has appeared since this chapter was written, also provides an important reference base for the Ayios Stephanos material. This report concerns only the finds of 1973, 1974 and 1977, as those of previous seasons have been dealt with adequately in Taylour 1972. The finds consist of items in bone, metal (bronze and lead), clay (including 'terracotta') and stone. They are all practical items of daily use, except perhaps for a seal and for the considerable number of beads that accompanied the many infant and child burials found on the site. Some of the beads in faience and glass have suffered badly in the storage conditions to which they have been subjected. In some cases it has been necessary to use the original description, in spite of seeing the object. The division between faience and glass has been made with a X30 hand-lens and with the help of the comments of Helen Hughes-Brock. A few items either cannot be located at present or were not retrieved when the study was made (autumn 1992). The apparent date of manufacture, and not of the find's context, has been used throughout the report in order to allow more coordinated discussions. The number of finds is small, but this must be related to the area of the Mycenaean settlement exposed, c. 945 sq. m., compared with about 4600 sq. m at Nichoria.4 Unfortunately, little can be said about the functional contexts, with the exception of the floor deposits and the burials.

BONE (7001-7009, fig. 10.1) The number of bone objects is small, as at Nichoria, but this may be an indication of conditions of retrieval or of preservation. The chronological coverage is full and shows continuity from the earlier periods. Despite the small number of items, the range of types is of interest (plate 52) and includes three tools (7006-7008) of a type that I cannot find noted elsewhere. These, like the complete point (7002), come from the good contexts of LH IIIC Early, while the short point (7004) is considerably earlier. It may be noted that there is no ivory or antler from the Mycenaean levels. The one piece of unworked boar's tusk 9164 is more probably MH I in date, although its context had slight LH contamination.

METAL (7011-7022, fig. 10.1) The copper or bronze objects offer a picture similar to the previous category. Their number is small, but this is a common situation; the range of interest, however, is high. Almost all but the earliest come from destruction levels, and this is doubtless responsible for their non-retrieval in antiquity.5 The ring with external hatching (701 1) is said to date to Early Mycenaean, but it is unusually elaborate and apparently unparalleled, though it does not stand out in the metallurgical analyses (see Appendix 5). The ring with attachment (7012) and the simple tweezers (7013) are quite at home in their LH IIIAi context, as are the other items from the LH IIIC Early contexts. Three crucible scraps (7053) and a piece of metallurgical residue (7053a) were found in a Mycenaean context (the LH IIIC Early Floor 5); see Appendix 4. Lead is extremely common in Mycenaean contexts,6 but the recovered remains are often difficult to interpret, and the range of uses is not yet fully understood. All five objects from this site (7018- 7022) are typical. The early date of the rivet 7018 should be noted,7 and one may wonder whether riveting was more common at times when pots represented a greater input of effort than later, when they were mass produced. Certainly in subsequent periods rivets are most common on large storage pots, where no doubt they were used to repair a vessel until its contents (presumably dry!) had been used up or emptied out.

TERRACOTTA, CLAY AND RE-USED POTTERY (i) Whorls and Conuli (7023-7052, fig. 10.2) The clay 'whorls' (I include all sizes) found in the LBA and later levels present a problem. In the Argolid, the examples found in Early Mycenaean levels are confined to the small conical and biconical types; clay gives way to stone between LH II and LH III.8 The evidence from the area of the Citadel House at Mycenae confirms this, but unusual terracotta examples have also been found there in LH IIIC Late contexts.9 At Nichoria, the clay types were recovered from levels dating throughout the period, but the overall pattern is similar.10 If we had details of the pottery ranges for the contexts, we might be able to suggest that some of the scattered examples are residual. To me the scenario at Ayios Stephanos seems similar. The large, coarser whorls are of MH manufacture; some may have continued in use and possibly manufacture into the Early Mycenaean period (as late as LH IIIAi), but by then the smaller types of finer clay are produced. These become rare in the Mycenaean period, but there may be a revival of clay whorls in LH IIIC. What is not clear is whether the almost complete absence of clay examples in Mycenaean times in the Argolid is also true of the provinces. Unfortunately, the evidence from Ayios Stephanos does not help. The social structure behind these changes in usage is difficult to interpret.11 There is little distinctive evidence of spinning and none of weaving from Ayios Stephanos in the Mycenaean period, and surprisingly little of weaving from the earlier period (6058- 6059 above). But it may be noted how rarely such evidence is found on the mainland of Greece, a fact that probably indicates that weaving took place away from the major buildings of the settlement, under the industrial conditions apparent in the textual evidence.12 Unfortunately, even with the addition of recent finds, we have as yet no examples of Mycenaean loomweights in a primary context (including at Lerna, although two examples were found there, one with and one without a groove). The clay whorls from Ayios Stephanos can be divided into four chronological groups: EH II, MH, Early Mycenaean and LH IIIC, with one outlier. Of the 39 examples found in LH and later levels, the two EH objects (5001 and 5002) and four in the MH group (6018, 6019, 6031 and 6036) are catalogued in Chapters 8-9 above. The MH whorls are of types, fabrics and surface treatment known from the whorls found in actual MH levels and described in Chapter 9 §3 above (see fig. 9.2). The flat tops and the irregular surface are particularly noticeable; both burnished and hand-smoothed examples are present. In the Early Mycenaean group I have placed six further examples of MH types (7023-7028). These come from LH I-IIIAi contexts, but there is no way of knowing when they were produced. Another example (7029, fig. 10.2) should be linked to these, though its rounded profile, which is a development from the MH types 2-3, is not actually paralleled in the MH group. Also from Early Mycenaean contexts are five biconical (7030-7034) and three conical (7040-7042) examples. Another seven Early Mycenaean examples come from later contexts: five are biconical (7035-7039) and two conical (7043-7044). Two types (7046-7052) probably belong to the LH IIIC period rather than being residual. Unfortunately, their poor condition does not help this hypothesis. They are differentiated by the surface treatment, since they are either burnished to a dark colour or left completely untreated, but the fabric is a fine friable red clay, of the type known as cooking ware in Mycenaean contexts but here showing clear glints of schist. One conical example (7045) is so well made that I think it may antedate its LH IIIC Early context and be a clay example of the normal LH IIIA-IIIB stone conulus.

This was apparent as soon as the first season in 1959. Lord William Taylour allowed me to study those from the early seasons before the publication of my thesis,16 though they were not included in the original version. Shortly after this, he invited me to undertake a separate publication of the LBA figurines in collaboration with him.17 Because of the possible confusion between the EBA and LBA examples, I was later asked to include those of the earlier period too. This present account, which was originally to form my sole contribution to the Ayios Stephanos publication, is the result of several visits to Sparta and considerable study, and thus differs from the more summary treatment of the other small finds in this Chapter. The figurines, including those from the earlier excavations, are presented here in some detail because of their intrinsic interest, and in the hope that their relation to other groups and areas may later become apparent. Perhaps the most intriguing group is the EH, because of their possible stylistic relation to LBA types.18 Second in interest comes the evidence for what seem to be actual Minoan imported figurines of MM III (7092-7093), as well as 7086, a possible local copy of a LM type. The typological influence of Minoan figurines in the southern Péloponnèse has long been admitted, e.g. regarding the examples from the Menelaion.19 However, published examples are few. The lack of any figurines from the excavations on Kythera seems very odd in this situation. The examples from Nichoria,20 though not identified as of Cretan type in the publication, add to this general picture.21 The presence of both EH and Minoan figurines at the site leads to the suggestion that perhaps we should be looking for the beginning of Mycenaean figurines in a cross between a residual use of, or at least acquaintance with, EH figurines and knowledge of contemporary figurines from Crete. The idea of an EH origin was originally put forward by Biegen,22 but I had previously discounted it because of the deep divide represented by the austere MH period. But Laconia is here rather different from the Argolid, and one might suggest that there was greater continuity from EH, particularly as classic EH III still seems to be absent from the area.23 This does not, of course, help in any way to identify the functional impulse for Mycenaean figurines, which is still elusive. Their popularity, which develops in LH ΠΙΑ, I personally would still assign to Near Eastern influence and to the rapidly expanding contact that is now even more evident. The Mycenaean figurines from Ayios Stephanos are also odd in that the proportions of figurines from phase to phase in LH does not seem to echo those of the pottery discussed in this volume. Particularly noticeable is the important number of LH IIIAi pieces, accompanied by a considerable rarity of ordinary, and usually prolific, LH IIIA2 and IIIB types. What little evidence there is of these phases is particularly worn and fragmentary. So the problem may be one of different occupation and usage of the various areas of the site. The abundance of LH IIIC Early pottery is echoed in the 16 French 1071. 17 Tavlour 1Q72. 208. 18 See above, Chapter 8 §2. 19 See Dawkins 1910, pl. II; Catling 1977, fig. 13; and Catling 1995, who does not discuss the possibility that this figure might belong to the Cretan group. 20 McDonald and Wilkie 1992, nos. 2031 and 2042. 21 See also Hägg 1982. 22 Biegen 1028, 185. 23 Dickinson 1992.</page><page sequence="476">THE LATE BRONZE AGE SMALL FINDS §4 453 figurine evidence. There are also indications of relations to other periods and places, which could be important and intriguing, but they are difficult to substantiate both on the actual evidence from the site itself and on our present knowledge of the rest of Laconia and Messenia (while we await the publication of the Menelaion). The evidence from Nichoria has the same early weighting and relative absence of ordinary types, but it lacks the LH IIIC Early material. Two fragments seem to come from large figurines or figures (7068 and 7090) rather than from the usual small examples. Both of these can be paralleled from the known groups at Mycenae24 and at Phylakopi,25 and fragments of human as well as animal figures have now been identified from Amyklai.26 The protome head 7118 parallels the animals from there well, though 7117 is more naturalistic. Among the animals the stags (7114-7115, plate 55) are extremely unusual. One example is mentioned by Karo27 as in the Vlastos collection. Other parallels are found on the contemporary rhyton from Volimidia28 and in LH IIIC Perati.29 It is noticeable that there are only three fragments of chariot groups (7120-7122) and one other group piece, 7123, though the female 7063 was originally applied, presumably, to a throne. The decorated wheel (7122) compares in shape very closely to the wheels of the chariot group from Mega Monastiri.30 As with the Lefkandi centaur,31 a single terracotta piece may have been broken up for use in several tombs. A few other pieces from the site, which are not figurines, are related to this material. The askoid rhyton 3289 is unique, particularly in its LH IIB-IIIAi context. It can, however, be related to 7117 below, and possibly to 7091. (The bovid protome head 7118, possibly even MH, is published here.) Overall, the figurines from Ayios Stephanos illustrate, as do the other materials, the elusive importance of the site and serve to emphasise the value of the relatively extensive excavation of provincial centres of this type.

PERSONAL ORNAMENTS OF VARIOUS FABRICS (7126-7231, fig. 10.5) One steatite seal (7126) was found in the later excavations. It probably comes from a burial (Eta burial 13) which also contained the bead 7163. Younger assigned it to the large group of Mycenaean seals called the Mainland Popular Group.32 [He classifies its image as Animal Pose Type 2 R, with filling motif Branch 2 below.33 This is the first seal from Laconia which can be attributed to the Mainland Popular Group.34 The settlement at Nichoria yielded several examples.35 Such seals were produced during LH IIIA-B; the battered condition and abraded string-hole is in keeping with its association with a LH IIIC burial. [The three seals from the earlier excavations have recently been republished.36 Of these, the steatite seal HS 249s7 is a MM II/III import; 38 this piece was found by the feet of Beta burial 19, which is probably LH I- II; it is not made of lapis lacedaemonius as was once thought.39 The second, HS 26 1,40 is likely to be a stamp for holy bread and therefore Byzantine in date.41 The third, HS 278, may be EH.42] The beads of various typical materials (bone, stone, faience and glass) come mainly from the burials or from contexts that are probably related to them. Two only, one of faience (7127) and one of stone (7214), seem to be accidental losses from the site itself. The latter is of some interest in itself, being a simple droplet of carnelian, probably LH I-II in date but from a context dated to LH IIIC Early. Its good condition is surprising in these circumstances. [A further carnelian bead, 6084, was found in a MH I- II context with a few LH sherds, while another, 6086, was from a MH III/LH I context] The evidence of bead usage in the various burials is particularly important. There are two identified Mycenaean female infants. One, Nu burial 4, had beads (7128-7134) forming a necklace, and the figurine (7063) is also of great interest. The typological development of the beads is unremarkable, with the simple types evolving into the more elaborate. The very rough segmented piece 7164, from the left wrist of the second female infant (Beta burial 28), is earlier than the more canonical examples and might be thought to be a local product. From the same grave eight beads of unparalleled type (7200-7206) were on the right wrist. This tomb showed individuality in its offerings in other ways also, such as the terracotta 'dinosaur' askos (3289). [Another notable interment with beads is Lambda burial 14. The absence of beads in hard stones other than carnelian, e.g. in agate, amethyst or lapis lacedaemonius, is intriguing.43 The references in the catalogue to parallels published by Biegen are taken from W. D. Taylour's notes; H. Hughes-Brock provided additional parallels for 7168-7193.] (i) Seal (7126) 7126. Complete; edges battered, string-hole worn, motif abraded. D. 1.5, (hole) 0.2. Th. 0.5.

GROUND STONE (i) CONULI (7232-7241) From the Mycenaean levels in the later excavations there are seven conuli of the stone often casually identified as steatite; two further specimens are added from related contexts in the earlier excavations. All are conical; five are dark in colour (7232-7236) and five of the paler grey-green variety (7237- 7241). One of each type, 7234 and 7240, is illustrated (plate 56) to show the string-wear at the top. Carington Smith44 summarises the latest information on this type of item, though her views are not universally accepted. To other recent interpretations (dress and belt weights) I would like to add curtain weights, including the ends of beaded door hangings, at present an almost ubiquitous furnishing in the villages of Mount Pelion.

(ii) Tools (7244-7279, figs. 10.6-10.7) [The artefacts in ground stone found in 1973-74, along with those kept from the earlier excavations, were examined on site in 1974 by Dr H. Blitzer, who drafted a report on them for Lord William Taylour. She kindly allowed us to make use of her report in preparing this chapter; this has been of particular value with regard to the LH IIIAi and LH IIIC Early groups, which the author has not examined herself in detail. Working from Dr Blitzer's records, the editor has added several pieces from related contexts in the earlier excavations. These are enclosed in square brackets.] Plate 56 shows the larger ground stone items from 1977 and serves to illustrate the tool range in this material, in useful complement to the other materials. The stones in use, as in earlier periods, comprise the local limestones and hard greenstones (including lapis lacedaemonius itself), used widely as cobbles and for pestles, as well as one piece of haematite, a hard black 'pebble', and two types specific to whetstones and querns. The tool types illustrated comprise pestle, cobble and whetstone (to use the terminology employed at Nichoria45). The differential wear is very clear on the plain cobble (7273), but one wonders whether the lump of hpis lacedaemonius (7279) may not be raw material rather than a tool (even a temporary one). A high proportion of the artefacts in ground stone from the LBA levels come from clear contexts, though doubt must always remain whether objects so long-lasting were in fact manufactured at the time of the contexts in which they were found. The Early Mycenaean levels seem to continue the picture of the MH levels, the latest drill-core being from a LH IIA context; the latest pierced disc, 6116, is also of this date. There is, however, one possible whetstone (7249). A group (7257-7262) of pebbles/cobbles from over the LH IIIAi Floor 1 is of interest for the variety of material represented; 44 Carington Smith 1992, 685-6. 45 Blitzer 1992.</page><page sequence="485">462 Ε. Β. FRENCH, WITH R. JANKO the presence of haematite is of note. It is, however, possible that this 'group' and the LH IIIC Early ones owe more to the zeal of the excavator than to any functional context. Two LH IIIC Early floor levels (Floors 4 and 5 of 1974) produced groups of artefacts, mainly cobbles and pestles of greenstone and limestone but with a fragment of a schist quern (7276) from Floor 4. [In addition to the items published here, a considerable number of rounded cobbles from these two floors were not kept. The quern may be compared with HS 265 and HS 312 from the earlier excavations.46 A stone socket for a doorpost, 7277a, has been added.] Among the other stone objects the small lump of rock crystal (7278) is certainly raw material, though its battered state in a late context may indicate that it did not originate in the period of its context. The piece is of interest, as items that might potentially serve for personal adornment are few on the site in the Mycenaean period. (a) pestles (fig. 10.6) 7244. Chipped. L. 7.12. W. (max.) 4.07.

Appendix 6 provides a synthetic analysis of all the chipped stone from the site, based on a hands-on study of all the pieces that were inventoried and of the many other items that were recovered after the excavations from the analysis of the pottery, bone and shell remains. This section catalogues the 63 items known to have been found in LH and later (i.e. Medieval or surface) contexts during the excavations of 1973- 77. Since only a selection of these is given in Appendix 6, and Ε. Β. French had completed her study of the other finds, I compiled this section using the excavation records and drawings then made, cross-listing those pieces described in Appendix 6 whose contexts are known. At the last minute P. N. Kardulias compared my descriptions with his own notes and rescued me from some serious errors. Since pieces are listed under die latest chronological period of their contexts, the number of items from periods earlier in the Bronze Age is probably understated, because there must be many cast-ups in later levels, including those of the Medieval period.

This assemblage provides evidence for the working of obsidian at the site both early and late in this period (see 7280-7282). Obsidian continues to preponderate over chert, as in earlier times. Chert is still used for sickle elements; its sources have not yet been found but are presumably local. Lapis kcedaemonius is not exploited at Ayios Stephanos until LH I-IIA, and then rarely.49 As in the MBA, hollow-based projectile-points continue to be more popular than barbed and tanged ones. Otherwise the assemblage seems not to be unusual for a site at this distance from Melos. The value of stone tools, even later in the Bronze Age, is attested by the hoard HS 219, which consisted of 35 obsidian blades and a whitish-grey chert scraper, deposited together with other precious objects such as a bronze dagger and tweezers and two worked bone pins in the possibly LH I grave Alpha 28.50 For further commentary on the MBA and LBA assemblage taken together see Appendix 6. 49 See Chapter 14 §3 (vi) (c) below. 50 Taylour 1972, 219, fig. 11, pl. 41e. 5.</page><page sequence="494">Chapter 1 1 The Roman, Medieval and modern small finds, tiles and coins G. D. R. Sanders andj. Motyka Sanders, with R. Janko [Editor's note: this Chapter was largely completed in 1994. Objects are Medieval unless otherwise stated. As well as contributing the account of the coins, including those from the earlier excavations, I have moved into this Chapter a few objects whose post-Bronze Age origin only became clear from subsequent study of the stratigraphy, and I have added a few unpublished finds from the earlier excavations, which can now be seen to derive from the vicinity of the buildings in trenches Beta 6 and 1 1 ; their descriptions are based on the excavation records only.] 1. INTRODUCTION The small finds from the Medieval levels at Ayios Stephanos are unprepossessing yet not substantially inferior in quality to the objects from those at Corinth and Nichoria. The modest assemblage includes iron, lead, glass, bone and terracotta objects of everyday use. The largest group is iron, mainly nails from in and around Area Lambda. The smallest group is glass, of which only a few fragments are catalogued. Of particular value for dating the deposits are five Medieval coins (8083-8087), all billon deniers dating between c. 1260 and 1321. One of the earliest (8084) was found in the make-up of an outside surface in Area Lambda, while the later three (8085-8087), perhaps dating the duration of the Medieval occupation on the site, were found in mixed levels with many Medieval sherds s of Structure Lambda VII. Also of interest are an incised inscription on a Taffy Ware stamnos handle (8069) and four iron arrowheads from Area Zeta (8009-8012). The catalogue is grouped by material rather than by Area. Many of the finds came from mixed deposits and are difficult to date with certainty. Those finds from good contexts date to the late 13th or early 14th century. Occasional finds, for instance the iron donkey shoe (8016), the tin button (8007) and two coins (8088-8089), are modern. 2. BRONZE, COPPER AND TIN (8001-8007; fig. 11.1) Apart from the coins mentioned above, only a few pieces of bronze were found, and a button, probably of tin. (i) Buckle or Harness [8001. Bronze or brass belt buckle or harness (not seen). Complete but in two fragments, one very bent.

IRON (8008-8045; FIGS· 11.1-11.2) Most of the finds came from in and around Structure Lambda VII. A large number of these were nails, only a selection of which has been illustrated. As at Nichoria, these come in two sizes, large and small.1 The larger nails generally had round heads c. 2 cm in diameter, a preserved length of around 5 to 7 cm, and a square shank about 0.7 cm thick where it met the head. The remainder were proportionately smaller with a thinner shank. Also of interest are two horse shoe fragments (one probably modern), two knife blades (both extremely corroded), and four iron projectile-points. [The editor has added another knife and the fire-steel 8008, found in 1963 close to the bronze fragments 8002-8003. Fire-steels originated among Germanic peoples like the Saxons and Vikings, and objects of this kind continued to be used for lighting fires until the 1 8th century. Fire-steels reached Greece during the Slavic invasions.2] (i) Fire-Steel (fig. 11.1) [8008. Fire-steel (not seen). Complete but corroded. L. (max.) 4.7. W. (max.) 1.8. Th. 0.1.

TILE (8077-8081; figs. 11.4-11.6) Published tile from Medieval contexts in the Péloponnèse is limited to Rosser's presentation of the 12 th and early 13th century material from Messenia.6 Tile is one of the commonest artifacts recovered in excavation and by survey. However, finds from excavations are seldom published, and finds from survey are therefore of little use as a chronological indicator. The tile from Ayios Stephanos presented here is exclusively from Area Lambda 3/4, 1977, and was used to roof the late 13th to early 14th century Structure Lambda VII. The tile covered the excavated area; it was found, mixed with tumbled stone, both inside and outside the building above the floor level. The context in which the tile was found allows it to be accurately dated. Both cover-tiles and pan-tiles were recovered. These can be differentiated by their relative dimensions, as well as by their shape and treatment. No ridge-tiles were found, and it must be assumed that the cover-tiles served in their stead. A single complete example of a cover-tile (8077) gives an impression of the standard size and form of this type. The cover-tiles are trapezoidal, about 48 cm long, and flare from about 22 cm at the distal end to about 26 cm at the proximal end. The ventral (lower) surface is concave and has an irregular pitted surface, often with traces of lime mortar adhering to it; the convex dorsal (upper) surface is smoothed and bears a finger-drawn grooved signature. No complete examples of pan-tiles were found. The surviving fragments give the dimension of the proximal end and permit an estimate both of the width of the distal end and of the minimum length. The pan-tiles are roughly rectangular. They measure about 34 cm across at the proximal end and an 6 Rosser 1983.</page><page sequence="502">THE ROMAN, MEDIEVAL AND MODERN SMALL FINDS §1O 'n' 1 ' (Í I Fig. 1 1.4. Medieval tiles.

The concave dorsal surface is smoothed and is decorated either with a curvilinear combed design or with finger-drawn grooves. The edges of both types of tile are bevelled on their upper surface (fig. 1 1.6). To a certain extent the process of manufacture can be reconstructed. The prepared clay was laid on an even earthen surface and flattened to the required thickness. When the clay had dried and had been hand-smoothed, it was cut to prescribed dimensions by using a pre-shaped form, or by hand with a knife. The cut tiles were then signed, either with a comb-like instrument or with wet fingers. The upper edges were trimmed with a knife, creating a bevelled facet. When the clay was stiff, the cut, trimmed and signed tiles were laid on a curved surface to give the final longitudinally concave shape. The signatures or manufacturers' marks are invariably on the upper surface of both cover- and pan- tiles. That the combed or finger-drawn designs were not devised to help the bonding of tiles is evident from their usually central location on the upper surface, where there was little or no overlap with other tiles. The marks must then have served either as factory identification or as decoration. Combed signatures are restricted to pan-tiles. These marks, exclusively curvilinear, are drawn with either a six-or seven- toothed comb-like instrument, which was dragged across the surface of the wet tile after it had been smoothed. This procedure left deep parallel grooves with slightly elevated ridges between the incisions. Finger-impressed signatures are present on both the pan- and cover-tiles. The forms of these marks include an inverted psi motif, loops and an inverted V-shaped design. In each case the design has been drawn with the middle and/or index finger into the pliable pre-smoothed surface of the clay. 7 Rosser 1983, 385, fig. 10.77, 81.</page><page sequence="504">THE ROMAN, MEDIEVAL AND MODERN SMALL FINDS §11 481 The types of tile used at Ayios Stephanos have survived in use in mainland Greece to this day. Any hope of differentiating the relative date of tiles by their size, shape and signature is dim. The late 1 2th or 13th century tile at Nichoria in Unit IV, Phase 4, is significantly different in size, signature and section. The cover-tiles from Nichoria measure c. 40 x 25-30 x 2.5 cm, and the pan-tiles an estimated 80 x c. 37 x 2 cm. When signed, the marks are finger-drawn perpendicular to the long axis of the tile near the proximal end. From the published drawings, it appears that the tiles were signed before the tile was cut.7 Although the tiles from Ayios Stephanos differ from the earlier examples from Nichoria, they are similar to and perhaps indistinguishable from later Laconian tiles in many respects. This may reflect a different standard of mensuration from that used at Nichoria. At Hagios Nikolaos on the Oinous River near Sellasia, tiles replaced during renovation of the roof still survive in the vicinity of the church. The church itself dates perhaps to the 16th century or later, while the roof was probably renovated in the past decade. The tiles cannot therefore be precisely dated within a 350 year span, some 300 years after the destruction of Structure Lambda VII. At Hagios Nikolaos complete pan- and cover-tiles were found by the team from the Laconia Survey. The pan-tile measures 63 x 30 x 3.2 cm, and the cover-tile 48 x 22 x 2.4 cm. Although the length of the pan-tile cannot be directly compared with that of the pan-tiles from Ayios Stephanos, the width, dimensions and signatures of the cover-tiles can. It seems, therefore, that the standard shape and size of roof-tiles survived for at least 300 years, if not considerably longer. Evidence for the survival of the standard into the mid- 20th century is provided by the recently replaced tiles of Pietrie House at Corinth, which also have similar shapes and dimensions. Although differentiation between middle- and late-Byzantine tile in the Péloponnèse may be possible, a fine chronology of the post- 13th century tile types cannot, at this time, be realised. 8077.

This originated in France and was then imitated by a number of Frankish rulers in southern Greece, notably the Princes of Achaia with their mint at Clarentia (Glarentza), modern Killini in Elis. The obverse type is a cross pattée, i.e. with slightly splayed arms; the reverse shows the castle-like design known as a châtel tournois.

The discovery of these French and Frankish deniers tournois and no other coins of Medieval date at a Byzantine site in Laconia has both numismatic and historical implications. In the context of several Frankish deniers, the presence of the French one of Louis VIII or IX (8083) is not entirely unexpected. Metcalf has plausibly argued that the Achaian coinage, with its identical types, was begun as a supplement or replacement for French issues and started perhaps as early as 1262 at the mint of Clarentia.11 In 1262 the Franks ceded the castles of Mistra, Monemvasia and Le Grand Magne to the Byzantines, who regained the rest of Laconia the year after.12 But French deniers tournois may have continued to reach Greece after 1266;13 coins of Louis are still found in hoards of deniers in the 1320s, albeit very rarely and usually in worn condition.14 Alternatively, the French coins may have been withdrawn from circulation once the issues from Clarentia began.15 But it is not clear whether such a withdrawal could have applied to the Byzantine province; the crucial early hoard evidence either way is lacking. The presence of a French coin among only five deniers tournois, and its excellent condition, make it likely that it was lost at a relatively early date. This coin does not prove that Ayios Stephanos was already reoccupied during the first half of the 1 3Ü1 century, but that possibility is not excluded.16 Moreover, this find is from a different part of the site, from Area Alpha on the top of the hill, rather than from its sw slope like the rest (see figs, ii-iii). It is remarkable that Frankish coins continued in use at Ayios Stephanos after Laconia became a Byzantine province in 1263. This contrasts with the finds from the British excavations at Sparta, where Byzantine coins heavily outweigh Frankish and Venetian pieces, which together amount to only 5% of the total.17 This may be because Ayios Stephanos was occupied mainly in the late 13th and early 14th centuries, whereas the Byzantine and Venetian coins at Sparta are respectively earlier and later in date than that. Perhaps the absence of these deniers at Sparta is evidence that it was then abandoned.18 Metcalf has proposed that the low- value deniers were used primarily in areas where there was trade and industry, and not in the agricultural hinterland.19 If so, Ayios Stephanos was presumably involved in coastal trade with the Frankish principate; situated at the head of the Laconian gulf, it offered an approach to Mistra that avoided rounding Cape Malea, and was thus more convenient for access from the west than was Monemvasia. This observation helps to explain the inscribed stamnos handle 8069 from the final occupation level in the courtyard of Structure Lambda VII; this bears the letters r f scratched in Latin letters. Deniers tournois may have circulated more extensively in the Byzantine province than has been realised; at later periods the Despots tended to rely on foreign money of various kinds and never struck any locally. Trade was, to an ever-increasing degree, left in the hands of Western merchants.20 11 Metcalf 1971, 210 ff.; 1979, 249-50, with n. 9. 12 See Chapter 14 §5 (ii) below. 13 Metcalf 1074, 122. 14 Metcalf 1060, φ (hoard L); 1074, 122. 15 Metcalf 1974, 122. 16 See Chapter 7 §4 above. 17 Metcalf 1060, R2; iq7Q, 238-Q. 18 P.

JANKO Ayios Stephanos certainly flourished in the late 13th century; Structure Lambda VII is dated to c. 1280 or later by 8084, which was recovered from the make-up of the yard surface. From 1321 the Byzantine province declined; raids by Catalans and Turks on the Peloponnesian coasts became a serious problem in the mid- 1320s, and Umur, emir of Aydin, led especially devastating attacks on the Laconian Gulf and Vale of Sparta in 1334.21 The finding of the later coins 8085-8087 in surface levels is most easily explained as resulting from the site's violent destruction; their dates and unworn condition suggests that Byzantine Ayios Stephanos, exposed to sea-borne raids up the River Vasilopotamos, met its end in one of these raids. The arrowheads 8009-80125 from Area Zeta support this hypothesis. However, it is not certain, since the deniers had a long life, well into the 14th century;22 the absence of issues after 1321 might just be coincidence, but I doubt it. (iii) Modern (8088-8089) The sole datable evidence recovered from the excavations for human activity at the site between the destruction of the Medieval buildings and the present day is again numismatic: this was the discovery in surface levels of two 19th century Greek coins, probably chance losses by farmers or shepherds rather than evidence of occupation. 8088.

Duhig (i) Source Material This report has been compiled from the information contained in the publication of the 1959-63 excavations,1 Lawrence Angel's lists for the skeletal material from these years, his record sheets for the 1973-74 material, and Sara Bisel's draft report on the burials found in 1977. 1 have not examined any of the remains, and I have not, therefore, been able to confirm or correct unclear or questionable details, nor to apply methods of recording that were unavailable to the previous investigators. It is clear that recording was hampered by the generally poor condition of the skeletons. [The locations of the bones and skulls stored in Sparta Museum are listed, when known, in table 12.7, according to the catalogue compiled by E. B. French and Clarissa de Waal. A few of the skeletons found in 1963 were kept;2 these are in box 62 and perhaps box 79. Editorial additions are in brackets.] Taylour's publication of the 1959, i960 and 1963 seasons3 includes for each burial the age at death, sex when applicable and condition of the bones. Angel's lists, on which Taylour drew, have somewhat fuller information - for example the state of eruption of teeth in juveniles, from which the ages were determined - and a few of the better preserved skeletons are described in detail. For the years 1973 and 1974, Angel completed a record sheet for almost every individual or group except those uncovered at the end of a season. All the records are handwritten, carbon copies of lost originals, and of the 45 sheets only four are the full Smithsonian Institution forms, with exhaustive measurements of every available bone, the others simply being slips of paper. No original records made by Bisel were available, but her draft report for publication (Appendix 7) is very detailed and probably contains all the information that could be obtained at that time, at least for the immature skeletons. (ii) Notes to the Catalogue and Correlation List As a preliminary to the creation of a complete catalogue of skeletons, a correlation list (table 12.7) was compiled, combining and ordering the numbering systems used by Lord William Taylour (WDT in the catalogue entries), Lawrence Angel (JLA) and Sara Bisel (SB). Because of the confused state of the records, it was necessary to take account of the date of excavation, the location and form of the graves and any osteological details, such as age at death, sex or pathological conditions, which could unequivocally identify an individual. Each individual was then given a new, unique number. Together, the catalogue and the correlation list amalgamate all published and unpublished information about the human remains; my additions, amendments and queries are given in square brackets to distinguish them from the findings and comments of Angel, Bisel and the excavators. I have not included Angel's exhaustive bone measurements and morphology scores for the 1973 and 1974 material, which can be found in the archive. Of these I have used long-bone measurements, when available, to calculate the height of adults of known sex, as described below. The correlation list fields are as follows: Catalogue number. This new numbering system, introduced in 1992, runs from 9001 to 9163 over all years of excavation. Each number represents one individual, which has necessitated some separation 1 Taylour 10,72. 2 Taylour 1972, 207. 3 Taylour 1972. 485</page><page sequence="509">486 C. DUHIG, G. JONES, C. MOURER-CHAUVIRÉ, A. NICODEMUS, D. S. REESE, M. J. ROSE of HS or SK numbers (see below) relating to grouped or commingled bones, and some combination to reunite parts of the same skeleton excavated in different years. Numbers 9001 to 9099 cover the seasons 1959, i960 and 1963, and are ordered according to the text of Taylour's 1972 publication, thus: Areas Alpha, Delta, Trial Trench VII, Gamma and Beta. It is to be noted that his published table reverses the order of Areas Gamma and Trial Trench VII. Numbers 9100 to 9163 cover the seasons 1973, 1974 and 1977, and are ordered first by Area, in the sequence in which trenches are published in this volume (Epsilon, Zeta, Eta, Beta, Lambda and Nu / Gamma), and within each Area by year of excavation. All references in this chapter use the new catalogue numbers. HS number. In the 1959-63 seasons, the 23 skeletons examined by Angel were numbered by him in order as he worked on them, from HS 1 to HS 22 including a HS 21a. HS stands for Hagios Stephanos, as in the finds numbers (to avoid confusion with the site of Asteri, denoted by AST), and not 'human skeleton'. Many skeletons were not handled by him and so have no HS numbers. This system was continued by Angel in 1973 and 1974 and by Bisel in 1977, but there was an inadvertent overlap of numbers with the previous sequence, so this sequence runs from HS 20 to HS 78, and with sub-numbers covers 62 individuals. SK number. When Taylour published the results of the first seasons, the skeletons were recorded by him with the Area letter followed by a skeleton number, with some sub-numbers; two individuals were not given numbers, as they came at the end of the work on their respective trenches. Janko has followed this system for the later seasons. It is only occasionally and coincidentally that the HS and SK sequences run in the same order, because the former indicates order of examination by the anthropologist and the latter the order of excavation. The burial of a child, SK Nu 5 of 1974 (= Nu burial 1 1), was deduced by Janko from the small size of the cist and the presence of a toy chariot wheel. No bones were found, however, so it does not exist osteologically and is not included in the catalogue. Comments on numbering. This column explains the combination or separation of individuals, and exclusion of numbers needed to produce the correlation list. Date. This is the date of excavation, a combined date showing that excavation of one individual was carried out in two separate seasons (e.g. 9147 shown as 1963-74). Angel's own records give the date when he worked on each skeleton, which can be up to a year later, and to avoid confusion these dates have not been included here. Trench. The trench numbers, from the record sheets, or references such as 'cist' or 'pithos', have been noted only to aid in the correlation of information on specific skeletons. As above, two trench numbers are given for 9146, for example, to indicate its position between two Areas (Beta 12A of 1963, and Lambda 1 of 1974). Period. Information as to the period of burial comes fromjanko's current table of burials (table 2.3). Age. Ages were determined by Angel and Bisel. Where I have corrected an age, it is given in square brackets, and the variant methods are discussed in detail in the section on demography, below. The notation used for referring to each permanent or deciduous tooth is that given in Brothwell 1972: 1, medial incisor; 2, lateral incisor; 3, canine; 4, anterior premolar; 5, posterior premolar; 6, first molar; 7, second molar; 8, third molar or wisdom tooth; the equivalent teeth in the deciduous dentition, which only contains 20 teeth, are indicated by the letters 'a' to 'e'. Many of the earlier skeletons were not examined by an expert, and some others were too fragmentary and damaged for age to be determined accurately, so they are listed in broad categories of 'neonate', 'infant', 'child' or 'adult', but it is not possible to determine what ages these bands represent. Correctly, a neonate is a newborn up to one month, an infant is less than one year old and a child any later age up to puberty. Sex. All immature individuals are recorded as 'N/A ('not applicable') in this column, with the sex determination made by Angel or Bisel following in parenthesis. The sex of many adult skeletons was not determined, presumably because of paucity and/or poor condition of bones, and these are marked 'N/D' ('not determinable'). A few of the adults with gender indicated do not appear to have been examined by Angel, and it is assumed that they were sexed on the basis of the grave goods: these are numbers 9025, 9037, 9066-9067, 9076 and 9078. Height. Bisel calculated the height of the two adult women in the 1977 sample (9161-9162), and her text mentions the muscular robustness of one of them. Taylour refers to the size of two skeletons (9076, 9086) without measurements or further comment,4 and Angel describes two individuals (9100, 9125) as being tall, his record sheets enabling me to calculate die height from long-bone lengths, 4 Taylour 1972, 228, 233.</page><page sequence="510">THE HUMAN AND OTHER ORGANIC REMAINS §1 487 using the regression formulae of Trotter.5 In no other case is stature or build mentioned, but I have used Angel's records to estimate height for numbers 9043, 9051 and 9137. Pathological conditions. In the correlation list, pathological conditions are only mentioned to aid correlation of specimens. In adding further information to the full catalogue, I have found that Angel tended to make diagnoses with little or no description, so his comments on pathological conditions are given almost in their entirety, only shortening entries by the use of certain well known anthropological conventions such as the tooth notation mentioned under 'Age', above, and reference to cervical, thoracic and lumbar vertebrae as 'C's, 'T's and 'L's respectively. I discuss the significance of the pathological disorders below. Certain other manifestations in the skeleton that cannot strictly be called 'pathological' are noted here, such as the degree of tooth wear and the presence of certain anatomical variants called 'non-metric traits', which are usually not of clinical significance in life but are sometimes heritable or environmentally determined, and can thus suggest family relationships within a cemetery or the presence of environmental Stressors during the development period. These are also discussed in more detail below. The catalogue entries (§1 (v) below) omit the details of HS and SK numbers and do not mention age, sex or height unless a determination was made by Angel or Bisel; as was mentioned above, possible sexes of immature individuals as suggested by Angel or Bisel appear in parentheses in table 12.7. Otherwise the catalogue entries repeat and expand on the information in the correlation list. In addition, the catalogue includes the state of recovery of each skeleton and some general comments on any unusual condition of the bones, burial positions, discard from graves, mixing and so on, once again primarily to aid correlation of the skeleton numbering systems. The condition and proportion recovered of each skeleton is not systematically recorded, but it was possible to find some notes, albeit somewhat anecdotal, as to preservation and recovery on all but three individuals, the exceptions being numbers 9149, 9151 and 9160. Frequently, the only clue to the presence of a particular bone is a measurement. It is clear that preservation at the site is generally bad, as mentioned above: most skeletons were crushed to some extent, many were disturbed by later burials or structures, and some had suffered partial decay, presumably due to differential drainage within the graves (water-leaching is the most destructive decay process6). There is a high percentage of immature individuals; these are somewhat more vulnerable to all these destructive processes because of their small size and low bone-mineral content,7 though not systematically.8 (iii) Findings and Interpretation Findings are discussed for the site overall and for each time period. It is important to emphasise that we are not looking at a single contemporary population, even when considering each site period separately, but a selection from the living populations of the site over many generations, with their changing genetic heritage and economic and social circumstances, in which perhaps the environment represents the most stable influence. For the whole period of Bronze Age use of the site, about 1 800 years, only 154 individuals have been recovered, so it is theoretically possible that almost every generation is represented by only one skeleton; in reality there must be time groupings, but the precision of dating methods is scarcely sufficient to indicate those individuals who could, potentially, have known each other. The overall sample size is good compared to many other sites, particularly those from the Mediterranean area that often have bone in similarly poor condition, but when it is broken down by period the samples for each are too small to be considered significant, and they are dismally small when broken down again by age and sex. The selection has its own biases due to intrinsic and extrinsic factors operating between the living population and the ultimately recovered skeletal population, factors discussed at length by archaeozoologists but rarely in the context of human remains, except recently by Waldron:9 selectivity at the burial stage, loss due to disturbance and poor preservation, incomplete excavation of the whole burial area and post-excavation loss. The first we are unlikely to be able to quantify, but at Ayios Stephanos, as at Lerna, large numbers of immature skeletons are found, so we can avoid the common osteological question:10 where are the children and babies? The apparent absence of very old persons is discussed below. The second and third factors are obviously operating at this site, only the third being quantifiable, and the fourth also operates in the sense that the data gathered from the material is less, and less comprehensible, than it would have been two decades before. 5 Trotter 1970, based on Trotter and Gleser 1052 6 See Goffer 1980. 7 Von Endt and Ortner 1984. 8 Duhig 1998, fig. 4.3. 9 Waldron 1994, 13-21. 10 This is discussed, for example, in Molleson 1993.</page><page sequence="511">488 C. DUHIG, G. JONES, C. MOURER-CHAUVIRÉ, A. NICODEMUS, D. S. REESE, M. J. ROSE Suggestions as to the meaning of the data must therefore be taken as tentative. Angel himself remarked that even ancient cemetery samples of five or ten skeletons have supported broad conclusions and therefore must have been considered representative of their living populations by the authors of the reports, but these reports should be treated with great caution. Even where the skeletal material from Ayios Stephanos is insufficient on its own, however, the information gained from it can contribute to wider studies of Bronze Age Greece. (a) BREAKDOWN OF SKELETAL REMAINS BY PERIOD I have included in each period only those burials that are unequivocally of that period, or which are queried without any alternative period being suggested. The latter are followed by a question mark in the lists below.

(vi) Period uncertain Twenty skeletons are of uncertain date. Numbers 9011-9012 and 9014-9015 are EH or MH. 9037 is MH or MH/LH transitional; 9111, 9021, 9037, 9120, 9127 and 9148 are MH or LH. 9069, 9075-9076 and 9078 are MH or Medieval. 9122 and 9129 are LH or Medieval. 9042 and 9065 are of completely unknown date. (b) DEMOGRAPHY (i) Age/sex ratios In general I have assumed that the immature individuals are aged accurately, even when the method used has not been described. For very young individuals, Angel indicated in some of his notes that he used the state of fusion of various areas of the sphenoid, temporal and occipital bones of the skull, the timing of which is well understood.12 I have made some amendments, however, when Angel noted the state of dental development and eruption, as the currently favoured standards13 produce slightly different results from his. The differences are minimal, however, usually only a month or two except in the case of skeletons 9004 (6 months), 9005 (1 year) and 9113 (1.5 years), and none are significant 11 See Chapter 3 §6 above. 12 Redfield 1970; Weaver 1979; Scheuer and MacLaughlin-Black 1994· 13 Moorrees, Fanning and Hunt 1963.</page><page sequence="512">THE HUMAN AND OTHER ORGANIC REMAINS §1 489 Fig. 12.1.

Age at death: LH burials (total 66).</page><page sequence="514">THE HUMAN AND OTHER ORGANIC REMAINS §1 491 given the larger problems of demography. Bisel reports that she used the dental development method of Schour and Poncher, which is a variant of the Schour and Massler standard.14 Skeleton 9112 is recorded as 13+ years of age because of the complete eruption of the second molars, which are commonly called the ' 12 -year molars'; but because the acetabulum is unfused the age can scarcely be greater than this, and I have recorded this individual as 1 2 to 1 3 years of age at death. The precise ages given for the adults were obtained by methods no longer in use: the Todd method of pubic symphysis ageing15 and a system of scoring the skull sutures for their degree of fusion, probably that of the Americans Todd and Lyon16 rather than a European system. Suchey, Wiseley and Katz17 have modified the Todd symphysis system, and I have followed them in reconsidering ages that clearly have been determined by this method. There are only two: skeleton 9100, which is recorded as aged 24 years and would fall into the new category Todd Ά' (&lt; 24 years), and 9137, which is recorded as aged 52 years and would now be in the Todd Έ' category (&gt; 45 years). For these two cases, then, the age differences between the systems is negligible, although it would not necessarily be so for other examples. As mentioned above, many of the ages are simply recorded as an age band, for example 'neonate', 'child', 'young adult'. Some of these bands, such as 'neonate', are narrow enough to be informative in themselves, although I have pointed out above that there is some confusion as to the actual ages indicated by 'infant' and 'child'. Others, such as 'adult', could cover several decades, and very few have ages given in years; but this is all the data there is, and it is extremely unlikely that more precise ages could have been determined given the condition of much of the material. I have consequently categorised the material into groups: foetal/neonate, up to one month after birth, with all assumed to be at least 8/9 foetal months (because Angel would undoubtedly have identified any younger foetuses), and thus all normal full-term or slightly premature infants rather than miscarried or aborted foetuses; infant, from one month to one year; child, up to adolescence (there were not enough with precise ages to justify separation into early and late childhood); adolescent, from puberty at approximately 13 years to eruption of the third molar and fusion of long-bone epiphyses at around 18-20 years; adult 1, up to 25 years; adult 2, 25-35 years; adult 3, 35-45 years; and adult 4, over 45 years.18 In tables 12.1-12.4, I show the numbers in each group, their percentage of the total, and the numbers and percentages for all immature individuals grouped together and all adults; the graphs (figs. 12.1-12.4) present the percentages as stacked columns. The Medieval burials and those of completely unknown date are excluded. Because of the small size of the period samples, only the totals of the percentages in each group are given, and in this section I will only discuss the whole cemetery findings. Among the 54 adults, 23 were sexed, either by the anthropologists or, apparently in six cases from the earliest excavations, by the excavator. Nineteen were aged, and in general these two groups overlap: unsurprisingly, those that could not be sexed could not be aged either. I have indicated the sex of all immature skeletons as 'not applicable', as use of the rim segment ratios for sex determination of immatures is now discredited. Indeed, the feasibility of sexing immature skeletons has been denied by most anthropologists in the last couple of decades, although Molleson19 has applied the Fazekas and Kósa sciatic-notch method20 to infants, and Rösing's tooth dimension method21 to children and adolescents, with some successful results. I emphasise again that the skeletal populations tabulated here probably have very dissimilar age/ sex proportions from the living populations. The sex ratio of 11:12 male to female adults is, unsurprisingly, close to unity. The age distribution is also problematic, given the need to extrapolate from the cemetery sample to the living population, but there are age distribution tables for dead populations, derived from modern data, which can be compared with the patterns from ancient cemeteries.22 A normal distribution for an undeveloped country, which we would expect to be most closely comparable to our sample, is U- shaped, with the maximum number of deaths in the youngest and oldest age categories (as countries develop, the curve swings to the right as infant and child deaths decrease and longevity increases). It is not possible to observe the right-hand end of the curve at Ayios Stephanos because of the difficulties in ageing of adults, which leads to the dominance of the category 'adult, age not-determinable'. The absence of older adults is partly an artefact of the methods used; it is also possible that the remains of 14 Schour and Massler 1044. 15 Todd 1920; 1921. 16 Todd and Lyon 1024; 102 κ. 17 Suchey, Wiseley and Katz 1086. 18 This is based on Brothwell 1981; Steele and Bramblett 1988, 6-7; S.

REESE, M. J. ROSE old persons, especially women, will be more fragile because of osteoporosis and consequently less likely to be found. Even taking these points into account, however, the full cemetery sample is dominated by infant (including neonate) skeletons to a greater extent than Lerna or a modern cemetery sample from an undeveloped country, Peru.23 Table 12.5 presents the age balance of these three 'dead populations' by percentage and ratio. BrothwelPs table presents 1 3 groups, from the Palaeolithic to modern times, for comparison of adult and child mortality rates,24 and the only population that exceeds the Ayios Stephanos child mortality is recent Egypt. Did proportionately more infants die at Ayios Stephanos, or were more of them buried at the site? The latter is an archaeological question, which can scarcely be answered without excavation of the whole site, but if the former is the case, possible reasons are discussed below.25 By contrast with Lerna and Ayios Stephanos, the LH human remains from Nichoria26 were in the ratio of 1.7 infants and 2.7 children to every 10 adults. This paucity of sub-adult skeletons is common in archaeological material, as mentioned above, and is more likely to be due to differential burial practices and loss of small, fragile immature bones than unusual mortality patterns. (it) Height (table 12.6) Bisel estimated the height of skeletons 9161 and 9162, two females, as 1 59.59 and 1 52.72 cm respectively. She notes that the method she used for estimation of living stature was that of Trotter and Gleser,27 which is commonly in use today, but my calculations give slightly different results: 158.673 ± 3.55 and 152.63 ± 3.66 cm, taking into account the adjustment for age - a reduction is made for every year an individual is over 30. Bisel describes skeleton 9161 as tall for the period and skeleton 9162 as average. This is confirmed by Angel,28 who gives the mean for female heights at Lerna as 154.2 cm. Skeleton 9086, unsexed , is of 'exceptional size',29 but without long-bone measurements it would be impossible to quantify even if we knew whether to use male or female norms. Numbers 9100 and 9125, both males, are 'very tall' and 'tall' according to Angel's notes. From my calculation of their heights, using recorded femoral and tibial measurements as 164.17 and 177.6 (± 2.99) cm respectively, it can be seen that 9125 is considerably the taller of the two, particularly as maximum femoral length was not recorded and the lesser, bicondylar length had to be used. Thus, while number 9125 could certainly be considered tall for a man in most living populations, number 9100 would be average, and probably was so for his time: male heights at Lerna vary around 166.8 cm. Skeleton 9043 is that of a female whose living height would have been 148.69 ± 4.45 cm, although only the humérus was measured and the bones of the upper limb are known to give less reliable stature estimates than those of the lower limb; this is shown by the greater plus/minus range for this estimate. Number 9051 is that of a male of 163.75 - 2·99 cm&gt; but the fact that age could not be determined means that any necessary age adjustments could not be made. Number 9137 is that of an older female whose height was 151.265 ± 3.55 cm. These results are given in table 12.6, and those with heights determined are shown diagrammatically in graph format (fig. 12.5). Obviously, any attempt to draw conclusions from such a small sample would be risible: the three men are taller than the four women, which is scarcely surprising. The average heights of the women and men from Ayios Stephanos are 152.8 and 168.5 cm#&gt; the men are shorter than those from Lerna and LH Athens30 by 1.5 and 2.6 cm respectively, and the women are taller by 1.7 and 1.1 cm, quite slight differences. The apparent increase in height from EH to LH, culminating in the great height of skeleton 9125, is tantalising but, sadly, completely insignificant statistically. The LH Nichoria people, however, were also tall: the average for women was 165.84 cm and for men i7°-33 cm.31 Angel32 comments that the ruling family at Mycenae were at least 5 cm taller than the people of Lerna and suggests that the relative shortness of the Lerna population must have been environmentally caused, if a gain of 5 cm could be made by a higher social class at Mycenae. Certainly, height differences are evident between socio-economic classes in the modern developed world and are attributed to a range of factors including, but not dominated by, nutrition.33 In a population such as that of Lerna, with several signs of growth-disturbance, nutritional deficiencies probably were significantly reducing stature, but at Ayios Stephanos, as is discussed below, nutrition appears to have been adequate. We do 23 The latter is in Waldron 1994, 18. 24 Broth well 1972, fig. 29. 25 See§i (iii) (c). 26 Bisel 1992. 27 Trotter and Gleser 1952. 28 Angel 1971,87. 29 Taylour 1972, 233. 30 Bisel and Angel 1085. 31 Bisel 1992. 32 Angel 1971, 85. 33 Harrison, Weiner, Tanner and Barnicot 1977, 346"7·</page><page sequence="516">THE HUMAN AND OTHER ORGANIC REMAINS §1 493 Fig. 12.5. Adult heights of Bronze Age burials (total 7). not know the heights of the ordinary people at Mycenae, so we cannot compare the whole population with Lerna or other contemporary sites. Perhaps, following the pattern at Ayios Stephanos, it is their relative lateness rather than their social status that caused the Mycenaean rulers to be tall. Since only three immature skeletons have long-bone lengths less than 100% of US means for age (number 9127, seven years old: 80%; 9128, seven months old: &gt;88%; 9149, eight months old: 90%), the population's relative shortness compared with that of a modern developed country appeared only after childhood. However, modern US (or, indeed, European) norms are probably unsuitable comparisons for any ancient human remains because of the secular trend, which has produced a height increase of about 2.5 cm per generation in Europe and North America over the last 150 years;34 it is more useful to compare ancient populations with each other by reference to their relative deviation from a standard.35 Without further evidence, and without invoking an extraordinary nutritional deficiency affecting only adolescents, we should assume that the growth curve of the people of Ayios Stephanos was normal for their genetic composition. (c) PATHOLOGICAL CONDITIONS AND NON-METRIC TRAITS (i)J. Lawrence Angel and thalassaemia Angel made a significant contribution to palaeopathology with his work on ancient thalassaemia. The clinical and palaeoanthropological pictures of the disease are described below, as well as Angel's application of these to ancient East Mediterranean populations, before we consider the case of Ayios Stephanos. The hereditary haemolytic anaemias The large number of anaemic conditions can be categorised into two groups, according to whether they are hereditary or acquired. The commonest acquired anaemia, and the commonest anaemia in the world today, is iron-deficiency anaemia,36 caused by dietary iron deficiency and/or parasitism. The hereditary anaemias include many disorders of haemoglobin synthesis in which red blood cells have a short lifespan, either because they have a structure liable to collapse or burst in specific 34 Harrison, Weiner, Tanner and Barnicot 1977, 348-51. 35 Goode, Waldron and Rogers 1993, 321. 36 Davidson and Passmore 1969.</page><page sequence="517">494 c· DUHIG, G.

They are called haemolytic anaemias, and it is their impaired capacity to hold oxygen, sometimes combined with the harmful effects of a debris of dead cells in the blood, which causes the symptoms of this disease. Sickle-cell anaemia is probably the best known, affecting people of black African or American heritage with fatigue, periodic crises with severe pain and fever and, when advanced medical care is unavailable, early death. The severest form affects those inheriting it from both parents (homozygotes), while those inheriting from only one parent (hétérozygotes) usually have a less severe disorder. Thalassaemia is commonly found in people of Mediterranean origin, hence the name, and is somewhat similar to sickle-cell disease clinically. There are several forms of the disease with different degrees of severity, and hétérozygotes can be asymptomatic or only slightly affected, although they are still carriers - a key point relating to Angel's work. Skeletal manifestations The physiology of the bone changes of the anaemias is well understood through haematological and clinical studies.37 Red blood cells are produced by bone marrow, which in childhood occupies the whole skeleton but in adulthood is restricted in distribution. When there is a severe anaemia, the marrow space expands at the expense of the other bone layers, thinning them by pressure atrophy, and eventually breaks through. In life, the thickened, radially-arranged bone columns (trabeculae) that comprise the central marrow-containing layer of the skull (the diploë) surround islands of overdeveloped marrow. These trabeculae give the distinctive 'hair-on-end' appearance radiographically, which is valuable in the diagnosis of anaemia. In the dry skull, the diploë is visible where the outer table has been destroyed, producing the 'spongy' or 'sieve-like' appearance of cribra orbitalia in the orbits and porotic hyperostosis on the vault. Other bones can appear on gross inspection to be 'netted' or 'lacy', with loss of outer, cortical bone.38 Archaeologically, differential diagnosis is rarely certain, but there are certain distinctive patterns of distribution and form of bone changes. Bone changes of all the anaemias especially affect the skull vault. In thalassaemia the facial bones and those of the facial sinuses are also affected, producing a swollen appearance to the face, malocclusion of the teeth and inhibition of sinus development, and many other parts of the skeleton can be involved, sometimes with distortion of the bone contour and even premature cessation of growth.39 Sickle-cell anaemia causes lesser changes than those of thalassaemia: the thickened diploë rarely shows through the outer table of the skull, but much of the postcranial skeleton can be affected, with expansion of marrow cavities and areas of infarction (death of bone cells) following obstruction of blood vessels by collapsed red cells.40 Infarctions do not appear in thalassaemia. The signs of iron-deficiency anaemia are slight by comparison with thalassaemia: the vault changes are rarely as extreme and do not involve the facial region,41 and long-bone alterations are usually absent. Other, less common haematologic diseases also produce the 'hair-on-end' appearance in the skull vault and should be considered for individual cases, but they are less likely to be relevant when significant numbers of cases are found in a population. Angel's contribution It is known that the defective red blood cells present in thalassaemia and sickle-cell anaemia provide poor hosts for malaria parasites (of which the most virulent is Plasmodium falciparurri), and thus there is some adaptive advantage in having them. In pre-modern times, in areas where the disease was endemic, the homozygotes would probably all have died young, those who had not inherited genes for thalassaemia would be likely to succumb to malaria, but resistance to malaria would have favoured the slightly anaemic hétérozygotes. The modern distributions of several haemolytic anaemias show a close correlation with malaria distribution.42 Angel attributed the porotic hyperostosis and aibra orbitalia he found in prehistoric East Mediterranean skulls primarily to thaiassaemia for these reasons43 and also because its incidence decreased from the Neolithic period onwards as irrigation practices improved, the assumption being that swamps and other areas that favoured the breeding of mosquito vectors of 37 Caffey 1937; Moseley 1965; Hengen 1971; Stuart-Macadam 1082, 10,85, 1087, summarised 1 0,0,4. 38 Steinbock 1076, 217-q; Ortner and Putschar 1085, 252-4. 39 Steinbock 1076, 220-25; Ortner and Putschar 1085, 252-4. 40 Diggs, Pullian and King 1937. 41 Except in one study: Aksoy, Çamli and Erdem 1066. 42 Lambrecht 1967, 143; Harrison, Weiner, Tanner and Barnicot 1977, 230-4, fig. 16.5. 43 Angel 1964a and 19660, referring, for example, to Fessas 1 959 and Neel 1951.</page><page sequence="518">THE HUMAN AND OTHER ORGANIC REMAINS §1 495 the disease were reduced. He preferred thalassaemia as a diagnosis to sickle-cell anaemia, as the former is endemic today in the area of study. In addition, he speculated that the red blood cells of thalassaemia sufferers were equally inhospitable to the parasites of amoebic dysentery, Entamoeba histolytica, a major cause of death in the young.44 Anaemias at Ayios Stephanos Angel had a tendency to omit detailed description in his records, so it is not easy to interpret his notes on pathological conditions, although like many eminent physical anthropologists his excellent intuitive diagnostic ability would have been justified more objectively at the publication stage. I have relied on the description of his diagnostic criteria.45 Only eight examples of porotic hyperostosis, cribra orbitalia, anaemia or thalassaemia are recorded for the site. They are skeletons 9052-9053, 9112-9114, 9117, 9136 and 9157. Skeletons 9052-9053 and 9157 are described as having 'hyperostotic diploë: this may be anaemia, probably thalassaemia'; 'hyperostosis and cribra orbitalia'; 'porotic hyperostosis: ?thalassaemia' As mentioned above, it is difficult to distinguish thalassaemia from other anaemias in skeletal material, and the skull changes, found alone, could be due to a number of disorders of red cell production or inadequate blood oxygénation (although only the commonest have been discussed above), so any one of the anaemias could be responsible for these cases. The first two individuals were adults, however, and it is possible that thalassaemic changes that developed in their limb bones in childhood were remodelled during life as the red marrow receded to the skull, leaving only this area affected. Skeleton 9136 has 'porotic hyperostosis (skull vault bossing, "bone within bone" on femur): thalassaemia'. Examples that Angel mentions from Lerna,46 Bamboula and Nea Nikomedeia47 have long-bones that have become thickened by over-development of the bone marrow in the central marrow cavity, with remnants of the old bone cortex inside producing the 'bone within bone' effect. This makes a diagnosis of iron-deficiency anaemia for skeleton 9136 unlikely, but sickle-cell disease would not be excluded were it not for its modern absence from the Péloponnèse; skeleton 9136 is thus the most likely case of thalassaemia from the site. The three remaining examples are enigmatic: number 9112, an older child, has 'trace of porosity', infant 9114 is simply described as having 'trace [of] anaemia', while infant 9113 has 'no porosity [on the skull vault] but trace [of] anaemia'. There is no indication of what Angel saw on the bones of the two infants, although the first is only represented by a skull and so presumably had porotic hyperostosis or cribra orbitalia. In discussing these seven cases in the light of Angel's work, I shall begin by assuming that all are cases of thalassaemia. Skeleton 9117, an infant of only one to two months of age, had 'internal raying + [of the skull vault]', which is a feature that Angel looked for as a diagnostic sign of anaemia, but it was combined with 'nutritional failure?: knee joint may have sharp bead with flare', which does not suggest thalassaemia or any other anaemia. The flaring of the growing ends of bones, which in some cases is combined with skull vault porosity, is a mark of rickets, but this is an unusual disorder in infants under four months old, because they still have a store of maternal vitamin D from before birth; it is also uncommon in this part of the world, because vitamin D is made in the skin by exposure to sunlight. Further, rachitic 'beading' ('the rachitic rosary') is found on the ribs and not at the ends of the long bones.48 The note is inscrutable. Skeleton 9113 is also described as having a metacarpal with a 'flaring edge' with 'trace of "bead"', but the possible evidence of anaemia on the skull, whatever this was, is mentioned as a separate entity, so once again another nutritional deficiency or disorder is implied. It is clear from Angel's tabulation of ten sites from Anatolia, Cyprus and Greece that porotic hyperostosis decreased from the EBA to the Classical period and then increased again,49 but the location of sites is also taken into account. The maxima for incidence are over 50% at Neolithic Çatal Hüyük and over 60% at Nea Nikomedeia, which is marshy, the minima between 5% and 10% at latest Neolithic/EBA Karataç and Kephala, which are dry sites that would not favour the malaria mosquito and would not, therefore, favour the maintenance of the thalassaemia gene in the population. About 20% of individuals from the marshy MBA site of Lerna were affected. An elaborate study50 of porotic hyperostosis in different 'families' at Lerna in relation to their fertility, demonstrating the genetic and environmental mechanisms maintaining a thalassaemic gene in a population, is not considered further here, as it is based on an index of parturition51 that has since been shown to be weakly correlated with 44 He cited Motulsky 1060. 45 Angel 1967. 46 Angel 19640; 19660; 1971. 47 Angel 19640; 19660. 48 Steinbock 1976, 265-70; Ortner and Putschar ιο8κ, 273-8. 49 Angel 19660. 50 Angel 1067; iQ7i. 51 Described in Angel 1967.</page><page sequence="519">496 C.

ROSE known parity.52 Bisel describes 30% of the skulls at Nichoria as 'thickened',53 referring to Angel's criteria for anaemic change. Our sample is too small to make a significant comparison, but initially it appears that our anaemic or thalassaemic individuals comprise an extremely small proportion of the cemetery population: 4.9 °/o overall. Taking only those burials clearly attributed to a site period, anaemia/thalassaemia affected none of the EH burials, 6.5% (4/62) of the MH burials and 6.1% (4/66) of the LH burials. These are very low percentages compared with Lerna, which is comparable to Ayios Stephanos in both time and environment. One possible explanation is that the very high proportion of foetal and neonate remains are not yet showing characteristic signs of anaemic disorders. Baker54 states that the bony changes of thalassaemia are not marked in the first six months. Angel, however, referred to a 'curious rayed appearance' within the frontal bone of some neonates from Lerna,55 suggesting that this is the early manifestation of porotic hyperostosis as described in ancient and modern skulls by Williams,56 and that he looked for this appearance when examining infant skulls. Skeleton 9117, mentioned above, had this raying, but in combination with other bone changes that do not indicate an anaemia. Angel noted 'raying absent' in all other cases, including the supposedly anaemic skull 9114. If we assume that changes due to anaemia only exceptionally appear before six months, and exclude infants unless they show signs of the disorder, affected individuals form 10% of the total (8/80). Broken down by period the percentages are: EH 0%, MH 9.5% (4/42), LH 14.3% (4/28). These figures are still much lower than Lerna, and the LH percentage barely exceeds those from Karataç and Kephala. Two explanations suggest themselves. One is that Ayios Stephanos was malaria-free in antiquity, which would be surprising, given the marshy condition of the plain in modern winters,57 but not impossible. This would mean that the thalassaemia gene would not be advantageous and would not be selected for (because non-thalassaemics would also be malaria-free and therefore the most healthy sector of the population), so that it would appear at a much lower proportion in this population than in others from malarial areas. It would, however, need to be at a higher proportion than we find for it simply to be maintained in the population at all without selection pressures favouring it.58 It is more reasonable to conclude that, whether or not the area was malarial, this population did not carry the gene for thalassaemia; skeleton 9136 is the only case that appears likely to be thalassaemia, so if the gene really was absent from the general population this child might have been an incomer. If the bony changes of all or any of the cases are due to another haematologic disorder, by far the most likely is iron-deficiency anaemia, and if so, its very low incidence suggests that dietary deficiency and/ or parasitism were negligible, which is confirmed by the findings below. In mainly agricultural populations, iron is not obtained primarily from meat but from cereals, so these need to be consumed in large quantities unless supplemented by meat and vegetables.59 The population of Ayios Stephanos, therefore, must have had a good mixed diet. Intestinal and other internal parasitic worms and flukes are a major cause of debility and death worldwide, producing anaemia through bleeding from the gut, kidneys or bladder, and from malabsorption of food; WaJdron states that hookworms (Ancylostoma duodenale) are the most important parasites causing iron deficiency.60 It is likely then that endoparasites, and in particular hookworms, were rare at Ayios Stephanos. (it) Dental enamel hypoplasia Disruption of tooth enamel formation is shown by surface and internal irregularities,61 the location of which can indicate age at formation62 and the size of which can indicate duration.63 Enamel does not remodel, so the defects remain throughout life. The external manifestations are referred to as enamel hypoplasia, enamel developmental defects, or enamel surface defects. Pindborg has reviewed the range of causes, of which starvation and severe febrile illness are the most common.64 Angel did not find any correlation between hypoplasia and other conditions, such as porotic hyperostosis, caused by environmental stresses;65 nor is this found in British populations.66 Incisors and canines exhibit defects most strongly,67 but unfortunately these single-rooted teeth are often lost in archaeological material 52 Suchey, Wiseley, Green and Noguchi 1979. 53 Bisel 1992. 54 Baker 1064. 55 Angel 1067. 56 H.

Only three cases of dental hypoplasia have been found at the site: skeleton 9112, an older child of 1 2 to 13 years from the MH period whose slight hypoplastic lines were formed at about the age of six years and who also had skull porosity; skeleton 9125, which is an adult male of the LH period (lines formed at about two years); and skeleton 9162, an adult female of the MH period. These represent an incidence of 1.9% (3/154) overall, 3.2% for the MH period (2/62) and 1.5% (1/66) for the LH period, figures ridiculously low when compared with the 61% incidence of slight and marked cases combined at Lerna69 or the 47% at Nichoria.70 As all three sites were examined by Angel or his student, Bisel, the differences are not likely to be explicable as inter-observer variation. The unusually good conditions of preservation at Lerna71 might have led to greater recovery of teeth, but teeth tend to remain even when small, fragile infant skulls are crushed irrecoverably. It seems reasonable to suggest that the absence of defective enamel in both immature and adult teeth confirms what was said above: that the population at Ayios Stephanos had a good diet throughout the year and did not have any episodes of severe illness with fever during the time when the teeth were developing, excepting, perhaps, the infants discussed below. This is quite surprising given the time period represented, and implies a benign environment in terms of food resources and an absence of infective agents, or excellent cultural controls of that environment. (Hi) Deaths of infants Far more of the 'dead population' consisted of neonates and infants at Ayios Stephanos than at comparable sites throughout the whole period of site use. Several causative factors, some age-specific but most potentially interrelated and multiplicative, need to be considered. Infanticide or natural death of neonates Mays has defined three factors that can be used to identify infanticide archaeologically, based on the ethnographically-derived premises that newborns are not full social persons, that their killing is therefore undertaken by immediate family and without delay, and that their burial is differentiated from those of other members of the community.72 These factors are a differential location of neonate burials, a predominance of female babies, and a peak in the number of deaths at 38 to 40 weeks gestation. The first factor does not seem to apply at Ayios Stephanos, where burials of all ages are dispersed throughout the excavated area. Sex determination carried out by Angel and Bisel on the immature pelves suggested that there were double the number of male to female children interred, which, even given the modern rejection of the methods used, is unlikely to represent the reverse situation. When the pattern of age at death for those 76 individuals under 1 2 months is plotted, however, the dominance of the foetal/neonate category is marked, as shown in fig. 1 2.6. (Infants for whom an age range rather than a specific age were recorded have been placed at the median point of the range or 'divided between' ages.) Unfortunately, the gestational ages of the neonates were not determined, so the graph cannot be compared with those of Mays73 for Romano-British and Medieval sites, which covered the ages 23 to 47 weeks gestation. It is only possible to consider the broader mortality pattern throughout infancy. The initial peak of neonate deaths is followed by a steep decline, with another small peak at seven months. Most of the infants were uninformative because not precisely aged, so an alternative 'adjusted number' has been produced by dividing them equally between the specific age bands from one to twelve months, forming a pattern that reduces the abrupt neonate peak at the lower end of the graph; were they to be divided proportionately, the apparent peak would be reduced still further. The shortage of immature skeletons at many archaeological funerary sites has been mentioned already; so does Ayios Stephanos represent an infant mortality pattern closer to that which might be found in modern undeveloped countries, and which might have been normal for the past? Data for most of the modern world and for 19th century Europe and America is plentiful, but an infant mortality rate is usually expressed as deaths at a given age as a proportion of live births, which is impossible to calculate for any archaeological population and is compounded at this site by lack of contemporaneity of burials. Nonetheless, it is clear that infant deaths dominate (and, presumably, have always dominated) 68 Goodman and Armelagos 1085. 69 Angel 1971, 84. 70 Bisel 1992. 71 Angel 1971, 1. 72 Mays 1 0,0,5. 73 Mays 1993.</page><page sequence="521">4g8 C.

ROSE Fig. i2.6.'Age at death up to end of infancy, all Bronze Age periods (total 76). the mortality patterns in all but modern developed countries, and even in those countries are higher in lower-income groups.74 Indeed, so correlated is the infant mortality rate with income that it provides an indicator of the level of socio-economic development of a country or community.75 For example, in 19th century London 50% of all deaths were of neonates, whereas the modern proportion is 2·5°/ο,76 and the mortality rate of newborns in modern Brazil is nearly 20 times greater than in modern Sweden.77 Thus I conclude that it is not necessary to invoke infanticide as an explanation for the infant mortality pattern, and we should rather consider high natal and post-natal hazards dwindling to the age of five to six months. Maternal and perinatal causes and infection produce approximately half of all deaths in the Third World.78 Deaths of newborns tend to be dominated by birth asphyxia, only fatal when resuscitation methods are not used, and low birth-weight, closely correlated with maternal health and workload;79 as elsewhere in the ancient world, these were probably significant at Ayios Stephanos. Infection Infections in the Third World are currently dominated by diarrhoea! diseases, malaria and measles80 and the sequelae of HIV. The first will be discussed below under 'nutritional hazards'; measles tends to affect older children in industrial societies and for unknown reasons favours infants in undeveloped countries, but the antiquity of the disease is not known other than from references in the Arab writers of the Christian era.81 If the population at Ayios Stephanos were thalassaemic, a large number of homozygous individuals might have died before one year, leaving the less severely affected hétérozygotes to live on, but skeletal changes might be expected to be found in at least some of the hétérozygotes - certainly more than were found. Was there an infective agent operating regularly that produced an illness of such short duration that those infected either recovered without skeletal signs of the disease or died outright? Such might be the case with malaria itself. The disease takes many forms, depending on the numbers of generations of plasmodia present in the blood at any time, and these forms are well described in the Hippocratic collection and by Galen as quotidian, tertian and quartan fevers. Malaria itself produces anaemia by destroying its host's red blood cells (although it does not produce skeletal changes), and in modern times 74 Stockwell 1993, 225. 75 Gray and Payne 1993, 13. 76 Davey 1985,%. 7.1. 77 Gray and Payne 1993, fig. 2.3. 78 Gray and Payne 1093, fig. 3.1. 79 Cooke and Davies 1988, 51-2, 69. 80 Gray and Payne 1993, fig. 3.2. 81 Hare 1967, 122.</page><page sequence="522">THE HUMAN AND OTHER ORGANIC REMAINS §1 499 necessitates blood transfusions. The subtertian form, anciently referred to as the hemitritaion, is fatal primarily due to multiple capillary thrombosis of the brain and other organs.82 A particularly virulent form, recurring regularly (ancient writers speak of autumn being the season of relapsing fevers), could have carried off large numbers of infants in the absence of modern medical support. Malnutrition acts synergistically with infection but, if severe enough, inhibits certain infectious diseases, including malaria.83 Other evidence from the human remains suggests that nutrition was not markedly inadequate at Ayios Stephanos, so the population was probably not protected against such diseases. Nutritional hazards Infants frequently suffer a nutritional crisis on weaning, because their nutritional needs are particularly high and the adult diet is reduced to weaning foods of especially poor quality, usually weak cereal gruels. They are also exposed to new pathogens.84 Approximately 20% of annual mortality in the 1900s was of infants under one year old, and the main known cause was diarrhoeal disease consequent on unhygienic food preparation and general unsanitary conditions.85 Even if the child is not completely weaned but is obtaining adequate nutrition from breast milk and additional solid foods, the supplementary feeding is sufficient to introduce infectious agents. This might be the explanation of the small peak in Ayios Stephanos infant deaths at about seven months. Children surviving the dual hazards of weaning can exhibit severe developmental defects, including dental enamel hypoplasias as described above. The hypoplastic lines on the dental enamel of skeleton 9125, however, were formed at about the age of two, and those of 91 12 at around six years, so do not coincide with the peak of deaths in this population at or below one year of age. They are also widely spread in terms of age of appearance, unless weaning age had decreased from the MH to the LH period; six years would also be exceptionally late for weaning. Further, only one other case was found, although one would expect many more defects produced by weaning stress if this were a particular hazard in the population. A similar observation can be made regarding iron-deficiency anaemia, to which the infant of about five to twelve months of age becomes particularly susceptible as poor-quality weaning foods come to dominate the diet at the same time as a growth spurt.86 It has already been shown that the incidence of anaemia, of whatever kind, is extremely low at Ayios Stephanos. Time variation In the EH and MH periods, the immature individuals make up about 56% and 50% of the population respectively, whereas during the LH period they are nearly 77%. I wish to emphasise again that the samples are very small, but if they are representative of the real 'dead population' of the site, this might indicate that there were greater disease hazards to the infants and children in the later period. (iv) Other pathological conditions Twenty-one other pathological conditions are described, in 1 5 individuals. These fall into various groups. Arthropathies The terms 'arthritis', 'degenerative joint disease', 'osteophytosis' and many others of greater complexity and obscurity have been used in the past to indicate a range of pathological changes in the joints of the limbs and spine, which we would now attempt to identify more precisely and classify more logically. For example, osteoarthritis, rheumatoid arthritis and gout all affect the joints but are unrelated aetiologically, the first being due to age degeneration or trauma, the second to an auto-immune response and the last being in part a metabolic disorder with diet implicated. A scheme for the classification of the arthropathies, to aid diagnosis and provide a standard operational definition, has been produced by Rogers, Waldron, Dieppe and Watt;87 this is the scheme that I follow. All skeletal material lacks the medical history and soft tissue changes used for diagnosis by clinicians, but for joint disease there is some compensation in the accessibility of the joint itself.88 Angel used the term 'arthritis' in the case of five individuals with joint change, of which four have changes in the spine: skeletons 9006 (MH male of 34 years), 9010 (EH male of 40 years), 9043 (EH female of 30 years) and 9044 (EH male of 28 years). The commonest of all diseases found on the skeleton is 82 Patrick 1967, 242-3. 83 Garnsey 1989, 50; 1999, 49, 146. 84 E.g.

DUHIG, G. JONES, C. MOURER-CHAUVIRÉ, A. NICODEMUS, D. S. REESE, M. J. ROSE osteoarthritis, which develops with age, tends to favour males and females equally and is most clearly seen in the spine and the joints of the hip and knee; so the likelihood is that osteoarthritis is what has been observed, probably in the form of osteophyte development, new bone 'lipping' around the margins of the vertebral bodies, as noted at Lerna.89 Other, less common, arthropathies cannot be excluded, however, and if re-examination of the bones were possible I would especially consider diffuse idiopathic skeletal hyperostosis and the sero-negative arthropathies, which have some bone changes in common with osteoarthritis. The percentage of adults at Lerna with osteoarthritis in the vertebral column is 63%.90 The percentage at Ayios Stephanos appears to be less than one-tenth of this, but it must be borne in mind that most of the spine is relatively vulnerable when preservation is poor: only 70% of the large lumbar vertebrae were recovered from a well-preserved British inhumation cemetery91 and not more than 20% and 30% from a Mediterranean and western French Neolithic site respectively.92 Without any record of how many vertebrae were preserved at the site, the real figure cannot be estimated. If it appears surprising that three of the four skeletons mentioned above are of EH date, I would suggest that this is no more likely to be indicative of a higher incidence of osteoarthritis in this period than of a proportionately greater number of well preserved adults, in whom the spinal changes had had time to develop and in whose skeletons they could be observed. The EH and MH periods had a greater percentage of adults. The health significance of this is discussed above. If good preservation can be roughly indicated by the proportion of individuals that can be aged and sexed, EH burials are better preserved than the others, as a glance at the age graphs will show: about one-third of EH adults could not be aged or sexed, but for the other periods the fraction is about two-thirds for MH and half for LH. Skeleton 9025, a LH 38 year-old male, had 'big toe arthritis', which could be a part of a systemic disorder or simply the result of recurrent use or an injury to the joint. Dental disease Five individuals had some evidence for dental disease, of whom one is the EH woman, number 9043, who also had arthritis. One of her six remaining teeth was carious. Two LH individuals, skeletons 9046 and 9142, also had dental caries in one molar, but the total number of teeth present at death is not known; indeed, 'skeleton' 9142 is only represented by this one tooth! Two well preserved skeletons from the MH and LH periods, numbers 9019 and 9161, both women, had considerable antemortem tooth loss. Number 9019 only retained the mandibular incisors, but a note by Angel questions whether this jaw belongs with the skull (although it must have belonged to someone buried at the site, and is therefore still useful as an indicator of tooth loss). Number 9161 (plate A7.1), one of the two complete skeletons recorded by Bisel, had very poor dental health, with severe antemortem tooth loss (26/32), one carious tooth and four abscess cavities in the six remaining teeth and their sockets, and marked alveolar résorption and periodontal disease. It is impossible to compare dental health at Ayios Stephanos with that at Lerna, or with the populations whose dental disease is summarised in Brothwell,93 as the data is expressed as percentages of available teeth or sockets, whereas we have scarcely any knowledge of how much of any jaw is present at our site. Dental caries is present in approximately 7% of adult dentitions and abscesses in about 2%. Trauma Twenty per cent of individuals at Lerna had evidence for trauma, half having penetrating wounds or skull fractures and half having other fractures.94 Only three (1.9%) of the skeletons from Ayios Stephanos had any evidence of trauma. This is in part accounted for, as with the cases of arthritis above, by the great number of infants and children, whose springy, largely cartilaginous bones do not fracture readily and who have had little time to be exposed to hazards. Individuals who died immediately or shortly after an injury would not have sufficient development of fracture callus for us to distinguish their fractures from post-mortem damage. This said, however, the proportion is still very low. A tantalising note by Angel, most of which is lost at the top of the carbon-copy record sheet, describes an injury to individual 9100, a young man from the MH period: '[...] wound hole [in head]: not [?] _ club ?by r[igh]t-handed opp[onent].' This is presumably a head wound of the type Angel found at Lerna, which he attributed to clubs or bronze swords because of their crushed form, in 89 Angel 1971, 86-7. 90 Angel 1071, 86. 91 Duhig 1993. 92 Duhig 1995, 63-72. 93 Brothwell 1972, fig. 56. 94 Angel 1971, 91-2.</page><page sequence="524">THE HUMAN AND OTHER ORGANIC REMAINS §1 501 contrast to the clean-cut lesions produced by Iron Age swords.95 The location of injuries can indicate the handedness of the opponent, and I assume that skeleton 9100 shows a crushed or depressed fracture to the left frontal or parietal, which would be the most accessible area of the skull vault to a right-handed opponent. It is probably our only example of interpersonal violence from the site, but it would need re-examination to confirm the diagnosis and to determine the type of weapon used. A rib fragment from skeleton 9017, a 30 year-old woman from the EH period, shows a 'diagonal depression and slight convexity', which could be a well healed rib fracture, caused by violence or accident. The brisk comment 'fine inflammation' accompanies skeleton 9125, an older LH male, but a further note on the record sheet explains it as a 'triangular inflamed area in part through cortex above r[ight] acetabulum at origin reflected head rectus'. Angel is referring to the rectus femoris muscle that stabilises the body upon the thigh, which in its upper part has two divisions, the straight (anterior) and the reflected (posterior), which arises from just above the hip socket. It is one part of the large quadriceps extensor muscle that forms the flesh of the thigh. Abrupt severe strain can cause a rupture of the rectus (sometimes known as 'cricket thigh', which explains the kind of movement which might cause the strain96), but this would be expected to produce new bone in the area of intra-muscular bleeding. It is clear that Angel observed an erosive change that had penetrated partly through the outer cortex of the bone, so either an infection had entered through soft tissue damage, which is not unlikely as the muscle is superficial, or the bony changes represent one part of a systemic disorder; if the latter, there is no way of identifying the disorder without other skeletal signs. Gait and activity Angel considered a range of changes in the morphology of the lower limb bones as indicative of the gait required by Greek or similar terrain.97 The changes include flattening of the upper femur (platymeria) and upper tibia (platycnemia), produced by increased muscle stress in steadying the hip, straightening the leg and flexing the foot, and facets on the bones of the ankle joint ('squatting facets') produced by extreme flexion. Bisel's report98 on two women from the LH and MH periods respectively, numbers 9161 and 916« (plates 63-64), notes these changes, which she attributes to 'much walking and running', together with strong deltoid crests on the upper arms and other muscle developments that she believed were indicative of heavy work. It must be said, however, that there are other possible causes for the changes in the legs, and that the same changes are found in populations from areas where there is scarcely a hill worth the name.99 Studies of occupational stress markers have been summarised by Kennedy100 and include squatting as a possible cause of platymeria and platycnemia as well as of squatting facets.101 Stirland102 and Waldron103 emphasise the poor correlation between musculo-skeletal changes and modern, known occupations as a warning to the over-optimistic palaeopathologist. A fascinating letter from Angel to Taylour104 relates to the traces of activity-produced (parafunctional) wear on the teeth of skeleton 9017, a 30 year-old woman from the EH period. She 'has intriguing special excessive wear of the central incisors from some industrial process, like holding a bow-drill or spinning. The contemporary people from Karataç show similar special wear,105 but more on a single incisor-pair, apparently from pulling wool between the teeth in spinning. Tammie Wheeler reports this for older villagers in the Elmah area of Lycia.' It is not always possible to determine the cause of this kind of wear in ancient teeth, but Angel's ethnographic example is helpful in this case. It is puzzling that no other examples were found, given that spinning practices tend to be common to women in the same group, so perhaps another activity was the cause, unless this one woman had a unique method of her own or one learned from her natal group.106 Miscellaneous Three remaining individuals have been grouped together because their pathological changes are sufficiently inscrutable to prevent classification. EH skeleton 9003 is a neonate with the incomprehensible disorder of 'thin jaw'. The skull of the LH skeleton 9081, an infant of seven to eight months, has a 'thin vault with brain impressions on inner surface', which might be indicative of raised intracranial pressure caused by a range of disorders, although the convolutional markings of the brain 95 Aneel 10.71, Q2. 96 Pick and Howden 1088, 423. 97 This is described in, for example, Angel i960; 1964Ã; 1966&amp; 98 See Appendix 7 § 1 . 99 E.g.

ROSE are also found on the skull x-rays of living children whose intracranial pressure is normal; this feature should not be used as sole indicator of a pathological condition.107 An older woman, number 9137 (MH), is supposed to have had six to eight births, judged from the pitting on the pubic symphysis, which Angel correlated with pregnancies.108 It has been mentioned above, however, that there is no correlation between the number of full-term pregnancies and extent of pitting, with some pitting in nulliparous women, no changes in known mothers and an increase with age independent of parity.109 Thus 'scars of parturition' are no longer used by anthropologists. All the bone fragments of skeleton 9137 show bone loss and atrophy, with the left pubic ramus only 3 mm thick, which is compatible with the osteoporosis and pubic symphysis rarefaction of old age. (v) Non-metric traits Non-metric or epigeneüc traits are those variants found in the skeleton that are not indicative of any disorder and have, mostly, some heritable element, although the manifestation of the trait might be encouraged or suppressed by the environment. They tend to be rather small changes that have no deleterious effect, such as additional canals for some blood vessels and nerves of the skull; in life, few can be observed other than tori (bony ridges) on the palate and internal mandible, additional cusps on molar teeth or 'shovelled' incisors (having marginal ridges). Eight examples were found at Ayios Stephanos. Carabelli's cusps are additional cusps found mesio-lingually on the first, occasionally the second, maxillary molars and are fairly common in European populations. Three children had this variant: skeleton 9005 (EH) and skeletons 9112 and 9113 (MH and LH respectively), who both had the mysterious 'growth arrests' discussed above. Skeletons 9044 and 9059 (EH and MH respectively) have incisor shovelling, and 9044 shares with 9053 (LH) wrinkled enamel on the molars. A patent metopic suture, the suture between the left and right sides of the frontal bone, which closes normally by two years of age, is present in a mature adult male of the EH period, number 9010. Skeleton 9100, previously mentioned as having a head wound, has the charmingly named Inca bone. This is an additional bone of the posterior skull vault, formed by the unfused upper part of the occipital, which remains separate because of delay in its embryonic precursor cells meeting and fusing with those of the main occipital bone ('failure to coalesce'110). It is particularly common in South American skulls but appears occasionally in most populations, and its heritability can be useful in population comparisons. Angel noted that there is a trace of artificial deformation on this occipital, but as he also says that there is a moderate amount of natural asymmetry on the same bone, it is difficult to understand how the artificial element could have been distinguished. If this were a cultural practice its presence in more than one individual would be expected, so I regretfully discount it. (iv) Summary Covering a range of approximately 1 800 years, the Bronze Age 'dead population' at Ayios Stephanos consists of only 1 54 skeletons, scarcely more than one for each generation of the site's use. The small size of the sample and its wide chronological span render breakdown by periods dangerous and all findings speculative. The population is roughly equal in the numbers of males and females, but its proportion of immature individuals, especially infants, is exceptionally large when compared to other ancient or even modern populations. I suggest that the blood disorder thalassaemia, common in the Mediterranean area, evident in prehistoric skeletal material and particularly prevalent at contemporary Lerna, was absent from the living population. It is tentatively proposed that the infant and child deaths are dominated by those from malaria, against which thalassaemia provides some protection and which is otherwise rife in damp areas. There is a possible rise in the number of infant deaths through time. The group is otherwise free of most signs of dietary deficiency and disease, and in this they contrast with that from Lerna, although the poor preservation and predominance of immature skeletons must to some extent mask real disease frequencies. The few heights that can be calculated are average for their time and show the usual sexual dimorphism, although, perplexingly, children's heights appear to be proportionately greater, so that some factor must have slowed their growth before adulthood. For insights into lifestyle, there is only one example of a wound that could have been caused by inter-personal violence and one example of dental parafunctional wear produced by a habitual activity such as spinning. 107 Hawkins 1983, 79-80. 108 Angel 1969. 109 E.g.

Nicodemus [Editor's note: no survey of the modern fauna and flora of the locality was undertaken, but smaller wildlife, including snakes and tortoises, were certainly abundant and there were jackals (Canis aureus) too in 1974 (personal observation). Most of the remains analysed here were retrieved by the use of dry sieving with a 7 mm mesh, which was applied to all the earth that was excavated. Where water- sieving was used on deposits that seemed especially important, with a 1 mm mesh, this is indicated; the bones of rodents were rarely recovered unless this method of recovery was used. The remains were studied at Aphyssou in the 1970s by D. S. Reese, who used early reports of the stratigraphie contexts to compile the catalogue. However, Dr Reese combined the data into aggregations ('deposits') of excavation units ('baskets'). Since 1992 we have managed to refine, and often to correct, the datings of the baskets, but the data could no longer be disaggregated. Even the broad headings contain some material that falls outside the correct chronological range: for example, two of the baskets listed in Appendix 8 (a) under ΈΗ I to EH II Late' contained small amounts of MH material. The aggregation of baskets has resulted in some loss of precision in the interpretation of the finds of the major domestic mammals - sheep/goat, pig and ox - in tables 12.8-12.14, which are based on the catalogue.111 111 Appendix 8 (a), (h)-(j).</page><page sequence="530">THE HUMAN AND OTHER ORGANIC REMAINS §2 507 Fig. 1 2.7. Abundance of mammalian and reptilian fauna by period. The same is true of the butchered and burned bones analysed in tables 12.15-12.18.112 Moreover, since baskets of different dates were combined, the MNI (minimum number of individuals) must be understated. Fortunately many broader trends still emerge, and finds of rarer species113 were not aggregated to the same extent The analysis of this data, figs. 12.7-13 and tables 12.8-12.18 were prepared by A. Nicodemus, to whom I am most grateful. [According to the catalogue compiled by E. B. French and Clarissa de Waal, the faunal remains are now stored in Sparta Museum as follows: Area Zeta 1973, box 84; Area Beta 1977, boxes 84-5; bone assigned to EH and MH, box 86; bone assigned to LH I-IIIAi, box 87; bone assigned to LH III, boxes 88; and bone assigned to the Medieval period, box 89. Faunal remains from the excavations of i960 are stored as follows: Area Alpha, box 80; trenches Beta 5 and 7, box 81; Area Delta, box 82; source not stated, box 83. No such remains seem to have been kept from the seasons of 1959 and 1963. Although the items were too numerous to be assigned catalogue numbers, one particular find, a pig's tusk, was given a separate description: [9164. Pig's tusk, unworked. Broken across one end. L.

The exact number is unclear since the NISP (number of individual specimens) totals for each context were rounded to the nearest multiple of five. D. S. Reese analysed the mammalian and reptilian remains, providing the large dataset from which this study was completed. Only MNI information is available for the major domestic species (sheep, goat, pig, and cattle), so this measure will be used for all taxonomic quantification: see also the Editor's note above. As MNI figures are substantially smaller than NISP counts, the majority of individual contextual units do not have an adequate sample size for comparative 112 These depend on Appendix 8 (k)-(l). 113 See Appendix 8 (b)-(g).</page><page sequence="531">5θ8 C.

Consequently, individual contextual units have been aggregated into larger chronological periods (EH, MH, LH and Medieval), making the MNI sample sizes suitable for the examination of long-term trends in animal exploitation. Units with primary components that are mixed across these broader time periods are not included in the summary analyses. Additionally, a number of baskets were reassigned chronologically after the initial MNI calculations were made for the major domesticates. The format of the original data prevents the recalculation of MNIs to reflect these changes. In the original dataset, sheep (Ovis aries) and goat (Capra hircus) are classed together as ovicaprids (sheep/goat). There is no separation of domestic species from their wild counterparts (e.g. ovicaprids and pigs); these taxa are assumed to be domestic. Equids, deer, dogs, hares, and tortoises are not identified to species level and remain grouped in these more general taxonomic categories. Because rodents and insectivores frequently burrow into archaeological deposits, they will be excluded from this study to avoid contextual problems.114 This does not mean, however, that these taxa were not commensal during site occupation. The relative abundance of mammalian and reptilian fauna is remarkably stable through time (see fig. 12.7 and table 12.8). 115 The EH period, despite its general similarity in animal representation to later periods, has a very low sample size (MNI=8), which tends to inflate the proportion of rare taxa and precludes statistical analysis. Consequently this period is omitted from the subsequent discussion. Excluding this period, there is no statistically significant difference in taxon abundance between periods (χ2=6.θ3ΐ, dß=8, p=o.64). The major domesticates are the most frequent species in all periods, with ovicaprids and pig occurring in comparable proportions (25.o0/o-33.g%) and cattle consistently being less common (12.8%- 19. 7%). Each taxon differs in relative abundance by less than 10% through time, demonstrating the long-term similarity in mammal and reptile exploitation at the site. The proportion of pigs, equids, dogs, hares, and tortoises are the most stable, varying by less than 5% between periods. Equids do not appear securely at Ayios Stephanos until early LH times. A single specimen appears in a mixed MH/LH context, but equids are notably absent from unmixed MH levels, even though domestic 114 See Appendix 8 (f). 115 These are based on Appendix 8 (i)-(vii).</page><page sequence="533">51O C.

Pig body-part representation by period. horses were common throughout Europe by the latter half of the third millennium bc.116 Equids are more common in the Medieval period (4.2%) than in the Bronze Age (o°/o-i .8%). The relative abundance of cattle, ovicaprids, and deer is more variable through time, although not significantly. Cattle are most frequent during the MH period (19.7%), becoming less common in the LH period (12.8%) but again increasing in frequency by Medieval times (16.7%). Ovicaprid abundance falls between the Bronze Age (30.o°/o-33.3%) and Medieval occupation (25.0%). Deer proportions nearly double through time, from 6.i%-6.4% in the Bronze Age to 12.5% in the Medieval period. Herd age profiles are constructed for the major domesticates from epiphysial fusion stages of limb elements (figs. 12.8-12.10). Unfortunately, the sample size of dental eruption data for each period is too small to be utilized. Further, there is no age assessment of axial elements or tooth wear, which would allow more precise age estimates for later stages of life. Ayios Stephanos survivorship curves for ovicaprids, cattle, and pig from the MH through the Medieval period are compared against Payne's theoretical herd profiles for specialised meat, milk, and wool production117 in order to interpret animal management strategies through time. Ovicaprid herd structure from all periods indicates an emphasis on secondary products (i.e. milk, wool, traction or other animal resources that can be obtained from a live animal and are therefore renewable), most probably wool production, as is demonstrated by the relatively large number of animals surviving well into adulthood (fig. 12.8, table 12.9). 118 A meat-focused management strategy, in contrast, would have the majority of animals culled during the subadult phase (c. 2 years of age), in order to maximise the trade-off between investment and energy return, as well as producing higher quality meat. A mixed milk-wool strategy would yield a pattern similar to the wool profile, in that many animals would be maintained into adulthood; accordingly, ovicaprid dairy production should not be excluded. Age data documenting later life stages would further refine interpretations, as wool production can be maintained in ovicaprids longer than high milk yields. Cattle herd structure for the Bronze Age differs from the Medieval period (fig. 12.9, table 12.10119). In MH and LH, 80-100% of cattle survive past reaching physical adulthood (four years of age), while 116 Sherratt 1997. u/ rayne 1973. 118 This is based on Appendix 8 (a), (h). 119 This depends on Appendix 8 (a), (i).</page><page sequence="535">5i2 C. DUHIG, G.JONES, C. MOURER-CHAUVIRÉ, A. NICODEMUS, D. S. REESE, M. J. ROSE in the Medieval period there is a relatively steady cull-rate of animals from juveniles to adulthood, with few surviving once physical maturity is attained (22.2%). These patterns suggest that secondary cattle products were significant BA resources, while meat production was more important for Medieval populations at Ayios Stephanos. The Bronze Age cull-patterns do not conform to a milk-specialisation curve, but the exceptionally large proportion of mature cattle suggests a mixed milk/traction strategy. In sharp contrast to ovicaprids and cattle, the pig profiles all exhibit a very high cull rate of young animals, with under one third surviving past 2.5 years and at most 13.3% surviving past 3.5 years (fig. 12.10, table 1 2. 1 1).120 This cull-rate is greater than expected from the theoretical meat profile. However, it is consistent with expectations for this species, since pigs are particularly fecund, becoming fertile around 6 months old and having six to thirteen offspring per litter with up to two litters per year. Additionally, pigs have no utilizable secondary products. The proportion of particular skeletal elements represented in a faunal assemblage can shed light on the nature of animal utilisation and the likely context from which the assemblage was derived (e.g. consumer refuse versus primary butchery debris). Although complete NISP element data is not available for the major domesticates, an approximation of body part utilisation can be gleaned from limb elements documented for aging purposes. Based on the MNI figures for each period per taxon, the expected number of individual elements is calculated and compared against the actual number of elements present in the Ayios Stephanos sample (figs. 12.11-12.13, based on tables 12.12-12.14). For ovicaprids, pig, and cattle in all periods, skeletal elements that are associated with the meatiest portions of the animal, the upper limb-bones, are most numerous. This probably reflects the recovery of animal bones associated primarily with food consumption debris rather than deposits with primary butchery refuse, which would contain more meat-poor elements such as heads and feet. Very few animal bones show evidence of human modification. (Note that the butchery and burning data121 incorporates all animal taxa, including fish and birds.) In terms of specimens with butchery marks, the site average for all periods is 0.7% (77 out of 1 1,135 bones), ranging from 2.4% in the EH to 0.4% in the LH period (tables 12.15-12.16). Cattle-bones exhibit the greatest number of butchery- marks, presumably because their very large size requires more extensive processing prior to cooking. For the major domesticates, high utility body parts, i.e. the upper limbs and the axial skeleton, minus the cranium (the low utility elements are the lower limbs and the cranium), display the majority of butchery evidence. 5.6% of the animal bones are burnt, with only a very small range of variation between periods, from 4.2% in the MH period to 6.6% during LH (tables 12.17-12.18). The number of burnt bones per mammalian taxon is roughly proportional to the species' overall representation at the site, with the exception of the anomalously large number of horse bones that derive from a single Medieval context. There are no burned equid bones in Bronze Age contexts. For ovicaprids and cattle, roughly two-thirds of identifiable burnt bones are high-utility elements, suggesting that these bones are most likely derived from consumption-debris, being burned either during cooking itself or in post-meal disposal into a hearth or similar context. In summary, the animal economy of Ayios Stephanos demonstrates striking stability through time. Although there are some differences in the relative abundance of particular taxa, this variation is not statistically significant. Ovicaprids and pigs are consistently the most frequent taxa, followed by cattle. Other domesticates and wild fauna are relatively rare. In terms of management strategies, ovicaprids (mostly sheep presumably) are surviving well into adulthood, suggesting a strong emphasis on secondary resources, probably wool or mixed milk-wool production. Pigs are culled young, as is expected for this species. However, cattle husbandry practices differ through time. In the Bronze Age there is a greater emphasis on secondary products (milk and traction), as is indicated by the large proportion of older animals, but there is a heavy subadult cull in the Medieval period, characteristic of primary meat production. [It is worth comparing the situation at Nichoria, where the overall proportions of animals present were similar. Cattle comprised some 15-20% of the animals in the MBA and LBA, with a regime favouring the use of milk products, eventually changing in the Dark Age to a system of earlier butchering that is characteristic of meat-ranching.122 Pigs were kept for meat at all periods, and were second in number only to ovicaprids. In the Middle Byzantine period the proportion of cattle was higher and pigs came second, while sheep and goats were kept for wool and milk and cows for milk; deer were hunted and occasionally tortoises were eaten. At Ayios Stephanos the proportion of cattle was greatest in M H and Medieval times, and in the latter period they were raised for meat; the reduction in cattle 120 This is based on Appendix 8 (a), (j). 121 Appendix 8 (k)-(l). 122 Sloan and Duncan 1978.</page><page sequence="536">THE HUMAN AND OTHER ORGANIC REMAINS §3 513 during LH is paralleled at both Lerna and Nichoria.123 As at Nichoria, there was a shift from raising pigs and cattle in the MBA to ovicaprids in the LBA. Hunting was significant in the EBA, as is proved by the presence of deer, hares and dogs, and never ceased entirely. Hares increased somewhat in the LBA and Medieval periods, and deer were plentiful again in the Medieval period, when their antlers were worked. To judge by the burnt and butchered bones, dogs and tortoises were eaten in the MBA and LH I-IIA; likewise, dogs were eaten during MH I at Nichoria, and tortoises in LH and Medieval Nichoria.124 At Ayios Stephanos tortoises were not eaten in Medieval times, but chicken were added to the diet. Rabbits are present, if at all, only in the Medieval period. Although equids seem to have been known at Nichoria from MH I, none is attested at Ayios Stephanos until LH I- II. The 45 burnt bones, all from a single individual, found on the surface of the Medieval yard in Area Nu are best explained as belonging to a horse that was caught in the destruction by fire; it is unlikely that a dead horse would have been left there under normal circumstances.] 3.

The avifauna is mainly composed of birds that live in aquatic environments, i.e. wetlands, lakes, marshes and ponds; these are white-fronted goose, various ducks, crane, crake, moorhen, coot and snipe. Their presence can be partly explained by the fact that the site is today only about two kilometres from the Mediterranean Sea; during the occupation of the site it was probably on the coast.125 Among the species represented, some nest in Greece today, but numerous others nest farther to the north and are present in Greece only as migrants or winter visitors, namely the white-fronted goose and the snipe. These birds must have been winter visitors to Ayios Stephanos. While all the birds present might have been eaten, this is thought unlikely for the eagle, buzzard, hawk, kite, owl and crow or rook. The cut marks on the bones of the domestic fowl and the Medieval passerine and mallard, and the burnt bones (MH II and Medieval passerines, LH IIA crane, and Medieval coot), are good evidence to suggest that these birds were consumed. Gallus gallus, the domestic fowl, might be represented in Bronze Age levels at Ayios Stephanos by a proximal part of a femur with numerous, very deep cut marks (9167), from a basket that produced MH I, LH IIA but possibly also Medieval sherds. The domestic fowl is otherwise not found in LH levels but is very common in Medieval contexts at Ayios Stephanos. Reese has collected evidence for chicken in the Bronze Age Aegean.126 However, the isolated Bronze Age bone from Ayios Stephanos comes from a level with possible Medieval contamination and may be of Medieval date. The bird bones of Ayios Stephanos show some similarities with those of Neolithic to LH Lerna. Both sites have in common numerous aquatic forms and possibly the domestic fowl.127 MH Tiryns produced 17 bird bones. From MH II come 1 1 bones with one Gallus gallus, four Anas platyrhynchos, one Alectoris graeca, one Accipiter gentilis (goshawk), one Asio flammeus (short-eared owl), and one Corvus corax (raven). From MH III come six bones with two Gallus gallus and one Anas platyrhynchos. From LH I- II comes only one Gallus gallus. From LH IIIBi come 1 1 bones with one Anas platyrhynchos, four Alectoris graeca, and three Anser anser (greylag goose). From LH IIIB2 come 32 bones with nine Gallus gallus, five Anas platyrhynchos, two Anas querquedula (garganey), two Anser anser, two Alectoris graeca, one Columba livia (rock dove), three Grus grus, one Larus argentatus (herring-gull), one Buteo buteo, one Athene noctua (little owl), two Corvus corax, and one Corvus corone comix.

(iv) The Ostrich Eggshell (9214) D. S. Reese A mixed LH II-IIIA and Medieval deposit produced a fragment of ostrich eggshell. This is an imported object from either North Africa or the Levantine coast and as such confirms that Ayios Stephanos had links with these areas.130 92 14. Ostrich eggshell. Broken fragment; dimensions not recorded. No signs of use detectable, but perhaps once part of a vessel. Beta 10, 1974, # 34. Mixed LH II-IIIA and Medieval context. Not illustrated. This is not the first time that ostrich eggshells have been found in the Aegean. The evidence from Cypriot and Aegean sites and from Near Eastern tombs and sanctuaries has been recorded elsewhere;131 only the examples presently known from the Greek mainland are considered here. In the Argolid, Grave Circle A at Mycenae produced examples from two shaft graves. Shaft Grave IV132 and Shaft Grave V133 each produced two eggshells carefully made into vessels. There are also two specimens from the acropolis at Mycenae.134 These are all fully described, with further references, in Sakellarakis 1990. Helleno-British excavations in Room II (the basement) of the megaron at Mycenae produced a LH IIIB ostrich eggshell fragment;135 it measures 18 x 13.5 mm. A pit in the LH IIB- III A 1 royal tholos tomb at Dendra near Midea, also in the Argolid, produced an ostrich eggshell made into a vessel.136 A decorated ostrich eggshell fragment, pierced with a thin bronze wire, was found in a LH IIIBi storeroom at Gla in Boeotia.137 There are a number of post-Bronze Age examples from the Péloponnèse. The Argive Heraeum produced a 'bit of shell of bird's egg - probably ostrich'.138 Two samples of ostrich eggshell fragments, dating from the 6th and from the 6th~5th centuries bc, were found in the Middle Room (the Treasury) of the underwater sanctuary of Apollo at Halieis in the Argolid.139 At least one fragment in each sample has a cut edge, suggesting that it may have formed part of a vessel. Four ostrich eggshell fragments from one or more eggs were found in nearby votive fills at Temple Hill, Corinth,140 with one fragment datable to the late 7th to early 6th century bc. Also from Corinth come single fragments from a shop in the Lechaion Road141 and from the Gymnasium excavations.142 Delphi also produced fragments.143 Lastly, one broken ostrich eggshell was found at Olynthus in northern Greece between the thighs of an adult burial in Grave 348; it dates to the second half of the 5th century bc.144 130 See further Chapter 14 §§3 (vi)-(vii) and especially 4 (iii) below. 131 Reese 1985; 2000Γ, 2008. 132 Sakellarakis 1990, 289, figs. 24-30. 133 Conwell 1987, fig. 10; Sakellarakis 1990, 289, 295, figs. 31-9,57· 134 Sakellarakis iqqo, 280, fies. 41 and a&lt;'. 135 Cat. no. 1962-952, MM 11228. 136 Sakellarakis 1990, 289, figs. 44-53. 137 Iakovidis 1082, 108; Iakovidis in Sakellarakis iqqo, ^08. 138 Waldstein 1905, 353. 139 Jameson 1974, 117; pers. analysis. 140 Corinth Museum cat. nos.

S. Reese supplied the comparanda in 2006. For the location of the fish bones in Sparta Museum see my introductory note to §2 above.] (i) Introduction and Commentary Nearly 500 fish bones were recovered from 23 separate contexts in the 1973-77 excavations (one item comes from the i960 excavation). Since the quantity of bone from each context is small and the contexts are from such a wide range of periods (15 MH-LH, eight Medieval, one undated), one must be cautious in drawing conclusions from the material. For this reason no attempt has been made to calculate either the number of fish or the quantity of meat represented by the bone; such figures would be of little real value. The nomenclature used here follows that in Hureau and Monod145 and Whitehead, Bauchot, Hureau, Nielsen and Tortonese.146 Greek and other common names are given in the individual species entries in those references. Fish from six teleost families have been identified among the remains: eel (Anguilla anguilla), grouper (Serranidae), sea-bream (Sparidae), wrasses (Labridae), grey mullet (Mugilidae) and trigger fish (Balistes carolinensis) . In addition to these fish, the presence of shark or ray is attested by two calcified centra. Four species of sea-bream occur in the collection: Pagrus pagrus, Dentex dentex, Diplodus sp. (either Diplodus sargus or Diplodus vulgaris), and Lithognathus mormyrus. The genus and species of the grouper, wrasse and grey mullet have not been determined. Based on the remains, little can be said concerning the importance of the fish to the inhabitants of the Bronze Age or Medieval settlements. Most of the remains are of small fish, all probably under a kilogram in weight. Of interest are the fish bones 9216-9218 from within the MH I Late Dark Burnished two-handled jar 1849. The bones derive from at least three eels, all between 20 and 30 cm in length and from 13 to 36 grams in weight. Eels of this size are immature individuals, which inhabit rivers or littoral waters until they attain maturity and migrate to the Atlantic to spawn.147 The types of fish identified suggest a shallow- water coastal fishery.148 The eel and grey mullet in particular could be found in shallow, perhaps brackish, lagoons or estuaries. Fish remains from Carthage may also reflect the exploitation of both brackish and marine coastal waters.149 Eel like those at Ayios Stephanos can be taken by a variety of means: actively by using spears, baited hooks and dip-nets, or passively by using trapping devices such as fyke nets and eel pots or by using baited hooks on long lines.150 Traditional methods of fishing for grey mullet in western Greece, using nets and reed enclosures,151 may provide parallels for the methods used to capture the mullets found at Ayios Stephanos. Some of the Sparidae, here Diplodus sargus, are also tolerant of brackish water. The presence, in bone from Medieval contexts, of Pagrus pagrus, Dentex dentex and a wrasse indicates fishing in fully marine waters. For these species, which are predatory and tend to be territorial, hook-and-line fishing would be most appropriate. EH II Perakhóra produced five samples of fish-bones, including one Thynnus thynnus (bluefin tunny), one Thynnus thynnus or smaller tunny, and one large Serranidae (Epinephelus guaza or Polyprion americanus [wreckfish]).152 Lerna produced a small fish-bone collection. From EH III-MH come two vertebrae, one a holed Thynnus thynnus vertebra. From MH come eight bones from eight deposits, including a Sparus aurata (gilthead sea-bream) dentale, two shark/ray vertebrae (one holed), and a ray tail spine. The LH I- II Shaft Grave 2 produced a jaw fragment.153 LH Tiryns produced 61 fish-bones. From the LH I- II layers comes one Morone labrax bone. From LH IIIBi come eight bones, with four Epinephelus guaza and one Sphyrna zygaena. From LH IIIB2 come 33 bones, with 26 Epinephelus guaza, one Sphyrna zygaena, one Mugil chelo, two Morone labrax, and one Trigla lucerna (tub gurnard).

DUHIG, G. JONES, C. MOURER-CHAUVIRÉ, A. NICODEMUS, D. S. REESE, M. J. ROSE (i) Introduction The site of Ayios Stephanos is today about two km from the sea; when occupied it may have been on the coast.156 Only shell samples were collected in 1959 (45 shells) and in i960 (135 shells), with Donax bivalves being the major form saved. Careful, systematic collection of fauna began in 1963, but this material has not yet been found. The 1973 material was first examined in 1975 by Karl Petruso, who very kindly made available to me his unpublished paper and all his raw data. In 1974 and 1977 water- sieving, introduced by Jeremy Rutter, was performed on selected deposits. This material was sorted by student volunteers, and in the present study it has been combined with the material removed by hand. A word about method is required here. Each excavation unit ('basket') from each trench was bagged separately in the field and has been analysed separately. For each basket the shells were identified and the Minimum Number of Individuals (MNI) for each species was calculated (based on valve side and size for bivalves, and on selected fragments such as apices and distal columellas for gastropods). Every basket has been dated by the associated pottery. For each trench, all material of a single date was combined (on paper), and a total MNI for the trench for that period was calculated. The MNI for each period for each trench was then calculated, and a reckoning of the combined MNI across the site was then made. All counts presented here are of shell individuals, not fragments or valves. There are 8062 individual marine invertebrates in the sample saved and studied. The collection of marine invertebrates from Ayios Stephanos is the largest Bronze Age or later sample so far published from the Greek mainland. The next largest sample is from Lerna in the Argolid, which produced a total of about 8600 shell fragments (not individuals). Table 12.19 lists the species present, with their quantities and their scientific, common English, and Greek names. Table 12.20 records the species and their numbers by period. Over 99% of the species present are edible. I do not know if a few forms [Tonna, cowries, Conus, Fasciolaria, Turritelld) were eaten; some of these were certainly collected dead on the beach and/or utilised. There follows a description of the most significant shells found. The Murex shells and shell purple- dye production are described. This is followed by a discussion of the shells utilised and of those from special contexts. The conclusions discuss the molluscs as food and their use in a reconstruction of the ancient coastline. (ii) Principal Classes of Shells (a) donax (wedge shells) Donax bivalves are by far the most common species present, accounting for 71.5% of the entire collection and from 57.1% to 83.7% of the shells found in each period. Table 12.21 records the major concentrations of these shells. This species is today found buried in sandy and muddy bottoms from the low water-mark to off-shore and at depths from 10 to 15 m. At least one source notes that it 'colonizes in large numbers the brackish drainage ditches and lagoons of saltmarshes' and has a 'predilection for mud'.157 This species is commonly eaten today in the Mediterranean; at the mouth of the Nile it is the most important bivalve food. The bivalves are eaten raw or in soups and are said to be 'the best of the whole category of bivalve soups';158 as Dance reports, 'enormous quantities are collected and eaten by humans each year'.159 Donax are not often found at most Mediterranean archaeological sites. They are common at sites on Cyprus, notably at Iron Age Tamassos in central Cyprus, as a funerary offering at Archaic Greek pyres at Salamis in eastern Cyprus, and at the Temple of Apollo Hylates at Kourion in the south.160 They are also the most common shell at the 4th to 7th century (Byzantine) and 12th century (Arab) Site C at Jerusalem.161 (b) GLYCYMERIS (DOG COCKLES) (9255-9270) This bivalve makes up 4.2% of the entire collection. Many of the shells (79, 21.3%) are definitely water-worn or beach-worn, meaning that they have been collected dead on the beach and have been naturally smoothed by wave and water action. Twenty-five dog-cockles have a hole at the umbo ('beak' of a bivalve), and several others are holed elsewhere on the shell; all were probably used as ornaments. Details of several of these follow. 156 See Chapter 14 §1 (ii) below. 157 Luther and Fiedler 1976, 200. 158 A.

In addition to the shells detailed above, there are two further utilised Glycymeris shells dated to LH I- II; two dated to LH II-IIIA; one for which the context is exclusively LH ΠΙΑ; one each from LH IIIB and IIIC; and two more from Medieval contexts. Another undated shell has been ground down at the umbo but is not holed there. The water-worn but unholed shells may have been used in an ornamental or utilitarian fashion. At most circum-Mediterranean sites they are found water- worn and often holed.162 This mollusc lives buried in sand or mud from the littoral zone down into deep waters. 'Dead shells are often heaped in the thousands along the strand line and also form an important constituent of muddy gravel deposits in 20-50 m depth'.163 Lellák also notes that 'the strong and durable shells far outlast the animal that inhabits them'.164 (c) COCKLES (9271-9274) Two genera of cockles (Cerastoderma and Acanthocardia) make up 3.9% of the total collection. Since fragments of these shells are not easily distinguishable and they live in the same habitat, they are considered together here. They live buried in sand, mud and gravel just below the surface, from the mid-tide level down into deeper waters. They are today commonly eaten in the Mediterranean, often raw, but may be cooked. Cockles are the most frequent food bivalve at many Aegean sites: Neolithic Nea Nikomedeia, Neolithic and EM Knossos,165 Neolithic and Bronze Age Pevkakia, Lerna, Asine166 and Nichoria,167 and LBA and Iron Age Assiros Toumba in Macedonia.168 Ten of the shells from Ayios Stephanos are ornaments, some naturally holed at the umbo and others intentionally holed there; four are catalogued here. In addition to these, there are two that date to MH II; a further shell dating to MH I- II; two dating to LH IIA; and one undated. A number of other Aegean sites also have holed cockles.169 1(52 Reese, 1987^, 121-4; 1987^/202; 1992, 771. 1(53 Luther and Fiedler 1975, 198. 164 Lellák 1975, 156. 165 Reese 19870. 166 Reese 1082, 140. 167 Reese 1992, 770-1. 168 Reese, personal analysis. 169 Reese 1987^, 124-5; 1992» 771·</page><page sequence="545">522 C.

Lambda 2, 1974, # 54· (d) PATELLA AND MONODONTA (LIMPETS AND TOPSHELLS) These two forms are found high up on rocky shores in shallow water and occur together at many sites. Together they account for 6% of the collection. Both are a common food item at many Mediterranean archaeological sites. They were not necessarily always collected together at Ayios Stephanos, since only 94 baskets have both species, while 124 have Monodonta without Patella, and 73 Patella but not Monodonta. Patella are a common food source at Upper Paleolithic Franchthi cave and are found in large quantities at Neolithic Knossos, Saliagos, Myrtos, Kommos and Palaikastro.170 Monodonta (and the similar and related Gibbula) are also a common food source at Neolithic Kephala on Kea, Saliagos and Kommos. (iii) Murex Shells and Purple Dye Production in Laconia The hypobranchial gland from three species of related marine gastropods (Murex trunculus, Murex brandaris, Thais haemastomd) was used in the Mediterranean basin to produce a colour-fast purple dye. Archaeological evidence suggests that shell purple dye production began in Greece in the late MBA.171 The Laconian Gulf was famous in antiquity for shell purple dye production.172 This area is said to have produced the best purple after that from the Levant (Tyre and Sidon). It was Murex brandaris that was used in Laconia, and a midden of shells opened through the upper spire was visible at Gythion during the last century.173 In the 1980s Murex brandaris were found at Gythion and around the little island of Kranaë, also known as Marathonisi, though no heaps are recorded.174 The total number of purple dye producing shells from Ayios Stephanos is only 618, and most of these are Murex trunculus, not Murex brandaris. Recent experimental work has shown that 12000 Murex brandaris shells are needed to produce 1.5 grams of pure dye, enough to dye only the trim of a single garment. The number of Murex from Ayios Stephanos does not suggest that purple dye was produced at the site, as Bintliff proposed,175 nor is there any increase in the number of Murex in the LH ΠΙΑ period, as he also suggested. The largest Murex samples (percentage of these shells by period) come from the MH/LH I (15.5%), LH II-IIIA (13.6%) and LH I-II (10.1%) periods. (iv) Discussion of Shells Utilised at Ayios Stephanos In addition to the holed Glycymeris and cockles noted above, a number of other shells are ornamentals or were used in some other utilitarian manner. One MH deposit produced nine Helix land snails holed in the lowest part of the whorl. They may have been used as ornaments. Three Conus are holed at the apex and were probably pendants; in addition to the two catalogued below, there is one from a LH IIIC Early context. 17(1 Reese 1987^; 19950, 252. 171 For discussion of the actual dye industry see Reese 1980; 1987^; 20000. 172 See Horace, Odes π 1 8.7; Pliny, Natural History ix 60. 1 25-42, xxi 6, 45; Statius, Silvaei 2.150; Pausanias in. 21.6; Athenaeus ν 198F. 173 See de Saulcy 1864; Wyse 1865, 54; Gaillardot 1873, 759; Lenormant 1881, 107; Tristram 1882, 48;Jackson 1916, 12; Thompson 1 047, 2 1 2 ; A.

Karali is incorrect in recording a Monodonta ring from Kommos, the Knossos ring as from the Royal Road rather than the Unexplored Mansion, two rings (rather than one in two fragments) from LH IIIC (rather than LH IIIB) Mycenae, and one rather than two rings from Khania.186 Two are known from Cyprus. There is a complete ring from Enkomi dated Late Cypriot IIIA2- IIIBi187 and another complete example from Hala Sultan Tekke.188 Finally, half of a large Monodonta ring was found in the Upper Settlement189 at 15th- 14th century bc al-Qitar on the Syrian Euphrates, 175 km from the Mediterranean coast. One LH II-IIIA Patella from Ayios Stephanos has a hole in the centre of the shell, but this may be natural breakage and not manmade. There is a holed Natica from a context covering LH IIIC Early and Medieval (Beta 8, 1974, basket 11, from disturbed Beta burial 22). There is one LH IIIC Early cowrie holed at one end (HS 244). 190 [This was found with five beads of glass and carnelian in Beta burial 7 or 8 (infants)]. From the Medieval period there are a Mactra with a hole drilled from inside the shell through the umbo (Zeta 1973, # 36), and a Tonna (L. 60 mm) cut down the centre to make a small container (Lambda 3, 1977, # 14, from the removal of a terrace wall). (v) Shells from Special Contexts In addition to the shells noted above, several others come from special contexts and are worth specific mention. One MH I Late deposit (Nu 1, 1977, basket 56, the floor of the apse) produced four holed shells, three Glycymeris holed at the umbo (two with ground down holes and two water-worn) and one water-worn Cerastoderma holed at the umbo. The LH I- II or IIIAi Beta burial 25 (Beta 9, 1974, # 41) produced the only Turritella from the site. (vi) Conclusions The majority of the Ayios Stephanos marine invertebrate collection consists of Donax bivalves, and it is suggested that these were consumed in soups or stews, as they are commonly eaten today. Donax, Glycymeris and cockles account for 80% of the collection and indicate that it was mainly collected from a sandy or muddy beach.

ROSE and some other molluscs suggest that a rocky shore was also exploited, but this shore was either less frequently visited or was less desirable in terms of its food offerings. The majority of the fish bones from the excavation191 consists of sea-bream, found in shallow water over rocky ground, and supports the suggested availability of a rocky shore. The malacology of the present-day beach south of the site is closely comparable to that of the archaeological collection: it has mainly Donax, cockles and Glycymeris, with rocky shore forms found further south-west of the main sandy beach. The major difference is the frequency of razor clams (Ensis/ Solen) and cuttlefish (Sepia), which are found today but are rare in the excavated collection. A word on the food value of the collection may be of relevance. It is suggested that 150-200 Donax individuals would yield 0.5 kg of meat. All the 5776 Donax from the site would yield only 29-38.5 kg of meat, the equivalent of one sheep or goat. The food value of the molluscs is therefore minimal, though at certain seasons they may have been more important than at other times. Bintliff notes that the geomorphological data suggests that in the Bronze Age Ayios Stephanos was on the coast and functioned as a fishing and trade station and port.192 The evidence of the marine invertebrates and fish bones certainly indicates that these resources were frequently exploited, but does not show whether the site was closer to the sea than the 2 km distance of today, though it does not disprove it either.193 Similarly, this evidence does not support or disprove Bintliff 's suggestion that the site was occupied only during the summer.194 6. THE INSECT REMAINS, 1974-77 D. S.

Day of that Department.

Since the ants could have entered the chamber of the LH I/IIA shaft grave at some later date, their presence is uninformative. However, the presence of weevils suggests the storage of vegetable foodstuffs, which is quite probable in the case of the LH IIIC Early slab floor 4, on which were found a stone saddle quern (7276) suitable for grinding grain and a carbonised wheat grain, probably emmer wheat (9285).] Only three other Aegean sites have produced insect remains: Akrotiri on Thera,195 Kommos in southern Crete196 and New Halos in Thessaly.197 (ii) Catalogue (9279-9281) 9279.

Bintliff Author's note, 2005: In summer 1973, I was invited by Lord William Taylour to make a study of the region around his excavation at Ayios Stephanos, namely the Helos Plain and its surrounding hills. The purpose of my investigation was to place the important Bronze Age settlement then being uncovered in the context of the environmental features of the area, and to relate the history of the site to the general development of human occupation in the Helos district. I would like to record my sincere gratitude to the late Lord William for his help and encouragement, and to other members of the excavation team (especially Biff Younger) for their support during my study based out of the excavation site. The initial version of this report was published in the book which arose from my PhD dissertation.1 Rather than rewrite that chapter from scratch, it seemed to me and to the editor (to whom I express warm thanks for bringing me into the final excavation report) more appropriate that I retain the original text, completed in 1975, but add updated comments where necessary, to reflect our greatly increased knowledge on many points. What I was not able to do was to revisit the region and reanalyse its settlement history to take account of new sites or the revised dating of already known sites: for such information see Chapter 14. [Updated comments added in 2005 are in brackets.] 1. METHODOLOGY AND PREVIOUS STUDIES This study was one of a series that I undertook in Greece to form a basis for my doctoral dissertation. The general aim was the interpretation of past settlement patterns, with particular emphasis on local environmental factors. My technique was to make an exhaustive field examination of each region studied, usually on foot, plotting the nature and extent of all significant natural features, visiting all known archaeological find-spots and gathering information on present-day patterns of land-use and settlement. Since Waterhouse and Hope Simpson published their archaeological survey of Laconia,2 no notable finds have been reported in the Helos zone. Hope Simpson does the great service of providing exact locations for each site. I have no doubt that many more prehistoric sites can be found in the plain, since his surveying was extensive and pioneering rather than intensive. Certainly it seems likely, from my examination of the LBA sites, that several of even the larger centres remain to be located, given the distance between known centres and the fact that intervening tracts have important burials. The problem of picking out the smaller communities would make their known number even less representative. In view of this, I was unable to verify as general the settlement-patterns detected in the Argolid and Sparta Valley, where it was possible to suggest regular hierarchies of Bronze Age communities, and an alternation over time of preference for dispersed and for nucleated settlement. [The absence of new sites held true till 1973, but in the subsequent decades new details have been added to the prehistoric site pattern. It does not seriously affect the analysis and main interpretations presented here, however, whilst the latest settlement evidence appears in Chapter 14 below.] For the local environment, as usual the masterpiece of Philippson, Die Griechischen Landschaften? proved indispensable for tackling local geology and rural settlement. Bölte, in his lengthy article 'Sparta',4 draws heavily on Philippson's long-lasting researches for geography, but is my main source for Laconian history and ancient topography. My maps of the Helos Plain, figs. 13.1-2, are based on the geological map at 1 :50,00o of the Institute for Geological and Mineral Exploration in Athens.5 While the Institute's mapping is very useful for a general picture of the major expanses of each formation, the sheets are quite inaccurate for large-scale surface examination of small areas. It is my common experience that 1 Bintliff 19770, 451-82. 2 Waterhouse and Hope Simpson i960; 1961. 3 Philippson 1959. 4 Bölte 1929. 5 Dimadis and Taktikos 1989 (1969). 527</page><page sequence="550">528 J. L. BINTLIFF natural features of small extent can be absolutely vital to the understanding of the locational preferences of past settlements. These features are sometimes misinterpreted and often quite lacking on the ι :50,00ο series. A helpful map, with a brief note of explanation, was obtained from an otherwise not particularly relevant study of the soils of the Helos Plain by N. Memmou.6 His map shows the general relation of the sediments of the plain to the watercourses that created them, and also the former extent of the two major marshes in the area (see fig. 13.4 below). 2. THE REGIONAL GEOGRAPHY AND GEOLOGY It is worthwhile briefly to summarise the regional geography (cf. fig. i). The chief feature of the geology of the south-eastern Péloponnèse is the existence of a rift valley which runs due south-east from the centre of the peninsula to the Laconian Gulf. Over most of its length it forms the course for the main river, the perennial Eurotas. Besides this and its major tributary, the Kelephina, all the other streams of the region are winter torrent beds (the Vasilopotamos is derived from the Eurotas). On either side, this trench is flanked by lofty mountains, also running due south-east, and continuing into long rocky promontories jutting out into the Gulf. These ranges inland are Taygetos to the west and Parnon to the east; their respective capes in the sea are Taenarum and Malea. There is far more to the tectonics of the area than a simple downthrust faulting of the total Eurotas valley (fig. 13.3), but in general the mountainous flanks have risen relative to an intervening depressed trough. The sequence of the rocks composing the mountains around the trough, and appearing also in the hill-lands between Sparta and the Helos Plain, is as follows (cf. fig. 13.1): at the base, crystalline metamorphic schists, with lots of marbles embedded within them; above this, massive crystalline 'hard' limestone of two series. Between the schists and the hard limestone at several places is found Labrador porphyrite, a stone composed from labradoric and diabasic lavas and quarried in prehistory and Roman times as lapis lacedaemonius. If we leave aside the mountains, Philippson divides up the sunken Eurotas Trench into four zones, taken from north to south: (i) From the low watershed with the related Megalopolis basin to the north-west to Sparta in the south, hill-land of hard limestones and schist, with some soft limestone of later date. (ii) The Sparta Plain, once filled by an Upper Tertiary inland sea, but with the soft limestone or 'Neogen' created by this sea largely eroded and replaced by Pleistocene alluvium and colluvium. (iii) A diverse region consisting of two parts, (a) To the west, the hill country of Vardounochoria or Vardounia, directly tied to the geology of Taygetus; since this reaches across to the east rim of the south continuation of the Sparta Plain, it effectively cuts the latter off from the sea, to which the hill-land itself runs in the south-east, (b) To the east, a plateau of Neogen which extends south to the coastal plain, but which is set off from the remnant Neogen of the Sparta Plain by a ridge of hard limestone. This block of Neogen is likely to be of oceanic origin, as opposed to the Sparta Neogen which is derived from the former inland sea. It is composed of mainly coarse conglomerates, with stretches revealed of the underlying sandy marls. (iv) The depression of the Laconian Gulf and the Helos Plain, consisting of (a) to the west, hill-land relating to the Taygetus rocks, (b) to the east, Neogen hill-land, and (c) in between, the broad alluvial plain of the River Eurotas and smaller watercourses. This whole sequence takes up an area 70 km in length. It is clear that the important sunken zone already existed in pre-Pliocene times between the ranges of older rocks, and was the only part flooded during the Pliocene; the Megalopolis Plain and the Sparta Basin were submerged by an inland sea, and the eastern part of zone (iii) above and of the Helos Plain by an oceanic transgression. Thus arose the extensive layers of Neogen shells, sands and conglomerates. Subsequently the main south-east fault continued to operate, and the central part of the trough sank relative to the original surface of the pre-Pliocene valley, while the whole region emerged from the sea upwards by about 500 m. In the early Pleistocene a sinking of the land and/or rise in sea-level resulted in many areas in a coastal fringe of marine deposits, often with well preserved shell-beds, locally called poros. The combination of recent tectonics, world-wide changes in sea-level and the normal processes of erosion on the soft limestones of the Neogen led, according to accepted opinion, to the removal of much of the Neogen in the furrow and to its burial under alluvium deriving from the steep mountains beside the rift. Thus was created the fertile alluvial plain of Sparta and that of its southern partner, Helos. 6 Memmou 1967.</page><page sequence="551">THE REGIONAL GEOLOGY AND EARLY SETTLEMENT OF THE HELOS PLAIN §2 529 [Far more work has been done since 1973 on the marine coastline geomorphology of the Mediterranean Sea, although much fundamental work was already available.7 For most of the last 1 million years, the Earth has succumbed to a long series of Ice Ages, during each of which sea-level sank to a great depth as ocean water was drawn into the expanding global ice sheets. Correspondingly, during the (on average) ten percent of the time that warm conditions predominated (the Interglacial cycles), these ice sheets shrank, and the oceans rose back to the relative height of previous warm periods. Each Interglacial era would then have been responsible for coastal deposits of shells, corals, pebbles and sand around shorelines, and since the marine fauna evolved over time, or species- replacement occurred, such former coastal deposits can be distinctive either for a specific Interglacial (or sometimes a warm episode within a Glacial - an Interstadial) or even for a part of it. Absolute dating from radioactive decay and other measurements have now allowed precise positioning of such formations in time. From this summary it is apparent that a given coastline will have accumulated a long series of high sea-levels during the Pleistocene era of the last 1 million years. Their survival as fossil coastal formations is of course highly dependent on the long-term stability of the land on which they were deposited, and on their own thickness and erosion history. As one might expect, the most recent high sea-levels before our own Interglacial (the Holocene of the last 10,000 years) are mostly surviving for the immediately preceding Interglacial of more than 100,000 years ago. Beaches from the next oldest Interglacial of around 250,000 bp are rarer, and those from further back are extremely rare. Although to my knowledge the Helos Plain Pleistocene fossil beach deposits or poros have not been dated, I would now expect them to be from the last or next to last Interglacial, rather than, as stated above, Early Pleistocene. They form, however, vital clues to landscape change in our region on a much smaller time-scale, that of the prehistoric and historic occupation of Ayios Stephanos, as will be further explained below.] Finally, some particulars on the Helos district are in order. The Vrondamas plateau, i.e. the eastern part of zone (iii) above, is a Pliocene formation consisting of conglomerate overlying sandy marls, and is inclined to the se and to the w. Except in an area by Geraki, it is mainly the infertile conglomerates that dominate. However, to the south, as we enter zone (iv), the plateau breaks off with an even edge at about 150 m above sea-level and by Myrtea (see figs. 13.1-13.2); out from under the conglomerate there appears the sandy marl, which forms a tongue projecting to the south-east into the Helos Plain, reaching as far as the sea-coast near Asteri. Some hard limestone hills are exposed in places beneath them. The main plain is west of this tongue of Pliocene deposits, while a smaller one is exposed to its east. On the Ν border of the main plain the hills are of hard limestone, but at its foot there runs a small seam of the early Pleistocene poros with seashells. By the Trinisa isles there is some poros on the coast, and soon afterwards to the west the Neogen marls crop up towards Gytheion. The study of the Helos region posed something of a challenge. In the area I had previously examined, the Sparta Valley proper, i.e. zone (ii) above, the key to almost every known prehistoric and historic site proved to be the local availability of soils derived from the softer Neogen marls. In visiting these locations, mostly in the so-called 'alluvial plain', it had soon become obvious that the degree of removal of the Neogen had been very much exaggerated, while the sedimentai cover from the surrounding mountains in the form of alluvium was quite slight in the main plain. Most of the 'alluvium', e.g. in the area south of Sparta in fig. i, proved to be nothing more than weathered slope-wash of Ice Age date deriving from the Neogen hill-chain in mid-plain, and deposited between these hills onto a clearly visible pediment of Neogen covering most of the plain proper. The majority, if not all, of the recent alluvium that I confirmed as such along the main watercourses most probably came into existence in and after the Late Roman period. [My fieldwork required a reclassification of the Sparta Plain as essentially not created by its chief river the Eurotas, or even by alluvial fans radiating out from the streams at the western edge of the Plain and draining the high Taygetos range. Rather, a large part of the Central and East Plain was composed of low hills and surrounding platform deposits of the Neogen soft limestone and conglomerates which make up the hill ranges at a higher level on the Ε edges of the Plain. Only on the w could giant piedmont deposits of alluvial and colluvial origin, essentially Pleistocene in date, be observed.8 Recently a detailed geomorphological study has been carried out by Keith Wilkinson and colleagues9 in which the extent of Pleistocene (mainly Ice Age) and Holocene alluvial and colluvial sedimentation has been evaluated at several points of the Sparta Valley. This is considerable, although the role of the Eurotas remains negligible, compared to the sediments flowing from the w at the steep 7 It is summarised in Bintliff 19770, 35-58. 8 Bintliff 19770, 371-450. 9 Pope, Wilkinson and Millington 2003.</page><page sequence="552">53O J. L. BINTLIFF foot of the Taygetos chain. Causation is mainly climatic and tectonic: Taygetos has risen relative to the basin floor by 300 m over the last 2 million years, with, in addition, localised areas of erosion in the Holocene as a result of anthropogenic and climatic pressures. In conformity, however, with research published since 1977, Holocene alluvia in Laconia are not just confined to Late Roman-Byzantine times, but appear to be tied to later prehistoric and Classical-Hellenistic times.10 The implication is clearly that our expectation for alluviation in the Helos Plain should be likewise broader in time, as is discussed below.] A correlation of known archaeological sites in the Helos area with local geology, based purely on maps, showed that a number of find-spots were clearly on the Neogen hills of the east and north-east fringe of the main plain, but an equal number were on the alluvium of the plain itself. Finally two sites, including Ayios Stephanos, lay on schists. The challenge lay in the apparent contrast between the two adjacent plains, especially as regards the alluvium. 3. CUMULATIVE SURVEY OF THE SITES OF THE HELOS REGION I shall now describe the development of my field survey in the Helos region: see fig. 13.1 for the results of my examination of natural features and fig. 13.2 for topography. (i) Ayios Stephanos The site itself is a rocky schist promontory, tied in to the hillocks at the western end of the plain by limestone and schist continuations of the promontory to the west. It is surrounded on the north, south and east by dark alluvium, grey to black in colour. The sea is about 2 km due south of the site. While the appearance of the schist from beneath the hard limestone is a common situation for a spring line, and in fact such a spring was in use at the site in 1963, the farming potential of the promontory is very low. Hard limestone gives a rugged relief and weathers but slowly; hence very little soil is created from it, and this is of poor quality. Schistose rocks, on the other hand, weather very easily and contain many useful components for a good soil in terms of minerals of clays. In addition, while the limestone is porous and all of the scanty Mediterranean rainfall soon disappears into its depths, the schist is impermeable and surface vegetation thrives; as was noticed above, the combination of the two rocks makes the schist an aquifer. However, the schist produces so many eroded fragments and allows such rapid incision by streams that its normal surface is one of an unstable scree, prohibiting that further comminution and chemical weathering that would produce a good soil from the promising rock components, and giving no support to a dense growth of the less tenacious plants. Only in depressions and on plateau surfaces close to the local water-table, where schist residues are more stable, can the potential of the schist be brought to fruition. Now both our promontory and the mixed schist/hard limestone to its west lack conditions for extensive soil development, the schist hills being steep, while the limestone lacks those solution-hollows where its meagre and in any case poor-quality residues can gather to contribute a clayey red soil. However, the occupation of the site is quite significant from the EBA through to the LBA; in the M H and LH periods the wealth of finds, the evidence for imports and the suspected size of the community point to the site being one of the major centres of the plain. My experience hitherto has been that only very rarely and temporarily will a community occupy a location remote from agricultural land of high quality. The obvious solution is to take the appearance of the present landscape as similar to the prehistoric, in which case our site dominates a good part of the western half of the alluvial plain; we might say therefore that it lies on a defensible ridge above a spring, and is within easy reach of a large area of very fertile and moist alluvium. The same interpretation could be applied to the other sites known in this half of the plain. However, from my own work in the south-western Argolid, the Argos Plain, the Sparta Plain, Melos, Crete, and Euboea,11 and from the Mediterranean-wide work of Vita-Finzi,12 it is now almost certain that the vast bulk of 'recent alluvium' is post- Classical in date. While this recent sediment forms a terrace often several metres in height beside large and small water-courses, in the coastal plain it may reach far greater depths of fill. In the case of a major river such as the Eurotas, with its rare quality of perennial flow, the amount of post- Classical deposition to be expected is 10 or even 20 m. Since some hint as to the underlying landscape was needed, other sites needed to be visited. 10 See Bintliff 2000 for a review of the field in a Greek context. 11 Bintliff 19770, 173-450, 521-88, 605-66. lz Vita-rinzi 1909.</page><page sequence="553">THE REGIONAL GEOLOGY AND EARLY SETTLEMENT OF THE HELOS PLAIN §3 531 [Mediterranean alluvial history is a vibrant field, and this is largely due to the pioneering research of Claudio Vita-Finzi, and the many projects which have followed his lead in taking seriously the last 20,000 years or so of this history. When I undertook this fieldwork in 1973, I was entirely influenced by his relatively recent and iconoclastic work, having had direct experience of his insights through working for him previously in Israel. Vita-Finzi's lasting and unchallenged contribution to Mediterranean alluvial history was to argue that erosion was not a permanent and unchanging feature but was rare and violent, conforming to the model of 'Punctuated Equilibrium', where long periods of relative landscape stability are broken by shorter episodes of dramatic erosion and deposition. His further claim that the short cycles of riverine and slope deposition of eroded sediments were due purely to climatic fluctuations, or more rarely tectonic action, has turned out to be far too simple. Since Vita- Finzi's was the most recent model, I tried in my thesis to fit all the evidence I found in Greek alluvial sequences to his Mediterranean grand scheme of two kinds of alluvial formation - an Older Fill from the last Ice Age, and a Younger Fill from Late Roman and Byzantine times. Indeed, at many places the inclusion of sherds or buildings of Late Antique date, including Trinasos on the coast west of the Helos Plain, seemed to conform well to this prediction. [I have summarised subsequent research at regular intervals, as other geoarchaeologists have tested and modified Vita-Finzi's scheme, in some cases unnecessarily rejecting it out of hand.13 It remains a curiosity that I find myself frequently cited14 as an unrepentant apologist for Vita-Finzi's original scheme, by commentators who have not followed the subsequent shift in my position in my decadal revisits to the topic, where I made full use of later detailed research which required substantial revision. In the context of this volume, the question of alluvial history is of paramount importance, since the setting of the hilltop is one of a promontory surrounded on three sides by an alluvial coastal plain, whose contemporary form is clearly of recent origin. In my original fieldwork of 1973, it was abundantly clear that the modern plain was Holocene alluvium in its upper levels, with a previous stage where a smaller plain existed and the sea came much further in being almost certain. The drill-cores of Kraft, Aschenbrenner and Rapp15 confirmed this, with clear evidence for the gradual encroachment of the Eurotas delta into a larger set of bays over the Middle to Late Holocene, from the Bronze Age onwards (see figs. 13.5-13.6). [Naturally I had assumed that this process of riverine alluviation was largely achieved in post- Classical times, following the dating of the Younger Fill to Late Antique-Byzantine proposed in the Vita-Finzi chronology. However, it was also well-argued in the Vita-Finzi scheme that coastal deltas formed an exception to his model and were actively expanding over the last 6,000 years, as an independent formation to the two-phase alluvial fills postulated for hinterland river-terrace formation. Thus the Helos Plain was already predicted by the Vita-Finzi theory to have been represented by deltaic deposition even before the deposition of the Late Antique Younger alluvial Fill, which would have lifted its surface further above the ocean.16 [What has changed since 1973 is that a series of much more detailed regional studies than Vita- Finzi's and mine, including those in the Argolid, the Plain of Argos, Melos, Attica, Thessaly, eastern Macedonia and Euboea, to name the most significant, have clearly shown that there occurred a series of short-lived erosional episodes in Greece, sandwiched, as Vita-Finzi rightly predicted, between longer phases of relative landscape stability and soil formation.17 Amongst the more important erosional periods, found in more than one region of Greece, is one during EBA times, another in Late Classical to Early Hellenistic times, and one or more in Late Roman to Byzantine times. On the other hand, although some scholars have claimed that all such episodes are entirely human in origin, there has developed what one might consider to be a growing consensus that they are more likely to be due to complex interactions between human impact and climatic fluctuations.18 [What are the implications for revising my earlier view19 regarding the alluvial history of the Helos Plain? In one respect I must alter the central postulate of post- Classical dominance. Judging from other regions of southern Greece, including upstream in the middle reaches of the Eurotas Valley, heavy alluviation from that river and its Taygetus tributaries is likely to have occurred at more than one time, especially in the Bronze Age and Classical-Hellenistic times, as well as in the Late Antique to Byzantine period as I had already claimed and in part documented. Exactly how that more complex alluvial depositional sequence would have affected the wider environment of the Bronze Age settlement 13 Bintliff 1982; 1992; 2000; 2002. 14 As Bintliff 10770. 15 Kraft, Aschenbrenner and Rapp 1977. 16 Cf. the model river sequence, map 6 in Bintliff 19770, 497. 17 These studies are summarised and discussed in Bintliff 2002. 18 Cf.

Map of the surface geology of the Helos Plain, showing EH and MH sites. at Ayios Stephanos requires us to factor in what were probably more important controlling variables - namely sea-level change and deltaic coastal depositional patterns. I shall return to consider this total interactional nexus below.20] (ii) Skala: Ayios Nikolaos A short distance west-north-west of the town of Skala is a site that gave evidence of occupation in the MBA and LBA. West of Skala a group of springs emerges from the interior of the hard limestone to form a river, the Vasilopotamos. This site, Ayios Nikolaos, is located between branches of its streams and on 'alluvium'. It should be noted that in practice two kinds of alluvium are met with in Mediterranean valleys.21 (a) First, and most obvious to the eye, is the fine brown to black alluvium that accompanies present- day water-courses as a terrace of several metres height, and that forms the upper surface of all alluvial plains and depressions. In section it is well bedded and contains little coarse material. It is the most important land in the Mediterranean today, lying closest to the water-table, fresh and silty to sandy, the centre of all the lucrative horticulture and fruit-cropping. As was noted above,22 most of it is definitely post- Classical in date. It is known as the Younger Fill. (b) The other kind of alluvium is really an alluvial-colluvial deposition, i.e. much of it stems not from regular stream-courses, but from massive slope-wash. This is characteristically red and ill-sorted, forming vast pediments at the junction of hill and plain, often tens of metres thick, and leaving high above present stream-beds remnant terraces of a former deep and wide valley-fill, which, to 20 See §4 (ii). lx Ct.

Relief map of the Helos Plain, showing LH and Classical sites and modern settlements. judge by surviving examples, is often convex in form. This fill contains much very coarse material and seems to be due to periglacial processes operating during glacial periods, especially the final Wurm glaciation. It is known as the Older Fill. Where a sequence can be observed, the earlier and coarser alluvial-colluvial fill, underlies the darker, finer historic fill. The necessary traces of a disconformity and intervening weathering between the two fills have been perceived (e.g. in Attica by Paepe 1980) to fill the chronological gap of 8,000 years. In Greece, after the Upper Pliocene Neogen, with the exception of the poros, rare volcanic eruptives and the present bed-load of streams, all later deposits can be separated into these two groups, i.e. the Older and the Younger Fill. Although the alluvium marked on the maps of Philippson23 and of the Institute for Geological and Mineral Exploration24 is undifferentiated, on observation the alluvium on the Helos Plain itself, as expected, shows all the features of the Younger Fill. [As was noted in the previous update, a more nuanced chronology and division is now required, although the essence of the older scheme remains. The Older Fill had been seen by Vita-Finzi 25 as essentially deposited during the peak of the last Glacial, whereas I preferred to attribute it to several glacial phases.26 The Holocene alluvia or Younger Fill are now considered to have been multiple depositions concentrated in discrete periods of the Middle to Late Holocene, essentially from around 4000-1000 years ago. Importantly, my original summary did not add a third equally significant alluvial formation in the Vita-Finzi scheme, the Coastal Delta Formation.27 In retrospect, this formation now appears to be more important to the later Holocene development of the Helos Plain than either of the first two just mentioned, as will be shown below.] 23 Philippson 1959. 24 Dimadis and Taktikos 1989 (1969). 25 Vita-Finzi 1969. 26 Bintliff 19770. 27 However, this was emphasised in Bintliff 19770.</page><page sequence="556">534 J· L· BINTLIFF The site of Ayios Nikolaos, to my surprise, is on a hillock amid the Younger Fill, nor is the mound marked on any of the maps cited. The finds were collected on top of a knoll c. 6 m high. Below it and to the west is found a low plateau, where I found a clue to the composition of the eminence: yellow sands and fossil shell-beds. Returning to the overgrown knoll, and passing round to its east end, I came across a scarp face recently cut back by the farmer. This showed a section right through the knoll: red and yellow, rarely white, sands, with plenty of fossils of marine plants and shellfish. Most of this, then, is early Pleistocene poros; though absent from all published geological maps of the area, it belongs to the 'seam' of poros noted by Philippson on the northern edge of the plain.28 However, some of the lower parts of the hill, especially the low plateau, could well be of Pliocene Neogen. Since, in any case, the poros has most of the properties advantageous for agriculture that the true Neogen possesses, we have an interesting link to my previous correlations of sites and soils.29 But here the hill is surrounded by recent alluvium, and the visible area of soil of marine origin is very small. Across the marshy Younger Fill to the edge of the hard limestone hills to the north, I noticed traces of similar deposits of small extent running into the alluvium; without doubt they link up to our knoll underneath. Further south into the alluvium another knoll appeared, of about the same height and similar composition. [As was remarked earlier, the poros marine beach-formation should probably be attributed to the most recent high sea-levels of the last Interglacial and its preceding equivalent, rather than to the Early Pleistocene.] (iii) Ayios Ioannis and Xeronisi Further west, beside the main road between Sparta and Skala and on the edge of the hard limestone hills above the level surface of the plain, I found the site of Ayios Ioannis, described by Waterhouse and Hope Simpson as a 'small terrace' with a few Mycenaean sherds and some Classical material.30 The location is a thin strip of yellowish-white sandy marls overlying the lower edge of the hard limestone, and again disappearing to the south under the marshy black soil of the plain. A pattern was beginning to appear: again, this was admittedly a small area but ignored on the maps, and just here we get early occupation. The remarkable site of Xeronisi lies some way out into the plain s of the last site. A considerable amount of EBA, MBA and LBA pottery is reported, together with some Classical sherds. As usual, it was not picked out from the alluvial plain on the geological maps. After I crossed the several hundred metres of intervening moist plain soil with its countless drainage-canals, a long and low 'island' appeared to rise out of the muck: hence the name Xeronisi or 'dry island'. Of course its composition turned out to be yellow sandy marl. The mound is quite extensive but was formerly a good deal higher than today, the upper surface having recently been artificially levelled. This may well have been to remove the original upper surface of conglomerate that characterises the top of many of the less eroded marly hills of the eastern side of the Helos Plain. At present the highest preserved section of the hill is only a few metres above the muck of the surrounding plain, and its long axis might measure c. 100 m. (iv) Lekas Panayiotis and Lekas South A number of sites are known in a raised area that takes up the north-west corner of the plain, to the north of Ayios Stephanos and separated from it by dark alluvium. The corner itself is marked as 'alluvium' by Philippson31 but grouped by the Institute for Geological and Mineral Exploration as 'slope wash, conglomerates etc.'.32 1 spent some time criss-crossing this zone, which consists of rolling hills at the most 15m above the floor of the plain. An important natural feature for its understanding is found just north-east of it, where, by the main road, a side-valley runs into the plain. The deeply incised stream here is accompanied on either side by a heavily concreted red terrace of typical Older Fill, extending at a steepish angle from the hard limestone hills to the east and west of the valley. This red alluvial terrace can be followed a short way south below the road, till it disappears under the fresh dark Younger Fill of the plain. Just before its disappearance and on its western edge, where it adjoins the Lekas hill-group, I found a well-shaft. The shaft had been freshly cut into the bright red Older Fill, and the latter was visible forming the sides of the shaft for a depth of 3-4 m into the ground. However, beside the well was the earth tip from the excavation of the shaft. The top layer was fine yellow marl of Neogen type; then, in reverse stratigraphy, the red deposits formed the bulk of the tip. Though the level at which the marl appeared was too dark to discern in the lower reaches of the shaft, it was clear 28 Philippson 1959. 29 See §2 above. 30 Waterhouse and Hope Simpson i960, 95. 31 Philippson 1959. 32 Dimadis and Taktikos 1989 (1969).</page><page sequence="557">THE REGIONAL GEOLOGY AND EARLY SETTLEMENT OF THE HELOS PLAIN §3 535 that it had been penetrated not far below my estimated depth of 3-4 m. Now the Lekas area has a surface cover of poros shell-beds, but its main structure consists of alternating soft clayey-sandy marls and pebbly conglomerate. The former beds should be early Pleistocene, the latter Pliocene Neogen. Since it is difficult to differentiate by eye the sandier parts of these two marine formations, the discovery of the well is important, since here the clayier Neogen was well down, and the combined height of the hill-group is inconsistent with the normally quite thin cover of poros. On either side of the red deposits the marls come to the surface and rise up onto the hills, which show the characteristic ledges of harder Neogen.33 1 conclude that the bulk of this raised area is weathered Neogen hillocks, covered in places by a thin layer of poros conglomerate and shell-beds, and later covered at the sides and in its lower parts by red alluvial/colluvial deposits which are derived, respectively, from adjacent streams and from its own slope-wash. The numerous sherds found all over these hillocks reflect once more the preference of early settlers for the Rendsina silts formed on Neogen.34 The main site is Lekas Panayiotis, a considerable prehistoric settlement with EBA and MBA sherds and major finds of the Mycenaean period, e.g. a thick defensive wall, a figurine and plentiful pottery, with some Classical and Hellenistic material. The reoccupation of these sites in historic times will be discussed below;35 again they exhibit the preference for Neogen soil. 200 m south-west, and still in the hillocks, another site yielded MBA and LBA and Classical sherds; surface pottery continues among the hillocks till, at the southern edge of the raised area, where the hills are at their lowest, a low mound called 'Lekas South' is found, with probable Neolithic occupation, and definite EBA to LBA, Classical and Hellenistic. This last site is situated where, within 50 m or so, the marls sink under the dark, even plain that runs south to the promontory of Ayios Stephanos. (v) TSASI, ROMAÏKA AND KOKKINADA Proceeding north-east of Skala and travelling up the valley of the Eurotas, one leaves the flood-plain and, with but narrow terraces of Younger Fill on either side, is soon shut in by hills of hard limestone. After 1 km, where the main river veers to the nw, we take a tributary valley northwards. This valley is, on the surface, dry and little incised, filled with red clayey Older Fill sloping down from the low hills on either side. After only a short distance we are at the watershed into the rectangular depression that is bounded on the north and north-east by the villages of Tsasi and Myrtea. Just at this point the soil changes colour from red to yellow, and I notice a krater-fragment of Geometric or Archaic date on the ground. The north-west to south-east ridge that bounds this side-plain on the west is composed of a core of hard limestone with an overlay of marl that reaches, on the east and north-east sides, almost to its top. Right on the north-east corner, in fact, a hill stands out somewhat from the ridge. This is called Romaïka with reference to its antiquities, and those collected by Waterhouse and Hope Simpson36 constituted Classical and Hellenistic tiles and sherds, as usual locally concentrated on the Neogen areas. From here the Neogen sweeps to the north, in its soft form as far as the hamlet of Phlision, and around to the east through the village of Tsasi and across to the large village of Myrtea. Several tongues of Neogen descend from the area of Tsasi into the alluviated side-basin to the south, and a major tongue reaches from Myrtea to the main road that marks the junction of the side-plain with the main plain. All the Neogen in this area is dotted with sites. What is quite important is that the natural frontier at about the level of Myrtea is respected, i.e. where the Vrondamas plateau of Neogen loses its infertile cap of conglomerate. From here southwards the fertile sands and clays beneath it are presented, and only below this line do we have traces of occupation. Not far south of the border just noted, and built into the conglomerate scarp, there is a chamber tomb of Late Mycenaean date, about 500 m east of the village of Tsasi. On the hills round about EBA, LBA, Classical and Hellenistic pottery is known, especially to the south. Along the marly tongue of Myrtea there is a large red hill named for its colour 'Kokkinada', about 1 km north-west of Vlachioti. Late Mycenaean sherds were found on it, and two possible chamber tombs are located on a low Neogen knoll below it to the west. EH and Classical pottery appeared on a hill 200 m north of Kokkinada along the tongue of marl. Myrtea itself, not visited by Waterhouse and Hope Simpson, may be the answer to the lack of a major Bronze Age centre in this fertile side- basin; for we have one definite and two possible chamber tombs for such a settlement, and my experience in other regions has shown that local administrative units, at least in the LBA, appear at regular intervals over the landscape. The nearest major centres, i.e. Ayios Stephanos, Lekas Panayiotis, Asteri and Ayios Strategos, are too remote from this natural pocket of fertility. Either the centre 33 Cf. my study of Sparta in Bintliff 19770, 371-450. 34 Cf. my other studies in Bintliff 19770. 35 See §4 (iv). 36 Waterhouse and Hope Simpson i960, 94.</page><page sequence="558">536 J. L. BINTLIFF underlies Myrtea, as Hope Simpson has suggested to me,37 or further detailed survey of the localities where finds have been made may reveal a major concentration of settlement. (vi) Vlachioti, Asteri-Dragatsoula, Asteri-Karaousi and Ayios Strategos Near the town of Vlachioti the British School in the early 1900s found ancient column-drums,38 while Kahrstedt reports a Roman villa.39 Waterhouse and Hope Simpson locate Classical and Hellenistic pottery on a hill a little west of the town centre.40 This corner of the Helos Plain consists of alluvial flood-plain to the east and south, with a giant ridge of Neogen marls and conglomerate descending from the Vrondamas plateau due south-east as far as the coastal marshes. Within the hillocks at the edge of the latter nestles Vlachioti, and the hill with antiquities is similarly placed. Between this hill and Kokkinada on the parallel but smaller tongue on the west runs the Bourba stream. The whole depression between these hills has been mapped as alluvium, but again we find that much of it is gently undulating marls, sometimes with a thin veneer of alluvium. In the centre of the depression the river has incised into its own bed to a depth of 2-3 m, and in its well-bedded Younger Fill section I recovered pottery from over 2 m down, regrettably undateable but at least showing how recently the fill accumulated here. Doubtless the marls extend at no great depth under the alluvium to join up the two tongues on the west and east. A number of sites are known amongst the Pliocene hill-chain which, as was noted, runs down through Vlachioti past Asteri to the sea, and cuts off the main plain from the smaller one to the east (this is left out of the present study). At the northern end of the chain, some hard limestone appears as a cliff under the marl, but soon disappears as the hills decrease in size to the south-east. Up on the hill- tops here, just south-east of Vlachioti, there is fine plateau land, and by a farm-house Mycenaean and Classical pottery. Below, at the foot of the cliff, a gorge in the hard limestone has a fan of Older Fill where the torrent meets the even plain; this fan is incised and partly filled with dark Younger Fill, and is now being incised again. 2 km north of Asteri and also up on the fertile hill-tops there is a small Mycenaean site with Classical finds and also possible Medieval buildings. Only 200 m north of the village of Asteri is a large hill, Karaousi, with a long and rich record of occupation, beginning in the Neolithic, continuing in the EBA, MBA and LBA, and with Protogeometric or Geometric, Classical and Hellenistic material, while of course present-day Asteri is immediately adjacent. Here some would see Homeric Helos. Unfortunately surface collection proved more successful than trial excavations,41 since heavy erosion accounted for the wealth of surface pottery but had also caused the loss of settlement features. To the east, a scarp of conglomerate with a good scatter of Mycenaean, Dark Age and Classical pottery contains a number of collapsed 'caves' that quite possibly represent a series of Mycenaean chamber tombs. Not far to the south-east of the village of Asteri and on top of a hill above the marshy plain lies Asteri-Dragatsoula. This site has EBA to LBA sherds and, along the top of the marls, a good surface cover of poros shell-beds. In addition, to the west of the road entering Asteri from the north, there is a very low marly promontory surrounded by alluvium, on which a good quantity of pottery appeared, some of which I identified as Classical. In the hills to the east of Asteri Wace and Hasluck42 reported finds of 'antique marbles', tiles and sherds at 'Sto Manolaki'. The locals referred this name to the whole area from Asteri to the ridge in the centre of the marly hills to the east, though Waterhouse and Hope Simpson in their visit to the site suggest an actual location within this zone.43 In fact Classical, Hellenistic and Roman material is abundant all over this area, from the hinterland of Asteri down to the coast at the southern end of the hills. At the very end of this hill-chain the heights descend lower and lower; finally the marls have almost disappeared under the alluvium of the plain when they meet a small coastal marsh only about 200 m from the sea. At this point a number of low hills with a chapel mark the major site of Ayios Strategos, with important finds from the Neolithic, EH to LH and Classical periods. The Mycenaean material includes a small tholos tomb, always a mark of local royalty and the only one known from the Helos area. The site consists of two parts. The western part consists of the ridge with the chapel and has Neolithic, EH and Classical finds, with, on the hills to the north, the remains of an undated building. The eastern part is an eminence with EBA to LBA sherds. Somewhat between the two, and northwards, the uppermost tip of the tholos appears out of a marly hillock. Again between these two, but to the 37 Pers. comm. 38 Hondius and Hondius-van Haeften 1010-21, 150. 39 Kahrstedt 1954, 212. 40 Waterhouse and Hope Simpson i960, 92. 41 Taylour iQ72, 262-^. 42 Wace and Hasluck 1907-8, 161-2. 43 Waterhouse and Hope Simpson i960, 89.</page><page sequence="559">THE REGIONAL GEOLOGY AND EARLY SETTLEMENT OF THE HELOS PLAIN §3 537 south, the ground is very low indeed, the marl sinking to sea-level; a lagoon enters the small depression here, today only 150 m from the site. The location has Neogen to the north-west, north and north-east, and, if it was a port, two beaches on either side, since the smaller ε plain is half-composed of Younger Fill with Neogen hillocks to the rear. If this was a local administrative centre in the Mycenaean period, its 'territory', in the light of my territorial studies in Argos and Sparta,44 would have included its harbours and all the Neogen up to Vlachioti, with a good portion of the Neogen in the upper parts of the ε plain as well. Another site is known at about the level of Vlachioti and to its east, corresponding to our sites near Vlachioti, and at the outer limit of the effective exploitation from Ayios Strategos and Asteri. (vii) Trinasos and the Lagio Site West of the promontory of Ayios Stephanos, the plain is rounded off by rocky hills belonging to the Taygetus complex, i.e. schists, porphyrite and hard limestone. As was noted above,45 their general appearance is unfavourable to settlement and soil development is limited in the steep scree-filled valleys, where in fact much of the soil is clearly developed on the terrace of Younger Fill. Stephaniá, the only village in this western half of the plain, and the nearby hamlet of Souli, have the main part of their fields in the plain itself and in the Lekas Neogen, using the hinterland of older rocks for pasture and very extensive olive-culture, i.e. with widely spaced trees. However, two sites are known in this hinterland. The first, Trinasos, is on the coast several km south-west of Ayios Stephanos. Here we have reports of a large fortification, said to be of Classical date, on the plateau above the coast; I was unable to locate its exact whereabouts but it certainly lies not far above the remains of an ancient harbour by the Trinisa islands. These three islets are linked up at a shallow depth under water, and once formed a natural breakwater for boats, apparently anciently aided by sea-walls. The name 'Trinasos' occurs as that of a Perioecic community in the Classical period,46 i.e. a subservient harbour of the Spartans, who we know to have personally occupied the Helos plain. But the major feature to be seen in this area is a remarkable underwater site noted by Kraft.47 In a long but narrow inlet just west of the remnants of the three-island harbour, and with its surface courses above the waves, there can be seen a large complex of walls running from the beach of the inlet 8 m or so into the sea. They form a regular rectilinear plan, and built of stone and concrete that seems to be of the Roman rather than the modern type. On my visit there I was able to gather pottery (Late Roman Combed Ware amphorae sherds) from the chambers. J. G. Younger kindly identified them as being Late Roman to Early Byzantine in date, i.e. 4th~7th centuries ad. This site is of interest, as the inlet has a well-preserved terrace of dark Younger Fill, which is at present being incised by its stream and eroded by the sea. This terrace contains Late Antique pottery and forms an abrupt scarp about 1 m high at the landward end of the beach, which would be c. 2 m above sea-level and the building-complex. Sand has accumulated around the terrace. However, since it is clear that the sea has risen relative to the land in this area, and that the deposition of the Fill should correspond with a lower base-level at the seaward end, taken together with the broken scarp- face of the Fill itself, we can safely conclude that, at the end of the deposition, the Younger Fill here extended for some distance into the present inlet and the sea was further out than it is today. The exact former shore-line might be indicated by the angle of the Fill: if we extrapolate the angle of the fill-beds, which are obviously graded to the old shore-line, they would have entered the sea, even at today's level, well beyond the building-complex. My interpretation of the situation is this: an inlet of the sea received from a stream sediment which, by Late Roman or Byzantine times, was thick enough to allow the construction of a substantial building. Subsequently alluvium overwhelmed the complex, but this was removed by the more recent marine transgression, and to a lesser extent by stream-incision from behind on the landward side. The structure, now mainly under water, was revealed again, but sand accumulation prevents the sea from continuing its erosion of the fill into the scar left from its former attacks. These events may be closely paralleled by identical events in the Classical harbours of Melos and Aegina,48 and points to Aegean-wide contemporary processes of sedimentation and marine transgression, as also to intensive human activity along the coast. Whether the local occurrence of poros and possible Neogen on this rugged coastline was connected to the reported ancient community I cannot say, since I did not locate the ruins inland. But the area is hardly likely to have provided a livelihood for anything but a marine community, unless the main centre of Trinasos lay inland near Lagio, whence a valley does indeed lead to this inlet. 44 Bintliff 10770, 271-450. 45 See §3 (i). 46 Bölte 1929. 47 Kraft 1972, 98-101. 48 Cf. on Melos Bintliff 19770, 521-88.</page><page sequence="560">538 J. L. BINTLIFF The site near Lagio is a good hour on foot from Ayios Stephanos, as one heads up into the hills to the west. It is mostly wretched and infertile country, alternately hard limestone with very little soil indeed and schist that is too steep and scree-like for farming. However, about half-way to the site I found myself emerging from the rough country onto a high but flat depression of schist between towering ridges of hard limestone, running as expected north-west to south-east from Krokeai to Trinisa. Above, on the western ridge, is the village of Lagio, while 20 minutes' walk along the fertile plateau to the south is a conspicuous hill, where Waterhouse and Hope Simpson collected a good amount of EH and Mycenaean pottery.49 As was noted above,50 given certain conditions schistose formations can produce very fertile soils, but these prerequisites are rarely met. In this depression, however, controlled both by differential erosion in comparison to the harder limestones and by tectonic sinking along the regional fault-lines, the necessary closeness to the local water-table and the absence of erosive incision allowed the stable development of a mature schist soil. The plateau is notably without parallel in fertility, and is clearly the centre of the food-supply and farmland of modern Lagio, as it patently was for the prehistoric community. The way in which the early site dominates this oasis of good land, the absence of other local sites, the quantity of finds and the distance from the nearest contemporary centres argues strongly for its status as a local centre in its own right. Its easy links downstream to the sea by sheltered Trinisa gave it its own port-facilities, and we may look up on this plateau for the Classical community of Trinasos. (viii) Concluding Observations To complete the picture of major features, human and natural, observed in the Helos region, three low rises peeping above the evenness of the plain, and entirely unnoticed by previous visitors to the area, will be of aid to our analysis. The first can be found to the east of Lekas South. 100 m into the plain from the low Neogen of the site, I observed a very low rise; on it a few coarse sherds, possibly prehistoric, were visible, and the hillock of marl, strikingly yellow amid the black of the surrounding alluvium, is perhaps 20 m long by 1.5 m high. Secondly, about 140 m south of the road between Skala and Vlachioti, midway between the Kokkinada ridge and Vlachioti, is a small but steep hillock rising several metres above the plain. It is composed of conglomerates and yellowish- white sands, probably poros with possible Neogen at its base, especially on a small ledge at its northern edge. In any case it is certainly a remnant of eroded or sunken pre-alluvial marine deposits, and belongs to the two tongues of Neogen further north across the road. Finally, to the north of the same road and this time between Kokkinada and Skala, within the alluvium of the Tsasi side-basin, low undulations culminate in a hillock about 1 m above the plain, with remains, as I was told, of a chapel. These could well be submerged 'marine' sands and marls, running into the side-basin from the north, west and east, since the torrents feeding this basin are all insignificant and the Younger and Older Fill are unlikely to be very deep here. The tectonic effects which could be involved, with a pattern of regular troughs and lateral faulting within the regional south-eastern trend, are shown in fig. 13.3. 4. ANALYSIS: THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE REGIONAL LANDSCAPE (i) The Regional Soils With the exception of the locally remarkable schist plateau of Lagio, the as yet unexplained promontory of Ayios Stephanos, and the harbour site of Trinasos, I hope to have demonstrated that, despite first appearances, all known prehistoric and pre-Medieval findspots are confined to Pliocene and Pleistocene marine sands and marls. One has only to consider on the maps (figs. 13.1-13.2), how much of the landscape exhibits no trace of occupation, to see that our sample is no random one, but shows a very clear locational preference, and one which is to be found equally strongly in the Sparta Valley, in the Plain and Peninsula of Argos, in the Ayiopharango of Crete, and on the islands of Aegina and Euboea. As I have shown elsewhere,51 Mediterranean soils can be put into three broad groups: (a) the hard limestone soils, sometimes called terra rossa, which are, except in karst depressions, poor in quantity and quality; 49 Waterhouse and Hope Simpson i960, 105. 50 See §3 (i). 51 Bintliff 19770.</page><page sequence="561">THE REGIONAL GEOLOGY AND EARLY SETTLEMENT OF THE HELOS PLAIN §4 539 (b) the metamorphic and volcanic group, which generally have a high potential in the parent rock but where favourable conditions for soil development and for the entering into availability of fertile properties in the rock are very rarely met with, e.g. the schist discussed above;52 (c) the soft limestone group, which developed on the sands and marls formed in shallow seas, most commonly of the Pliocene period. This is highly fertile soil, the 'Rendsina' of the old classification, and one which very easily weathers into a favourable soil, and is also very light for the purposes of cultivation. The Rendsinas have a particular ability to retain moisture and humus, i.e. the nitrogen so lacking in most Mediterranean soils. [(d) a fourth group of soils must of course be added, those developed on the older Pleistocene alluvia- colluvia (the Older Fill series) and on the Holocene alluvia (the Younger Fill series).] However, whilst the early settlement in the other areas mentioned above can obviously be shown to concentrate on the Rendsinas, because there they form extensive zones of easily-worked fertile soil, in our area most of the sites on the Neogen exist merely as small islands of Rendsina amid the alluvium. I have already begun above53 to set out the evidence that this alluvium is, to a depth of many metres in our plain, a post- Classical deposition. The pottery of the fill in the Bourba valley, the relationship between the Late Roman or Byzantine building at Trinisa and the fill 2-3 m high behind it, and the complete absence of any ancient or prehistoric finds from the alluvium of the plain, are wholly predictable from my own work on the Younger Fill elsewhere in Greece and from that of the geomorphologists cited above.54 [However, as was noted earlier, we now consider the Younger Fill to have been deposited in discrete periods during the last 4000 years, of which one, the Late Roman- Byzantine, may be evidenced at Trinasos.] The key to the reconstruction of the pre-Roman landscape, essential to set our sites in their original environmental context, lies in regional tectonics, which is a long-term and fairly consistent moulding force in landscape-evolution all over Greece. The reader will no doubt have noticed, from my geographical discussion and perhaps from the maps (figs. 13.1-2), that there is a dominant south- easterly trend to all the mountains, hill-chains and valleys in Laconia. In this direction some areas are consistently depressed, whereas others are relatively uplifted, i.e. experience relative uplift. Again, along this north-west to south-east line there is a consistent downward faulting towards the sea. Although in places the transition between 'down' and 'up' areas is abrupt and a cliff is found, e.g. where the Taygetus massif meets the Sparta valley, in most cases we can find examples where the uplifted or remnant raised zones are warped at the edges, i.e. to east and west there are steps leading down to the sunken zones, fig. 13.30 illustrates these three tendencies, and fig. 13.3ε shows schematically their operation in the topography of the Helos area. We know that these processes have consistently operated from pre-Pliocene times, and the fact that I found Pleistocene marine deposits only on the lower hillocks of the Neogen, namely the lower Lekas surfaces, Ayios Nikolaos, and Asteri-Dragatsoula, is a strong argument that already by that time the pattern of alternating 'ridge and furrow' hill-chains in a south-eastern strike had been created by faulting continuing from what was certainly, at the end of the Pliocene, a level plateau of marine beds. Now the low Neogen features on fig. 13.1 can be tied into down- warping to east and west from south- eastern dipping and ordered ridges, and the bridging saddles and hillocks that must connect the smaller to the larger hills are certainly to be found at no great depth. We have already suggested the necessity of picturing the area minus the top 5 to 1 5 m of recent alluvium, and this would definitely reveal these linking deposits. What I am putting forward, then, on field data is the existence of a buried landscape, whose form is in many places barely hidden by later sediments of terrestrial origin. In the north-west, north and north-east parts of the plain, this landscape was one of alternating high and low hill-groups of fertile Neogen, which formed the centre of all pre-Roman occupation and agriculture, apart from the exceptions noted above. [The revision required here is to expand more clearly my original comments55 regarding the Eurotas Deltaic Fill. In the Vita-Finzi scheme, during Interglacial high-sea-levels, rivers always had bed-loads, and if the load was not very high, the bulk of it was deposited at the endpoint of the river system concerned, i.e. the sea or a lake. But when erosion increased, rivers proved unable to transport all their increased load (technically they lost 'competence') and deposited this along their courses, not least increasing the angle of downward flow, which further assisted in giving the streams more energy. For Vita-Finzi, therefore, the 'normal' phase of Mediterranean streams in an Interglacial period was associated 52 See §3 (vii). 53 See §3. 54 See §3 (i). 55 Bintliff 19770.</page><page sequence="562">54&lt;&gt; J.

Tectonic trends in the Helos Plain: (β) generalised pattern (not to scale); (b) actual operation in Helos topography. with the creation of coastal deltas, and minimal inland riverine deposition of alluvia. Conversely, once high erosion began, coastal erosion would decline and stream-loads would pile up along the hinterland valleys. The implication of this for the Helos Plain was straightforward: we would expect the formation of a Eurotas delta from later prehistory onwards, which might at times of hinterland alluvial episodes have reduced its growth. I had assumed that the effect of the Younger Fill would have been to thicken the coastal delta, converting deltaic marsh into a genuine plain, at least in the inner Helos Plain. The existence of this proto-plain was indeed supported by the Homeric name Helos or 'marsh' for the entire region. One must now accept that there were probably several alluvial phases of Eurotas alluviation in the last 4000 years, each of which could also have built up the inner delta to drier and potentially cultivable land. Since Ayios Stephanos has major Bronze Age occupation, this certainly implies that, during the major phases of the settlement there, parts of the Holocene alluvial plain could well have formed a significant agricultural resource alongside the much older soil types which I have just discussed. Exactly how much of the alluvial plain existed in the Bronze Age is a point I shall return to below.] The place of the Older Fill should be considered. I noted fine examples in the small valley north- east of Lekas Panayiotis, which sank rapidly under the plain and at a good angle, and also in the small fan at the mouth of the gorge near Asteri.56 Between marly hills the usual effect that I have noted elsewhere occurred: reddish slope-wash fills the intervening hollows and represents the Older Fill in Neogen deposits. The Older Fill has been shown to grade to a sea-level much lower than that of today; since its last height of deposition was climax Wiirm, we know this level to be c. 100 m below 56 See §§3 (iv) and (vi) above.</page><page sequence="563">THE REGIONAL GEOLOGY AND EARLY SETTLEMENT OF THE HELOS PLAIN §4 541 the present sea-level. The steepness of our valley-fill could be used, small sample though it is, to suggest that at the time of its formation the Gulf was much further out to sea than it is today, with a far lower sea-level terminus, and that a considerable amount of the sediment that is now in it, whether marine or terrestrial, did not then exist. A core drilled within the plain proves this,57 with c. 40 m of fill dating from after 7,000 bc (see core EB-2 in fig. 13.5). In our prehistoric occupation, then, the Neogen hill-chains would exhibit Older Fill wash of their own composition in depressions, e.g. the Tsasi side-basin where, as we know,58 only a shallow Younger Fill is suspected and older features are almost visible on the surface - a situation incompatible with the absolutely even surface of the Younger Fill; some of this basin should consist of derived marls amongst low marly hillocks. The Older Fill should also appear at no great depth between the knolls with sites near to and west of Skala, where these knolls are certainly not joined at great depth and a direct sediment-bearer is lacking. In this area, in fact, I observed undulations in the plain that cannot be due to the Younger Fill but should reflect older features now obscured by ploughing. In any case, the date from core EB-2 of after 7,000 bc (fig. 13.5) precludes any older fill from creating an extensive body of land in our plain after the post- Glacial rise in sea-level. The plain was not created till early Medieval times, long after this transgression. [The bulk of this analysis remains correct. The Helos Plain at the end of the last Ice Age would have consisted of undulating Neogen and poros hills, between which had been deposited Glacial Older Fill sediments, grading and descending to some 100 m below modern sea-level and to a Glacial shoreline considerably out to sea from that of today. During the Holocene, this steeper plain was filled by tens of metres of alluvial sediment derived chiefly from the River Eurotas, whose last phase of deposition occurred near present sea-levels, thus creating a level plain grading very slightly down to contemporary sea-level (except for the recent lagoon infill-zones, which are still below sea-level).] (ii) Ayios Stephanos, Helos and Changes in Sea-Level But let us return to the enigmatic site of Ayios Stephanos. On its northern side the promontory drops sheer into the alluvium, and there is over 1 km before the Neogen of Lekas slowly rises from the marsh; to the east and south no feature breaks the monotony of black earth and fen as far, respectively, as the Eurotas and the sea. As can be seen on my maps (figs. 13.1 and 13.3), the schist at its eastern end that forms the knoll of the site, separated by a slight saddle from the limestone of the bulk of the ridge, is continued by schist hills to the north-west, and the same goes for the limestone; our tectonic trend affects all the rocks of the area equally. Remove the historic alluvium and more of the schist may appear to the north-west. However, the extrapolation of the Lekas hills to this point would put them tens of metres below the present surface of the plain. A crucial but complicated factor to introduce now is change in sea-level. It is generally agreed that the Aegean coasts have experienced a relative rise in sea-level since the Classical period, and there is some evidence that this process goes back into the prehistoric period. Trinasos in our area, and sites around Gytheion further along the coast, are part of a large body of sites now partly or wholly under water. In nearly all cases a 2-3 m relative rise since the Classical period can be accepted. If more than this depth of post- Classical alluvium is present at a coastal location, there is a strong possibility that that area was at one time ocean. In these cases the amount of alluvium, which we can now date to historic times, exceeded the transgressing sea. Well-known examples of this are Thermopylae, the Maeander coastal plain, and the Thorikos and Brauron plains, while I believe that it can also be demonstrated for ancient harbours on Melos and in the Argos Plain and Peninsula. I will now hypothesise that the pace of relative rise in sea-level throughout the prehistoric occupation of our area was of the same order as that attested over Greece for the last 2,500 years. For the first well-attested settlement at Ayios Stephanos, then, sea-level would have been 4-6 m lower relative to the land than it is today. [In retrospect, the Sea-level Effect and the Deltaic Alluvial Effect are the most important in accounting for the Holocene development of the Helos Plain and of the topography of Ayios Stephanos. In 1973, the most recent statement of change in Aegean sea-level had been that of Flemming.59 He believed that the recent apparent rise in sea-level around the Aegean coasts, back into later prehistory, was the result of very long-term (geological timescale) tectonic down-warping of Greece and Turkey, pushing the land down into the ocean, and with it former coastal sites. This quite soon appeared to me to be impossible, since at innumerable points around the Greek coasts geologists had mapped and dated fossil coastal formations of the Last and previous Interglacials, often at no great vertical difference 57 Kraft, Aschenbrenner and Rapp 1977. 58 See §3 (v) above. 59 Flemming 1972; cf. Bintliff 1977 0, 13-26.</page><page sequence="564">542 J. L. BINTLIFF from the current sea-level height. Given the immense time-periods of hundreds of thousands of years, these formations simply could not have remained not far from present-day marine height, had the rates observed in recent millennia (around ι m rise in sea-level per thousand years) been the product of a unilinear tectonic trend. The only alternative was to take the sunken sites as essentially recording a rise of the sea itself ('eustatic' change) over the land, in the context of the melting of the great ice sheets of the last Glacial era. On this basis I suggested that EBA Ayios Stephanos would have been adjacent to a marine bay which was c.6m below its present level. [My earlier conclusion can now be compared with our latest authoritative review of Aegean sea- level change.60 On the time-scale of the last 100,000 years or so, the Aegean is found to have been relatively stable in terms of long-term tectonic warping of coastlands up or down, apart from well- known highly-volatile regions such as the Gulf of Corinth. The effects that do count in mobile sea- levels are then due to ice-sheet melting in Interglacial phases, and to long-distance balancing effects due to the displacement of equilibrium forces on land masses when ice sheets build up or waste away, and to effects on off-shore coasts with variable water loading as seas rise and fall between Interglacial and Glacial periods. Crucially, sea-levels due to ice-melt moved rapidly up from a low-point at the last Glacial height, c. 20,000 years ago, of some 130 m below present, to around 6000 years ago, when our current Interglacial achieved its warmest natural high-point. Sea-levels, other things being equal, would by then have been at their highest level for this Interglacial (i.e. the Holocene), were it not for the land and sea equilibrium adjustments following ice-sheet withdrawal, which have had the effect for the Aegean of allowing sea-levels to continue to creep upwards in the succeeding millennia till today. The rate of this post-7000 years bp sea rise for the South Aegean is, as I had originally supposed, estimated at around 1 m per millennium,61 i.e. -6 m for 6000 bp and -1.5 m for 2000 bp. This allows me to stay with my original sea-level reconstructions. [Here the Eurotas Deltaic Fill makes its essential contribution. As we have seen earlier, already in the Vita-Finzi scheme this Fill was assumed to have been pouring into the Helos Plain from prehistoric times, overlying the Last Glacial Older Fill. Now we must consider the effect on this process of the scenario for sea-level just outlined - a rapid rise from 20,000-6000 bp, from -130 m to around -6 m, followed by a very slow rise of a mere 1 m or so per millennium till today. During the phase of rapid rise, Deltaic Fill is normally too thin to compete with rising sea-levels, so that these riverine deposits empty into an encroaching sea that is moving inland. It is only when the rate of rise in sea-level drops to slow mode that the Deltaic Fill can compete seriously, and gradually assert its dominance over the sea, pushing the coastline back and out to sea. Even then, there will be a significant interval as the river delta fills in the (till recently) rising sea basin and can emerge as a prograding deltaic plain totally above the seas.62 This is one of the main reasons why the record of Greco-Roman cities around the Aegean is marked by truly remarkable cases of the landlocking of ancient ports and historic landscapes such as the Pass at Thermopylae, although we can now admit that humanly-provoked erosion has helped to boost the depth of Deltaic Fill in ancient times. [The effect of combining the fast to slow sea-level curve with the Deltaic Fill is to argue that there would be two clear phases in the infill of the Helos Plain during postglacial or Holocene times. In the first phase, sea-level was much lower than today, though rising rapidly between 10,000 and 6000 bp (from around -130 m to around -6 m compared to modern height). The Plain district then consisted of a ring of Neogen, schist and limestone hills, with a lower girdle of recent marine poros deposits, then in the lowland a steep series of Older Fill deposits descending steeply to a deep glacial sea-level point which was now swallowed up by the advancing sea. The rise of the sea was too rapid for the Eurotas Deltaic alluvia to compete with, so these would mostly have emptied into the rising waters of the bay as submarine deposits. Only at the entry point of the Eurotas into the Plain would the delta have been high enough and replenished enough to maintain a subaerial presence as a visible surface fan, the proto-Helos Plain. Over this whole period the sea encroached further and further into the Helos Plain, well inland from its modern position. In the second phase of our sequence, rise in sea-level slowed down abruptly, and from around 6000 bp to the present it rose a mere 1 m or so on average per 1000 years. Now the Eurotas delta proved far more powerful, and has continually been able to expand at the expense of the former oceanic inlet. At first, however, the Delta had to fill the marine basin, before it could emerge as a dry-land alluvial plain. This agrees with the results of the drill-cores of Kraft, Aschenbrenner and Rapp63 that c. 40 m of estuarine, mixed marine and freshwater sediments 60 Lambeck 1996. 61 Lambeck 1996, fig. 4C-d. 62 Bintliff 2000; 2002. 63 Kraft, Aschenbrenner and Rapp 1977.</page><page sequence="565">THE REGIONAL GEOLOGY AND EARLY SETTLEMENT OF THE HELOS PLAIN §4 543 have been laid down in the plain since around 7000 bc, the bulk of it in its lower sections deposited in a marine environment (see fig. 13.5). [The general scenario I sketched out in 1977 remains broadly valid (cf. fig. 13.6): till the EBA, when Ayios Stephanos develops into a significant settlement (c. 4000-5000 bp), the site stood on a promontory with bay waters on three sides, whilst the other Bronze Age settlements of the Plain were either nestling in the Neogen-poros hilland or on the border of those soft, fertile soils, the proto-Delta and the sea. The sea was much further inland than today. There was limited Deltaic estuary land which was dry enough to farm, but much more suited to grazing and hunting, so that the older soils were more central to the agricultural production of the settlements of the Helos Plain. Progressively the Eurotas Delta took advantage of the low rate of rise in sea-level to push itself outwards over the formerly greater bay and marine marshes, to the west, south and east. The build-up of coastal sandbars also isolated areas of open water from the sea as lagoons, on the extremities of the Delta's influence; it appears that this happened in early Modern times. These remained till recently ocean inlets, remnants of harbour entries for the important settlements on the west and east of the Helos Plain in the Bronze Age and Greco-Roman times.] Let us now bring into the discussion another site, one that has been mythical for rather too long - Helos. This city, after which the Plain is named, is cited in the Homeric Catalogue of Ships as contributing forces to the Trojan War; it is explicitly a 'city on the sea'.64 In early historic times it was conquered by the expanding Spartan kingdom, having been till then a bastion of 'bronze age' stock against the intrusive Dorian settlers to the north. In the Classical period it was considered important enough and accessible enough for an Athenian fleet to raid,65 and in the 2nd century ad it was visited by Pausanias in his tour of Greece. Pausanias notes that the site was in ruins, though a very ancient cult continued there.66 He quite clearly locates it on the eastern edge of the Plain, and, as we saw above,67 it was the collection of marbles, tiles and pottery in the hills near Asteri at the site of Sto Manolaki (fig. 13.2) that led Wace and Hasluck to its location there, together with a milestone on the main road in its vicinity.68 It is rather surprising to see Waterhouse and Hope Simpson suggest that Helos was in fact Ayios Stephanos.69 On the east of the plain, the finds at Asteri and Ayios Strategos, with important Mycenaean occupation, e.g. the only tholos in the region, and evidence of probable continuity through the Dark Ages, e.g. the Protogeometric or Geometric material common at Asteri, with very frequent finds of Classical and later date all over these hills, leave no doubt in my mind that Homeric and Classical Helos lay in the area of Asteri and Ayios Strategos. The Mycenaean town could be either of these two sites, but more probably Ayios Strategos with its royal tomb and its proximity even now to the sea. We would probably search in vain for the Classical town, as it is normally accepted that areas directly under Spartiate rule lacked nucleated monumental centres but were closely spaced villages. The marbles and so on, as signs of civic pretension, would reflect the collapse of Spartiate traditions of settlement in the Hellenistic and Roman periods. We have nothing at Ayios Stephanos between the LBA and the Medieval period except the odd find of Hellenistic to Roman date,70 and a small site of similar date, possibly a farm, on a terrace to the west; nor can Lekas give any significant post-prehistoric finds. With the two sites, Ayios Stephanos and Ayios Strategos, in mind, let us look at the map of N. Memmou (fig. 13.4). According to his brief accompanying note,71 it shows how the sediments of the Helos Plain have been deposited by the major Eurotas river and the minor Bourba. It also shows the former extent of two large marshes, that of Trinasos to the west, and that of Helos on the east; these have been drained only in the last few decades, and in fact patches of marsh still exist among the maze of drainage-canals over the plain, especially in these areas. The two rivers dumped their load of sediment on reaching the lessened incline of the plain, in characteristic alluvial fans with the typical radial and convex form. The radial factor is shown well on fig. 13.4. The marked convexity of the Eurotas fan is a very obvious feature if one looks across the plain from either its eastern or western edge: the centre of the plain is clearly several metres higher than its edges. Again according to Memmou,72 the areas least affected by this alluvial spread were those most remote from it - clearly the outer parts of the plain towards the sea (cf. fig. 13.4). These areas received least sediment and last; in his view, they were areas of sea or open lagoon till very recently. In support of his argument, he mentions cores going down 64 Homer, Iliad u 584. 65 Boite 1Q13, 201. 66 Paus, πι 22.3. 67 See §a vi). 68 Wace and Hasluck 1908-9, 161-2. 69 Waterhouse and Hope Simpson i960, 101-3. 70 See Chapter 14 §5 (i) below. 71 Memmou 1967. 72 Memmou 1967.</page><page sequence="566">544 J· L· BINTLIFF Fig. 13.4. General development of the sediments of the Helos Plain, with contours at 20 and 40 m above sea level. several m into all areas of the plain (unfortunately no cores were made near our zones of 'buried landscape'). These met recent alluvium everywhere (cf. fig. 13.5), but in the two areas of marsh, levels of recent salt-water mussels were found only c. 1 m down. Memmou's other service is to give, on a series of cross-sections of the plain, incidental data on the actual heights above sea-level of its various sections.73 From this it is clear how the central fan of the Eurotas descends from 11m above sea-level to c. 3 m near the sea, while our former zones of marsh, the one curiously exactly around Ayios Stephanos and the other around Ayios Strategos, are at present areas of negative sea-level, almost 1 m down. These negative zones are only prevented from reverting to ocean by drainage-canals that actually convey water from behind the marshes at an elevation over 1 m above them to the sea, and by the barrier of sand-dunes at the coast. The removal of only 2 m of alluvium in these two areas would, if we allow for change in sea-level, put the sites in question in the Classical period on oceanic lagoons or even, if the dunes were removed, on the open sea. Memmou's cores showed dark recent alluvium to descend 3 m in these areas, with intercalations of marine shells. The juxtaposition of these two deposits clearly reflects a rivalry between transgressing sea and accumulating alluvium. As we saw above, in all areas where more than 3 m of alluvium accumulated above the former sea-level, the land won, e.g. in the centre of the Plain, where the mightly Eurotas certainly deposited more than 10 m of alluvium. However, where sediment was thin, as on the edges of the fans in our marshes, the sea won till sand and drainage-projects recovered the land. The sand- dunes seem to reflect a post- Classical build-up over the Aegean; one may compare, for example, the case of Trinasos, where they overlie an already eroded Younger Fill and the Late Roman building.74 73 Memmou !967· 74 See §3 (vii) above.</page><page sequence="567">THE REGIONAL GEOLOGY AND EARLY SETTLEMENT OF THE HELOS PLAIN §4 545 DEPTH A ABOVE AND BELOW ' ^Γ- ' SKALA 30_ ^/ ' HELOS PLAIN 20 NEAR MODERN HELOS (DOURALI) ' CORE , ' ES-8 CORE / 10 ^ VV·- ö οΊ a EB"' / ™dc CORE FRESHWATER BARRIER ^ ' VV·- C ^Γ^ΛΓ'ί οΊ a Γ^ JL ™dc CORE OSTRACODA ACCRETIOl· ' r C ?&lt;?&gt;·&gt; "-"-" Γ^ V^^ EB-2 / /RIDGES SEA Ti C · CD · # ο · #o · YELLOW^ ^ 1/ ' r-| //3i £*' ,ϊ£.

L. BINTLIFF (iii) The Evolution of the Eurotas Delta It is normal for riverine deltas to sink as their sediment compresses; also, the perennial Eurotas is likely to have been emptying sediment into the Plain before the Younger Fill increased general stream-alluvial accumulation. I would say, therefore, that in the prehistoric period there would already have existed a smaller version of the present delta around Skala, but its thinner expanses would have been more prone to marshiness. In other words, the situation which at present prevails in the low areas of the former marshes with thin sediment and high water-table is transferred to an earlier stage of the formation of the Plain and moved further up the Plain, perhaps as far as present-day Helos and Leimonas. This would account for the name 'Helos', which means 'marsh' and seems already to have been used for the area in Mycenaean times. Sand-dunes do, however, reflect predominant on-shore winds; hence it is likely that similar ponding-up may have affected our proto-Eurotas delta. That the Plain has for a long time been an area of alternating terrestrial and marine sediment is shown by deep cores analysed by Kraft, Aschenbrenner and Rapp.75 Bedrock near the southern end of the present delta was not reached at 69 m down; this bears out our conclusions on the steep fall of the hills to the north.76 The bulk of the deposit seems to be marine, but a level of peat c. 40 m down reflects lagoon or estuary conditions in this area in about 7,000 bc (drill-core EB-2 in fig. 13.5). This, it should be noted, is especially due to the post-Glacial rise in sea-level, as the glaciers melted in the period between 8,000 and 4,000 bc. Though this peat was presumably soon swamped by transgressing sea, the depth of this find shows both the lower level still at that time and most probably a good amount of sediment-compression. Most of the deposits above this peat to the recent fill at the top seem of marine origin. I would like to emphasize the value of the date of this core. We have seen that the Older Fill ceased to be deposited over the Mediterranean at the end of the Wurm period (c. 8,000-10,000 bc), and the next major phase of sedimentation was the deposition of the Younger Fill. So almost all of the c. 40 m of deposition in the Helos Plain after 7,000 bc should be either post- Classical alluvium or marine sediment. In both cases this would leave us with the inevitable conclusion that, previous to the historical deposition, most of the Plain was sea. [I have revised this last section in the preceding note. The build-up of the delta above sea-level is now a steady development from the Bronze Age to modern times rather than being focused primarily on post- Classical times.] One can support this reconstruction from several points. Firstly, to those who suggest that early settlers, like present-day farmers in the same areas, concentrated on irrigated crops,77 one can show how almost all sites of all periods before Late Roman or Byzantine are found on the Neogen hills, which are first-rate dry-farming zones and centres of modern wheat and olive production, but practically useless for irrigated crops nor used for such today, despite the high value of these. Moreover, the main irrigated cash-crops are citrus-fruits that are Medieval innovations. The reason for this neglect of the alluvial areas is simply, as we have seen, that they did not then exist in their present form. As can be shown from my other area- studies,78 the pre-Medieval farmer was confronted with valleys generally filled at their edges with Neogen and Older Fill piedmont deposits, and in their centres with remnants of other terraces of Older Fill of poorish quality. At the coasts the Holocene erosion that followed the deposition of the Older Fill led to thin alluvial soil of a deltaic nature, i.e. thin, poorly drained and of little value except for summer grazing. Only with the massive amounts of sediment that accumulated in the Late Roman Younger Fill did there arise a large area of fresh alluvium of good, fine consistency; by lucky coincidence the citrus- fruits and later cotton arrived to take full advantage of it. Possibly the time-lag between the early stages of the Younger Fill and the arrival of the fruit-crops may account for the late evidence of exploitation of the new alluvial lands. [I would now allow an earlier development of a cultivable inner Eurotas Delta, but it would not have been a large area compared to the marshier estuarine component more suitable for grazing, hunting and fishing in Bronze Age and Classical times (hence the regional name - The Marsh).] Another delaying factor was the need to reach a high level of alluvium that would be easier to drain and cultivate; indeed we know that in Late Medieval times alluviation ceased and natural incision and drainage began of the terraces thus revealed. The drainage-problems with concomitant malaria that plagued most of lowland Greece help to account for the peripheral siting of many communities. Now that irrigation and drainage is secure and the rivers well incised, the centres of exploitation have shifted to the more economical plain-centre, where modern Helos and Leimonas are expanding at the expense of the rim-communities. Skala, Souli and Vlachioti were, from their location, more concerned with the alluvium of the plain than with the Neogen, but in the previously fever-ridden and swampy 75 Kraft, Aschenbrenner and Rapp 1977, with figs. 1 3.5-1 3.6. 7(i Cf. §4 (ii) above.

Geomorphic map of the Helos Plain, showing present-day environments, prehistoric sites and the approximate position of the Bronze Age shoreline. conditions of the plain many other peripheral villages, such as Stephaniá, Myrtea, Tsasi and Asteri, may still have devoted much of their labour to the surrounding marls.79 (iv) The Pre-Medieval Settlement-Pattern Thus the pre-Medieval settlement-patterns in the Helos area are most adequately explained as farming settlements concentrating on Neogen hills for cereals and olives, with grazing for sheep and goats further out, and horses on the deltaic marshes and the infertile hills of schist and hard limestone round about, with the exceptional schist plateau at Lagio being another centre for farmers. Three coastal settlements, Trinasos, Ayios Stephanos and Ayios Strategos, would have been occupied, only one of which, Ayios Strategos, had an immediate fertile hinterland; this perhaps explains its overriding importance. It is surely more than a coincidence that the two major prehistoric sites, Ayios Stephanos without an immediate agricultural hinterland, and Ayios Strategos suspected of being Homer's 'city on the sea', are in precisely the only two areas of the plain of negative sea-level and known marine infiltration in the past. The imported finds at Ayios Stephanos and the curious 'tip' situation of Ayios Strategos support the picture. [The Neogen was associated in the lowest non-alluvial zones with small areas of fertile poros soils, which includes areas near Agios Stephanos, and in the centre and north of the Plain the inner parts of the slowly expanding Eurotas Delta could have been highly fertile if unstable land.] The collection of fauna from Ayios Stephanos confirms the importance of marine exploitation for the community, since fish-bones and seashells are plentiful in the habitation-levels.80 The site certainly 79 For full documentation of this sequence see Bintliff 19770, 451-98. 80 See Chapter 1 2 §§4-5 above.</page><page sequence="571">548 J. L. BINTLIFF exhibits strong overseas contacts throughout its occupation, notably with Crete. Since the well-known sources of lapis lacedaemonius occur near the site, it was most probably the centre for the export of the finds of this stone at Bronze Age Knossos and elsewhere. Trinasos was probably the centre for exportation in Roman times, and was well placed for sending out the stone quarried nearer to Krokeai, where we know that the Romans had quarries for this stone, then often used as an architectural ornament. However, I would not stress the significance of this stone for the establishment of Ayios Stephanos, which, after all, began in the EBA before lapis lacedaemonius began to be exploited. Not till the Roman period is there a scrap of evidence that the demand for the stone justified the existence of a centre for its exportation. Lapis lacedaemonius is actually infrequent in the occupation levels at the site. [The role of fishing and of lapis lacedaemonius are now much better understood.81] I was able to establish a tentative settlement-hierarchy for the LBA in both the Sparta and the Argos Plain. Major centres, normally with tholos tombs for royalty, were at about an hour's walk from each other; smaller centres with chamber tombs for the lesser landowners and folk-leaders were intermediate and at about half-hourly distances on foot. However, as was noted above,82 in this area the clear gaps in the settlement evidence in some parts of the Plain, despite e.g. chamber tombs in the vicinity, led both Waterhouse and Hope Simpson and myself to consider the survey-data inadequate for even the larger communities of the LBA. However, one can say that there exist at either side of the Plain two paired centres of this date, each pair being c. 25 minutes apart on foot. In the case of Ayios Strategos and Asteri, the former has a tholos tomb, the latter probable chamber tombs; hence I suspect that the former was dominant. We should then look for another centre for the Tsasi side-basin. None of the sites so far known there can be taken to represent large settlements, and the community corresponding to the chamber tombs at Tsasi is so far lacking; perhaps it is to be found by Myrtea. Again, the possible chamber tombs at Kokkinada are hardly accounted for by the scanty Mycenaean finds on the hill there. In theory one might expect to find another centre of importance near Vlachioti, corresponding to the large modern village, and then a smaller centre for Kokkinada and Tsasi, which are actually quite close to each other; however, this prediction is no more than speculation based on numerous examples of regular spacing of centres in other study-areas. A gap between centres, large and small, is to be expected for the infertile mass constituting most of the northern plain; the smaller area of Neogen here supported what are certainly farms and hamlets only, at Ayios Nikolaos, Ayios Ioannis and Xeronisi. But the Lekas area is, even now, a large zone of fertile rendsinas, and the surviving evidence of several smaller farm-sites around a large centre at Lekas Panayiotis is justified by the abundance of preferred soil, even without my additions to its extent. Lekas Panayiotis is 25 minutes on foot across the Plain from Ayios Stephanos, while the latter lacks any significant large areas of fertile fields, and, as was suggested in §4 (i) above, probably always did so till the post- Classical fill was deposited. I would therefore make the two contemporary centres complementary: Ayios Stephanos would have exercised the fishing and trading functions of Lekas Panayiotis, but depended on the latter for agricultural products. It is quite possible that both settlements were occupied by the same community, which may have moved to Ayios Stephanos in summer, when fishing and sailing in general were most favourable and least pressure of agricultural work existed. This dual settlement-pattern is very well attested in recent traditional Greece.83 [I am more sceptical of this seasonal theory now than in 1977. The pairing of inland and coastal, and/or upland and lowland, settlements into a seasonal alternation used by the same community, although very common in Greece during the 18th to early 20th centuries ad, seems to be tied to specific historical conditions of security, population levels and early modern economics. It is unclear if we can utilise such pairings for past millennia without serious modifications. Moreover, the archaeological evidence now available from Ayios Stephanos does not point to temporary use of the settlement. On the other hand, the always poor farming resources of Ayios Stephanos make its location of primary value in terms of marine access, begging the question of how the basic necessities of life were obtained. The richer potential of the eastern Plain suits the hypothesised higher status of that area in Mycenaean and Greco-Roman times. At the very least a necessary interdependence between Ayios Stephanos and hinterland agricultural settlements or locations is required.] Finally, about an hour from Lekas and Ayios Stephanos, lies the Lagio centre at the heart of its locally excellent fields, and probably with its own access to the sea and a harbour at Trinisa, or perhaps at Paizoulia just down the coast where prehistoric finds are known. 81 On the latter see Chapter 14 §3 (vi), §4 (iii) and §5 below. 83 Cf. my discussion in Bintliff 19770, 1 1 1-30. Kl See $3 (v).</page><page sequence="572">THE REGIONAL GEOLOGY AND EARLY SETTLEMENT OF THE HELOS PLAIN §4 549 (v) A Note on the Classical Period In the light of my comments on the notable interest shown by the Mycenaeans in placing their local centres clearly amid the most fertile land available, a note on the later history of the area is called for. As I pointed out elsewhere,84 the policy of Dorian Sparta was to take personal charge of the most fertile lands in Laconia, which were farmed by descendants of the Bronze Age stock, the Helots, leaving the poorer areas to her subservient allies, the Perioeci. As Bölte has shown,85 the heartland of the Spartiates included the Sparta Plain and the Helos Plain, but already at Trinasos we are in Perioecic land. We know that Helos was part of Spartiate land, though its reduction to dispersed hamlets in the Classical period is to be expected. [My original discussion86 on the location of ancient Helos in connection with the evidence from ancient geographers is summarised and added to Chapter ΐ4·87] The model most applicable to this situation was proposed by Flannery in a stimulating paper on the rise of elites in Mesopotamia.88 He argues that when e.g. 1% of the population controls 10% of the land, which produces 30% of the harvest, then we have the basis for control by the elite. The Spartiates were certainly aware of this and must have ensured, in their land policy, firstly, that they themselves did not go hungry (nor did they need to work in the fields, the surplus being enough), but also that the surrounding Perioeci were dependent for food on the Spartiates' surplus. In another way, the upland communities surrounding these core-zones of fertility are still dependent on the lowlands today, namely in shepherding. In summer the mountains are good for pasture, but in winter they are too inhospitable for the flocks, which must descend to the sheltered lowlands and feed off the fallow land, stubble and olive-cuttings, in turn manuring the lowlanders' fields. Both in the recent past and in the Classical period we possess records of the purchase by hill-shepherds of winter grazing-rights in the plains. Here again a means of control is available to the lowland powers: the price is normally set in animal products such as wool, kids and cheese.89 (vi) The Role of Water-Supplies and the Need for Defence The location of settlements has often been seen solely in terms of water-supplies and defensive requirements. My own analysis begins from agriculture, as in my field experience it has always been far more instructive to consider this factor first, and most often sites show no great consideration for either water or strategy. Water is not a problematic commodity over much of our area, with the perennial Eurotas and the presence of schist that underlies permeable deposits and creates a spring-line; no settlement in the west, north and centre need worry about it. The Asteri hill-chain and the Tsasi zone, however, are of permeable sandy marls, and down by Ayios Strategos we are really cut off from fresh water on the surface. Ayios Stephanos has its spring, functioning in 1963. However, all the western edge of the Plain has aquifer-lines, and the spring would be just another advantage to add to the priority, its coastal location. Lekas is close to the same juxtaposition of schist under hard limestone, which gives good springs around its modern neighbour, Stephania. The springs of the Vasilopotamos are available for the sites west of Skala, though the actual locations and sizes of site, as was noted above,90 reflect the arable potential rather than the abundant water. Skala, with its nice steep hill and two rivers, the Vasilopotamos and the Eurotas, should on the old view be a fine location for a settlement, but here there are no pre-Medieval finds at all; the explanation lies of course in other preferences in a different environment. With the exception of the Lagio site, again, no settlements are known in the water-rich hills to the north-west and west of our area. The sites grouped around Tsasi and Asteri would be relying on wells, cisterns and water-carriers. As for defence, Lekas and Ayios Stephanos are not lofty hills, admittedly not prone to surprise attack and with fairly extensive views around, but hardly chosen for their notable difficulty in scaling. Both sites have a saddle linking them to apparently unoccupied hills, thus making the enemy's job easier. Reports of defensive walls at both sites are somewhat suspect, and these walls are not in any case clearly ancient. Asteri is a very large hill to defend, as is Kokkinada, and both have accessible slopes; at neither are defensive works noted. Ayios Strategos, though obviously a major site, shows a neglect also of defensive provisions; it is on very low hillocks with no sign of walls. 84 Bintliff 19770, 371-450. 85 Bölte 1929. 86 Bintliff 1977e, 475-6. 87 See Chapter 14 §5 (i). 88 Flannery 1969, 94. 89 See also the discussion in Bintliff 1977^ with a model landscape. 90 See §3 (ii)-(iii).</page><page sequence="573">55O J. L. BINTLIFF The Lagio site is on a steep hill on all sides, and its position, somewhat off-centre relative to its land, near the southern end of the fertile plateau, could reflect a slight concession to defence. In conclusion, whereas some large sites show a concern for protection against surprise attack by taking a degree of advantage in height, all are chosen from a limited area which is primarily selected for exceptional arable or marine possibilities. The question of water-supply is even less influential.</page><page sequence="574">Chapter 14 Summary and historical conclusions R.Janko Author's note: this Chapter gives an overview of the specialised studies in this volume, which were written independently of one another. Such an overview should also try to reconstruct the non-material by interpreting the material evidence. The informed hypotheses here advanced are liable to falsification by new evidence and by new theories that account more completely for the sum of our knowledge. They are proposed in the conviction that, as in every field of study, we will not progress unless our interpretations and inferences rest on the widest possible base of evidence.

THE PHYSICAL ENVIRONMENT So viele Jahre stand verlassen das Talgebirg, Das hinter Sparta nordwärts in die Höhe steigt, Taygetos im Rücken, wo als muntrer Bach Herab Eurotas rollt und dann, durch unser Tal An Rohren breit hinfließend, eure Schwäne nährt. Goethe, Faust ii. 3, 8994-8 (i) Geology, Relief and Climate Laconia consists of a great tectonic trough running about 70 km exactly south-east from the centre of the Péloponnèse to the Laconian Gulf (fig. i).1 This trough provides the bed for the perennial River Eurotas, which broadens into two plains, the Vale of Sparta inland and the Helos Plain. On either side, it is bounded by high ranges of mountains running south-east. To the west lies the mighty range of Mt Taygetus, whose jagged peaks (the 'five fingers') can on a clear morning be seen from Ayios Stephanos, lying behind the village of Stephaniá and towering above the north-west horizon (plate 59 a). To the east there rises more gradually the massif of Mt Parnon, less impressive at a distance. Because of a series of faults downward to the south-east, both ranges eventually disappear under the sea as capes: these are, respectively, the rugged Taenarum (Matapan) and Malea, gentler in profile but more feared by ancient mariners. The isle of Kythera forms an extension of Cape Malea. The two promontories together enclose the Laconian Gulf. These ranges consist of, at their base, Palaeozoic crystalline metamorphic schists, with marbles copiously embedded in them, and then, above these, massive layers of crystalline 'hard' limestone in two series, laid down during the Triassic period. These were thrust high above modern sea-level in middle Tertiary times by the same orogenic forces which created the Alps. Between the schists and the limestone there occur Tyros igneous beds with outcrops of Labrador porphyrite, a distinctive rock, dark green in colour with light green crystalline inclusions. The main outcrops are at Alaï-Bey near Krokeai, formerly Levétsova, and at the hill of Psephi an hour's walk south of Alaï-Bey, some 6 km to the west, north-west and north of Ayios Stephanos; but there are outcrops ten minutes' walk from the site, and hard deposits of it at Stephaniá.2 This stone was first quarried in the LBA, then in Roman times, when it was known as lapis lacedaemonius, and in the Middle Ages, when it was called porfido 1 Cf.

JANKO verde antico; it is also known as Spartan basalt.3 Nearby there are also oxidised copper ores, copper pyrites (CuFeS2) among or under the lapis lacedaemonius, and native copper itself.4 Between the lateral mountain-ranges, where the trough sank in the middle Tertiary period to create an inland sea around Sparta, softer 'Neogen' deposits of sandy marl and conglomerate were laid down upon the limestone in late Tertiary times; these have often been eroded away. The hard rocks are contrasted, on their lower slopes and in depressions, with unconsolidated slope-wash and alluvium, falling into two types: a series of Pleistocene date (the Older Fill', deposited mainly in glacial times over the last one million years), and another of Holocene date (the 'Younger Fill'), a grey to black loam rich in humus, brought down by the Eurotas and other rivers. The 'Younger Fill', at first dated to late antiquity,5 is now thought to have been deposited in successive phases datable to the EH, Hellenistic, Late Roman and Modern periods.6 The hinterland of Ayios Stephanos consists of the hilly landscape lying south of the Vale of Sparta and north-west of the Helos Plain: see the relief map, fig. 13.2. The hill country of Vardoúnia reaches across the southern end of the Vale of Sparta, isolating it from the Laconian Gulf. Here the Eurotas flows down through difficult terrain from the former lake around Sparta. In its path to the sea, the river has carved a shallow but precipitous gorge through the limestone north-east of Skala. To the east, in the area lying south of Geraki and comprising modern Vrondamás and along the east edge of the Helos Plain, runs a band of Neogen 'rendsina' soils, consisting of coarse infertile conglomerates with fertile sandy marls below ('Older Fill'). The Helos Plain itself, south-east of the site, is composed of recent alluvium ('Younger Fill'). At its north-east edge, around Astéri, the marl projects from under the conglomerates to provide some good land. Limestone hills form its northern border, extending past Ayios Stephanos to the south-west, with at their feet a thin seam of poros, fossilised beds of seashells which were raised above sea-level during the Pleistocene. In climate the Helos Plain resembles the rest of Laconia, with a long summer drought and rainfall concentrated into heavy downpours, especially in late autumn and winter, when northerly winds prevail. Otherwise, with the exception of periods of meltémi in midsummer, the wind is southerly.7 Messenia to the west has considerably more rain. In July and August Ayios Stephanos receives even less, c. 1.25 cm, than falls on Sparta; the range of temperatures in both winter and summer is less extreme, because of the moderating influence of the sea, which makes its climate more like that of Kythera. The site's maritime location causes a strong on-shore breeze (μπάτης) that comes up in the afternoons; this played an important part in metal- working. The climate was probably wetter in the middle Holocene era (the 'Atlantic' vegetation phase, c. 7500-5500 bp) than it is now: cores from near Khania in western Crete show that pollen from trees presently confined to central Europe disappeared during the EBA,8 and Messenia too was wetter before it was deforested.9 (ii) The Location of the Coastline in Antiquity The sea is now c. 2 km south of Ayios Stephanos, beyond a line of marshes and sand-dunes. In the past, however, the site was a headland joined to the mainland by a saddle to the west but lapped by the sea on its other three sides. One or more geological events or processes have left the site high and dry. The date and nature of this change have been disputed.10 The land has not risen;11 on the contrary, Ayios Stephanos should have sunk relative to the sea. Ruins on the north-east shore of the Laconian Gulf, like Classical Asopus (Plytra) on the Xyli peninsula,12 are submerged by at least 1 m of water; on the rocky north-west shore, the Late Roman walls at Trinasos are now on the beach.13 The fact that the Bronze Age site at Pavlopetri, 48 km south-east of Ayios Stephanos, is now under 2-2.5 m of water (fig. 14.4) implies a yet greater change, estimated at 4 m.14 Globally there has been a eustatic rise in sea-level of c. 2.7-2.8 m since 500 bc15 and 4-5 m since 1500 bc.16 Modelling that takes no account of tectonic factors predicts that the sea-level at Ayios Stephanos ought to have risen by 4.6-5 m since 4000 bc.17 3 Warren 1992, 285.

Lambeck calculates the rate of subsidence at the head of the Laconian Gulf as 0.8 m per millennium.21 Further south, the island of Elaphonisos was in antiquity a two-pronged promontory aptly named Onugnathus, 'donkey's jaw', which enclosed the Gulf of Boeae to the south.22 In 1677 cattle could be driven across the strait to the mainland,23 and in 1829 one could ford it in calm weather,24 but now it is 3 m deep.25 Submerged ruins are reported at Point Helena on the south side of Elaphonisos26 and sunken columns at Ayios Elias on the coast opposite, as also at Epidelium on the east side of the peninsula.27 There is an underwater site near the island of Roditsa and another at Zarax further north.28 This subsidence has slightly magnified the rise in sea-level at Ayios Stephanos. Lambeck's calculations, taking both geological processes into account, show that sea-level at the site has risen by 1.6 m since ad 1, by 2.3 m since 1000 bc, by 3.3 m since 2000 bc, by 5 m since 3000 bc and by 6.7 m since 4000 bc;29 the results for the coastal plains of Messenia are almost identical, and those for the Argolid differ only slightly.30 The effect of these processes means that Ayios Stephanos ought now to be closer to the sea, not further from it. But a further geological change has counteracted this tendency: the slowing of the rise in sea-level has reduced the erosion of the deltaic fill deposited by the Eurotas, thereby allowing the delta to expand (see figs. 13.5-6). The period when sea-level rose rapidly ended in c. 4000 bc. As a result, the alluvial delta gradually extended to the south-west and south-east to create the Helos Plain. Deep cores drilled in the plain and dated by uncalibrated radiocarbon testing, supplemented by the results of well-drilling, show that c. 40 m of silt has been deposited since 7000 bc (fig. 13.5).31 Three cores were taken: one near Skala, the second by modern Helos and the third nearer the coast. These prove that for a long period, perhaps from the Mesolithic to the first millennium bc, the sea went much further inland than at present. Whereas the southern sector of the plain yielded marine sediments, the northern and middle sectors yield remains typical of coastal swamp, flood-plain and riverine sands and gravels. The cores suggest that in the Bronze Age shore ran along the south and east sides of Ayios Stephanos, with an inlet to the north bordered by a plain to the west of it; the coast then turned to run south-east to just south of modern Helos, with another, shallower bay near Asteri (fig. 13.6).32 This reconstruction accords perfectly with the calculations of Lambeck33 and with known patterns of alluvial deposition, since the plain is a radial convex delta, with the land highest and driest in its middle and lowest and wettest to the south-east and south-west (fig. 13.4). Much of the water of the Eurotas travels underground through the limestone and emerges with great force as springs near Skala. It then flows even more vigorously as a geologically recent river, the Vasilopotamos, down the west side of the Helos Plain to the sea. Such was the situation in antiquity. According to Ptolemy,34 after the roadstead at Trinasos the traveller reached 'the mouths of the River Eurotas' (Ευρώτα ποταμού έκβολαί). A Byzantine scholiast on this passage notes that this was 'now' called the Iris (νυν Ίριδος); its name was still 'Iri' in 1829.35 Next Ptolemy's traveller reached 'the beginning of the river' (ή αρχή του ποταμού), i.e. the springs of the Vasilopotamos. The name is first attested in 1389.36 In 1829 ^e Vasilopotamos itself had two mouths, one south of the site and the other south-west; as wide as the middle reaches of the Seine, it did not silt up like the Eurotas.37 Until recently the high water-table and incidence of malaria caused the population to migrate inland each summer to escape disease.38 Before the land was reclaimed in the 1930s only the upper and inner delta was cultivated, whereas the lower and outer delta was used for pasturing flocks in winter. 18 Price et al. 2002. 19 Lambeck iqq6, 600. 20 Flemming 1078, 428-q with fig. 8. 21 Lambeck iqqr, 1041-2 with fis;. 16. 22 Strabo Geog. vin 5. 1; Ptolemy Geog. m 16. 10; Pausanias III 22. 1O. 23 Diary of T.

JANKO The extensive lagoons in its corners, the Asteri marsh to the east and the Trinasos marsh to the west, are now below sea-level, protected from marine transgression only by the sand-dunes which have, within the last 150 years, sealed their mouths.39 This deltaic fill is likely to have been caused by erosion resulting, at least in part, from human activity. Indeed, Homer already implies that the loss of fertile terraces through erosion is Zeus's way of punishing human wickedness.40 The deposition of the Younger Fill began as early as the Bronze Age;41 the place-name Helos, listed by Homer as a town in Menelaus' kingdom,42 proves that southern Laconia had already received enough deltaic fill to create a significant area of swamp (έλος), if not by the time of the Trojan War, then at least no later than 700 bc.43 At first this delta was not near Ayios Stephanos, but further away to the north-east (fig. 13.6).44 During the Bronze Age the site was a marine promontory, with a small harbour in the bay to the east enclosed between two small promontories at the north-east and south-east corners of the hilltop; compare the contours in fig. iii. This bay provided an excellent beach some 200 m wide; the longer beach to the south would also have served as a harbour. A double harbour is typical of Laconian Bronze Age sites.45 However, the northern side of the promontory could have begun to silt up by this time, creating marshes where the Anopheles mosquito could breed. The high infant mortality attested at Ayios Stephanos in the LBA is matched only in the deltas of the Nile, Ganges and Indus.46 However, I suspect that the adults were probably being buried elsewhere, in a cemetery yet to be found, and that malaria was not then a major problem at the site. The deltaic fill in the south-west part of the plain was certainly deposited after classical times. This is shown by the line of an ancient road some 3 m wide with wheel-ruts which runs in a north-south direction rather more than one km south-south-west of Ayios Stephanos, between the foothills and the edge of the former Trinasos marsh.47 That the road ran around rather than across the plain shows that in antiquity the area below the site was not solid ground. This reconstruction is supported by Pausanias' figure of 80 stades, i.e. 14.8 km, as the distance from Trinasos to Helos;48 since classical Helos was on the eastern side of the plain,49 this implies a roundabout route following firm ground.50 Again, Strabo51 gives the distance along the shore from Gytheion to the mouth of the Eurotas as 240 stades, i.e. 44.4 km, whereas it is now 14 km. Bintliff plausibly suggests that Ayios Stephanos was still on a coastal inlet until the 1 8th century, perhaps with the chapel of St Stephen, shown on fig. iii, as a navigational landmark.52 (iii) Factors Favouring Settlement We must next ask what factors favoured the settlement of Ayios Stephanos. Such factors can be unexpected and complex.53 Our site lay on important routes of communication by land and sea. Journeys along the coast towards Capes Malea and Taenarum were usually easier by sea; both peninsulas were isolated from the north by difficult country. By land, one route led north-west across barren hills past the quarries of lapis lacedaemonius near Krokeai to the Vale of Sparta; another ran east through the foothills of Mt Parnon to Epidaurus Limera. By sea, those wishing to sail from Kythera and western Crete towards the western Péloponnèse could either cross the Laconian Gulf or follow the coast. In the Homeric Hymn to Apollo 'Cretans from Minoan Knossos', on their way to found Apollo's shrine at Delphi, first pass Cape Malea; this implies that they went via Kythera. They then sail παρ Λακωνίδα γαΐαν, 'past the land of Laconia', to reach the άλιστέφανον πτολίεθρον, 'sea-girt city', and Cape Taenarum.54 Matthiae, noting the aural similarity of this verse to Homer's expression 'Έλος τ' εφαλον πτολίεθρον 'coastal city of Helos',55 suggested reading that phrase here.56 If he were right, this would prove that they followed the coast, but the expression may simply have been adapted during oral recomposition-in-performance.57 S9 Chapter 13 §4 (iii) above; Bintliff 19770, 470-3. 40 Homer, Iliad xvi ^80-02; Tanko iqq2, ^66. 41 See §1 (i) above. 42 Homer, Iliad 11 584. 43 For the date see Tanko 1082 c. 44 See Chapter 13 §4 (iii) above. 45 Banou 1996, 98. 4&lt;i See Chapter 12 §1 (iii) (c) above. 47 Waterhouse and Hope Simpson i960, 100; Banou 1996, 108. 48 Pausanias in 22.3. 49 See §5 (i) below; Banou 1996, 92. 50 Bintliff 1977«, 475-6. 51 Geog. vin 5.2. 52 Bintliff 1977e, 473. 53 For valuable and detailed accounts of the reasons for site- choice in the Helos Plain, to which my discussion owes much, see Chapter 1^ above and Waerstaff 1082, 7Q-84· 54 Horn.

One reason why Ayios Stephanos was founded was presumably because the underlying schists, being impervious, trap moisture which flows down through the porous limestones of the surface, resulting in a line of springs. The spring south-east of the site was still in use in 1963; however, only a few nondescript sherds were recovered when Trial Trench Pi was opened north-west of it in i960 (see fig. iii).58 However, this would only have been a minor factor, since the spring-line extends right along the edge of the plain.59 The environs of the site offered plentiful sea-food. Before it silted up, the deep bay to the north of the promontory must have provided fish, while the deltaic marshes, which lay only a short voyage to the north-east,60 harboured abundant fish and shell-fish, perhaps including the eels and mud-loving donax-shelh attested as early as EH II. They also provided an ideal habitat for water-fowl, as the avian remains attest.61 The plentiful remains of fish and marine invertebrates show that there were both rocky and sandy or muddy habitats, as well as the possibility of brackish waters, at all periods including Medieval.62 The agricultural potential of Ayios Stephanos has been considered less important, since, prior to the formation of the alluvial plain which now surrounds it, it apparently lacked a supply of suitable land; it was argued above63 that we must expect the site to exhibit the character of a coastal settlement rather than a farming one. Most Bronze Age sites around the plain tend to be located on the Neogen hills to its east and north-east; only Ayios Stephanos, Asteri-Dragatsoula and Ayios Strategos were chosen for their coastal location (figs. 13.1-13.2). Ayios Stephanos rests on schist overlaid in places by hard limestone; the combination creates the springs at the foot of the site. The schist is infertile, since it usually erodes into steep screes which do not let much soil accumulate.64 A thin and poor red soil leached from the limestone bedrock was found wherever the excavators reached it. Bintliff proposed that Ayios Stephanos, as a fully coastal settlement, had a symbiotic relationship with people farming Neogen soils 2 km to the north-east, where fertile 'rendsinas' permitted an important settlement at Ayios Panayiotis with outlying farms on the land sloping down to the south-east. Ayios Stephanos would have satisfied the needs for fishing and trade of Ayios Panayiotis, but depended on the latter for agricultural products.65 However, some fertile land once existed south of Ayios Stephanos. The excavators of Trial Trench Pi near the spring (fig. iii) reached a bedrock which they described as 'white shale' and 'harder than shale'; this was surely the seam of poros that runs along the edges of the hills and yields a relatively fertile soil.66 It lay at a depth of not much more than 1 m below the modern surface but above the level of the alluvium; its bedding planes were tilted at an angle of 30% to the horizontal. This poros is likely to have been exposed over a wide area in ancient times. The hilltop is now c. 35 m above the level of the alluvium and c. 36-38 m above sea-level.67 However, the sea has risen by c. 5 m since 3000 bc;68 moreover, since the prevailing pattern of tectonic faulting in the area is towards the south-east (fig. 13.3), it is likely that these soils sloped gently south-east, as at Lekas, filling most of the indentation south of the promontory.69 Another possible reason for settlement was metallic ores. Laconia has the most important ores in Greece after those of Laurion in Attica and Siphnos and Kythnos in the Cyclades. There are several deposits of copper and copper ore near Krokeai, native copper around Apidia, copper and lead near Sykea and Molaoi, and copper near the Vale of Sparta;70 there was alluvial gold and possibly silver in the Eurotas south of Sparta.71 The use of Laconian ores in the Bronze Age has yet to be proven, but should not be excluded without evidence to the contrary.72 A further factor favouring the site was the land-to-sea breezes that blow at night, thereby hindering the activity of mosquitoes, and the strong wind which blows off the sea on hot summer afternoons. The advantages of these would outweigh the exposure to chilly winter winds. At Nichoria, the midday breezes were exploited to supply draught for melting bronze during MH I,73 and this was also done at Ayios Stephanos from MH I onward. Also, the distant views from the site in all directions gave the inhabitants some defensive advantage. To the north-west on clear days one can see across the rolling landscape as far as the peaks of Taygetus (plate 59 a). To the south-west the view embraces Cape Matapan (plate 59 b).

JANKO one can look across to Skala and the hills bordering the Helos Plain (plate 59 c). To the south-east the Laconian Gulf extends in a great vista under the looming bulk of the Kourkoula range towards Cape Malea, including the plain of Neapolis and the former promontory of Elaphonisos; in the far distance, the outline of Kythera occasionally rises from the misty sea. Hope Simpson calls Ayios Stephanos the only site in the region 'naturally suitable for use as a fortress'.74 There is evidence for fortifications on the north and east slopes, although their dating is not determined.75 Only to the west and north-west, where a saddle connects Ayios Stephanos to the harsh countryside (fig. iii with plate 59 d), was the settlement accessible by land. Such a saddle is a typical feature of Laconian Bronze Age sites.76 The hinterland consists of hard limestones with little soil and schist that is too scree-like for cultivation. Today these hills offer only hunting and rough pasturage, and are uninhabited. We do not know what vegetation they supported in antiquity; in Messenia the clearance during the Bronze Age of forests first of pine and then of deciduous oak77 should warn us that this region too may have suffered drastic changes. The fact that the radiocarbon dates from the site (table A9.1) are almost all much earlier than they should be suggests that old-growth timbers were used and/ or reused in the Bronze Age buildings, as at Nichoria,78 where an oak-forest grew nearby. Palynological investigation would clarify whether the hinterland in this drier region was once similarly forested. (iv) The Stone Age in Laconia Apart from a cranium discovered at an open site in the Mani, which resembles the skull from Petralona in Chalcidice of c. 200,000 bc or earlier,79 the first human presence known in the region was near Elaia to the south-east of the Helos Plain (fig. i). Here, on a raised beach that may date from the last interglacial period (c. 123,000 bc) or before, an assemblage of flaked implements was found.80 These tools were probably made by an archaic form of Homo sapiens, as they antedate the Mousterian phase which may be associated with the Neanderthals.81 If their date is correct, they represent the end of the Lower Palaeolithic Age. These are the only Palaeolithic sites yet known in the southern Péloponnèse. Human habitation may not have become permanent in Greece until after c. 26,000 bc.82 It remained sparse during the Upper Palaeolithic, Mesolithic and Neolithic, until the adoption of the plough in Final Neolithic.83 Thus no sites are known in Messenia until that time.84 Neolithic occupation is reported at Lekas (South) just north-east of the site85 and at Apidia further off in the same direction. Such occupation is certain at Asteri-Karaousi and Ayios Strategos, on the south-east edge of the Helos Plain,86 at Goules-Plytra and Alepótrypa cave further to the south-east, and at Geraki to the north-east.87 Late and Final Neolithic finds are known from the first Kouveleïki cave at Alepochori,88 and Final Neolithic material has been excavated at Kouphovouno, a low mound near Sparta.89 Some coarse sherds decorated with impressed cordons found at Platia Rachi on Kythera may be Final Neolithic,90 and a large lithic site of that phase was located in 200 1.91 Neolithic sherds were found in Messenia at Nichoria92 and probably Chalcolithic ones in Arcadia at Asea,93 while Neolithic sherds were found in a survey of eastern Arcadia.94 Howell suggests that such isolated finds may, in the absence of a permanent settlement, imply a pattern of transhumance, with coastal sites like Nichoria being inhabited in the winter, while people drove their flocks inland in the summer. But the probable paucity of good grazing close by makes one doubt whether the inhabitants of Ayios Stephanos lived in this manner.95 That a Neolithic settlement existed at Ayios Stephanos is unlikely. A sherd which can be shown to have been EH I was at first deemed Neolithic: D. H. French compared the fabric and shape of the brown bowl-rim 1 to North Slope ware from the Athenian Acropolis, then considered Neolithic.96 1 is surely EH I, since it closely resembles the Red Slipped and Burnished bowl-rims îa-b. A bowl in this ware is known from Kouphovouno, where it was at first taken for Neolithic.97 A red burnished bowl 74 Hope Simpson 1981, 105. 75 See §4 (v) below. 76 Banou 1996, 98. 77 Wright 1972; Zangger 1998, 5-6. 78 McDonald, Dickinson and Howell 1992, 758-9; Appendix 9 below. 79 Pitsios iqq6. 80 Reisch 1980; 1982. 81 Runnels 1995, 710-12. 82 Runnels 1995, 726, 728 with figs. 1-2. 83 Johnson 1996. 84 Runnels 2001, 258. 85 Hope Simpson 1981, 105. 86 Bintliff 19770, 460, 462. 87 Cartledge 1979, 32-4. 88 Koumouzeli 1989. 89 Renard 1080. 90 Broodbank 1999, 205, 211. 91 C.

BEGINNINGS: THE EARLY BRONZE AGE (i) Early Helladic I (fig. 14.1) The first definite traces of occupation at Ayios Stephanos appear in EH I or the earliest phase of EH II (on the dating see below). The EH I settlement constitutes the first stratified remains of this period to be excavated in Laconia; another EH I deposit was found in 2001 in Area A at Kouphovouno,100 and 'Chalcolithic' occupation is reported in the Mani in the cave at Pyrgos Diroú called Alepótrypa, where copper tools and pottery resembling North Slope ware have been found.101 EH I sherds are also known at the Amyklaion and at Ayios Efstratios in the south-east of the Helos Plain.102 The earliest EH sherds at Geraki may be of comparable antiquity, since they include no sauceboats.103 It is uncertain whether the EH pottery from Pavlopetri104 contained any EH I. Other EH I sherds may have been found elsewhere in Laconia,105 since stray EH I sherds are easily confused with Neolithic.106 Stratified EH I pottery is known from few other sites in central and southern Greece: these are Eutresis and Lithares in Boeotia, Palaia Kokkinia in Attica, Perachora-Vouliagmeni near Corinth, Tsoungiza near Nemea, and Ayios Demetrios in Triphylia.107 Assemblages of later EH I pottery are known at Kefalari Magoula and Talioti in the Argolid. The EH I deposit was found in Area Eta, i.e. in the se quadrant of the hilltop nearest to the harbours and the spring below, where the ground sloped gently towards the SE. Here, resting on bedrock and a thin layer of red soil leached from it, EH I sherds and debris from the knapping of obsidian tools were found.108 The transition to EH II in the strata above was accomplished with no sign of violent disruption or abandonment. Although this is the only certain EH I occupation, any buildings were probably in the centre of the plateau, since the Red Slipped and Burnished rims 1 and ia were found in Area Alpha. The first of the three EH building phases there was probably of this date (fig. 14.1). This includes wall aa109 and perhaps the isolated wall an, which is cut by the EH II burial 10; both are on a N-s axis.110 To the sw, 'slipped and burnished' sherds were found in Area Nu along with EH II Early.111 EH I sherds could have passed unnoticed elsewhere, like the reddish-brown burnished sherds reported along with EH II in Trial Trench III to the ne. In Laconia 'Red Slipped ware', to use the terminology of the Laconia Survey, remains the sole diagnostic criterion for EH I pottery.112 The 15 sherds surviving from Areas Alpha and Eta comprise Red Slipped and Burnished, semi-coarse and plain wares.113 Although no Urfirnis ware, termed 'Dark Painted' at Lerna III, is published, the excavator of Area Eta, J. B. Rutter, recorded Urfirnis sherds there and called attention to the lack of Yellow Mottled ware.114 Since Yellow Mottled ware is a defining characteristic of mature but not early or final phases of EH II,115 these sherds could instead represent the earliest stage of EH II. Sherd 4 may belong to a 'sauceboat'; it is unfortunate that this is doubtful, since the lack of this shape is a diagnostic criterion for EH I116 and the earliest phase of EH II at Lerna also lacks sauceboats.117 Other shapes include bowls, saucers, strainers, and open jars. For the range of wares and shapes at Ayios Stephanos one may compare Caskey's Group V at Eutresis,118 phases 5-6 at Lithares with incised decoration from trench 70 of 1976,119 surface finds from eastern Arcadia120 and a few unstratified sherds at Lerna.121 The EH I assemblage from Asea in Arcadia, contemporary with the 'late' or 'Talioti' phase of EH I, is very similar.122 The EH I pottery at 98 Waterhouse and Hope Simpson 1961, 136 n. 151 (they deemed it Neolithic). 99 Waterhouse and Hope Simpson 10,60, 07. 100 'y G.

JANKO Ayios Stephanos, as elsewhere in Greece, evolves smoothly into the EH II style without a break. The excavators of the EH Deposit Alpha at Kastraki on Kythera assign to EH I only the ware which they call Slipped and Burnished, with surfaces either red, brown or black;123 Deposit Alpha apparently mixed EH I and EH II.124 The shapes are the same as those at Ayios Stephanos, and do not include sauceboats. The technique of decoration with incised white-filled chevrons or zigzags is not paralleled at our site; it was even suggested that this material might be Neolithic.125 None of the few EH burials found at the site can be identified as EH I rather than EH II; no interments are definitely recognised as EH I anywhere in Greece. (ii) Early Helladic II (fig. 14.1) During EH II Ayios Stephanos was an important site at the head of the Laconian Gulf. It had two ceramic and architectural phases: an analysis of the frequencies of Yellow Mottled and Cream Slipped126 wares (see Appendix 1) enabled me to distinguish two phases of EH II, here called 'Early' and 'Late' (chart 14.1). This is the first Laconian site where this distinction can be drawn. Seventy EH sites are now known in Laconia.127 The dispersed 'farmstead' pattern of settlement on low hills in all the main geological sub-regions, especially near the coasts, lasted throughout this long and prosperous era, which was characterised by active trade, particularly by sea.128 Thus the coasts round the mouth of the Eurotas were well-settled at this time. EH sherds, presumably EH II, have been recognised at Paizoulia, Lagio, two sites at Lekas, Xeronisi, Peristeri (East) near Tsasi, Kokkinada, Asteri-Karaousi, Dragatsoula and Ayios Strategos, eleven sites in all (fig. 13.1).129 Around the Gulf the main centres were at Peristeri (East), Lekas (South), Lekas Panayiotis and Ayios Stephanos,130 together with Asteri-Dragatsoula.131 An hour on foot to the west of Ayios Stephanos, the depression at Lagio between towering limestone ridges with schistose subsoil created a fertile plain. This was settled in the EBA and to a lesser extent in the LBA; it had its own access to the sea at Trinasos or perhaps at Paizoulia just along the coast.132 Communications by sea were certainly easier than those by land. These would have been by long- boat or canoe; since the sail had not yet been introduced, the routes used would have been coastal, and it would have been difficult to reach places across open sea like Crete.133 The nearest major port to the south was Pavlopetri on the coast to the south-east,134 then 70 km by sea (but now only 48 km) and itself some 40 km from Kastraki on Kythera. The EH sites on Elaphonisos, which was then a promontory opposite Pavlopetri, lay mainly in the north, close to the then isthmus.135 There was certainly extensive trade in pottery (see below); other possible items of trade include wine, oil, and linen. Inland, important sites include Apidia and Geraki to the north-east, which was fortified with a megalithic wall,136 Palaiopyrgi and Kouphovouno in the plain of Sparta,137 Anthochori just to the south, and Pellana in the far north.138 Ayios Stephanos was not at the top of the hierarchy of settlements that had arisen in south-central Greece in this period. Such sites had 'corridor houses' like the House of the Tiles at Lerna or those at Kolonna on Aegina, Akovitika in Messenia, Thebes in Boeotia and perhaps Asea in Arcadia,139 large round buildings like that at Tiryns or fortifications like those of Lerna and Kolonna. No roof-tiles have been found at Ayios Stephanos or indeed at Geraki, but they are known at Anthochori, together with a massive wall,140 at Akovitika, at Ayios Demetrios in Triphylia,141 at many sites in the Argolid, even minor ones, and at Raphina, Asketario, Kolonna and Thebes.142 Nor have seal impressions been found, as at Lerna, Petri and Geraki,143 but their survival depends on burning at high temperatures, which is not attested at Ayios Stephanos. No high degree of social differentiation is apparent.

JANKO reign is conventionally dated to 2494-2487 bc; said to have been found in a tomb, this is now in Athens.144 It may of course have reached Kythera later. The other early inscription from Kythera, that of Narãm-Sín, designates not the EBA Sumerian ruler of that name but a MBA king of Esnunna.145 During EH II the settlement expanded beyond the centre of the plateau (fig. 14.1). In Area Alpha the earlier excavations uncovered walls with little stratigraphy but some whole pots.146 In addition to EH I, both Yellow Mottled ware, characteristic of EH II Early, and Cream Slipped ware, typical of EH II Late, were found. The first of the three EH building phases probably goes back to EH I.147 The second included Structure Alpha I, a rectangular room some 5 m long by 3.5 m wide aligned on a NNE-ssw axis, consisting of walls ab and ac=ao. This building was probably EH II Early, because it lay under the EH II Alpha burial 17 with Yellow Mottled vase HS 12.148 The third phase, on a slightly different axis, was probably EH II Late. To this phase belongs Structure Alpha II, with walls am, ap, av and aj forming two large rectangular rooms, at least 7.3 m N-s by 5.3 m ε-w, overlying Structure Alpha I. To the ε walls ae and al formed the corner of a rectangular room, Structure Alpha III.149 Pottery diagnostic of both phases of EH II was found in trench Alpha 5 to the w, and EH II sherds possibly associated with walls were found in Trial Trenches V and VII to the nw.150 In Area Delta on the Ν rim of the plateau, pieces of 'white slipped ware' found in trenches Delta 5 and 7 may have been Cream Slipped, and thus EH II Late. Three building phases can be recognised, of which the first was EH. This consisted of Structure Delta I, i.e. the narrow walls bc and bd, which formed a crude room facing ne with its walls at an obtuse angle to each other and abutting bedrock at the sw corner; the MH wall bi runs over wall bc. In addition, this phase probably included a narrow wall to the s, wall bk, which is apparently cut by the MH wall bj.151 To the se, in Area Eta, there were two phases of EH II occupation. In the first, wall do was built against a sharp rise in the bedrock. The building comprised at least one room with a minimum dimension of 1.5 m2, with occupation on the ledge of bedrock above. This room continued to be used during EH II Late; a saucer was left on the floor when it was abandoned.152 Down the slope&gt; Area Zeta yielded EH II Late sherds in a pocket of the bedrock.153 The substantial wall is is either of this period or MH I Earliest. On the s slope in Area Beta, EH II and MH I sherds were found in a hard red stratum above stereo. A wall of small stones, wall gr, must be EH II or MH I Early. The settlement or at least the cultivated area also included the sw slope, in Area Nu / Gamma 1, where EH II Early sherds were found. EH II sherds were recovered in Trial Trench III on the ne slope, and two undated walls, amid EH and MH sherds, were found on a terrace in Trial Trench IV to the se.154 Thus the entire hilltop, except for its Ν and nw sectors, may already have been inhabited during EH II. Too little of the settlement, only c. 587 m2 at most, was cleared to bedrock for any overall plan to emerge. The area available for occupation depends on how far down the slope the settlement extended at any given period. A settlement 70 m in diameter would amount to 13,000 m2; a settlement 160 m in diameter, the maximum, would cover 63,200 m2. But the steep ν slope is unlikely to have been occupied. EH walls may be found in Area Zeta as low as the 92 m contour, which encloses an area of almost 1.4 ha (fig. 14.1), while the scatter of sherds covers the hill down to the 91m contour to the Ν and w and the 83 m contour to the s and E, giving a total area of c. 26,500 m2 or 2.65 ha. This distribution corresponds to a village on the summit with zones of intensive use extending down to the harbours to the Ε and s. If it is reasonable to assume a density of 1 1 2 inhabitants per ha of inhabited area,155 the population of a settlement of 1.4 ha would have been c. 160. A higher density of 300 people per ha would yield a population of c. 420. 156 The houses seem to have been rectangular as was usual, e.g. at Eutresis and Zygouries. During the earlier phases bedrock was incorporated into the buildings; a similar practice is known in EH II Geraki.157 There is nothing as sophisticated as the unique small square structure at Pavlopetri, Building IX, which is built of large orthostates with small apses on its ν and s walls (fig. 14.3); to judge from associated pottery this was probably EH.158 144 N.M. 4578; Coldstream and Huxley 1972, 33, 218, 266. 145 See §3 (vii) below. 146 Taylour 1072, 23Q-40, 210 fier. &lt;λ. 147 See §2 (i).' 148 Taylour 1072, 212, pls. 30g, 40b. 149 The M H burial 19 lay over wall av, and the M H I Structure Alpha IV ran over wall ae (Taylour 1072, 23Q-40, 210 fig. a). 150 Taylour 1972, 248-9. 151 Taylour 1972, 244, 223 fig. 13, refers the earliest phase to early MH. 152 See Chapter 1 %% (vi)-(vii) above. 153 Chapter 1 §2 (vii) above. 154 Tavlour 1072, 248. 155 McDonald, Dickinson and Howell 1992, 758; cf.

Ayios Stephanos: the MH I settlement and burials.</page><page sequence="588">SUMMARY AND HISTORICAL CONCLUSIONS §2 563 The EH II pottery resembles that found elsewhere in the southern Greek mainland, like that from Asea and the north-east Péloponnèse.159 Many pieces can be assigned to the Early or Late phases;160 an EH II Early context has an EM IIA Early import. To enlarge the corpus I refer to the c. 17 vases from the earlier excavations of Areas Alpha and Delta, since they comprise a wider repertoire of shapes than the items in this volume (14-223). In plain ware there are saucers,161 pedestalled bowls,162 plates,163 miniature cups,164 baking pans,165 jars,166 bowls, sauceboats, and a strainer. In coarse wares there are jars, basins and pithoi. In orange fabric there is a lid with red paint.167 In Urfirnis ware, the 'Dark Painted' of Lerna III, the shapes include saucers, sauceboats,168 pedestalled bowls,169 miniature cups,170 a large cup, basins, jars, spoons and lids. In Yellow Mottled ware there are sauceboats, bowls, a cup,171 jars, spoons, a lid and an askos. In Cream Slipped ware the shapes comprise bowls, a handled bowl, saucers, sauceboats, a cup,172 askoi, jars, a bridge-spouted jar, spoons and askoi. Impressions on the bases of pots173 show that mats and/or baskets were used during their manufacture, presumably either as supports for pots that were being built up174 or as turn-tables to help their makers rotate the vessels before the potter's wheel was introduced. The latter phenomenon is also attested at Ayios Demetrios in Elis,175 at Tsoungiza and elsewhere in the Argolid,176 and on Kythera.177 The interior of Laconia was not in the mainstream of ceramic development,178 since Yellow Mottled ware is still unknown there,179 but the coast was in full contact with other regions. The Yellow Mottled and grey-green fabrics may be imported, the former from the Argolid, whence it reached Asea,180 the latter from Corinthia.181 Two frying pan handles are also in imported fabrics of mainland origin; one of them has impressed triangles.182 A pithos sherd from Pavlopetri has similar triangles,183 as does an imported EH fragment found at Kastraki on Kythera.184 Another similarity with Pavlopetri is that the fabric there usually contains silver mica; at Ayios Stephanos micaceous inclusions occur in the orange fabric (160-205). A very similar fabric is known at Kastraki.185 The EH II pottery from Ayios Stephanos, characterised by Yellow Mottled ware in both phases and by Cream Slipped in the later one (Appendix 1), can be closely related to the sequence in the Argolid, where four ceramic phases of EH II have been identified (chart 14. i).186 Yellow Mottled ware appears in phase A late, remains plentiful until phase C late (the time of Building BG) and diminishes in phase D (the era of the House of the Tiles); Cream Slipped ware appears in quantity only in phase C. Likewise at Tsoungiza EH I and ΈΗ II Early' pottery, which is equivalent to Lerna III phase early A and contains no Yellow Mottled ware, is stratified below ΈΗ II developed' pottery equivalent to Lerna III phases late Α-B.187 Thus the EBA occupation of Ayios Stephanos lasted from EH I (= EH I at Lerna and/or Lerna III phase early A) through EH II Early (Lerna III phases late Α-B) until EH II Late (Lerna III phase C); it ceased before the very end of EH II (Lerna III phase D). In their survey of southern Laconia, Waterhouse and Hope Simpson noted Cream Slipped sherds, typical of EH II Late, only at Apidia and Xeronisi,188 whereas they saw Yellow Mottled ones at Geraki, Peristeri (East), a hill north of Kokkinada, Asteri-Karaousi, Xeronisi, Lekas (South), Ayios Stephanos, and Mavrovouni.189 The burnt destruction level behind the acropolis wall at Geraki contained vases comparable to Lerna III phase C, including Cream Slipped ware.190 Pavlopetri yielded Urfirnis sherds, perhaps including sauceboats, and Yellow Mottled ware; no Cream Slipped sherds were noted.191 Even if these are harder to recognise, it seems that fewer sites were occupied in southern Laconia 159 D.

JANKO during EH II Late than in EH II Early. Whether this reflects a greater nucleation of settlements or a decline in population is as yet unknown. No EM pottery is known from anywhere in Laconia.192 EH occupation is well attested on Kythera by the Kythera Survey and the excavations at Kastraki; the pottery has close affinities with that of Elaphonisos.193 The unstratified rubbish pit from Kastraki, Deposit Alpha,194 contains no Cream Slipped sherds, but does include Red Slipped and Burnished, Urfirnis and Yellow Mottled sherds, with sauceboats. As at Ayios Stephanos, much of the coarser pottery in orange clay is micaceous.195 There is no sign of Cycladic influence, but there is an import from Crete and another from the north Aegean. The excavators deem Deposit Alpha a mixed lot of EH I and EH II pottery.196 However, since the same wares are stratified together in the Phase Ha pottery from Ayios Demetrios in Triphylia,197 the date should be early in EH II (but not the earliest phase, because of the presence of Yellow Mottled ware). Most of the EH small finds were published with the earlier excavations, and are referred to in Chapter 8 above; since their contexts were poorly dated, more objects of this period were probably found than are recognised in Taylour 1972. Metal tools displaced stone ones very slowly: the sole metal object known is the tweezers HS 203 from Alpha burial 10. 198 Apart from the tools from Pyrgos Diroú199 and a hoard said to have come from Thyreatis but perhaps really from Lerna, this is the only metal item known from EH Laconia.200 Finds of obsidian comprised a cortical flake, bladelets and retouched bladelets; in contrast with the assemblage at Geraki,201 there are none in chert. As at Kastraki,202 the presence of cores shows that some obsidian was brought from Melos as a raw material even though other artefacts of Cycladic origin were absent. The small number of tools in comparison with the Argolid suggests that knapping was only a part-time activity. Stone tools of other materials included an adze, pestles and a phyllite disc. Twenty terracotta figurines were found, including some unusual female types;203 anthropomorphic figurines are very rare at other EH sites.204 There are also birds and bovines. One of these, 5011, may have worn a yoke; models of yoked oxen were found at Tsoungiza,205 and these figurines are the first evidence for draught oxen in Greece. The birds may be paralleled at Kouphovouno,206 and other animal figurines are known from Laina near Goritsá, Palaiopyrgi and Ayios Vasilios.207 Terracotta whorls attest to the spinning of wool or linen; flax seeds and linen-impressions are known from Geraki.208 There are terracotta buttons and a possible 'fire-dog' terminal of terracotta,209 presumably for roasting meat on wooden skewers. The bones of deer and hares show that hunting was an important source of food, but ovicaprids, pigs and cattle were kept (fig. 12.7). Shellfish, notably Donax, were also eaten.210 Between seven and nineteen EH burials, including adults, were found in Area Alpha at the centre of the plateau. Some were in pits, others, probably, in cists, but no grave certainly datable to EH is a cist, although these are known elsewhere.211 They were all within the settlement, and should probably be classified as intramural.212 The bodies were usually laid in a contracted position. Almost 50% of tombs, especially those of adults, had some grave goods; this is a higher proportion than was later the case.213 These burials resemble those in most of the mainland, where rich grave goods are very rare. Both cists and pits are attested at Kouphovouno214 and elsewhere;215 single interments in cists were also normal in the Cyclades. All the burials at Ayios Stephanos are of individuals: contrast the grave circles of Leukas, the double-decker cists of the Cyclades, the multiple burials in cists of Cycladic type at Ayios Kosmas in Attica, the rock-cut tombs at Manika in Euboea, or the round tombs for multiple use in the Cretan Mesará. The rock-cut tombs at Pavlopetri have always been considered EH, like those of Manika;216 however, they may have Minoan traits and be later.217 The intramural burial of adults, also known at Kouphovouno,218 was not unusual at this time elsewhere in Greece.219 At Ayios Stephanos this practice continued for most of the Brone Age.

Ayios Stephanos provides no evidence for the reuse of tombs, funerary cult, burial tumuli like that at Pellana north of Sparta,220 or the stuffing of skeletons into clefts in the rock as in central Greece. (iii) Early Helladic III Extensive survey suggests that, of the eleven EH II settlements around the mouth of the Eurotas, at least four were abandoned at this time. These were the Lagio site, Ayios Stephanos, Peristeri (East) and Kokkinada (fig. 13.1); Lagio and Kokkinada were not reoccupied until LH IIIA-B. The difficult question of how EH II ended at Ayios Stephanos is part of the wider controversy about the transition from EH II to EH III in better known regions of Greece.221 There was no stylistic overlap between the two types of pottery; EH II Late did not evolve into EH III or MH I Early, and was not used alongside it. A sharp discontinuity also appears in the wider material culture, since figurines ceased to be used and apsidal buildings were introduced. The answer depends in part on the stratigraphy of Area Zeta. A layer of hard red soil with burnt human bones suggests that the building involving wall is came to a fiery end. However, this event probably dates to MH I Earliest.222 No sign of destruction by fire was noted elsewhere. In Area Alpha this may simply be owed to the lack of stratigraphy,223 but that elsewhere was well preserved. A stratum that mixed EH II Late with MH I Earliest sherds was found in Area Zeta.224 In Area Eta the EH II building was certainly abandoned; layers of tumbled stones and decayed mudbrick, with a mixture of EH II Late with MH I Early sherds, mark the transition.225 There may have been a similar transition in Area Beta, where EH II sherds were found and wall gr, probably MH I Early rather than EH II, lay beside and under a hard red stratum with EH II and MH I sherds, with stereo below.226 Ayios Stephanos was abandoned before the final phase of EH II at Lerna, i.e. Lerna III phase D.227 This phase was contemporary with the first EH III style pottery in central Greece (that of Lefkandi I, Manika and Thebes group B), before EH III proper (Lerna IV) began at Lerna;228 there was a gap in the occupation there, but a transitional phase at Tiryns (chart 14.1).229 Ayios Stephanos lacks the Pattern Painted ware and other styles characteristic of canonical EH III in the Argolid, Corinthia, Elis and further north. At Geraki a severe destruction with burning during a mature phase of EH II is followed by a gap until MH I;230 no EH III was noted at Pavlopetri. None was found by the Laconia Survey,231 but Pattern Painted sherds are known at Vouno Panagias and Ayios Georgios, both near Skoura south-east of Amyclae.232 Pottery of the second and the third phases of EH III has also been identified in Arcadia at Asea,233 and the third and last phase of EH III is known at two Messenian sites. The first is Deriziotis Aloni near Pylos; this was excavated by W. D. Taylour in 1958.234 At Nichoria, what is called 'MH I group A' pottery235 is better paralleled in late Lerna IV rather than Lerna V.236 Neither place had been settled in EH I- II or the earlier phases of EH III. The new style probably reached southern Laconia very late in EH III. A few pieces of EH III pottery were found at Ayios Stephanos. Area Zeta produced 1035-1053; a possible Pattern Painted sherd, 2205, comes from Area Delta; Trial Trench III yielded 2214; and 2315 was found at an unknown location. The site forms part of a consistent pattern in the southern Péloponnèse, where a site unoccupied during EH III is settled at the end of that period. This phenomenon is widespread in Greece, the Cyclades and Crete.237 On Kythera, however, the situation is different. The EH I- II Deposit Alpha at Kastraki was succeeded by local pottery of central Cretan type and EM II (?late)- MM IA date in Deposit Beta,238 found immediately above natural at Kastri. This indicates the arrival of Minoans on the island,239 although the settlement may have been intermittent or seasonal until MM IA.240 Intensive survey suggests that was an overlap at two other sites between users of Helladic and those of Minoan pottery, but also reveals that the small scattered settlements typical of the EBA had disappeared by the time of Deposit Delta.241 220 Spyropoulos 1999, 35~7- 221 See Maran iqq8. 222 See Chapter 1 §2 (vi)-(vii) above. 223 Tavlour 1072, 2&lt;*q-ao. 224 Chapter 1 §2 (vi)-(vii) above. 225 Chapter 1 §« (v)-(vi) above. 226 Chapter 1 §4 (vj above. 227 See §2 (ii) above. 228 Rutter 19930, 763-6. 229 Forsén 1992, 32-3; Maran 1998, 12-15. 230 Weingarten et al. 1999; Crouwel et al. 2001, 13. 231 Cavanagh and Crouwel 1996, 16. 232 Banou 1999, 79, pls. i3a«7, 13c. 3. 233 Forsén 1996, 47, 66-7; Maran 1998, 29. 234 Stocker 2003. 231 Ho well 19920, fig. 3.2. 236 Rutter 19930, 773. 237 Watrous 2001, 223. 238 Kiriatzi 2003, 129. 239 Coldstream and Huxley 1972, 275-7. 240 Rutter and Zerner 1984, 76. 241 Broodbank 1999, 211-12.</page><page sequence="591">566 R. JANKO The interpretation of this transition is controversial.242 Does the lack of EH III pottery in the southern Péloponnèse signify that the new ceramic style, well attested in central Greece and the north-east Péloponnèse, had already evolved into Transitional EH ΠΙ/MH I before the introduction into Laconia and Messenia of the culture which created them? If so, mature EH II pottery could still have been in use in the region when Transitional EH ΠΙ/MH I appeared, and the relatively high number of EH II sites identified by the Laconia Survey would reflect a longer-lived EH II culture in the south than in the northern Péloponnèse. However, the evidence from Ayios Stephanos makes this unlikely. Instead, EH III was probably a period of discontinuity and depopulation in the Péloponnèse, just as in the Cyclades; this accords with the sharp architectural discontinuity vis-à-vis the following period, which possibly coincided with the arrival from Anatolia of new elements in the population.243 Indeed, these changes might be related to the turmoil and recession in the Near East, reflected by the disorder of the First Intermediate Period in Egypt and an analogous downturn in Palestine, Syria and Anatolia, perhaps occasioned by climatic change when the annual flooding of the Nile was interrupted for about a century toward the end of the third millennium bc.244 Such severe depopulation was to recur at the end of the LBA. Perhaps a combination of archaeological, linguistic and genetic arguments will eventually confirm, in modified form, the venerable but unfashionable theory that the speakers of the Indo-European dialect that was to become Greek entered Hellas at this time,245 moving into a largely empty landscape. But that debate lies beyond the scope of this volume. 3. A COASTAL ENTREPOT OF THE MIDDLE BRONZE AGE (i) The Middle Bronze Age at Ayios Stephanos The relative chronology of the MH period on the Greek mainland is controversial (see chart 14.1). Few sites have been excavated with well-stratified deposits of pottery covering the whole period, and they reveal considerable regional variation. Although Ayios Stephanos typifies this variation, the ceramics from the site are crucial for resolving these difficulties, for two reasons. First, the stratigraphy covers the entire period. Secondly, the site (like Pavlopetri and Geraki) lies at a major interface between the Helladic and the Minoan cultures without the added complication of a Cycladic dimension,246 since it lacks the Aeginetan and Cycladic imports that are common further north on the mainland; Aeginetan appears only in LH I, and Cycladic never. This gives its assemblage a distinctively Minoan tinge when compared with other sites on the mainland. Zerner has set the whole chronology on a firm footing by correlating the pottery from Ayios Stephanos with that from Lerna.247 For fixed points she relies both on imports from Crete and on the evolution of Lustrous Decorated ware, which occurs at both places. The Lustrous Decorated and other 'Minoan' wares, found throughout the MBA at Ayios Stephanos, Lerna, Kolonna, Asine and elsewhere in the eastern Péloponnèse but not at Lefkandi,248 probably came from Kythera (see below); this was surely the bridge between Lerna and Ayios Stephanos, and between the Helladic and Minoan cultures. Minoan pottery was present from the beginning of MH I at both Ayios Stephanos and Lerna. By MM I A the Minoans had developed a trade route from Kydonia (Khania)249 and western Crete via Kythera, which branched north-east to Lerna and north-west to the ports of the Laconian Gulf. Broodbank notes that this 'South-western Network' antedated the Cretan penetration of the Cyclades in MM IB; he persuasively links the Minoans' expansion with the introduction of the sailing ship, and suggests that fear of them may have caused the increase in fortified and nucleated settlements in the Cyclades.250 Minoan influence reached Messenia in MH II,251 and Lustrous Decorated sherds are reported in late MH levels on the island of Nisakouli off Methone.252 Thus, at least later, this trade route continued round the southern tip of Messenia. Starting in MM IB, central and eastern Crete developed routes to the north via the Cyclades to Lavrion, and to the east via the Dodecanese to Anatolia, Cyprus and the Near East.253 The location of Ayios Stephanos on the western trade route contributed to the site's prosperity in the MBA. The inhabitants' increasing wealth is shown by the more solid construction of their houses and the richer grave goods in their tombs; the wealthiest grave 242 Rutter 19030, 763-6. 243 Maran iqq8, 460-q. 244 Niizhet Dalfes, Kukla and Weiss 1997. 245 Biegen and Haley 1928. 246 Rutter and Rutter 1076, 63. 247 See Chapter 5 §§2-3. 248 L.

But their prosperity was as nothing compared with that of the Minoans. We shall consider their relations with Crete below.254 Study of MH settlement patterns in Laconia is hindered by the fact that, before C. Zerner's work, no sub-phases were recognised among the pottery that was found. However, the coast clearly had more settlements than did the interior; 36 sites are now known in all.255 Around the mouth of the Euro tas Ayios Stephanos was one of the main centres, along with Lekas Panayiotis, Lekas (Southwest), Asteri and Ayios Strategos. Whereas twelve sites were occupied in EH II, eleven are known from the entire MBA (fig. 13.1). Of these, eight had been occupied during EH II, while three, Lekas (Southwest), Ayios Nikolaos and Kokkinia, seem new. One important local industry known from MH I onwards was the manufacture of shaft-hole axes of greenstone. Such axes, known earlier further north, are not found in southern Greece until EH III Late.256 One MH I axe was found in Area Eta; another, presumably MH,257 was from Area Delta, which also yielded a bored celt.258 The raw material, a gabbro, occurs near the deposits of lapis lacedaemonius.259 As it is among the harder stones (6.0-6.5 on Mohs' scale), it began to be used for stone vases in Crete only from MM I onwards, and then only rarely.260 This material was worked into axes at the site. Nine drill-cores were found in Trial Trench III and Areas Beta, Delta and Alpha, where a limestone slab pocked with drill-impressions of the same diameter as some of the cores, c. 1.5 cm, was also unearthed.261 Our cores correspond to the perforations of the axes (c. 2 cm) and surely derive from the latter. The cores must all consist of greenstone, like the specimens 6100-6101, which were at first mistaken for lapis lacedaemonius^ the confusion is common,262 but the latter stone was hardly worked until Neopalatial times.263 The cores would have been drilled out by using quartz sand and a bow-drill made of a hollow reed cane, Arundo donax, in the same way as the earlier class of Minoan stone vases.264 The axes may have been widely exported, at least within Laconia. A 'bored celt' found at Ayios Ioannis near Kalyvia of Vezani265 to the north-east was presumably of this type; other examples are from Geraki266 and Palaiopyrgi. Such axes occur elsewhere on the mainland, including at Asine,267 but these were made at Asine, since drill-cores are also found there.268 Obsidian and chert tools are common at the site throughout the MBA (table A6.10). The materials used, 91% Melian obsidian and 9% local chert, were typical of southern Greece as a whole. Denticulate blades and hollow-based projectile-points were introduced later in the MBA. Metal tools were more common than during the EBA; metal-working, presumably over hearths fanned by the on-shore breezes, is attested at the site from MH I Early onwards. To turn to funerary practices, study of the c. 74 burials269 reveals that at first they were made in plots among the buildings; later the cemetery was mainly on the top of the hill, in Areas Alpha and Delta, where the houses had been abandoned, as at Asine, Argos, Berbati, Kirrha and Pefkakia.270 There are more rectangular stone cists and pithos burials rather than pits, and more extended rather than crouched interments, than in the EBA. The increase in extended burials is unusual.271 The fact that graves became larger and better built suggests that people became wealthier over time. Infants were sometimes buried together, sometimes intramurally, and received grave goods more often than adults. Grave goods are found in 22% of the burials, which recalls other intramural cemeteries like Asine at 15% and Lerna at 3O%.272 Thus there is more differentiation between burials, especially of adults, than in the previous period. Most of these funerary customs are paralleled elsewhere.273 The use of pithoi or jars for infant burials is known at, for instance, Amyclae, Olympia, Korakou, Lerna, and Kirrha,274 not to mention the Minoan-style pithos burial near Lazarianika in south-western Kythera.275 In Crete pithos burials began in the MBA,276 and this is true of the mainland also. The use for single burials of shallow cists lined and covered with slabs is even more common, as at Geraki.277 At Pavlopetri there are some 37 slab-lined rectangular cist tombs among the houses; these are probably MH, since there are pithoi 254 See §3 (vi). 255 Banou 2000, iq6 with fig. 1. 256 Forsén 1992, 227-32; Maran 1998, 286-8. 257 Jorsén 1992, 106-7. 258 6090, HS 284-285 in Taylour 1972, 247; Forsén 1992, 106-7. 259 Blitzer 1QQ2, 727-8. 260 Warren 1969, 132, 145, 159-60.

JANKO inside graves 22 and 29, a phenomenon paralleled in MH graves at Argos and Mycenae.278 The cists seem to have been placed with an awareness of the walls of the houses, and sometimes a house-wall forms one side, as at Ayios Stephanos; whether they were contemporary with the houses or later is uncertain.279 At Kirrha, slab-lined cist tombs run from MH to LH II;280 at Ayios Stephanos they continue into LH III. No burial tumuli have been recognised, although, in addition to those in western and central Greece,281 they are known in Messenia at Nichoria282 and Voïdhokoilia.283 (ii) Middle Helladic I (fig. 14.2) Although the areas in which MH I layers were reached were at most c. 650 m2 in extent, three phases can be distinguished. This suggests that the period was lengthy, as do the results of the excavations at Lefkandi and Nichoria.284 By the end of MH I the settlement probably occupied the hilltop down to the 97 m contour at the Ν and the 91m contour at the s, an area of c. 27,225 m2; thus it was already as large as it had been in EH II. Apart from a few EH III sherds from Areas Delta and Zeta and Trial Trench III,285 the earliest known reoccupation was in Area Zeta on the se slope nearest to the spring, where three phases of MH I were found (fig. 14.2). Over an EH II Late stratum, sherds dated to Phase I, MH I Earliest, were found.286 This layer contained the badly burnt leg-bones of an infant (Zeta burial 6); sherds of a pithos lay beneath and pieces of a jar above. If this was a pithos or jar burial, the burning of the bones remains unexplained; had it been exposed by erosion when the maquis was burned off to erect a building at the end of phase I? This building would have included wall it and perhaps wall is. In Phase II, MH I Early, a solid terrace-wall io was built over wall it. It probably supported an apsidal long-house with its entrance to the se and a superstructure of combustible materials like wattles and thatch. This building burned down, and the debris from it, containing carbon, ash and many sherds, was dumped into the terrace below. In Phase III, MH I Late, a house was built with three or four rooms, Structure Zeta I. Another, Structure Zeta II again aligned nw-se, was erected over wall io. Their rectangular plans suggest that these houses had flat earthen roofs. Both buildings burned down, filling the terrace below with tumble, burned mud-brick, timbers and pottery.287 In Area Epsilon nearby MH I Early sherds were stratified under MH I Late sherds.288 Two MH I building phases were recognised in Area Eta further up the slope.289 In the first, corresponding to Phase II above, a long wall, dj, was built with a ne-sw axis. This wall, over 4.5 m long, probably belonged to an apsidal long-house, with its entrance to the sw; one cannot guess its total dimensions. It apparently collapsed, with no sign of burning. An infant, possibly malnourished, was interred during this phase. In MH I Late a rectangular house on a different axis, Structure Eta I, with a superstructure including mudbrick, daub and reed canes, was built. This house had a ceiling or roof of smoothed mud laid on reed-canes. The presence of canes, Arundo donax, is noteworthy, since this plant came from the Near East: its name κανών, attested in Mycenaean Greek in the derivative ko- no-ni-pi290 is of Semitic origin.291 Three or four infants were buried under the floor before this building collapsed, apparently after a fire. At least seven pots lay on the floor and in an open area nearby; the distribution of sherds shows that two of them fell from the roof, which proves that it was flat. On the sw slope, an apsidal long-house, Structure Nu I with its entrance to the se, was erected during MH I Late.292 It was c. 4.5 m wide and, if we can extrapolate from the dimensions of the completely excavated Structure Alpha IV,293 originally c 14 m long. It was built of mudbrick on a stone socle; mud-plaster coated the walls. The destruction debris contained mud with reed-impressions among carbonised roof-beams and pebbles that were used to hold thatch in place. This building must have had a pitched roof without an upper storey. At the nw end, a mudbrick wall with a central wooden threshold separated the apse from the main hall. The apse, which was at a higher level than the main room, was used for storage and contained a number of vases that had been placed on stone pot-stands. The building burned down within MH I Late; the floor was covered with burnt mudbrick and roof-timbers, with much pottery. The plank built into the threshold provided the low radiocarbon 278 Alden 2001, 21 with n. 15. 279 Harding et al. 196g, 123-5. 280 Dor, Jannoray and van Effenterre i960, 46-9. 281 Cavanagh and Mee 1998, 29-30. 282 McDonald, Dickinson and Howell iqq2, 761. 283 Korres iqqo, r-8. 284 McDonald, Dickinson and Howell 1992, 760. 285 See §2 (iii) above. 286 See Chapter 1 §2 (vi) above. 287 Chapter 1 §2 (v) above. 288 Chapter 1 §1 (v) above. 289 Chapter 1 §§3 (iv)-(v) above. 290 Ventris and Chadwick 1056, 329. 291 Chantraine 1968, 493. 292 See Chapter 1 §8 (x) above. 293 Xaylour 1972, 210 fig. 3.</page><page sequence="594">SUMMARY AND HISTORICAL CONCLUSIONS §3 569 date of 1838 BC + 138.294 This suggests that MH I ended later than has been thought, and accords with the architectural and ceramic evidence in indicating that MH I was a long period at the site. On the s rim of the plateau, wall gr made of small stones may have been MH I Early. Above it there was another possible long-house, Structure Beta I, on much the same orientation as Structure Nu I. This building burned down within MH I Late, leaving two pots among the debris of tumble, mudbrick and beams.295 Trench Beta 12A to the w produced MH I sherds, notably 2219, perhaps from the debris of a building.296 On the summit a large apsidal building, Structure Alpha IV, was evidently MH I (it overlay the EH II wall ae).297 The building had two phases, since its original apse as collapsed and was replaced by the new apse ar. This entailed a slight increase in its length; its final exterior dimensions were 3.4 m by 1 1.25 m. It was entered by a porch between antae at its se end. How it was destroyed is unknown. To the N, erosion and stone-robbing make the architecture in Area Delta hard to understand. Based on its elevation, the corner formed by walls bf and bj, Structure Delta II, may belong to this period. Wall bj ran under wall bl, which was probably MH II, while wall bf was cut at its sw end by a pit that contained only MH pottery.298 The use of apsidal dwellings with entrances oriented roughly s, an architectural style without precedent in the EBA,299 is highly significant. This innovation probably reached other parts of the southern Péloponnèse at about this time. Pavlopetri had two apsidal buildings, with entrances approximately to the s, in areas F and B/D, both c. 5 m wide and the latter c. 10 m long; the fact that one does not match the rectlinear plan of the town (fig. 14.3) suggests that it is older. The MH I house Unit V-i at Nichoria may have been apsidal.300 However, the arrival of this type of construction in Messenia and Laconia formed the end of a longer trajectory. Apsidal architecture was first seen in central Greece in EH II Euboea at Mourteri near Kyme and perhaps at Linovrochi near Lefkandi.301 An apsidal house 5.5 m wide was destroyed by fire in the final phase of EH II at Thebes, and a later one (EH III), even larger, was 7.5 m wide; these dimensions imply the use of interior columns.302 Apsidal houses appear in EC III on Syros and Paros, and in EH III at Chasampali in Thessaly and at Lerna, where they were often destroyed and rebuilt.303 The MH apsidal house 98 A at Lerna has interior dimensions of 3.25 x 10 m;304 that at Korakou was 3.8 x 6 m in size,305 comparable to houses Cand Xat Eutresis.306 These dimensions resemble those at Ayios Stephanos. The introduction of apsidal construction is one of the central arguments for the intrusion of a different element into the population at this time. The inhabitants of Ayios Stephanos already ceased to erect apsidal houses within MH I, replacing them, as in Area Zeta, with rectangular buildings; these remained the norm down to LH IIIC Early. The same development occurred at Lerna, where rectangular buildings superseded apsidal ones early in the MBA.307 At Nichoria apsidal construction probably went out of use by MH III.308 This evolution recurred in the early Iron Age, when apsidal construction had been reintroduced.309 Three factors may have caused it. First, the apse may have tended to collapse, as in Structure Alpha IV. Secondly, fire posed a grave threat to buildings with pitched roofs covered with thatch. The MH I Late fires in Areas Beta, Zeta, Eta and Nu may well have been a single conflagration. Another explanation, furnished by comparative study of other cultures, is that such fires were deliberate social acts related to a major change in the community.310 Thirdly, apsidal construction suits sparse open-plan settlements, whereas rectangular houses are more compact and better suited to a higher density of habitation. The MH I pottery of Ayios Stephanos, all handmade, can be divided into Transitional EH III/MH I (= MH I Earliest)311 and two MH I phases. A few Transitional pieces come from Areas Zeta, Eta and Nu;312 one bowl, 1064, was imported from the north-east Péloponnèse. MH I Early pottery is more plentiful,313 and MH I Late is commonest of all.314 Most of the assemblage is of local origin. True Grey Minyan is rare, as elsewhere in Laconia;315 it is replaced by the local ware termed Dark Burnished or 294 See Appendix ο %%. 295 See Chapter ι §4 (v) above. 296 See Chapter 1 §5 (vi) above. 297 Taylour 10,72, 240, 210 fig. 3, pl. 46a. 298 Taylour 1972, 244, 223 fig. 13. 299 Cf.

The ceramic assemblage there was probably identical to that at Ayios Stephanos. Zerner suggests on the basis of imports that MH I Earliest corresponds to the end of EM III on Crete, MH I Early to MM IA and MH I Late to MM IB-MM IB/II (chart 14.1), since much of the MH I Late Lustrous Decorated pottery looks MM IA but is in fact later in Cretan terms.319 MH I corresponds to Deposit Gamma (MM IA) at Kastri on Kythera, where a Minoan settlement had been plantedin EM II- III. Both Ayios Stephanos and Kastri have Lustrous Decorated and (eventually) Micaceous Minoan wares. These are Minoan in style and follow Cretan trends, but not slavishly; but at Kastri there is no sign of mainland influence. The presence at Pavlopetri and Kythera of both Lustrous Decorated and Micaceous Minoan pottery supports the results of chemical analysis which suggest that these wares are not Cretan but south Peloponnesian or, as Zerner suggests, Kytheran.320 Both wares are also found at Lerna, and both employ a distinctive technique for attaching handles by cutting holes in the walls of vases. Coldstream and Huxley attributed this technique to the mainland,321 but Zerner ascribes it to the southern mainland or Kythera, since it is unknown in Crete or central Greece. Dickinson objected that Ayios Stephanos was ill placed to serve as a centre for exportation and Lustrous Dark-on-Light ware has not been found on Kythera; instead he suggests that Lustrous Decorated ware was made at both Lerna and Ayios Stephanos.322 The Lustrous wares were certainly distributed by sea, as their rarity in the Laconian hinterland shows. However, since this hypothesis is uneconomical, Zerner is more likely to be right.323 The use of purple paint on Lustrous Decorated vases, seen at Ayios Stephanos from MH I Late (e.g. 1875) and on Kythera in MM IB-IIIA,324 may also be a Kytheran feature. The island was famed in antiquity for the production of purple dye from the murex sea-snail.325 This was done by boiling (πορφύρειν) enormous quantities of these molluscs; our word 'purple' derives from this process.326 Kythera was called Porphyroussa 'because of the beauty of the purple garments made there',327 while the coasts of Laconia produced the best purple after Phoenicia itself.328 Although murex shells were found at Pavlopetri and Kranae,329 they were not numerous enough to prove the manufacture of purple, for which great numbers of snails are needed; indeed, some have questioned whether the purple paint on these vases came from the murex,330 but the middens of shells have probably been submerged by the change in sea-level. Dull Painted ware, unknown at Kastri except for one possible import,331 also recalls Minoan rather than mainland style, but followed earlier Kytheran traditions; it has a different but related technique for attaching handles. Sherds with the crazed paint typical of this ware were found at Pavlopetri.332 The pottery documents the influence of the early phase of Minoan expansion attested at Kastri. The contrast between Lustrous Decorated wares, which followed contemporary Minoan styles, and Dull Painted, which followed earlier ones, is explicable if the former ware was produced on Kythera by potters working fully within Minoan traditions, while the latter was made on the mainland by potters isolated from the latest Cretan fashions. Jones and Zerner, relying on chemical and stylistic analyses, suggest that the similarities result from the movement of potters to Ayios Stephanos.333 One simple cist burial of an adult, Beta 6, is dated to MH I Late by pots 2273 and 228 1;334 the child burial Alpha 1 is also MH I.335 Intramural infant burials in pits were numerous.

JANKO the proportion of the site occupied was probably no smaller than before; the inhabitants clearly had the will and the strength to rebuild after the fire or fires on the sw and se of the hilltop. They used less flammable roofing materials, substituting for the remaining apsidal houses oblong structures with flat earthen roofs. The introduction of rectangular housing was surely connected with a change to the plan of the settlement. At some point the original 'mainland' style of freestanding buildings, retained in Messenia until MH III at Dorion/Malthi337 and never abandoned at Nichoria,338 evolved into an 'agglutinative' layout based on blocks of houses, such as was usual in Crete and the Cyclades.339 The new layout of Ayios Stephanos must have originated around this time. The settlement came to consist of an agglomeration of rectangular buildings with 6-10 rooms and courtyards, laid out with no centralised planning. The plan of Korakou may be compared.340 Pavlopetri also had such a layout; the presence of two apsidal buildings, one of which disrupts the plan (fig. 14.3), suggests that it underwent a similar evolution at some date.341 Its layout could represent a later stage of development, perhaps even Mycenaean, as has been argued regarding Malthi,342 where houses were built against the wall which surrounded the settlement.343 However, I prefer to posit that the plans of both settlements derive from MH I Late to MH II. At Ayios Stephanos the streets were at first paved with pebbles from the sea-shore; in the LBA schist slabs were often used for courtyards and passages, as at Nichoria344 and the modern Cyclades. Steps and terraces were used to accommodate sloping terrain. The streets and alleys varied from 1 m to 2 m in width. The undated streets at Pavlopetri are 2 m to 4.5 m wide, with an average of c. 3 m (fig. 14.4), and the LH street in Area III at Nichoria reaches 3 m in width.345 The architecture of Ayios Stephanos remained unsophisticated for the rest of the Bronze Age, without stone column bases, ashlar masonry or thresholds made from single blocks (there is one stone door- socket, probably LH ΠΙΑ). Most surviving walls were only the stone socles of walls made of sun-dried mudbricks. Floors were of beaten earth; roofs were flat and spanned by wooden beams supporting reed canes or wattles and clay. The relative rarity of pithoi until LH IIIC Early may suggest that storage was centralised. The MH II remains are scrappy (fig. 14.4). On the se slope, a rectangular building on a nw-se axis, Structure Zeta III, adjoined a walled alley, Street Zeta I, which made a right-angled turn to the NW. A step was added where the alley met another road, Street Zeta II, presumably because of wear at that point; a similar technique can be seen at Pavlopetri, e.g. where Street 1 joins Street 2 (fig. 14.4). Three complete vases represent disturbed floor levels.346 Higher up the slope in Area Eta, MH II occupation is attested by a wall, a cobbled road and a pot.347 On the sw slope in Area Nu MH II is represented by an adult burial and a building on a nw-se axis with two floors.348 On the south-central slope there was a house on a wnw-ene axis, Structure Beta II, with a floor on which lay several vases. Its south-facing doorway opened onto a walled alley, Street Beta II.349 As usual, the remains are less clear on the plateau, because of erosion and imprecision in dating the MH strata. Structure Alpha V was perhaps MH II; its wall ak is cut by the MH burial Alpha 8.350 In Area Delta further Ν there were four building phases, not three as was thought. The third phase, which was MH I- II, comprises two rectangular structures on the same nnw-sse alignment. The first is Structure Delta III,351 consisting of two rooms 2.4 m wide by at least 9.7 m long.352 Wall bl seems to run over wall bj, which is assigned to MH I,353 while wall bb was cut by burial 7, which contained two MM IIB-IIIA vessels,354 and wall bi by the LH I burial 14. Walls bg and bh formed the corner of a third room on the same alignment, Structure Delta IV; Street Delta I separated it from the others. In Trial Trench VII nearby, a rectangular building on a N-s axis was probably MH, since most of the pottery was of that period and none was earlier.355 337 Howell 1992, 79. 338 McDonald, Dickinson and Howell 1992, 763. 339 Dickinson 1994, 61-7. 340 Biegen 1921, pl. vin. 341 See §3 (ii) above. 342 Darcque 1980, 32-3. 343 Valmin 1938, pl. 3. 344 Walsh and McDonald 1992, 458. 345 McDonald and Wilkie 1992, %%1 with fig. 7-11. 346 Chapter 1 §2 (iii) above. 347 Chapter 1 §3 (iii) above. 348 Chapter 1 §8 (ix) above. 349 Chapter 1 §4 (iv) above. 350 Taylour 1972, 240, 210 fig. 3. 351 Tavlour 1072, 244-f^, 223 fiff. 13, pl. 46b. 352 Taylour 1972, 244-5, 223 fig· X3&gt; interpreted this as a megaron with a porch facing se and later reuse, because LH IIIC Early vessels were found around it.

A sign of Cretan influence, they remain rare until the end of the MBA. The assemblage corresponds to MM IB- II and to Deposit Delta at Kastri (lower layers), where this phase is equally poorly represented and hard to recognise (chart 14.1). MH II material is more readily identified at Lerna. Zerner plausibly suggests that MH I Late at Ayios Stephanos overlapped with Lernaean MH II;357 this may explain the paucity of MH II here and other signs that the phase was brief. The trends seen in MH I continue, showing that Ayios Stephanos was a locus of interchange between mainland and Minoan culture. However, on Kythera the sole sign of mainland influence is a Dull Painted sherd which may have been imported from Ayios Stephanos or Pavlopetri.358 The peak sanctuary above Kastri at Agios Georgios tou Vounou was founded at this time.359 By the Second Palace Period the small scattered settlements typical of the EBA had gone, while hamlets of Minoan character dotted the central and eastern parts of the island. Kastri itself was c. 9-10 ha in area.360 At Nichoria Minoan influence began in MH II but was far weaker, with no distinct classes of Minoan pottery and no clear sign of the potter's wheel.361 Burials Eta 14 and Nu 14 are definitely MH II, and up to five of the infant burials assigned to MH I Late could instead belong to MH II. An unusual trussed burial of an adolescent, Eta burial 6, may date from this time. (iv) Middle Helladic III (fig. 14.4) The MH III remains were better preserved than those of MH II; indeed, layers of this date were probably reached in c. 90% of the total area excavated. The earlier phase of MH III pottery was first identified by Rutter, who deemed it MH II Late, contemporary with a later phase of MM ΠΙΑ.362 Zerner has now shown that this pottery is MH III Early,363 and that a later phase of MH III is stratified in Areas Lambda and Nu.364 On the sw slope, Area Nu/Gamma 1 exhibited three architectural phases (fig. 14.4). At the end of MH II or beginning of MH III (MH II/III Early), a broad n-s road was laid, Street Nu I, with a retaining-wall on its Ε flank. To the Ε walls ng and nx enclosed a room or yard which remained in use until MH III Late.365 Within MH III Early two irregular walls, dd and nu, were built over the road; perhaps they demarcated the w boundary of the property. Two goblets and an amphora survived on a MH III Early floor nearby.366 The walls went out of use at the end of this phase, when the gravel surface of the road, now called the 'Upper Pebbled Road' or Street Nu I, was renewed. In the Ν it had a drain made of tiles of Minoan type. A rare Minoan seated ithyphallic figurine, dated to MM III, was found in its make-up. A MH III Late floor to the Ε had on it a jar and a dipper, with crucibles and residues that prove that bronze was worked.367 Just to the ε there stood a rectangular house, Structure Lambda I, on a nnw-sse axis; it goes back to at least MH III Early. Four MH II or MH III Early (i.e. MH II/III Early?) cups and jars lay on its lowest excavated floor when it was destroyed by fire. The building was refurbished and a new floor was laid, on which were found two MH III Late-MH III/LH I drinking vessels and a pithos. The presence of a drill-core suggests that greenstone axes were manufactured here.368 This house continued in use until LH IIA. Lower down the slope, in Area Lambda/Beta 12, Floor 25 was datable to MH III Early, and a MH III Early stratum yielded a jar, a bowl and a crucible. Over this a set of nine rectangular rooms on a similar axis, Structure Lambda II, was built, probably during MH III Late, 356 It includes items 1154, 1164, 1168, 1180-1182, 1187- 1190, 1288-1315, 1343-1346, 1349-1350, 1365, 1381, 1386, 1395, 1406-1407, 1836, 1840, 1871, 1879, 1888, 1909-1911, i9*7&gt; !924&gt; Í931' X938&gt; *944&gt; !95°&gt; X952, i96«, 1969-1970, *975&gt; *979&gt; 1989~1991' 1996~1999&gt; 2273 and Rutter Deposits Α-B (Rutter Period I). 357 Chapter 5 §2 (ii) above. 3)8 Coldstream and Huxley 1972, 97, 277-8, Delta no. 45. 359 Sakellarakis 1996. 360 Broodbank 1999, 212-13. 3bl McDonald, Dickinson and Howell 1992, 760; for the MH II material see Howell 1992^, whose system of classification is very different from that used here. 362 Rutter and Rutter 1076, 32, Period II. 31)3 The MH III Early pottery includes items 1347-1348, i351"1364, iS^^S80» *382-i385&gt; i387"1394, ^Φ~^^^ 1408-1414, 1479-1481, 1483, 1485-1512, 1908, 1912-1916, 1918-1923, 1925-1930, 1932-1937, i939-!943&gt; 1945"1949&gt; 1951&gt; 1953~1961. i963~1968. 1971~1974&gt; i976~19785 i98o~ 1988, 1990a, 1992-1995, 2000, 2007, 2016, 2025, 2041, 2089, 2108, 2111-2112, 2116, 2124-2125, 2133, 2163, 2165-2166, 2175, 2186, 2194-2195, 2197, 2199, 2280, 3627 and Rutter Deposits C-D.

JANKO since a floor associated with its walls, Floor 22, was found, on which lay the jars 2288 and HS 32. 369 This building too was used until LH 1 1 A. On the south-central slope a house on a similar axis, Structure Beta III, was probably built in MH III Early and certainly went out of use during that phase; a walled alley, Street Beta III, ran past it, and presumably met up somehow with the old Street Beta II.370 In Area Epsilon on the se slope burial 1, laid on coloured pebbles, was MH III Late.371 Nearer the summit in Area Eta, one wall was probably MH III.372 In the ν half of the plateau the situation is obscure, since Structure Alpha V may be MH II or MH III,373 but by the LBA that sector was apparently abandoned. The copious MH III pottery continues that of MH II. The replacement of Dull Painted ware by Matt Painted ware, at first in its gritty variety, defines the start of MH III. This ware appears much later than it does further north; Matt Painted is still unknown elsewhere in Laconia.374 During MH III Lustrous Decorated ware gradually changes from a mainly light-on-dark style to a dark-on-light style. In MH III Late this ware also adopted stripes or bars imitative of Minoan ripple-pattern, and red or purple on a light ground with borders of dark bands. Micaceous Minoan ware begins in MH III Early but only becomes common during MH III Late, when Yellow Minyan is introduced. Aeginetan pottery first arrives in MH III/LH I and only becomes common in LH I.375 The presence of light-on-dark sherds at Ayios Nikolaos and Gangania east of Apidia376 and of Micaceous Minoan at Pavlopetri377 can now be understood to show that these sites were occupied in MH III. MH III Early corresponds to MM IIIA on Crete and at Kastri to Deposit Delta (upper layers). MH III Late is coeval with Cretan MM IIIB, at Kastri with material in Deposits Epsilon (MM IIIB and the earliest LM IA) and Zeta (MM IIIB-LM IA), and at Mycenae with the main phase of Grave Circle Β (chart 14.1).378 During MH III the local Dark Burnished ware borrows several shapes from MM III-LM IA stone vases. Since these shapes, and not others current in Crete, appear in serpentine on Kythera, the borrowing took place via Kytheran intermediaries, perhaps Kytheran potters resident at Ayios Stephanos.379 Two terracotta human figurines of MM III type, apparently imported, were found, which explains the influence of Minoan types in the southern Péloponnèse that is also visible at Nichoria.380 There, however, the MH III pottery, of which two phases are recognised, seems less under Minoan influence than it had been during MH II.381 Eight burials are definitely MH III and confirm that the site prospered, although nothing resembles the wealth of Grave Circle Β at Mycenae or of contemporary Crete. A cist grave, Delta burial 7, contained two MM IIB-IIIA vases.382 (v) Middle Helladic III/Late Helladic I and Late Helladic I (fig. 14.5) The transition from MH to LH, here divided into MH III/LH I and LH I, displays the same continuity of material culture and ceramic production which prevailed throughout the MBA, save that the first equids appear by LH IIA (fig. 12.7). Since the MH III/LH I architecture and stratigraphy are distinct from those of LH I in the sw part of the site, MH III/LH I has been designated a separate period. However, I shall discuss both phases together, for three reasons. First, the MH III/LH I lustrous painted pottery is the earliest Mycenaean ware, and its evolution from Lustrous Decorated clarifies the transition to Mycenaean more clearly than at any other known site, as was hoped when the excavations were renewed;383 all the stages of its evolution are present, whereas at Lerna Mycenaean pottery arrives fully developed.384 Secondly, MH III/LH I and LH I were coeval with Grave Circle A at Mycenae385 and with the richest epoch of Minoan Crete. Both eras precede the true turning-point of the Bronze Age, namely the collapse at the end of LM IB of Minoan civilisation in Crete and the Aegean. Finally, the Mycenean ware of LH I date is published in Chapter 6 above, but the MH wares used at the same time are mostly published in Chapter 5. 369 See Chapter ι §5 (v)-(vi) above; Taylour 1972, 234, pls. 45c, 45d (where it wrongly associated with a burial). 370 Chapter 1 §4 (iv) above. 371 Chapter 1 §1 (v) above. 372 Chapter 1 §3 (iii) above. 373 See §« (iii) above. 374 Cavanagh and Crouwel 1996Ã, 26.

By LH I the settlement had retreated to the s half of the site, although LH I pottery was found in Trial Trenches to the Ν and Ε (fig. 14.5). Areas Alpha and Delta on the plateau seem to have been used only for burials.389 The apparent shrinkage of the settlement is surprising. Perhaps the remains of this period have eroded away on the hilltop, which might explain the fills containing worn Early Mycenaean sherds on the sw slope in the Lambda trenches. But if the deltaic fill was approaching from the north-east, causing the bay to the north to silt up, sites on the other side of the Gulf would have gained a competitive advantage,390 even if an increase in malaria was not a factor,391 and the settlement would have declined. On the se slope, sherds were found in Areas Epsilon,392 Zêta and Eta393 and in Trial Trench IV (fig. 14.5). On the s slope, a set of double walls were built within MH III Late to LH I in order to increase the size of the terrace by holding back the soil to the ne. This terrace now became a courtyard some 5.5 x 5.5 m in extent. At first it had a stone floor; in LH I it was surfaced with yellow clay and schist slabs, with a hearth in the sw corner.394 It was used for several infant burials. On the sw slope Structure Lambda II continued in use until LH ILA. Its sw part was remodelled after a fire by the addition of two walls, enclosing Room 10; this may have had a floor with a LH I jar and bowl. Two other LH I vessels were found nearby, possibly in the same context as Linear A inscription 6154.395 In Area Nu,396 Structure Nu II was built on a N-s alignment against a long and massive wall, wall nf, that now formed the w boundary of the property, separating it from Street Nu I. At Pavlopetri too houses were built against the much longer walls that delimit the streets (fig. 14.4). Structure Nu II had two rooms, with its entrance to the s. The larger room to the s had a stone bench, hearth and earthen floor, on which lay several pots. This room gave onto a smaller one to the N. The house collapsed in LH I Early, with no sign of burning. Its ruin could have been caused by an earthquake, possibly the same as that which shook Thera at the start of LC I397 and that at Trianda on Rhodes during LM IA some time before the Theran eruption.398 Its s wall was cut by the LH I/IIA Shaft Grave burial Nu 13. Just to the E, Structure Lambda I continued in use. In MH III/LH I Floor 9 was replaced by Floor 8, on which lay a LH I Early vase. Floor 8 in the ν room was renewed in LH I Early, with the addition of a step in the threshold between the two rooms.399 MH III/LH I pottery is very plentiful.400 The range of wares, forms and shapes, both locally made and imported, now came to resemble that of the central area of the mainland. There were two new wares, Fine Yellow Minyan and Fine Matt Painted Bichrome. Lustrous Decorated ware was now first produced in styles that resemble those of LM IA; Zerner remarks that it may be called the very earliest LH I (chart 14. i).401 In Cretan terms, MH III/LH I corresponds to LM IA Early and the upper layers of Deposit Zeta at Kastri (MM IIIB-LM IA). Zerner recognises two phases of LH I pottery at the site, LH I Early and LH I/IIA.402 LH I Early material is very common,403 and includes the only stratified deposits of LH I in Laconia. LH I began after the start of LM IA: it corresponds on Crete to LM IA Late and at Kastri to Deposits Zeta (upper layers), Eta and Theta. 386 Banou 1996, 120. 387 Mountjoy 1999, 1 243. 388 Rutter 19930,787. 389 Unless Structure Delta V was of this date rather than LH IIIC Early; see §4 (v) below. 390 J.

JANKO LH I/IIA pottery, which is effectively LH I Late or LH IIA Early, is equally common.404 LH I/IIA material was found in tombs at Epidaurus Limera.405 LH I/IIA corresponds in Crete to LM IA Late-LM IB Early and on Kythera to Deposits Iota, Kappa and Lambda. Of two radiocarbon dates deriving from LH I/IIA strata, one is extremely low (1450 ±150) but based on a sample of reliable size; this result is more compatible with the low than with the high chronology of the Santorini eruption, which according to the low chronology occurred early in the Eighteenth Dynasty in Egypt in c. 1550-1525 bc.406 The most important novelty of LH I is the lustrous painted fabric known as Mycenean ware. The gaps in the assemblage may be caused by the lack of material from tombs.407 Its quality and style resemble those at sites in the north-eastern Péloponnèse like Korakou, Lerna and Asine.408 In this period the sole criterion for distinguishing Lustrous Decorated from decorated Mycenaean pottery is the unburnished treatment of the surface, which results in the paint being dull;409 Fine Yellow Minyan is practically indistinguishable from unpainted Mycenaean.410 Yellow Minyan vessels may now have minute pellets applied to the rims in imitation of metal rivets, and Matt Painted is decorated in light ground and bichrome. Fine Matt Painted ware first appears in LH I Early. Chemical analysis proves that this ware was imported, that pottery of the Minoan Schist Group came from Kydonia (Khania),411 and that LH I-IIA Mycenaean ware was reaching the site from the Argolid.412 The Cretan and Minoanising assemblage sheds light on the origins of Mycenaean ware. Some features of LH I Mycenaean ware, notably the small closed shapes, cannot derive directly from Cretan LM IA.413 Ayios Stephanos has both LM IA imports from Crete and motifs shared with Kythera;414 LM IA patterns, notably the foliate band and ripple-pattern, now appear on Fine Lustrous Decorated. Since the earliest LH I pottery of the southern Péloponnèse antedates that of the Argolid,415 it was proposed that Mycenaean ware arose in either Messenia416 or Laconia.417 Clay analysis indicated that the 'Minoanising' wares found at Ayios Stephanos had a local south Laconian origin.418 Both petrological and chemical analyses now suggest that Lustrous Decorated ware was made on Kythera, whence it was exported to both Ayios Stephanos and Lerna.419 That Mycenaean ware originated in southern Laconia is plausible for two reasons: the similarities between LH I Mycenaean ware and Kytheran LM IA,420 and the relative rarity of Lustrous Decorated in the Argolid. It breaches Occam's razor to suggest that there was a separate workshop in Lerna, founded from one in southern Laconia.421 As Mountjoy observes, in historical times pottery was traded along the coasts of the mainland on a grand scale; this would have been equally true in the Bronze Age.422 At least eight graves, including two or more adults, are MH III/LH I in date. Despite the proximity of Crete, Helladic funerary traditions continue: pits, cists and stone surrounds were still used. A little of the great wealth of the time reached the site. The richest grave of any phase, Alpha 23, dates from MH III Late-MH III/LH I. Its occupant had carnelian beads and the pyxis 2222, which imitates MM III-LM IA stone vases.423 The adult burial Delta 7 was of the same date.424 The wealthiest LH I grave was Delta 4, a man buried with a cup and a bronze knife. The cist grave evolved in one case into a Shaft Grave with massive cover-slabs. This LH I/IIA grave, Nu 13, contained the body of a woman without grave goods. A rectangle of stones with a square platform for offerings marked the top of the shaft. This tomb resembles the slab-covered shaft grave used in LH II-IIIB at Krokeai and another, covered by six schist slabs, at the Menelaion.425 404 LH I/IIA pottery includes items 1519, 1529, 1550-1551, 1553, 1570, 1608, 1611, 1613-1614, 16557, 1645-1649, 1661, 1677, 1687, 1701, 1709, 1730, 1735-1736, 1759, 1767, 1769, 1773, 1804, 1808, 1812, 1815, 1819, 1824, 2045, 2064, 2066, 2081-2082, 2085- 2086, 2093, 2101, 2118, 2131-2132,3382-3390, 3394, 3398» 34OO&gt; 34O3-34O4. 3406-3409, 3433-3434» 3437~3438' 3444» 3449» 3452-3454, 3457, 3459-3460, 3466, 3522, 3638~3643&gt; Rutter Deposit N, and some of 3222, 3234-3244, 3649-3662 and R973- 1012.

Probable Minoan trade routes in the Aegean, showing mines (fl), sites (·) and finds of Linear A outside Crete (a). (vi) Lapis Lacedaemonius, Linear A and Other Cretan Connections The wide variety of ways in which the material culture of Ayios Stephanos interacted with that of Minoan Crete from MH I onwards raises important questions. What forms did this interaction take? Did it intensify over time? Was it mediated or direct, gradual or sudden? Did each side influence the other, or did influence flow largely in one direction? What motivated these contacts, and what advantages did they offer both sides? Were Minoans living at the site, and, if so, on what basis? Who controlled the site in political, military and economic terms? Before trying to answer such questions as best the evidence permits, I shall review six fields of material culture which attest these contacts and the routes along which they took place (fig. 14.6). They comprise architecture, pottery, stone-working, writing, religious expression and burial-customs. (a) ARCHITECTURE Ayios Stephanos has no overtly Minoan architecture. There are no painted floors or wall-paintings like those at Phylakopi on Melos, Akrotiri on Thera, Trianda on Rhodes or Ayia Irini on Kea. There is no ashlar construction with Minoan-style mason's marks, such as are known at Mycenae, Kolonna</page><page sequence="607">580 R. JANKO on Aegina, or Pylos and Peristeria in Messenia.426 There are no polythyra (pier-and-door partitions), 'pillar-crypts', adyta ('lustral basins'), lavatories, light- wells, baths with cement floors, horns of consecration or blocks of gypsum; there are only Minoan-style drain-tiles427 which are paralleled at Mallia,428 Phaistos,429 Phylakopi430 and LM IB Kastri.431 However, the plan of the settlement suggests Minoan influence. The apsidal dwellings of MH I were replaced by rectangular houses in blocks on the Cretan or Cycladic model, yielding a layout like that of Pavlopetri (fig. 14.4). As Hope Simpson remarked, the plan of Pavlopetri 'most resembles that of Aegean towns such as Phylakopi, rather than of any Mycenaean settlement hitherto excavated, although there is a superficial resemblance between the "streets" and one found at Nichoria'.432 But one must doubt whether the town was as well-planned as Gournia or Palaikastro on Crete, or even Akrotiri and Ayia Irini in the Cyclades.433 (b) pottery Minoan styles of pottery and imports were present at the site from the start of the MBA. The Minoans' north-west trading network goes back to MM IA, antedating their trade routes to the north and north- east.434 The antiquity of these contacts is not surprising, since Minoan settlers colonised Kythera as early as EM II. Zerner suggests that local potters adapted Dull Painted ware from EM II styles mediated via Kythera.435 Unlike Dull Painted ware, which fell out of fashion at the end of MH II, Lustrous Decorated ware remained in touch with the styles of the Cretan mainland. This pottery was already being shipped to coastal sites in the Argolid (although not to inland sites like Tsoungiza or Zygouries) from the start of the MBA, and reached inland Laconian sites like Geraki;436 by LH I it was well known at the Menelaion too.437 Ayios Stephanos must have participated in its distribution to the interior. Aeginetan pottery, by contrast, first reached Ayios Stephanos in MH III/LH I, far later than the Argolid and in much smaller quantities.438 Ayios Stephanos was the westernmost place, apart from Asea in Arcadia, to receive this pottery. It must have been shipped round Cape Malea via Pavlopetri (it has not yet been identified on Kythera). In this case, Ayios Stephanos was at the end of a trade route rather than close to its origin. Cycladic pottery remained absent throughout. The amount of Minoan pottery at Ayios Stephanos grew steadily in the MBA. On Rutter's statistics, in MH II the Lustrous Decorated wares constituted 27-33% of all painted or Dark Burnished sherds. In MH III Early the proportion rose to 52-55%, including Micaceous Minoan; in MH III/LH I it reached 52-66%.439 Thus for much of the MBA over half of the fine pottery used at the site was Minoan in origin or style; similarly, of only 40 sherds published from Pavlopetri, as many as four are LM imports.440 Minoan pottery is known elsewhere on the gulf at Paizoulia, Vardies near Mavrovouni and Kastelli near Daimonia;441 it also reached the interior.442 Such pottery became so popular that LH I Mycenaean ware evolved in the southern Péloponnèse out of Lustrous Decorated ware, as was argued above.443 The sheer amount of pottery imported to a site can, however, be an unreliable guide to what was happening there. The presence of household objects can reveal the presence of resident and socially equal or superior foreigners,444 whereas artefacts of other kinds may not. To draw a modern analogy, a briki is more significant as a mark of Levantine or a tea-pot of English culture than are other kitchen items, since such pieces play special roles in particular social rituals. Thus the finding of large numbers of conical cups is a reliable index of the presence of Minoans at sites like Kastri, Akrotiri, Trianda, Ialysos, Iasos or Miletus.445 The use of Minoan drinking and pouring vessels in Kythera and the Cyclades is a clear sign of the adoption of Minoan ideology.446 At Ayios Stephanos, however, the commonest domestic shapes of Kytheran MM IIIB - lamps, braziers and above all conical cups - are absent or, in the last case, rare.447 At Pavlopetri many tripod or cooking pot legs in Micaceous Minoan ware were found.448 Such legs are common in Crete from EM II onwards. However, they are extremely rare on the mainland before the LBA; in accord with this, the earliest specimen at Ayios Stephanos, 1519, is LH I/LH ILA.

Barber has proposed that flat looms with concave whorls or field-stones as weights were used until warp-weighted looms with terracotta weights were introduced from Crete.452 The use of such humble objects would have been owed to Minoan residents.453 However, only one discoid weight, 6058, was found at Ayios Stephanos. This type, known in Crete from EM II onwards, is common in MM contexts, as at Kastri in LM ΙΑ-B (Deposit Kappa). (c) STONE In addition to pottery, stone was another object of trade. The MM II- III cushion-shaped seal HS 249, which has two sets of cylindrical circles and striations in the angles,454 is a sign of Minoan influence. Minoan seals of similar date are known from MBA levels at Miletus and on Aegina, Karpathos, Kea, Kythera, Melos, Naxos, Rhodes and Thera, but not elsewhere on the mainland.455 Another such sign is the cup-base HS 273,456 found in a mainly MH context and presumably of serpentine. The rim of another stone bowl was found at Asteri-Karaousi,457 and local potters used Dark Burnished ware to imitate MM III-LM IA serpentine vases.458 Ayios Stephanos lies just 6 km south-east of the only outcrops of lapis lacedaemonius in the world save in Labrador. This stone occurs only as relatively small blocks, which in Roman times were simply dug out like pebbles;459 they would have been equally easy for Bronze Age quarrymen to extract.460 Many pieces have been found at the site. Waterhouse and Hope Simpson recorded ten lumps on the surface, three of which were pounders. They noted more at Lekas Panayiotis and Lekas (South), equally close to the sources of this stone; other pieces were carried to Kranae near Gytheion, to Apidia, and to Kosmas between Geraki and Leonidhi.461 However, the stone is very hard (6.0-6.5 on Mohs' scale) and has a tendency to fracture; the Romans deemed it difficult to work.462 Apparently it did not reach Crete until the Neopalatial period. It was not used at Ayios Stephanos for stone tools before LH I-IIA, and then rarely.463 No carved piece of it is known from the site, since the seal HS 249 is made not of lapis lacedaemonius but of olive-green 'steatite'.465 The earliest evidence for the export of lapis lacedaemonius comes from Crete, where it was worked in the Lapidary's Workshop at Knossos, at the Knossian harbour town of Trypeti and possibly at other palatial centres: for a list of worked and datable pieces of it see chart 14.2. It was rare, since only 0.14% of Minoan stone vases are made of it.466 It was sawn into lumps and blocks and carved into seals, vases, votive ladles and decorative spheres, but was not used for inlaying tables, walls or floors. The earliest seals are MM ΠΙ/LM IA;467 vases, votive ladles and spheres are known by LM IB. Seals were also produced during LM II-IIIA1.468 The industry continued at Knossos until the palace was destroyed in LM IIIA2 Early.469 The absence of finished products in lapis lacedaemonius at Ayios Stephanos has led to the suggestion they were all were exported.470 But the site was not home to lapidaries so skilled that they could carve this stone. No sawn pieces of it have been found, nor any stone wedges with drill-marks,471 and fragments of it constitute only 0.1% of all the flaked stone recovered (table A6.1), while the drill-cores are of gabbro and derive from the manufacture of axes.472 Since Ayios Stephanos was merely a depot for the export of raw stone of luxury quality, this cannot have earned its inhabitants much profit.473 449 Demakopoulou 1992. 450 Rutter and Rutter iQ76, 65. 451 Harding et al. iq6q, 138, small find no. 2 with pl. 33k. 452 Barber 1991, 308, cf. 2ηι. 453 So Rutter and Zerner 1084, 77-8. 454 Taylour 1972, 236, pls. 42h. 5, 42J; CMSV Suppl. ιΒ no. 346: for the motif see Younger iqq^, fig. 33. 455 Krzyszkowska 200F., 117-18, sor. 456 Taylour 1972, 243 (where dated ΈΗ?'). 457 Waterhouse and Hope Simpson 1060, qi n. 118. 458 Rutter iq7q. 459 Pausanias in 21.4. 460 Dworakowska 1975, 125; Warren 1992, 285-7. 461 Waterhouse and Hope Simpson i960, 106-7 n· X77' !96l&gt; 135- 462 Pausanias πι 2 1 .4. 463 See chart 14.2. 464 Pace Taylour iq72, 236. 465 So CMSV Suppl. ιΒ no. 346. 466 'Yarren !q6q 132-3, 145; iqq2. 467 Krzyszkowska 2005, 123 n. 20. 468 Warren iqq2, 287 with n. 12. 469 See §4 (iii) below. 470 Taylour 1972, 262. 471 Cf.

Except for a vase from Shaft Grave IV at Mycenae477 and the masons' marks mentioned above,478 Ayios Stephanos is the only place on the Greek mainland to have yielded an inscription certainly in written in the Cretan Linear A script (6154, = HS Zg 1). This is a stone tab with two signs, transcribed α-ma. It may well derive from MH III/LH I-LH I levels, i.e. MM IIIB-LM IA; this accords with the advanced forms of the signs, and coincides with the time of the script's greatest diffusion. Linear A inscriptions are widely found in areas under Minoan hegemony (fig. 14.6). They fall into two classes, inscriptions on clay and those on other types of object. Clay tablets, roundels and nodules with seal impressions are the only sure proofs of a Minoan administrative system; fragments have been found in MM III or LM IA contexts at Phylakopi, Akrotiri, Ayia Irini and Miletus.479 Roundels and nodules have even been found in a MM II/IIIA context at Mikro Vouni on Samothrace in the north-east Aegean, along with evidence of metal- working.480 These finds show that Linear A was used for administration along the Minoans' northern and eastern trade routes; its use implies participation in their economic system, if not Cretan military or political control. Cretan writing was diffused along the Minoans' western trade route also, beginning fairly early in the MBA, since a three-sided seal in the British Museum inscribed in Cretan Hieroglyphic script is said to be from Kythera; the earliest such seals date from MM IIB.481 Linear A is known on Kythera too. A stone ladle of central Cretan type (KY Za 2), inscribed with the signs da-ma-te, was found at the peak sanctuary at Agios Georgios;482 established no later than MM II, this shrine continued in use until at least LM IB.483 Moreover Deposit Epsilon at Kastri (MM Ill-earliest LM IA), which is roughly contemporary with the ladle, contained a broken terracotta weight (KY Zg 1) inscribed with what is probably the ideogram for 'grain'.484 This inscription on clay confirms that the Minoan language was used on the island for administrative as well as religious purposes. However, nothing proves that this was true of Ayios Stephanos. Since inscriptions on other types of artefact, like the inscribed sherds from Naxos485 and the Aeolian islands,486 could travel with the objects themselves, these lack the same probative value. The stone tab 6154 belongs to the latter category; perhaps it served as some sort of token. (e) RELIGION Religion is another cultural indicator, but does not take us far. Almost nothing is known of the religion practised at the site, save perhaps for the presence of two Minoan male figurines of terracotta, both probably MM III (7092-7093); none in bronze has been found.487 Such figurines often represent worshippers. This void is typical of MH Greece. The earliest religious site known on the mainland is the sanctuary near Epidaurus in the Argolid which later belonged to Apollo Maleatas. The finds, dating from LH I- II, resemble those from Minoan cult places,488 including many conical cups.489 The god's title indicates that his cult came from the region of Cape Malea, following the eastern branch of the Minoan trade route via Kythera, where a similar peak sanctuary existed near Kastri. I suggest that both the title 'Maleatas' and the cult go back to the Bronze Age. Mycenaean connections between Cape Malea and the Argolid are implied by the story that Thyestes and Aegisthus lived there,490 which suggests that south-eastern Laconia once formed a principality separate from the Vale of Sparta.491 We may compare the tradition that Apollo's cult at Delphi was founded by some Cretans who were sailing from 'Minoan Knossos' past Cape Malea to Pylos, when the god commandeered their ship and 474 Morris 1982. 475 Sakellarakis 1996, 84, 90 with pls. 2AC-a. 476 Warren 1969, 126. 4/7 Grumach 1962. 478 See §3 (vi) (a). 479 Palaima 1082; Rehak and Younger iqq8, 137 n. %%%. 480 J.

JANKO led them to Krisa.492 This tradition depicts the foundation of a shrine on a Minoan trade route; a fragment of a Minoan lion's head rhyton was found under the temple of Apollo at Delphi.493 Both sanctuaries are on slopes rather than peaks. Peak sanctuaries of Minoan type can be posited at Troullos near Ayia Irini, at Trianda on Rhodes, at Mikri Vigla on Naxos,494 at Thera and on Kalymnos.495 However, none is as yet known near Ayios Stephanos. (f) BURIAL CUSTOMS Ayios Stephanos retained its Helladic burial customs, with pithos burials, cist graves and a shaft grave.496 It has no pithos burials for adults or cave chamber tombs.497 The use of cists within the settlement is also known at Pavlopetri.498 By contrast, the Minoans used rock-cut tombs with several chambers, as in the MM II-LM IB cemetery at Poros near Knossos.499 No such tombs are known at Ayios Stephanos, although it is conceivable that tombs could have been cut into the low limestone outcrop to the south- west of the site, where LH III sherds were found on the terrace below.500 Small, round rock-cut tombs are known on Kythera, e.g. tombs B, F and G;501 some were certainly used in MM III-LM IA, when a number of larger multi-chambered tombs were also hewn from the rock. Such a tomb at Palaiopolis contained MM IIIB-LM I pottery;502 there are others with LM I pottery at Tholos.503 Similar rock-cut tombs, sometimes with short dromoi and/or several chambers, appear on the Maleatic peninsula. At Pavlopetri about sixty small round tombs, some with stepped dromoi, are cut into a limestone outcrop above the settlement.504 In form they resemble smaller Kytheran examples like tombs B, F and G. No finds from them are known, but they may well be MBA rather than EBA.505 Chamber tombs 1 and 2 are believed to be Mycenaean, as they have only one chamber, but the dromos of tomb 1 is stepped and that of tomb 2 is only 2 m long.506 More chamber tombs, some with stepped dromoi, were found at Ayios Yeoryios, c. 2.5 km inland from Pavlopetri;507 the site has yielded EH II, MH III, LH IIIA2 and LH IIIC sherds.508 On the other side of Cape Malea, at Epidaurus Limera near Monemvasia (fig. i), three groups of chamber tombs are more Minoan than Mycenaean in plan; some have stepped dromoi and a second chamber.509 The earliest pottery recognised in them was 'LM IA or very early LH I, apparently of a local type independent of the Argolid'.510 Tombs of this type continued in use until at least LH IIIC Middle. Minoan influence of this kind has not been observed at Ayios Stephanos. (vii) Laconian Metals and the Minoan Thalassocracy (fig. 14.6) Our survey of the evidence above shows that Ayios Stephanos was not a heavily Minoanised settlement like Kastri, Akrotiri, Phylakopi or Ayia Irini. However, the site was closely linked with the Minoans' trade route via Kythera and Pavlopetri. During the MBA this route was a conduit for trade that was very far-flung indeed. (a) KYTHERA AND MINOAN TRADE The role of Kythera in Minoan trade is shown by an extraordinary discovery made there, a cuneiform inscription now lost (fig. 14.7). Its first publication by J. Calucci511 runs as follows: Lately at Paleopolis was exhumed a small rectangular piece of hard white stone, one inch in length and ten lines thick;512 its lower surface has deep cuttings in it so as to form five half- cylinders. On the upper surface, which is highly polished, is the inscription in five lines represented in the annexed drawing. Paleopolis was near Kastri; the term 'exhumed' need not imply that the inscription came from a tomb. It is in Akkadian, in the script of the Old Babylonian period; it has lost its right half. It is read and translated as follows:513 492 Homeric Hymn to Pythian Apollo 391-439. 493 Rehak and Younger iqq8, 115. 494 Sakellarakis iqq6, 02-6. 495 Rehak and Younger, 138 with n. 337. 496 See §3 (v) above. 497 Hägg 1984, 120. 498 Harding et al. 1969, 140. 499 Rehak and Youneer iqq8. 110. 500 Waterhouse and Hope Simpson 1060, 100. 501 Coldstream and Huxley 1972, figs. 66, 76-7. 502 Tomlinson 1996, 8. 503 Be van et al 2002. 504 Harding et al 1969, 127-32 with fig. 13 and pls. 24b, 25.

Since the stone had five half-cylinders drilled in its underside, it was perhaps the lid of a box for precious circular objects, probably cylinder seals;514 it was not an amulet.515 There were presumably three more holes in the part which was broken away; these were no doubt drilled in the pattern :·:[·:]. This box was not dedicated by the famous Narãm-Sín, grandson of Sargon of Akkad, because it names the king's father as Ipiq-Adad. Instead, the donor is Narãm-Sín king of Esnunna, i.e. Tell Asmar in Mesopotamia c. 80 km north-east of Baghdad. This ruler and his father are known from inscriptions found at Esnunna;516 the box was probably carved there. Like the bowl of Userkaf,517 it has a votive aspect;518 1 suspect that it was eventually dedicated at the peak sanctuary of Agios Georgios near Kastri. The chronology of Narãm-Sín is secure. He may briefly have held sway over Assyria. Upon his death it was conquered by Samsi-Adad I, who ruled it for 33 years and died in the 17th regnal year of Hammurabi of Babylon; according to the low Assyrian chronology, which best matches dendrochronological evidence from Kiiltepe and Acem Höyük in Anatolia, he ruled in 1744-1712 BC.519 Samsi-Adad I also took over Mari,520 which controlled the donkey-caravan route for trade in lapis lazuli and tin.521 This route ran from Drangiana (Afghanistan), Anshan (Elam) and Susa via Esnunna, Mari and Qatna to the sea. The royal correspondence of Zimri-Lim of Mari records that an interpreter ('dragoman' - our word derives from Akkadian) at Qatna specialised in trading with 'Caphtorites' (Kap-ta-ra-i), i.e. Cretans, one of whom wanted to obtain tin.522 In the opposite direction, Zimri-Lim sent Hammurabi a commodity, perhaps cloth, from Crete.523 An inscription of Naram-Sin's servant Mãr-Estar was found in the temple-treasure of Kourion on Cyprus.524 Thus Naram-Sin's votive was probably a gift from a distant ruler involved in the tin-trade, perhaps via Cyprus, which was vital to the Minoans' ability to make the bronze essential to their military and economic supremacy. The Assyrian merchants of Kanes (Kiiltepe) attest this trade; their tablets mention that 11,000 pounds of tin (annakum) was brought to Anatolia by Assyrian traders.525 The presence on Kythera of a Mesopotamian seal box recalls finds of imported cylinder seals, which occur sporadically in Aegean contexts from the MBA onwards, like that from Tholos Β at Plátanos in the Mesara,526 or the hoard of 38 Oriental cylinder seals, mainly Kassite and Cypriot, from LH IIIB Thebes.527 The box reached Kythera because the island was located on the essential trade route to Assyria, as we saw.

JANKO in the Aeolian islands beyond the Straits of Messina,528 and analysis has linked sherds from the islet of Vivara near Procida in the Bay of Naples with the southern Péloponnèse.529 It is at such distances that we should seek the economic impulses for Minoan trade. (b) THE ROLE OF AYIOS STEPHANOS IN MINOAN TRADE Thus a Minoan trade route of cardinal importance ran east-west only c. 50 km south of Ayios Stephanos (fig. 14.6). But did this route reach the site itself? How often, and how, would sailors have used its harbours? Indeed, was its main function the transfer of goods from ship to shore and vice versai Much depends on whether shipping struck out from Kythera or Pavlopetri due west across the Laconian gulf, or preferred to hug the coast. This choice could have varied according to the season, the winds, the seaworthiness of the vessel, and the skipper's confidence and experience. Ayios Stephanos would have been a useful port of call, especially in bad weather, but was also a trading destination in itself. Something must have been exchanged for the Minoan and Kytheran pottery found at the site and for the perishable contents that were brought in the closed vases. One possible type of payment would have been intangible, e.g. the right to engage in trade or use the harbour. But Ayios Stephanos was so poor that its inhabitants' naval or military prowess could not have exacted much from anyone. Nor was the payment exports of pottery. Throughout the MBA, Laconian ceramics are almost unknown in Kythera and Crete: Kastri has only tiny amounts in LM I A contexts of imported Matt Painted ware, LH I Mycenaean ware and Bichrome Matt-Painted.580 Hence any goods which the Minoans sought in Laconia, apart from raw stone, were perishable or reusable. They cannot have needed cloth, of which they made so much, and they could obtain agricultural or marine products closer to hand. However, they certainly needed metals which they could turn into finished goods. Crete is almost devoid of metallic ores, whereas Laconia is rich in them; the interior of Cape Malea contains substantial deposits of lead and copper ore near Molaoi and Sykea, and copper ores are mixed in with the lapis lacedaemonius close to Ayios Stephanos.531 The abundant copper and lead of south-eastern Laconia probably played a central role in the Minoan interest in this area.532 That these ores were used in antiquity has been doubted,533 but ore brought as ballast from Laconian sources may have been smelted in small amounts at Nichoria in the LBA.534 In the LBA the commonest lead- isotopic composition of copper-based artefacts in Greece and Crete matches that of the ores from Lavrion in Attica,535 but not all the sources of the Cretan oxhide-ingots have been identified.536 Metal- working over hearths is attested at Ayios Stephanos from MH I Early to LH IIIC Early, although there are no furnaces or slags to indicate smelting. Lapis lacedaemonius, on the other hand, was unimportant until MM ΠΙ/LM IA; perhaps it was even a by-product of the extraction of copper.537 (c) THE SIGNIFICANCE OF PAVLOPETRI Ayios Stephanos can by no stretch of the imagination be called a Minoan colony, and probably had few Minoan inhabitants.538 Yet archaeological evidence supports, in some sense, the tradition that Minos ruled the Cyclades, installing his sons as governors.539 As J. L. Davis noted, heavily Minoanised settlements existed on each of the Minoans' main trade routes.540 On their eastern trade route, they settled on Karpathos and Kasos, on Rhodes at Ialysos and Trianda, on Kos at Seraglio, and on the Anatolian mainland at Iasos and Miletus. In the central Cyclades they settled at Akrotiri. In the direction of the mines at Lavrion, there were heavily Minoanised settlements at Phylakopi and Ayia Irini. On their western trade route via Kythera they had long since founded Kastri. Davis also noted that there was a point along each route past which there were no such settlements. On the eastern trade route this point lay at Miletus or beyond, in the central Cyclades at Naxos and on their northern trade route at Kea.541 Where did this dividing-line lie along their western route via Kythera? In this context, the realities of ancient sailing are decisive. The route from Crete via Kythera led in two directions. The first was to the north-west, via Pavlopetri and then either due west towards Cape Taenarum or along the coast via Ayios Stephanos, a lengthier but safer voyage. The second was to the 528 Cavalier and Vagnetti 1986. 529 Re 1086, 16s. 530 Coldstream and Huxley 1972, 120, 123, 179 (Deposits Eta no. 73, Theta no. 25, Omega no. 19). 531 Kiskyras 1088, no, 122, 125, with §1 (iii) above. 532 Stos-Gale and Gale 1984, 61, 63 with fig. 5; Morris 1992, 101; Sakellarakis 1996, 90. 533 Cooke, Hendrickson and Rapp 1972. 534 Cooke and Nielsen 1978, 209-10. 535 Stos-Gale and Macdonald 1991. 536 Sayre, Yener and Toel iqq^. 537 So Banou 1996, 116; see §3 (vi) above. 538 See §3 (vi) above. 539 Thucydides, Hist. 1 4. 540 J.

The greatest risk faced by Cretan mariners was whether they could get a safe start on either route past the formidatum Maleae . . . caput.bA2 An ancient proverb, evidently taken from comedy, put it thus: Μαλέαν δέ κάμψας έπιλάθου των ο'ίκαδε, Once you pass Malea, forget about the folks at home'.543 The violent winds around the Cape, especially the prevailing north-eastern meltémi, made it very hard to pass in an ancient ship. Even in later times the squalls which often arise, even if the sea is calm elsewhere, meant that sailors often had to wait for days or weeks to round the Cape; Medieval voyagers preferred to wait at Melos because of the Monemvasiots' bad reputation.544 Hence I suggest that, on their western trade route, the Cretans' zone of control crossed Cape Malea, in the sense that they used a pair of heavily Minoanised ports on both sides of it to facilitate its passage, just as the Venetians used the twin ports Methoni and Koroni to control their trade route around Messenia. I believe that the Minoans' main ports were at Pavlopetri on the western side of the Cape and near Epidauros Limera to its east. Minoan pottery was found at Pavlopetri, while both sites have tombs of Minoan type.545 These two bays were of enormous economic and strategic value: each was once protected by a narrow isthmus with beaches on both sides which could serve as harbours. Pavlopetri was an important settlement, being at least 4.5 ha in size (fig. 14.3). In the Bronze Age it lay at the base of the Onugnathus peninsula,546 which had other sites at Elaphonisi village and Panayia.547 Roman writers note that Onugnathus was only 40 stades, i.e. 7.4 km, from the northern tip of Kythera, Cape Platanistous,548 now Spathi. From Kythera it is only 118 km to the Minoan city of Kydonia in western Crete; Antikythera is conveniently located half-way along, and will surely turn out to have traces of Bronze Age occupation. Although Onugnathus is now only c. 23 km from Cape Malea, Strabo computes the distance as 150 stades, i.e. 28 km; the Cape must have been more indented before sea- level rose. Onugnathus loomed large in his mind when he spoke of sailing from Cape Taenarum towards Onugnathus and Malea'.549 To judge by the three-fathom line, the neck of the peninsula where Pavlopetri lies was once c. 2 km wide. The local sandstone must already have formed fine beaches of soft, dazzingly white sand on either side, like those of today; these would have been perfect for beaching Bronze Age ships.550 The situation of Mochlos in Crete, formerly a promontory but now an island, is exactly similar. The location of Pavlopetri on the south-east side of this isthmus, facing Crete, protected it from the wind; here one could wait for better weather, which is why Onugnathus mattered so much to Strabo. Ships waiting to round Cape Malea would have used the whole of Vatika bay from Pavlopetri to the small headland of Palaeokastro opposite, with its harbour to the north (plate 60 a).551 Pavlopetri was well placed for trade in the other direction too. To sail round Onugnathus would have added at least 20 km to the journey; perhaps it was easier to beach one's ship, cross the isthmus on foot, mule or waggon, and then continue north. The locals could have profited handsomely from such a trade, just as the Trojans did by controlling the promontory between Besika Bay and the deep inlet that then almost reached their city.552 Pavlopetri's prosperity is shown by the discovery of a bronze figurine perhaps of Minoan type, with its right arm raised in worship;553 such figurines were a Minoan speciality.554 No fewer than 83 have been found at the uniquely rich peak sanctuary at Agios Georgios on Kythera; they were being cast from ingots nearby. Was some of the metal Laconian,555 shipped from Ayios Stephanos? Bronze can be rare at ports through which it was traded, as at Kommos.556 A unique find probably made at Pavlopetri may date to early in the MBA: a group of two stone stamp seals, a stone signet and four beads of greenish 'steatite' in the Ashmolean Museum (plate 60 b).557 The beads suggest that the objects formed a necklace. They are labelled 'seals of Hittite form found at Palaeokastro near Baia (Turkish Vatika), opposite the Isle of Elaphonisi or Cervi, Péloponnèse'. This means that they came from the eastern side of Vatika bay at Palaeokastro south of Neapolis, but this site was unoccupied in antiquity.558 One place on Vatika bay opposite Elaphonisi did have a major Bronze Age cemetery, namely Pavlopetri.559 The tombs were already visible in 1805: 542 Statius, Theb. π 33-4. 543 Strabo, Geog. vin 6.20; nobody has noticed that it scans as a comic trimeter.

JANKO The strait between Elafonisi and the main is three to four hundred yards over, and so narrow that none but the smallest boats can pass . . . The eastern end of the strait or western point of the Bay of Vátika, is a low point covered by sand. Here, near a ruined tower, are several ancient sepulchres hewn in the rock, and nearly filled with sand.560 I suggest that the seals were found in these tombs. Their form is unusual and they do not closely resemble seal shapes found in Anatolia; convincing Aegean parallels are also hard to muster.561 Two are of a hammer-headed type with squared base.562 The third is conical, rising to a large ring by which it may have been hung from a cord. The design of each seal is a number of dots, arranged in neat rows.563 There is scant evidence for seal use or manufacture on the Greek mainland in the between the end of EH II and the Shaft Grave era, while seals found in the Aegean islands during the MBA are invariably Cretan imports.564 We cannot exclude the possibility, however, that the Pavlopetri seals were local products, made under Minoan influence.565 (d) THE PORT OF MINOA The equivalent locale on the other side of Cape Malea was, I believe, Monemvasia (plate 60 c). Like Pavlopetri, Monemvasia was once a peninsula 'with only one entrance', as its name indicates; it was still a 'promontory' (άκρα) in the early 13th century.566 However, Cape Malea has sunk even since ad 1677.567 By 1829 Monemvasia was joined to the mainland only by a line of rocks level with the waves, with a poor harbour to the south of the mole.568 Roman writers record a peninsula immediately south of Epidauros Limera called 'Minoa';569 this was the ancient name for Monemvasia.570 Pausanias writes that 'by the town [i.e. Epidaurus Limera] a promontory called Minoa projects into the sea' (άκρα δε ες το πέλαγος κατά την πόλιν άνέχει καλούμενη Μίνωα). Frazer was surely right to emend άνέχει to αντέχει,571 so that the Periegete says 'a promontory projects opposite the town', since he goes on to note the beauty of the pebbles found on the long beach between Monemvasia and Epidaurus Limera.572 Strabo calls Minoa a fort (φρούριον),573 an apt description of what the Franks named the 'Gibraltar of the East'; Medieval building has presumably obscured any traces of earlier fortifications. Monemvasia once had harbours on both sides of its isthmus, later ruined by the change in sea-level. Ptolemy calls Minoa the first harbour (λιμήν) after Cape Malea.574 His terminology carefully distinguishes a harbour from an anchorage (έπίνειον) such as he records at Trinasos. Likewise Epidaurus Limera now has only an anchorage,575 but Ptolemy records the 'harbour of Zeus Soter',576 Pausanias mentions a temple of Zeus Soter 'by the harbour',577 and Apollodorus of Athens wrote that Epidaurus Limera was so named because it had a good harbour.578 In antiquity the harbours of Minoa and Epidaurus Limera would have been full of ships waiting to round Cape Malea. Pausanias gives the distance from the Cape to Epidaurus Limera as 300 stades,579 or 55 km (perhaps the coastline had many more ins and outs than at present, when the distance is c. 35 km). From this bay one can either turn east to Melos, which is roughly equidistant, c. 110 km, from Cape Malea and from Kydonia, or follow the coast north towards the Argolid. This coast has several harbours. The first is the sheltered fjord of Zarax, Ptolemy's Zarex; an acropolis dominates the harbour from the north, but with no sign of Bronze Age occupation.580 Beyond this, ships could put in at Kyparissi (Kyphanta), Leonidhi (Prasiae), where Mycenaean sherds are known, and Tyros before reaching Astros in Thyreatis, Lerna and the ports of the Argolid. But the real importance of Minoa and Epidarus Limera lay in the passage of Cape Malea. The presence of the name 'Minoa' is no accident, but indicates a Minoan port.581 Several places were called Minoa in antiquity (fig. 14.8): Paros,582 where Minos was said to have instituted a special sacrificial rite;583 towns on Amorgos and Siphnos;584 and two places in Crete, the harbour of Aptara in 560 Leake 1830, 1 509; Harding et al 1969, pls. 24b, 25a. 561 Ο.

Hood suggested that this lay at Epidaurus Limera,590 which dominates the overland route across the Maleatic peninsula. However, I find it more probable that the main port was by the then isthmus of Monemvasia, or under the Byzantine town on the south-eastern shore of the rock itself. Biegen is said to have found Mycenaean sherds near the old village.591 Further exploration is needed. (e) AYIOS STEPHANOS AND MINOAN HEGEMONY In conclusion, Ayios Stephanos was neither a Minoan colony like Kastri nor a heavily Minoanised settlement like Phylakopl. But it lay only just beyond the Minoanised port of Pavlopetri, which controlled navigation around Cape Malea, and it depended for its well-being on its ties with Kythera and Crete. The lack of serious destruction or abandonment at Ayios Stephanos shows that its inhabitants enjoyed peaceful relations with their Minoan neighbours. There is no proof that the site was walled at this time.592 But the Cretans had no need to establish political or military as well as economic domination over Ayios Stephanos or its region. Provided that there was no outbreak of piracy, they could have maintained control through networks of intermarriage and gift-exchange.593 Their representatives at the site, whether they were Cretans, Kytherans or local magnates, kept the crucial supply of metal flowing. When Minoan prosperity finally waned the effects at the site were palpable.594 4. DECLINE AND RESETTLEMENT: THE LATE BRONZE AGE (i) The Demise of Minoan Crete and its Impact (fig. 14.6) The fifth-century lyric poet Pindar recounts a tradition in which the Greeks preserved for over a thousand years the memory of a major historical event: λόγον ανακτος Εύξαντίου επαίνεσα [Κρητ]ών μαιομένων δς άνα[ίνετο] αύταρχειν, πολιών δ' εκατόν πεδέχει[ν] μέρος εβδομον Πασιφ[ά]ας &lt;σύν&gt; υί[οΤ]σν τέρας δ' έον εΐ- πέν σφι· 'τρέω τοι πόλεμον Διός Έννοσίδαν τε βαρ[ύ]κτυπον. χθόνα τοι ποτέ και στρατον άθρόον πέμψαν κεραυνω τριόδοντί τε ες τον βαθύν Τάρταρον έμαν ματέρα λιπόντες και όλον οίκον εύερκέα.595 I praise the words of King Euxantius, who refused to rule when the Cretans asked him, and to hold the seventh part of their hundred cities with Pasiphae's sons. He told them his portent: Ί tremble at war from Zeus and the rumbling Earthshaker. They once dispatched, with thunderbolt and trident, a land and army together down deep to Tartarus, leaving my mother and her whole house safe.' Euxantius, lord of Ceos, was in local legend the son of Minos by an island princess, Dexithea; he came to the island in fifty ships, sired a dynasty and sailed back to Crete, leaving half his men behind.596 This is myth; yet the excavations at Ayia Irini on Kea (in modern parlance) have revealed a Cycladic port under heavy Minoan influence, with wall-paintings and Linear A. For a millennium, the memory of these connections survived on the island, to be made known to us by the poets Bacchylides, who 585 Pliny, Hist.

JANKO was born there, and his Theban rival Pindar. To those who deny that such a tradition could endure for so long, I can only reply that it did. Its survival is all the more astonishing, because a survey of much of the island suggests that its population declined greatly during the intervening Dark Age.597 But there is more. What cataclysm does Euxantius cite to explain why he refuses to swap his humble island for a great realm in Crete? In the time of his father Minos, he says, Zeus and Poseidon destroyed a whole land and army, but left unscathed his mother's house on Ceos. Other sources, going back to the fifth-century historian Xenomedes of Ceos,598 say that the Telchines, metal- working Vizards' (their name is from θέλγει ν 'enchant'), had blighted the crops with their poisons, heedless of the gods, who then destroyed them, sparing only Dexithea and her sister Macelo.599 The Telchines' 'poisons' correspond to another fact about Bronze Age Ayia Irini: much of the working of the copper and silver from the mines at Lavrion took place there,600 which would have caused heavy industrial pollution (especially perhaps from arsenical bronze). A generation later, according to Pindar as cited above, Minos' sons vainly summoned Euxantius back to Crete, evidently in a time of trouble. In 1939 Marinatos boldly posited that the Santorini eruption, one of the most spectacular natural disasters in recorded human history, ended Minoan civilisation.601 His hypothesis is incorrect. First, study of the pottery shows that the volcano exploded no earlier than the middle of LM IA, i.e. in LH I Early, most probably during mature LM IA or even at the end of LM IA, and certainly before the start of LM IB;602 but the Minoan palaces were burned at the end of LM IB. The circular caldera largely existed long before Holocene times.603 Yet Marinatos' hypothesis led him to make his spectacular discoveries on Thera, which brought to light a Minoan Pompeii smothered under volcanic debris. The eruption was as violent as that of Tambora in 1816, the only other one as large in the last 10,000 years; its violence reached 6.9 or more on the Volcanic Explosivity Index.604 Geological studies have shown that debris from the eruption rained down-wind to the east and south-east, burying Rhodes in places to a depth of over 50 cm,605 whereas Ayia Irini 1 70 km to the north-west, itself exposed only to the north-west, was protected from the ash-fall. Pindar has surely preserved a genuine folk-memory of this catastrophe. Some aristocrats of Ceos, with whom he must have spoken before he composed his Paean for them, recalled that their island was spared its worst effects; lacking a scientific explanation, they blamed the disaster on the gods. According to tradition, Euxantius' family long endured, since his descendants included Acontius;606 this family would have preserved their ancestors' story. Did this calamity affect Ayios Stephanos, which lies 255 km west-north-west of the volcano, sheltered behind the lower spurs of Mt Parnon? Its physical impact would have been far less severe than in eastern and central Crete, which was only 120 km south of the volcano; western Crete and Kythera, which lay 210 km west-south-west of it, were protected from the ash-fall by the direction of the wind. The ash was blown east across the Aegean607 and has not been found west of Melos.608 Although pumice from the eruption reached Nichoria,609 Ayios Stephanos was protected from the tsunamis which carried it to the Levant.610 However, discussion of the eruption has tended to ignore its seismic effects, since these are hard to verify. Severe earthquakes certainly shook Crete during LM IA,611 and possibly Ayios Stephanos in LH I Early and LH I/IIA.612 In the MBA only eleven sites are known in this part of southern Laconia (fig. 13.1),613 but in the LBA there were nineteen (fig. 13.2). Extensive survey suggests a minimum of three Early Mycenaean sites and a maximum of 18, and in the Late Mycenaean period a minimum of nine and a maximum of 17. Occupation continued at all the sites inhabited in the previous period, i.e. Paizoulia, Ayios Stephanos, three locations at Lekas, Xeronisi, Kokkinada, Asteri-Karaousi, Dragatsoula, Ayios Strategos and Kokkinia. The Lagio site, Peristeri (East) and Vlachioti were reoccupied after being abandoned in the EBA. Places which appear to have been settled for the first time are Kranae near Gytheion, Krokeai, Ayios Ioannis, Peristeri (Solakos), a site near Kokkinada and another south of Vlachioti.614 The number of sites elsewhere in Laconia615 and the rest of Mycenaean Greece, Crete excepted, rose steadily throughout the LBA until the catastrophe at the end of LH IIIB. This expansion suggests an increase in population; it was greatest during LH IIIA-IIIB.616 597 Cherry et al. 1991, 466 with table 22.2. 598 FGrHAA2 F 4. 599 Rutherford 2001, 288-9; Hornblower 2004, 120-3. 600 Rehak and Younger 1998, 136-7. e&lt;)1 Marinatos îq^q. 602 Manning iqqq, 16-17 v^ith fig. 15. 603 Friedrich 1994. 604 Manning 1999, 268, 296. 605 Marketou 1990. 606 Callimachus, Aetia fr. 67.5. 607 Manning îqqq, 71 fig. 21. 608 Rehak and Younger iqq8, q8 with n. 21. 609 Rapp and Cook 10,73. 610 Rehak and Younger iqq8, qq. 611 Rehak and Younger iqq8, 100. 612 See §3 (v) above. *13 See §* (i). 614 Bintliff 1Q77Ö, 4^6-6ρ.; Banou iqq6, 17-iQ· 615 Banou 1996. 616 See §4 (iv) below.</page><page sequence="618">SUMMARY AND HISTORICAL CONCLUSIONS §4 591 Banou is probably right to classify Ayios Stephanos in the second of her four ranks in the settlement hierarchy of Bronze Age Laconia. She regards 13 sites, Pavlopetri included, as towns, 20, including Ayios Stephanos, as villages, 15 as hamlets and 1 1 as farms, for a total of 59.617 However, Ayios Stephanos did not share in the general rise in prosperity: the inhabited area, and presumably the population, shrank, reaching a nadir in LH IIIA2 to LH IIIB. The decline of Ayios Stephanos must be ascribed to environmental, political and economic factors, which may have been linked. First, if deltaic fill from the Eurotas was already creating marshes nearby,618 even if this process did not cause an increase in malaria, some of the site's harbour facilities may have silted up. Secondly, Ayios Stephanos depended on long-distance trade in pottery, stone and metals between Kythera and Crete to the south-east and Messenia and places further west.619 As we saw, if the site suffered damage from the Theran eruption, this was only from earthquakes. However, in a complex and interdependent system like that of the later MBA, no economy is wholly insulated from the rest; troubles in the southern Aegean would ultimately affect southern Laconia. After the eruption there would have been a period of confusion,620 especially if the catastrophe was seen in religious terms as a divine punishment, as Pindar's Euxantius seems to interpret it. The eruption of the island called Thera or Therasia certainly had religious repercussions;621 these may have included the worship of the goddess 'Therasia', who appears as qe-ra-si-ja among other deities in Linear Β tablets at Knossos.622 But once Akrotiri was destroyed, shipping between Crete and the mainland via Kythera could have increased.623 Such a shift would have benefited Ayios Stephanos, but if it happened it is invisible in the material record. However, an even worse disruption occurred at the end of LM IB, just after the end of LH ILA, when the administrative centres of Minoan Crete, Knossos excepted, were destroyed by fire, in what has been called 'a decisive rejection of the Neopalatial religio-political system'.624 This disaster struck western Crete also, since there were conflagrations at Kydonia and Nerokourou; indeed, in LM II Mycenaean-style 'warrior-graves' appear at Kydonia as well as at Knossos.625 The view that the spate of destructions was caused by war or insurrection, and that mainland Greeks took over thereafter, has yet to be disproved. It is suspicious that Knossos alone was not burned; its rulers could have invited Mycenaean Greeks into Crete.626 Tradition indicates that there was trouble on Crete a generation after the eruption; why else, according to Pindar, would the sons of Minos have offered to share Crete with the half- Greek prince Euxantius from the distant outpost of Ceos? In reply, he refuses a great but insecure fortune on Crete: έπειτα πλούτου πείρων μακάρων τ' έπιχώριον τεθμον π[ά]μπαν έρήμον άπωσάμενος μέγαν άλλοθι κλαρον εχω; λίαν μοι [δέο]ς εμπεδον εϊ- η κεν. εα, φρήν, κυπάρισ- σον, εα δε περιδάϊον νομόν. έμοι δ' ολίγον δέδοται θάμνου, ου πενθέων δ' ελαχον, &lt;ού&gt; στασίων. 'Then, if I aim at wealth and leave utterly forsaken my local ordinance from the blessed gods, am I to have a great estate elsewhere? My fear would be too great an obstacle. Let go, dear heart, the cypress, let go the contested pasture. My portion is a little dry brush; I got no share of grief nor civil strife.'627 Kastri was largely abandoned at the end of LM IB,628 although sherds attest some continuing occupation,629 and there are a few LM II and Mycenaean finds at the peak sanctuary of Agios Georgios.630 However, the Kythera Survey found only one settlement later than LM IB/LH IIA. Whatever reasons caused the fall of Minoan civilisation, the concomitant loss of many of the skills developed by Neopalatial artists and the depopulation or desertion of sites all over Kythera and Crete 617 Banou 1996, 100-2. 618 See §1 (ii) and §3 (v). b19 Cf. §§* vi-vii . 620 Driessen and Macdonald 100,7. 621 Rehak and Younger 1998, 101; Manning 1999, 146 with n. 711. 622 Hiller 1978 (tablets Fp 1, Fp ia). 623 Schofield 1982. 624 Rehak and Younger 1998, 164. 625 Rehak and Younger 1998, 152-3 with n. 430. 626 So Rehak and Younger iqq8, 148. 627 Pindar, Paean iv 50-4 (text of Rutherford 2001, my translation). 628 Coldstream and Huxley 1Q72, %±. 629 C. Broodbank, pers. comm.</page><page sequence="619">592 R. JANKO are sure signs of collapse. The downturn in trade which inevitably ensued must have damaged the economy of Ayios Stephanos. Indeed, some inhabitants could have moved to Crete, whether as soldiers, merchants or settlers, to take advantage of the fine agricultural land and stores of wealth suddenly available there. In any case, the site was to fare badly until the start of LH IIIC. (ii) Late Helladic IIA (fig. 14.8) As usual, the fortunes of Ayios Stephanos were more closely aligned with those of Crete than with those of its Laconian hinterland. The site did not share in the immense riches attested in the Vale of Sparta by the tholos tomb at Vapheio and by the monumental building at the Menelaion across the Eurotas to the north-east, both of which began in LH IIA. Unlike these sites and Pellana, Ayios Stephanos had no Palace Style vases.631 Moreover, the destruction and abandonment at the end of LM IB of all the Cretan administrative centres except Knossos, together with the virtual desertion of Kastri, must have disrupted the trade on which Ayios Stephanos relied.632 As the Minoan element retreated, the Mycenaeans may have developed regional hierarchical structures which favoured Asteri over Ayios Stephanos.633 There is much evidence for decline at the site from LH IIA onwards. The area within which sherds are found shrank from c. 26,500 m2 in MH I-LH I to c. 15,500 m2 during LH II-IIIA; LH II walls are limited to a zone of perhaps 730 m2 on the s and sw slopes of the hill. Several buildings on the sw slope fell into disuse. In LH IIA Early, the s room of Structure Lambda I received a new clay floor, dated by sherd 3457, but the house collapsed soon after, burying a LH I/IIA goblet on Floor 6 and other finds on Floor 7·634 Structure Lambda IV collapsed within LH IIA. Structure Lambda II went out of use early in LH IIA, when a floor was abandoned with a hydria and cup on it. The collapse of the sturdy N-s wall If occasioned the replacement of this complex with the two-roomed Structure Lambda III.635 In Area Nu three walls were built, but these went out of use within LH IIA.636 There were no signs of burning anywhere. I suggest that the sw slope, very steep even now, became subject to subsidence. This explains why only the landward walls of successive buildings survived while those facing the sea disappeared, only to be supplanted by new buildings soon after. The fact that the walls were by now standing on the ruins of so many earlier ones cannot have improved their stability. Landslips could have been caused by violent marine surges, torrential rains, earthquakes or varying combinations of such events. The collapse of several buildings in LH I Early and in LH I/IIA (= LH IIA Early) could well have been caused by successive earthquakes connected with the explosion of the Theran volcano. There was new building in Area Beta on the gentler s slope. In LH IIA the se terrace was cut away to create a forge with a bench, a hearth and a mud-plaster basin with a stone-built drain. A crucible shows that arsenical tin-bronze was worked. This installation was perfectly located to catch the landward breezes which would have greatly aided the smiths. It was buried in a thick layer of ash. The adjacent courtyard had a succession of floors before it was profoundly remodelled later in LH IIA or in LH IIB.637 Area Epsilon to the se yielded only sherds, and only burials are known in Areas Zeta and Eta.638 The rest of the plateau was empty. In LH IIA 75% of the pottery, which is plentiful,639 now consists of Mycenaean ware. The assemblage is domestic, with no sign of the palatial class of vessels;640 some of it was imported from the Argolid.641 The Minoanising wares found at the site are not seen inland or at Epidaurus Limera.642 The local Marine Style pottery was under strong Minoan influence, and the LH III whorl-shell motif entered the Mycenaean repertoire through this channel.643 The closed shapes, paralleled on Kythera and other islands, have some Minoan traits.644 Ayios Stephanos has also yielded a bell cup, 3665, 630 Sakellarakis 1996, 88. 631 Mountioy 1999, 1 254. 632 See §4 (0. 633 T.

This Style is found at Phylakopi, Ayia Irini, Nichoria and Khania-Kastelli, as well as in late LM IB Kastri, where it may have been made;645 perhaps the style was spread by refugee artisans who moved from Crete to the southern Péloponnèse at this time.646 LM IB ended just after the start of LH IIB on the mainland.647 The local LH IIA pottery is contemporary with mature LM IB and with Deposits Mu, Nu and Xi on Kythera (chart 14.1); these contain a minority of LM IB and LH IIA imports together with mostly local LM IA material, like the destruction deposits of eastern Crete and Trianda IIA. There are more mainland imports to Kastri than in any previous phase,648 reflecting the mainland's growing importance, but also more imports from Crete, which may represent an influx of refugees from the troubles there. Only child burials are known during LH IIA. The pithos graves Lambda 15 and Beta 24 are the last survivals of this MH mode of burial; the other tombs are pits or cists, like the impressive cist Eta 15. Burial Nu 12 was cut next to the LH I/IIA shaft grave burial 13; vases were put on top of its stone-filled pit and covered with a cairn. Burials Eta 15, Nu 12 and Lambda 2 had vessels in the grave-fill, perhaps from funerary meals. The use of stone-lined cists for child burials even within the settlement is seen at Nichoria also.649 (iii) Late Helladic IIB-IIIAi, Helos and Renewed Trade with Knossos (fig. 14.9) The settlement-pattern of Laconia in the LBA was discussed above.650 In LH IIIA-B the region shared in the general increase in occupation. LH IIIA-B sherds are known at the Lagio site, Lekas (South), Lekas (South-west), Lekas Panayiotis, Xeronisi, Ayios Nikolaos, two sites near Peristeri, Kokkinada, Asteri-Karaousi, Asteri-Dragatsoula, Ayios Strategos and Ayios Efstratios (fig. 13.2). The main centres were Ayios Stephanos, Lekas Panayiotis, Asteri-Karaousi and Ayios Strategos, which was probably Mycenaean Helos, since Bronze Age finds continue for 2 km all the way between Asteri-Karaousi and Ayios Strategos. Ayios Strategos, also known as Elitsa, once had a harbour651 and a small tholos tomb with LH III sherds, probably LH IIIA-B.652 Although this was of poor construction,653 it is the only one known in the region. Like other tholoi on the margins of Laconia at Kambos, Analipsis and Pellana, its existence shows that a local noble family retained some power, despite the centralising forces in the Vale of Sparta evidenced by the monumental architecture at Vapheio and the Menelaion. I doubt whether the Helos Plain was fully independent, but the difficult communications with the Vale of Sparta probably kept central control weak. Perhaps south-eastern Laconia was even a separate principality,654 as is implied by Homer's story that Thyestes and Aegisthus lived near Malea.655 Elsewhere in the region only chamber tombs are known. Some may lie near Kokkinada and east of Asteri, one east of Peristeri is dated to LH IIIA-B,656 and another, used from LH IIA to LH IIIC, has been found nearby;657 there are more at Mavrovouni, Krokeai and Pavlopetri.658 The fortunes of Ayios Stephanos were still tied to developments on Crete. The growing prosperity of the Vale of Sparta, where major replanning took place at the Menelaion,659 contrasts with what was at best a modest revival here. No wall- or floor-plaster, ashlar masonry, bathrooms, single threshold blocks or high-value materials have been found; even Nichoria had richer finds. As for Crete, after the ruin of its Minoan centres in LM IB, the Knossian rulers the west and centre of the island now began to conduct their administration in Greek, but there was no real recovery until LM IIIA1.660 Laconian contact with Knossos is shown by the manufacture of luxury objects in lapis lacedaemonius there, whence they were traded around the Aegean (chart 14.2). A store of pieces and sawn blocks was in the Lapidary's Workshop when the palace was burned down early in LM IIIA2.661 This raw material, amounting to much less than a single ship-load, could have been imported at any time after MM IIIB, but probably arrived shortly before the destruction.662 During this period seals were certainly being made of lapis lacedaemonius, since many are datable on stylistic grounds to LM II-IIIAi or LM IIIA1.663 The engravers were fond of minotaurs and bull-leaping scenes; these motifs were closely 645 Jones 1986, 467. 646 Coldstream and Huxley 1972, 302-3; 1984, 110. 647 Mountjoy 1999, 1 249. b4K Coldstream and Huxley 1072, 2Q2. 649 McDonald and Wilkie 1QQ2, 375-6. 650 See §4 (i). 651 Chapter 13 §3 (vi) above; Bintliff 10770, 462. 652 Waterhouse and Hope Simpson i960, 88 n. 3; it is now destroyed (Banou iqq6, 57). 653 Hope Simpson iq8i, 106. 654 Banou 1996, 97. 655 Homer.

JANKO associated with Knossos, which suggests that they came from a Knossian workshop.664 The art of engraving seals in hard stones like lapis lacedaemonius was lost when the palace was burnt. The seals of this material found on the mainland may well have been Cretan imports, but this cannot be proven.665 The stone began to be carved into vases at Mycenae in LH III, where sawn pieces of it were found, but there is no evidence that this craft was practised elsewhere. Lapis lacedaemonius was apparently exported from Ayios Stephanos as raw material.666 Since the inhabitants never carved it themselves, its export must have profited them little. Far-flung trade, probably via Knossos, is also attested by the ostrich eggshell 9214 found in a mainly LH IIIAi context. At this time pottery from Kydonia was being exported to Italy and Sardinia, as well as to the site,667 while Sardinian wares are found at Kommos and Appennine wares at Kydonia, Knossos and Kastelli Pediadhas.668 The ostrich eggshells from early contexts at Knossos, Zakro, Palaikastro,669 Akrotiri,670 and the Shaft Graves at Mycenae are well known, but there are also LH III examples from Mycenae, Dendra and Gla.671 Evidently Crete now had as much contact with Laconia as with Messenia.672 Even so, Ayios Stephanos was now less prosperous than the rest of Laconia.673 Proven LH ΠΙΑ walls are attested over an area of only c. 625 m2, while sherds are found over perhaps 15,600 m2, as in LH II (fig. 14.9). Save for occasional sherds, the plateau was disused even as a cemetery, while Area Nu was used only for burials. Only the s slopes were occupied. To the se, Structure Epsilon I was erected no later than LH IIIAi.674 In Area Beta on the s slope a plaster floor was laid, on which LH IIB drinking vessels were found. The adjacent courtyard underwent major refurbishment later in LH ILA or in LH IIB: it was walled off to the nw, and was reached from the ne by a narrow alley, Street Beta IV, with stone steps leading down to a gateway between antae. In LH IIIAi a stone bench was built against its nw wall. But the courtyard was soon abandoned; it was strewn with 15 drinking- vessels, stone grinders and other finds, which accumulated by the bench and gateway.675 Two LH IIIAi complete vases suggest an abandonment in trench Beta 4 also.676 To the sw, Structure Lambda HI went out of use in LH IIIAi Early. It had two associated floors, Floor 19 of 1963 with a LH IIB cup, and Floor 3 of 1973 with LH IIIAi material. This building was succeeded within LH IIIAi by Structure Lambda V, which itself went out of use by the end of the period.677 The site yielded a surprising number of LH IIIAi terracotta figurines; these are prevalent unusually early in the southern Péloponnèse, as at Nichoria.678 Two rare stag figurines are known (7114-7115), and one or two pieces of a very large female figure, of a type paralleled at Mycenae in the House of the Idols and at Phylakopi in the Shrine (7090-7091). However, like some of those figures, these could have been heirlooms in the LH IIIC Early shrine(s) that surely existed at the site.679 LH IIB pottery is sparse.680 Two floors in Area Beta are the only stratified deposits of it anywhere in Laconia.681 Its rarity cannot be ascribed only to the brief duration of LH IIB, but accords with the decline of the site seen in other aspects of its material record. LH IIIAi pottery is equally rare.682 The assemblage is idiosyncratic;683 analysis shows that some items were imported from Mycenae and Kydonia.684 The only stratified deposits of this date in Laconia are at the Menelaion.685 At Kastri, a LH IIIAi jar and alabastron are of provincial, perhaps south Peloponnesian origin.686 Infant burials, either in pits or in cists with grave goods like Beta 28 and Nu 11, continued in and near the inhabited sectors. The predominance of infants contrasts with their usual under-representation in Aegean cemeteries, save at Lerna and Asine.687 The missing adults were probably interred in one or more cemeteries of chamber tombs further away; these are found elsewhere in the region, but a report seal engraving during the Bronze Age. Unfortunately few come from datable contexts, and many lack any provenance whatsoever. Nevertheless about 25 examples can be associated with Crete, coming either from controlled excavations, or having been acquired there by early collectors like Evans.

This hypothesis better explains the lack of adults than would an increase in malaria.689 (iv) Late Helladic IIIA2-IIIB (figs. 14.9-14.10) Ayios Stephanos was partly destroyed by fire in LH IIIA2 Early, perhaps around the same time as the burning of the palace at Knossos, which had traded with the site in LH IIIA1,690 and the concomitant rise of Kydonia in western Crete. A building in Area Epsilon on the se slope burned down and was not rebuilt. An important LH IIIA2 Early deposit, consisting mainly of drinking-vessels, came in as wash from an adjacent building which was ruined at the same time.691 After this event Ayios Stephanos was almost deserted (fig. 14.10). Occupation continued somewhere on the hill, but no LH IIIA2- IIIB construction is attested. A LH IIIA2-IIIB fill, perhaps from terracing in LH IIIC Early, was dumped in Areas Lambda/Beta 12 and Lambda 2.692 Likewise rubble containing LH IIIA2-IIIC Early sherds was dumped in Area Beta.693 LH IIIA2-IIIB figurines, common elsewhere, are rare. No LH IIIB graves are known, and the LH IIIA2 burials may be from early in the period; two LH IIIA2 Early basins from Trial Trench III on the ne corner of the plateau may derive from graves, since human bones were found.694 The tribulations of Ayios Stephanos contrast with the great prosperity of the rest of the mainland, since LH IIIA2-IIIB1 is marked by the highest number of settlements during the entire Bronze Age. Laconia now had its main centre of power at Palaiopyrgi near Amyclae until its destruction at the end of LH IIIB i.695 Laconian stone was used for the finest monument of the age, the Treasury of Atreus at Mycenae: the grey-green marble of its façade is not lapis lacedaemonius ,m(ò but came from the same quarries at Kyprianon that produce rosso antico.697 Laconia had ties with other major centres; thus the name of the important man Ra-ke-da-mi-ni-jo in the Thebes tablets is probably an early form of Lakedaimonios.698 In LH IIIB occupation spread into upland and even mountainous country (fig. 14.10); this probably does reflect density of population rather than merely the ease with which the pottery can be recognised.699 The newly-founded sanctuary at Amyclae had two almost life-sized female figures in clay.700 To the cluster of sites with LH IIIB pottery found by extensive survey around the Eurotas delta, together with Kranae and Mavrovouni near Gytheion,701 we must add Ayios Nikolaos near Skala (fig. 13.2).702 Pavlopetri was still occupied. At first Crete prospered too, with an increase in the number of settlements; there was a major Mycenaean administration at Kydonia until a destruction at the end of LH IIIBi, and possibly still at Knossos.703 Architecture is attested again at Kastri in LH IIIA2. Kythera's international importance is attested by the funerary inscription at Kom-el-Hetan in Egypt, in which Amenhotep III, whose reign had ended by 1350 bc, includes Kythera between Nauplia and Knossos-Amnisos; Phaistos and Kydonia are also listed,704 while for some reason the name Amukla 'Amyclae' is defaced and written over.705 The LH IIIA2 Early pottery is significant, since stratified deposits of it are rare.706 It is a remarkable hybrid of Minoan and Mycenaean traits.707 The Minoan-style kylikes termed Group II are especially notable; cups with Minoan shapes may have a purely local scheme of decoration.708 Many shapes are painted monochrome, a development paralleled across the Péloponnèse to Phocis but not in the Argolid.709 Although some deem this assemblage a sign that Laconia was prone to regional particularism,710 the same features appear at other sites, even inland.711 The renewed Minoan influence which puzzled Mountjoy712 must have been owed to the revival of trade with Knossos in luxury goods like lapis lacedaemonius. After the fall of Knossos Cretan influence ceased; thus none of the stirrup jars with painted Linear Β inscriptions which were exported from Kydonia and central Crete during LM IIIA2-IIIB has been recognised.713 There are few sherds of later LH IIIA2;714 save one from Area Eta, all are from the s slope. 688 Bintliff 19770, 455. 689 See §1 (ii) above. 690 See §4 (iii) above. 691 See Chapter ι §1 (iii). 692 See Chapter ι §§5 (ii), 6 (ii). 693 See Chapter 1 §4 (ii). 694 *68k-*686; Taylour 1072, 248. 695 Banou 1996, 35. 696 Pace Banou 1996, 115. 697 Higgins etal 1968. 698 Shelmerdine iqq7, ^64. 699 Cartledere iq7q, 62-7 with fier. 7. 700 Demakopoulou 1082. 701 Hope Simpson 1981, 109. 702 See Introduction § 1 . 70s MerOusis 2002, 168. 704 Cline 1994, 38-40, 122. 705 Latacz 2004, 131. 706 Items ^027-^121, ^677-^688. 707 See Chaoter 6 §7 above: Mountiov 10.88: iqqq. ι 2ro. 26F.-76. 1 / &gt; J J *J ' *J U U &gt; kJ ' *J I 708 Mountiov IQQO, 2P.Q. 709 Mountiov iqqq, 1 24^, 2p;o. 710 Dickinson 1992, 112-13. 711 Banou iqq6, 121; Crouwel iqq6, 32. 712 Mountiov iqqq, I 24s. 713 Mountjoy once pondered such an identification for the LH IIIBi piece 3122 (P.

The massive fortifications of centres like Tiryns, Mycenae, Athens and Gla prove that there were palpable military threats. There was surely inter-state warfare by land, like that which underlies the tradition of the Seven against Thebes. The Menelaion, abandoned during LH IIIA2-IIIB1, was rebuilt on a grand scale; since this site is far more defensible than Palaiopyrgi, this move indicates increasing insecurity. It had administrative functions, using sealings and importing from western Crete stirrup jars with painted inscriptions in Linear B; although Laconia remains the most important Mycenaean region without surviving Linear Β tablets, archives of them certainly existed. Evidently the Menelaion controlled a principality with access to the coast. However, at the close of the period, its major buildings were violently destroyed.715 Occupation at Kastri ceased in LH IIIB1.716 At the end of LH IIIB2 'women of Kythera' (Ku-te-ra ), presumably either slaves bought at a market on the island or locals captured as a result of sea-borne raids, were making textiles for the palace at Pylos.717 After its Mycenaean administrative centres fell, Crete probably became a hornets' nest of pirates, as during the early first century bc.718 Their depredations, together with those of other islanders and of the Lukka (Lycians) of south-western Anatolia, surely contributed to the collapse of the trading network between the Aegean, Cyprus, Syria and Egypt upon which the prosperity of the LBA world had depended. I refer, of course, to the raids of the 'Sea Peoples', including the Philistines, who attacked Egypt in the reign of Merenptah and again early in that of Ramesses πι. Both tradition and archaeology show that Cretans were involved in these attacks. Odysseus tells of a Cretan raid on the Nile Delta that ended in his defeat and resettlement in Phoenicia.719 Although this is one of his false tales, the poet meant it to be truer to life than the hero's wanderings in the lands of folklore, since Odysseus is trying to pass himself off as a Cretan prince. According to Egyptian sources, some of the 'Sea Peoples' settled in Philistia. It cannot be chance that Minoa was another name for Gaza;720 biblical sources equate the Philistines with the Cherethites, i.e. Cretans,721 and say that they came from Caphtor, i.e. Crete.722 The LM IIIC elements in Philistine pottery of the 12th century bc723 are best explained by the presence of Cretans among the Philistines. LH IIIB pottery724 is as rare at the site as material from later in LH IIIA2: published sherds come from Areas Epsilon, Zêta, Eta, Beta and Lambda 2, and more were found in trench Beta n.725 The pottery exhibits few pecularities, although its scarcity may conceal any that existed; no stratified LH IIIB pottery has been found in Laconia.726 Kylikes continue in use, whereas Deep Bowls are rare. A Zygouries kylix (3352) is LH IIIBi, while two Deep Bowls (3133-3134) are LH IIIB2; like the pottery from Apidia, these bowls prove that the Argive LH IIIB2 style reached southern Laconia as well as the Menelaion. None of the Handmade Burnished ware, sometimes called 'Barbarian ware', has been recognised. One piece is known in a LH IIIB 2 context at Nichoria,727 another at Pellana, and a third perhaps at Mavrovouni;728 it is common at the Menelaion in deposits from the end of the period.729 (v) The Transitional and Late Helladic IIIC Early Phases (figs. 14.10-14.11) The existence of these phases, very important at Ayios Stephanos, has been recognised only recently. During the earlier excavations the pottery of both phases was deemed LH IIIB. Now, however, the pottery of LH IIIB2, at the end of which period the main palaces in the Argolid were destroyed, can be distinguished from what Mountjoy terms Transitional LH IIIB2/IIIC Early, when the palace at Pylos was burned, and from LH IIIC Early itself.730 In the Transitional phase the virtual desertion of the site was dramatically reversed. Transitional sherds were found in quantity in Areas Epsilon and Beta and in Trial Trench VI, while the scatter of LH IIIC Early sherds probably covered an area at least 26,500 m2 in total, as in EH II and the MBA. New buildings covered the area down to the 92 m contour to the s and the 96 m contour to the n. In Areas Epsilon and Lambda/Beta 12, where their construction is precisely dated, they were built within LH IIIC Early itself. At the end of this phase the site was abandoned, with parts of it destroyed by fire. 715 Dickinson 1992, 113. 716 Coldstream and Huxley 1972, 149-59, Deposits Pi and Rho. 717 Ventris and Chadwick icm6, ir6 (Aa, Ab and Ad tablets). 718 Nowicki 2000, 222-35. 719 Homer, Odyssey xiv 244-84. 720 Stephanus of Byzantium, Ethnica s.v. 721 Zephaniah 2:5; Ezekiel 25:16. 722 Jeremiah 47:4, with Doth an 1082, 13, 20. 723 Dothan 1982, especially 208-15.

Structures Epsilon I and II, orientated ne-sw, were built during LH IIIC Early. Pottery, figurines, pins and whorls attest domestic occupation.731 Area Zeta produced LH IIIC Early pottery; Structure Zeta IV was probably LH IIIC Early, and the infant burial Zeta 3 was presumably of this date.732 Area Beta yielded vases and other finds suggesting domestic occupation;733 at least some are Transitional. Drinking vessels of both phases were found in trench Beta φ734 Two more are known from trench Beta 5,735 probably associated with the large room formed by walls gt, gv and hi. This was 2.5 m wide by at least 4.5 m long and had a floor of slabs, Floor 4 of 1963; on it, amid signs of heavy burning, lay a krater, three closed coarse vessels736 and two pithoi. Other finds from Beta 1 1 comprise a krater and eight bowls.737 Just to the sw lay Structure Lambda VI, built in LH IIIC Early. This complex of rooms was differently aligned from the room in Beta 11. The peculiar relationships between some walls, which at first seemed to indicate that the complex had separate phases, suggest merely that it was hastily erected. At least two rooms were paved with slabs; when abandoned, they contained LH IIIC Early vases in closed and open shapes, as well as a LH IIIB amphora. These were domestic areas, with stone pounders, a quern, figurines and relics of spinning, weaving and bronze-working. More pottery came from other parts of this complex.738 The plateau, disused since the MBA, was reoccupied. Area Eta to the se yielded sherds and a burial.739 Area Alpha has sherds from this time.740 On the ν slope, Area Delta yielded complete vases, both open and closed,741 from around walls ba and bb; these walls, built much earlier,742 may have been reused. Structure Delta V, with rubble walls bn and bo aligned nne-ssw, may also belong to this phase.743 To the ε there lay an irregular alley, Street Delta II, with a stone drain along its centre for taking water down the slope. The very thick wall bq was conceivably part of a gate in a fortification wall. These remains deserved to be investigated further. At least one Transitional sherd, 3755, came from trench Delta 15; the incised bronze fibula HS 277 was found in trench Delta 12.744 On the ε slope Trial Trench VI, dug in search of fortifications, yielded a stratum full of Transitional and LH IIIC Early pottery, comprising hydriae, cups and bowls;745 there was also a LH IIIB krater and the arm of a female Psi-type terracotta figure, paralleled in the House of the Idols at Mycenae and the Shrine at Phylakopl.746 Like the LH ΠΙΑ specimens from Area Beta,747 its presence proves that there was once a shrine at the site. This deposit may represent rubbish dumped over the edge;748 perhaps the natural outcrop of poros was worked into a fortification, as at several other sites.749 Waterhouse and Hope Simpson discerned traces of an upper and lower enceinte, as well as of walls at Lekas Panayiotis,750 but the existence of fortifications is unconfirmed. However, even a stout enceinte could not protect coastal sites at this time, as witness the massacre of the defenders of Koukounaries on Paros during LH IIIC Middle.751 The buildings were still rectangular. At Nichoria an apsidal megaron, Unit III- 3, is dated to LH IIIB2;752 like the introduction of Handmade Burnished ware, this harbinger of the apsidal style usual in the Dark Age is so anomalous753 that it could be related to the foreign mercenaries called 'allies' whom the authorities at Pylos employed to guard the Messenian coastline.754 The detachments of different ethnic groups who served as e-pi-ko-wo are best interpreted as epikorwoi 'allies' (επίκουροι in Homer), although most scholars prefer to take this as epikowoi 'watchers'.755 Such groups would have formed part of the new population who, I suspect, took over Messenia after the collapse of its palatial administration, conferring on the region their name Metsãnai.756 731 See Chapter ι §1 (ii). 732 See Chapter ι §2 (ii). 733 See Chapter 1 §4 (ii) above. 734 3711' 3733' 3742; 3733 is Transitional. 735 3737, 3758. 736 3718, HS 95, 97, 115 (in Taylour 1972, 257-9 with fig. 30, pl. 49b). 737 371O&gt; 3729-3731, 3734-3735. 3748, 3756-3757; Taylour 1972, 255-6, 231 fig. 15. 738 See Chapter 1 §5 (ii) above. 739 See Chapter 1 §3 (ii). 740 'LH IIIB' in Taylour 1972, 239-40. 741 3695-3699; Taylour 1972, 244-7, where they are dated LH IIIB2.

JANKO A few burials belong to this period. These include the infant Eta 13 with the steatite seal 7126 (the sole example of the Mainland Popular Group known from Laconia) but not the 1 2 year-old Beta 19.757 The lack of interments of adults, when the occupied area was larger than at any time since LH I, suggests that they are buried away from the hilltop in chamber tombs yet to be discovered. The Transitional pottery, corresponding to that from Iria in the Argolid, can be recognised from various types of Deep Bowl.758 LH IIIC Early pottery is plentiful. It exhibits some unusual characteristics, notably the absence of monochrome Deep Bowls. Chemical analysis suggests that most of it was made locally; there was some contact with Messenia and with Nichoria in particular.759 It participates in the general trend towards regional diversification.760 Elsewhere hydriae with added white paint, Deep Bowls with a reserved band below the interior rim and amphoriskoi that are completely monochrome except for a narrow decorated band appear only later in LH IIIC, in the last case much later.761 One krater depicts a man carrying a fish; although the Pictorial Style generally begins in the earlier phase of LH IIIC Middle,762 pictorial sherds occur at the Menelaion at the end of LH IIIB763 and there is a LH IIIAi example from Melathria.764 To turn to the regional context, in LH IIIC Laconia suffered a precipitous decline in settlement; known sites fall from c. 52 in LH IIIB to c. 16, a drop of c. 66% (see fig. 14.10 and chart 14.3).765 The decline was greatest in the Vale of Sparta. LH IIIC Early pottery appears with Handmade Burnished ware in the brief reoccupation on Aetos hill near the Menelaion, before its final desertion during that sub-phase.766 The shrine at Amyclae was in contact with the Close Style of the Argolid and had LH IIIC Late, but lacks ceramic continuity with Protogeometric.767 No LH IIIC sherds were recognised during the Laconia Survey.768 Up in Mt Parnon Palaiochori yielded a LH IIIC Early vase.769 On the north-west periphery, the chamber tombs at Pellana yielded every phase of LH IIIC, with Handmade Burnished ware, as well as Sub-Mycenaean.770 Around the Laconian Gulf most sites, including Pavlopetri, lack LH IIIC pottery, but it is less rare than further north. Figurines from Geraki and Koutifari in the outer Mani, and pottery from Mavrovouni and Kranaë near Gytheion, Xeronisi and Goritsa may be LH IIIC. But none of these is certain: the last two may be either LH IIIC Early or LH IIIB,771 while Geraki has Protogeometric pottery but not LH IIIC or sub-Mycenaean.772 North-east of the Helos Plain, Apidia yielded LH IIIC Early sherds773 and a LH IIIC Late vase is known from Vrondama,774 unless this is somewhat earlier.775 At Asteri-Karaousi a Type Β shallow angular bowl is LH IIIC Early776 and a krater is LH IIIC Middle.777 On the Maleatic peninsula, chamber tombs at Sykea near Molaoi yielded Transitional and LH IIIC Early vases,778 together with a sword of Sandars' type C, presumably an antique.779 The tombs at Epidaurus Limera were used from the Transitional phase into sub-Mycenaean.780 LH IIIC Late is known at the inaccessible site of Phoiniki south-west of Sykea, which has earlier Mycenaean occupation and outcrops of oxidised lapis lacedaemonius.781 A vase dated LH IIIC Late is said to come from a grave near Krokeai,782 but the provenance is doubtful.783 Thus the only sites in Laconia that definitely continued into LH IIIC are Palaiochori, Pellana, the Aetos hill near the Menelaion, Amyclae, Ayios Stephanos, Asteri-Karaousi, Apidia, Sykea and Epidaurus Limera. The rest were presumably deserted. Pellana, Ayios Stephanos, Sykea and Epidaurus Limera received influxes of settlers at this time. They were apparently refugees who moved into marginal parts of Laconia; the contemporary depopulation of the Vale of Sparta may indicate whence they came. There were certainly refugees in Messenia just before the palace at Pylos was burned: a list of rowers includes 'refugees', since the Mycenaean word po-si-ke-te-re must be read as posikteres 'arrivals' from 757 Taylour 1972, 235-6. 758 Mountjoy 1999, 1 251.

The influx of refugees in the Transitional phase belongs to a pattern wherein palatial sites were destroyed at the end of LH IIIB2 or (in the cases of Pylos and Athens) during the Transitional phase, whereas unfortified sites were either deserted or enlarged.786 The expansion of Ayios Stephanos is paralleled in other coastal areas, such as Perati in Attica, Asine and Tiryns in the Argolid, Naxos, Koukounaries on Paros, Achaea and the Ionian islands of Kephalonia and Ithaca,787 not to mention places like the LH IIIC Early settlement at Palaeokastro-Maa on Cyprus.

In that Tigani lacks arable land, it might resemble Palaeokastro-Maa.789 Ayios Stephanos in effect became a staging-post for refugees on a journey to points further afield. When they arrived during the Transitional phase, they surely hoped to stay. However, before the start of LH IIIC Middle something brought the settlement to an abrupt end. The inhabitants did not trouble or have time to take their everyday possessions, but left them where they were; their valuables were removed, whether by themselves or by raiders who, as usual, are archaeologically almost invisible. Three sling-stones were found in the ε part of Area Delta near the possible fortified gate, with another in Area Alpha,790 and a dead dog was left unburied on the floor in Structure Lambda VI. A pit containing four adult skulls with their neck-bones only was cut through the slab floor of the large room in trench Beta 1 1 ; this pit was dated 'LH IIIB', i.e. LH IIIC Early.791 These are surely severed heads that silently attest to a massacre.792 It is perhaps no coincidence that this room was burned down, the sole place at the site known to have had heavy burning. In well-documented modern atrocities like those of Bosnia, Rwanda and Darfur, the attackers normally kill the defenders and then burn down their dwellings so as to deter others from returning. Apidia and Sykea were probably abandoned at about the same time. Asteri lasted a bit longer, while Epidaurus Limera and the inland sites near Molaoi survived, with contacts by sea to Asine and Perati, until sub-Mycenaean times. Then even these, like all other known sites in Laconia including Amyclae, suffer a complete break. A post-palatial koine of the Arcado- Cypriot dialect, datable to LH IIIC, was spoken in the Argolid, Arcadia, Laconia, Crete, Rhodes and Cyprus.793 The vital piece of evidence for the early speech of Laconia is the survival in later Laconian of the form Ποίιοιδάν, derived from Arcadian Ποσοιδάν rather than from Mycenaean Poseidãõn or Doric Ποτειδάν; the classical inhabitants of Helos celebrated a festival named Ποίιοιδαΐα, and Helots had the right of asylum at Poseidon's shrine at Taenarum.794 This linguistic evidence suggests that at least some of the inhabitants of Ayios Stephanos left by sea to join one of the waves of migrants who settled in Crete, Cyprus and perhaps even Philistia during the century from c. 1 190 bc, just as many Laconians fled from the Slavs to settle in Sicily and southern Italy in the 6th century ad.795 The archaeological record has a gap between sub-Mycenaean and the earliest Protogeometric finds around the mid-ioth century; continuity of occupation is not proven anywhere.796 According to tradition, the remnants of the Achaeans of Laconia withdrew to places like Paracyparissii Achaei, Pharis, Geronthrai (Geraki) and Helos, until the Spartans conquered them under Teleclus and his son Alcamenes.797 Southern Laconia was sparsely inhabited until the classical era;798 it fared poorly under Spartan domination, when the name of the subjected Helots was thought to derive from the pre-Dorian inhabitants of the conquered town of Helos.799 5. EPILOGUE: CLASSICAL ANTIQUITY AND THE MIDDLE AGES (i) Helos and its Region in Classical Antiquity (fig. 13.2) The environs of Ayios Stephanos changed considerably after the Bronze Age, as we saw above.800 There is no sign of reoccupation at the site until at least Hellenistic times, when the region prospered.801 Even then, the only finds are the possibly Hellenistic or Roman loomweights 8063-8064, the astragalus 8071 and the worn Roman coin 8083 of ad 161-75, together with sherds that were likened to West Slope ware. These objects came from Areas Zeta, Lambda 2 and Nu/Gamma 1.802 Perhaps there was a hovel nearby, or these artefacts were lost by shepherds or travellers, or the Medieval inhabitants brought them from a site in the vicinity. There was no large Graeco-Roman settlement on the western side of the plain. Two minor sites lie near Ayios Stephanos: a farm-structure, apparently of Graeco-Roman date, on the next hilltop to the west,803 and a classical site just over 1 km south-south-west of the site near the ancient road. The ancient highway from Sparta, marked by wheel-ruts of standard gauge cut into the rock, followed the Eurotas to emerge at the northern edge of the Helos Plain between Phlisio and Peristeri near Tsasi 789 Karageorghis and Demas io88. 790 HS 290-291 in Taylour 1972, 247.

JANKO where it divided.804 One branch ran south-east past Peristeri towards the classical town of Helos, where it met a road from Epidaurus Limera, traces of which exist near Ayios Ioannis;805 from Helos the road continued south to Asopus and Boeae. The other branch turned south-west towards Trinasos and thence to Gytheion.806 This road reappears at the western edge of the Helos Plain, about ι km south-south-west of Ayios Stephanos, where ruts of the same gauge running north-south are cut into the limestone foothills above the former Trinasos marsh. There are rock-cuttings for houses, with sherds and tiles of Classical date.807 Presumably the Mycenaean network of roads had been similar.808 Strabo, writing under Augustus or Tiberius, says that a flourishing trade in lapis lacedaemonius had begun 'recently'.809 The quarries near Krokeai, at first owned by the notable Spartan family of Julius Eurycles, became an imperial monopoly; this is attested by a dedication made by Eudoxus, a dispensator who would have been a freedman of Domitian and responsible for the quarries.810 The stone was probably exported through Paizoulia, where pieces of it are known,811 or through Trinisa, where there is a rectangular Late Roman building-complex on the beach with tiles in its walls, built on top of a thick deposit of Younger Fill.812 The regional centre, Helos, was at Sto Manolaki between Asteri and Ayios Strategos 2 km south-east (figs. 13. 1-13. 2).813 Classical and Roman finds, including inscriptions, are densely concentrated from Sto Manolaki over to Ayios Ioannis near Vezani;814 Leake saw a Roman milestone nearby at Priniko.815 Bronze Age Helos had been in this same area,816 where there was a sizable agricultural hinterland.817 Homer's statement that Helos was on the coast818 accords with the facts that it had a festival of Poseidon and that the Athenian fleet raided it in 424 bc.819 Strabo mistakenly implies that it was near the mouth of the Eurotas gorge, i.e. at Skala,820 but it was only 30 stades, i.e. 5.5 km, from Helos to Acriae,821 which lay at Kokkinia on the eastern side of the Laconian Gulf.822 Strabo calls Helos a village;823 Pausanias found it in ruins,824 which is confirmed by the fact that Ptolemy does not list it in his itinerary.825 Similarly, it does not appear on the accurate Roman map known as the Tabula Peutingeriana, where the distance by road from Gytheion to Asopus on the opposite side of the gulf is given as 27 Roman miles, i.e. 40 km;826 this distance implies a considerable detour inland to circumvent the marshes. (ii) Helos and Ayios Stephanos in the Medieval Period (fig. 14.12) The early Middle Ages were a period of upheaval in southern Laconia.827 From the late 6th century onwards Slavs called Ezeritai, i.e. lake-dwellers', settled in the swampy plain. Helos was called Ezeros, Slavic for 'lake' or 'marsh';828 Slavic toponyms survive in the area.829 Many of the earlier inhabitants fled inland to Tsakonia (Mt Parnon) or sailed from Gytheion to Sicily.830 The Byzantines regained control in the Middle Byzantine period. Helos had a naval station by 878 ad,831 by which time it had replaced Gytheion as the main port of Laconia.832 Lapis lacedaemonius was again in use in the 11th to 13th centuries, from Trebizond in Anatolia via San Marco in Venice to Westminster Abbey in London.833 I suspect that the chapel at Krikela by the quarries and the ruined building at Psephi which is considered to be of the Turkish period in fact date from this time.834 The stone may have been taken from the quarries along an old road to Skala, whence it could have been shipped down the Vasilopotamos, whose vigorous flow kept its channel to the sea open. Medieval Helos was not on the coast near the mouth of the Eurotas (fig. 14.13).835 Instead, it was, I suggest, identical with Skala, which has two Medieval churches - that of the Transfiguration by the the vigla or watch-tower, and that of the maritime saint Ayios Nikolaos above the springs of the 804 Leake 1830, 1 195. 805 Pikoulas 1988^ 277. 806 Leake 1830, 1 105; Waterhouse and Hope Mmpson 1900, 05. 807 Waterhouse and Hope Simpson i960, 100. 808 Banou 1996, 108. 809 Strabo, Geog. vm 5.7. 810 Le Roy iq6i; Dworakowska 1975, 91. 811 Banou iqq6, 4Q· 812 Çpp Chanter 12 §a (vn) above; Bintliff iQ77fl, 464. 813 Le Puillon de Boblaye 1836, 94-5. 814 Chapter 13 §4 (ii) above; Bintliff 19770, 467-76. 815 Leake 1830, 1 iqq. 8lfi See §4 (iii) above. 817 Chanter '% §§3 (vi), 4 (ii) above: Bintliff 19770, 461, 474~7- 818 Homer, Iliad π 584. 819 Thucydides, Hist, iv 54.4. 820 Strabo, Geog. vm 3.12. 821 Pausanias πι 22.3. 822 Banou iqq6, k8. 823 Strabo, Geog. vm 5.2. 824 Pausanias πι. 22.4. 825 Ptolemy, Geoz. m 16.10. 826 Pritchett 1080, 23Q, fig- n· 827 Wagstaff 1982, 54-7. 828 Constantine Porphyrogenitus, De administrando império £O.Q-2 1. 829 Wagstaff 1982, 57. 830 Lemerle 1063. 831 George Cedrenus, Hist. 11 p. 235 Bekker; Joseph Genesius, Reeesiv 33; Doukas 1922, 565-6. 832 Armstrong 2002, 342. 833 Warren iqq 2, 2q6. 834 Le Roy 1961, 206-7 with fig. 1. 835 Pace Wagstaff 1982, 58-9.</page><page sequence="638">SUMMARY AND HISTORICAL CONCLUSIONS §5 607 Fig. 14.13. The Helos Plain during the Middle Ages. Vasilopotamos.836 Helos was for centuries the seat of an Orthodox bishop,837 as was Skala at times.838 Skala's name, 'landing-place', befits its location at the head of two navigable rivers, the Vasilopotamos and the Eurotas. Skala also had a Medieval fortress,839 presumably on the site of the vigla. In 1389 the Venetians captured 'the tower by the Vasilopotamos',840 and in 1740 a traveller had to walk from his ship along the Vasilopotamos to the 'rocky fortress of Eleos' near the springs.841 In each case Skala must be meant. The Frankish knights who conquered the Morea (Péloponnèse) after the Fourth Crusade won control of the coast of Laconia by 1209, or 1223 at the latest.842 According to the Aragonese version of the Chronicle of the Morea, one Guy de Leis built a castle on the Laconian gulf;843 this was inherited by his son Hugo, Ούγγος ντε Λέλε in the Greek version.844 De Leis or de Lele is an error for 'de l'Eles' 'of Helos', castle since 'Helos' had become 'Eles' in French845 and 'Elos' or 'Eleos' in Greek.846 Thus Guy's castle was at Skala. Ayios Stephanos was an outpost in his territory. Just as a Medieval tower guarded the approach to Skala from the north through the Eurotas gorge,847 so too the site was ideally located to guard the harbour at the mouth of the Vasilopotamos; this formed the south-western approach to bkala, which is easily seen from the site (plate 59 c). Ayios Stephanos may have been reoccupied by the mid- 13th century, since a slightly worn silver com of Louis VIII or IX of France, struck between 1223 and 1266, was found on the centre of the plateau (fig. 14.12). Medieval walls existed in a rectangular area of c. 1,000 m2 along the s slope while the scatter of sherds reached the Ν, ε and s sides of the hill and probably covered c. 26,500 m2' Lambda as during VII LH HIC Early implying the use of harbours to the Ε and s. A large building, Structure Lambda VII was erected later in the 13th century.

The yard had a stone bench and a well with a stone drain leading to it. The building was stoutly constructed with foundation-trenches, stone piers and a tiled roof. Animals were kept on the ground floor, with living-quarters above. Other less solid buildings, probably comprising stables, a square tower of mudbrick on a stone socle (perhaps a dovecote or watch-tower) and a walled enclosure with a stone bench, were erected to the se in Area Beta; there was a floor with a hearth in Area Zeta. Pits were dug in trench Beta 6 and Areas Alpha, Epsilon and Eta. There may have been a small cemetery for adults on the Ν side of the hilltop; at least one extended adult cist burial, Delta 25, is Christian.848 A few newborns were perhaps interred among the outbuildings of the main complex. The settlement probably combined the functions of a fortified customs-house, harbour, look-out post, farm and inn, which could accommodate passing wayfarers and their beasts. Laconia was administered under a feudal system established by the 1 220s, in which Frankish barons ruled Greek villages through the agency of Frankish castellans. Guy de Nivelet's castle at Geraki to the north-east guarded the restive region of Tsakonia (fig. i). William II de Villehardouin built the castles of Mistra, Le Grand Magne (Maina) and Beaufort to try to subjugate the Slavic Melingi in the Taygetus range;849 he reserved to himself the Eurotas valley with La Crémonie, i.e. Lacedaemonia on the site of ancient Sparta. Jean de Nully's castle at Passava south of Gytheion guarded the approach to the Mani; it took its name from the French cry passe avant.850 In 1259 the Franks lost the battle of Pelagonia to the Byzantines, led by the Emperor Michael Palaeologos; William de Villehardouin and many leading barons were captured. To obtain their release the Franks agreed to surrender Monemvasia, Le Grand Magne (probably Tigani on the west side of Cape Taenarum), Mistra, Geraki and the region of Kinsterna or Gisterna south of Kalamata.851 The defection of the Tsakonians and Melingi gave the Byzantines control of all of Laconia, while the fleet of the protostrator Alexis Philanthropenos secured the coast from Monemvasia to the Mani.852 Thus Ayios Stephanos became Byzantine territory. The Franks, led by Anselin de Toucy and Jean de Katavas, raided Helos in 1264,853 but Byzantine advances continued; in 1278' the Emperor even regained Cerigo (Kythera) from the Venetian family of the Venieri. When the Franks sought help from the ambitious and rapacious Charles I of Anjou, brother of Louis IX and King of the Two Sicilies, this only hurt their cause. In 1289 Isabella de Villehardouin, more acceptable to her Greek subjects, returned from Naples. As Cheetham writes/for an all too short period, the artificial division of the peninsula between Franks and Greeks lost its importance ... The indeterminate nature of the frontier is clear from the number of Greeks holding lands under both Byzantine and Frankish jurisdiction.'854 Byzantine control is likely to have been weak, with local Frankish lords retaining control as fiefs of the Emperor under the Byzantine system of πρόνοια. Thus Ayios Stephanos probably remained in the family of Guy de L'Eles until its destruction. In accord with this situation, the inhabitants of Ayios Stephanos evince a mixture of material cultures. Even though they were within the Byzantine Despotate, their coinage was Western: they used deniers tournois minted at Tours or Clarence (Glarentza) in Elis, the port of Andréville (Andravida), capital of the Frankish principality of Achaia. The denier was a city-coinage of low value, well-suited to markets and trade;855 it must have been used by coastal travellers and merchants. The Byzantine rulers of the Morea never minted coins, employing foreign money of various kinds. The pottery856 is of great interest, since hardly any well-dated assemblages of the late 13th to early 14th century are known from the Péloponnèse south of Corinth;857 it resembles that from Sparta and Methone, with the fine wares imported from northern and central Italy rather than from Byzantine regions.858 Ayios Stephanos also yielded a bronze buckle adorned with fleurs de lys, a firesteel of Western type and a the graffito Eastern m Latin letters; but two terracotta stamps, probably for holy bread, such as are used in the Eastern Church, were also found.859 This cultural intermixture suggests that the inhabitants included 'Gazmoules , i.e. children of Greek women married to Frankish knights; the Gazmoules often adopted their mothers religion, and gradually merged into Byzantine society.860 848 See Chapter 3 §6 above. 849 Huxley 1993. 850 Bon 1969, 509. % _ 851 George Pachymeres, Chron. 1. 31 (Failler 1984, 123).

Their depredations, and those of the Turks whom they were supposed to be repelling, severely weakened both the Empire and the Franks. The Despot Andronicus Palaeologus Asen kept them at bay, but after he left Mistra in 1321 Laconia fell into a decline.862 The Catalans raided the Morea again in the 1320s. The Venieri, who had retaken Cerigo from the Eudaimonoiannis family of Monemvasia in 1309, turned the island into a base for piracy, especially against Catalan shipping. Turkish pirates used Cerigo too, until Nicolo Veniero exstirpated them in 1347.863 Above all, Umur-beg el-Ghâzi, the Seljuk emir of Aydm and Izmir who was the most powerful pirate-prince in the Levant, captured the lower town of Monemvasia in 1332 and ravaged the Laconian Gulf and Vale of Sparta in 1334.864 The Black Death soon followed, preventing any recovery. The latest coins found at Ayios Stephanos are freshly minted deniers of Philip of Taranto and Maud of Hainault, dating between 1307 and 1321. The site was burned and abandoned after the removal of whatever valuables had been there. A horse may have been caught in the fire; its burned carcass was left in the yard, and four iron arrowheads were found elsewhere.865 These finds indicate that Catalan or Turkish raiders destroyed the site between 1321 and 1334. The terracotta stamps suggest that an Orthodox chapel existed at the site. The present chapel of St Stephen may be 15th century or older.866 If its origins were even older, one would like to think that survivors of the destruction escaped to the greater safety of Stephaniá further inland, naming their new settlement after the patron saint of their former home. 6. THE SIGNIFICANCE OF AYIOS STEPHANOS The importance of the site, 1-2 ha in area and located on a coastal promontory throughout the Bronze Age, may be briefly stated. It is the first site in Laconia to yield a stratified pottery sequence which runs from the start of the Bronze Age almost to its end, EH III excepted. It has EH I pottery and two phases of EH II, as well as architecture and burials. The site attests a radical break between the material culture of EH II and that of the MBA, in accord with the general pattern in the Aegean islands and mainland. Resettled at the very beginning of MH I, there are three ceramic and architectural phases during MH I, when the use of apsidal dwellings was abandoned after disastrous fires. Such buildings were replaced by rectangular structures, while the street-plan of the settlement came to resemble Minoan prototypes. Minoan imported pottery, and styles under Minoan influence, are evident from the start of the MBA. The site has stratified remains of MH II and of two phases of MH III. Study of its ceramic sequence, when compared with those of Lerna, Kythera, and Crete, has greatly improved the precision with which the various MH wares can be defined and the successive phases dated. It has also clarified the relation between the mainland sequences and those of Crete. A ceramic phase, MH III/LH I, which is transitional between MH and LH I, has been recognised. Pottery dated LH I Early, LH I/IIA and LH IIIA2 Early is also distinguished. Throughout the MBA Ayios Stephanos was a medium-sized port which relied on trade, fishing and metal-working. It was rather isolated from the interior of Laconia, but maintained close links with Kythera and Crete, and exported greenstone axes and eventually the rare stone lapis lacedaemonius', this raw material was turned into luxury goods in Cretan palatial workshops. The site imported Cretan pottery and perishable goods. Since Ayios Stephanos has many tombs as well as extensive architectural remains, it well illustrates how Minoan material culture was diffused to the mainland, without the added complication of any Cycladic intermediary. A Linear A inscription is known, but Ayios Stephanos was neither a Minoan settlement like Kastri on Kythera, nor a heavily Minoanised one like Phylakopi on Melos. Minoan merchants traded in copper and tin, commodities vital to the Bronze Age economy, along a route which ran overland from Iran through Syria and thence by sea to Cyprus, Crete, Kythera, the Péloponnèse and the western Mediterranean. Although the Cretans established heavily Minoanised ports at Pavlopetri and Minoa (Monemvasia), so as to control navigation around Cape Malea, Ayios Stephanos lay just beyond this zone and kept its mainland culture. The site displays none' of the wealth of contemporary Crete and Mycenae. Although Ayios Stephanos was not exposed to the Theran eruption of LM IA, it probably suffered from the associated earthquakes. But as the interior of Laconia grew in power and prosperity, the site 861 Bon 1969, 167. 862 Runciman 1980, 51-2. 8W Thiriet 1959, 251 n. 3. 864 Zakythinos 1975, 1 90-1, 334; Runciman 1980, 52.

Trade must have collapsed after the destruction at the end of LM IB of settlements all over Crete save Knossos, and the abandonment of much of Kythera. In addition, the approach of the marshy Eurotas delta, after which Homeric Helos was to be named, may have caused the harbour to begin to silt up, giving an advantage to the rival centre at Ayios Strategos (probably Bronze Age Helos) on the other side of the bay. In LH IIIAi trade revived and Cretan influence was briefly renewed, as the local LH IIIA2 Early pottery attests; raw lapis lacedaemonius was exported to Knossos, and was worked there until the palace was burned in LM IIIA2. At about the same time, i.e. in LH IIIA2 Early, Ayios Stephanos was partly burned and almost abandoned; only a few inhabitants remained. After the destruction of the Menelaion at the end of LH IIIB2, Ayios Stephanos received a large influx of refugees, probably from the interior of Laconia. The greatly expanded settlement lasted long enough to leave behind substantial architecture and major deposits of LH IIIC Early pottery. But then the site was emptied of valuables, partly burned and abandoned, apparently after a massacre. Ayios Stephanos was left to nature for the next 2,400 years. It slumbered through the centuries of Spartan, Roman, Slavic and Byzantine rule, only disturbed by an occasional shepherd or traveller along the nearby coastal route. The site, now on an inlet of the sea, was resettled in the 13th and early 14th centuries ad, probably by followers of the Frankish knight Guy de L'Eles. By about 1285 they had erected a house or tower with a walled yard and stables. This doubled as an inn and fortified look- out post guarding the approach up the River Vasilopotamos to Skala, the local capital (Medieval Helos). However, in the years after 1321 a raid by Catalans or Turks plunged the site into its final oblivion.</page><page sequence="642">Bibliography R. Janko andT.
