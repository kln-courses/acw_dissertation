SCHILLER, M.A., D.Sc., Fellow and Senior Tutor of Corpus Christi College, Oxford. Swan Sonnenschein &amp; Co. SOME twenty years havg passed since Dr. Schiller's well-known Riddles first saw the light. Tempora mutantur et nos . . . The author observes in his Preface to this, the third and revised edition, that he is no longer able to endorse all the conclusions that were reached in the original work. He is now a mature Humanist, alive to the unsatisfactoriness of his earlier " gropings ". He disbelieves now in the possibility of framing any system of metaphysics which can lay claim to absolute truth and certainty; thinks further that philosophers, himself included, have been prone to overrate their importance. Still he is haunted by a ' personal vision' of the universe and opines that his loyal public may care to hear about it. Accordingly, he-gratifies this curiosity with the re- vised work; a valuable contribution to thought, brimful of subtle aperqus and criticisms and refreshingly contemptuous of time-worn shibboleths and systems. It is constructive as well as destruc- tive. The author does far more than dwell on the defects of famous philosophers, absolutist and other, with intent to show what power " Humanism " has to demolish. I have heard an acute thinker describe Dr. Schiller as too critical and " subjective "-as too loth to expose himself to the risks incidental to constructive work. But none surely will read the Riddles and impute to him lack of daring. The chapter (pp. 33-94) on " Scepticism," viewed as a developed agnosticism, shows effectively what a case against meta- physics destructive thinkers can urge, but the author presents these arguments simply to make clear that he is fully aware of their force and yet anon able to pass beyond them. This " study of Humanism " is designed, in sooth, to brush Agnosticism and Scepti. cism from our path. It goes very far indeed on the way of positive ontology; in the matters, for instance, of Theism, of the teleologic interpretation of the world-process, of pre-existence, of the plurality of lives, of Immortality, and of the ideal of the changeless perfect society of individuals which is to crown evolution, submitting truth- claims, which if held valid, must draw approval even from the exacting Sphinx! Dr. Schiller withal is no dogmatiser, but puts trust in the " natural dialectic of the soul and the necessity of the</page><page sequence="2">406 CRITICAL NOTICES: process which impels it step by step, from the coarsest prejudice a.nd crassest 'fact,' towards the loftiest ideals of metaphysics ". The order of discussion is not arbitrary, but seeks to convenience, as far as may be, this ' natural dialectic'. And the upshot is one of the most live and interesting volumes which give worth to modern British philosophy. Metaphysics, it is urged, is worth our trouble, because a practical issue is involved-the problem of how to live well. And to live well we must obtain an understanding of our--position and pros- pects. We cannot act with fully intelligent purpose unless we have found some clue to the mystery of our standing in, and ex- pectations from, the world process. There is required some highly probable solution of the riddles of the Sphinx. In this solution lies the only tolerable alternative to Pessimism, i.e. the view that the nature of things is perverse "rendering all the aims of life illusory ". In the powerful chapter on " Pessimism," it is urged that the ideals of knowledge, goodness, beauty a.nd happiness, if our outlook goes no farther than this terrestrial life, are fated to disappoint. To this extent, then, we can endorse the conclusions drawn by Schopenhauer and von Hartmann. And unless we can believe that the world-order, as we now know it, is a stage only in the coming-to-be of a consummation which will be truly satisfac- tory, there is nothing, for it but to despair of life. For myself I would go farther. Were it not that I saw ground to believe in the persistence a.nd final satisfaction of individuals, I should both preach and act a gospel of pleasant Decacdence. Que tout crave ! The optimism of some moderns, who profess to have no use for immor- tality, is really pathetic. They have depicted evolution as a tragedy- farce and they still dare to expect us to take "progress " seriously! But " if," as Dr. Schiller writes, "the chapter of life is definitely closed by death, despair is the end of all its glories." 1 I recall the case of an agnostic friend who was so worsened by this sense of "despair " that he said to me almost in the words of the poet: Let's eat, drink and play till the worms do corrupt us, 'Tis certain, -Post Mortem Nulla Voluptas. For health, wealth and beauty, wit, learning and sense, Must all come to nothing a hundred years hence. -Jordan. He was rational enough after the limitations of his kind. Why, as I have urged elsewhere, strive to be a master-builder when the fane contemplated is certain to be overthrown-when not only you, but the human race itself, are but passing events in the history of a moribund planet ? The game of the grave sage is really one not worth the playing. 'P. 367.</page><page sequence="3">F. C. S. SCHILLER, Riddles of the Sphinx. 407 In chapter v. the subject of Reconstruction is broached. The worst has been said. And we have noted, further, that a great deal of pseudo-philosophical work can be set aside as not even confront- ing honestly the difficulties which have been stated. A great many systems of thought are vitiated with " latent pessimism ". But how are we going to reach a solution of our riddles which is satis- factory,? At this stage the discussion of a " new theory of truth capable of repelling all the assaults of scepticism " is foreshadowed -and we know, of course, at once what is coming. With respect to the most recent statement of this theory, to wit that " truth furthers a purpose conceived as cognitive " '-a purpose which Error thwarts, I must avow that I find little enough to criticise. It is admitted almost universally that we judge 'toward an interest,' and that, in so doing, we desire to know, whether with the ulterior end of forwarding action or not. But those of us who agree with Mill, that truth is not a Cosmic Whole (" self-fulfilling and self- fulfilled " as Hegelians would urge), but that it is a " sum of true propositions " (verifiable empirically), will want to be told in what respect the alleged novel theory of pragmatism differs from ours. Is it solely in respect of the contention that truth need not re- produce or 'copy' aspects of reality? William James, I observe, in his Meaning of Truth, does not base the importance of Prag- matism on the claim that it proffers a new Truth-theory. He terms pragmatism, indeed, with diplomatic caution, an attitude rather than a theory. If Dr. Schiller admits this correction, he will have to admit, I will venture to suggest, much more. For the atti- tude which rejects the vision of an absolute Cosmic Truth-Whole, and refers us, in radical empiricist fashion, back to concrete appear- ances which arise in human experience, has been approved already by such otherwise opposed writers as Schopenhauer and Mill. I must submit here that the British empirical school has been over- looked by' pragma'tists in a way which calls for some comment. Thus even Dr. Schiller's treatment of the " Axiom " of Causality as what it is, viz., a mere " Postulate," will be found to have been anticipated by Bain. I note further that Dr. Schiller's view of truth seems not always hostile to ' correspondence '. I hap on utterances such as these: if our description of the world-process is true, the world must satisfy all the characteristics of that description " (p. 200) ; and " Not one of the principal conceptions of our science is true, not one is able to grasp the ' Becoming ' of things as it really is " (p. 58). But, perhaps, such passages preserve first edition " gropings " of the Riddles which have been left behind! There exists, I must say in passing, an improved and I humanistic' form of the Correspon- dence Truth-hypothesis not unworthy, perhaps, of notice.2 Accord- Cf. Dr. Schiller's paper on " Error " (International Congress of Philos- ophy, Bologna, April, 1911), p. 12. 2 Cf my Individual and Reality, p. 38.</page><page sequence="4">408 CRITICAL NOTICES: ing to this hypothesis, the ' correspondence' has to lie within human experience, if a truth-claim of the verifiable sort is in question. If truth-claims cannot be validated within such experience they re- main-merely claims, as do Dr. Schiller's own assertions about God for instance. Dr. Schiller's business in disposing of Pessimism is to account for Imperfection, Becoming and Time. Since, however, appear- ances are against us, we must push our truth-claims beyond them: the basis of inquiry being the " reality of the Self or Soul " (p. 138). Ought we not to say rather " reality of the centre of consciousness, which is called ' mine ' "? ' Self ' and ' soul ' are not, after all, such pellucidly clear concepts as to serve as the very basis of an inquiry. (Dr. Schiller's vindication of his attitude will be found on pp. 138-144.) Deduced from the reality of Self is the neces- sarily anthropomorphic character of all human feeling and thought; the essential requisite being to keep this anthropomorphism " good ". Humanism is just this "g ood " anthropomorphism:. a remark, let me note, which squares with William James's view already cited that Humanism is an attitude rather than a particular hypothesis about truth. The Naturalistic Method, as based on the lower sciences and deriving the higher from the lower, is rejected. Eke the abstrac- tionist which stands too aloof from fact. The method of Humanism is designed to avoid these mistakes. It starts from concrete human experience and feels its way from the phenomenally real, with the aid of science, to the ultimately real-to metaphysics. " The method of philosophy will utilise the results of science; meta- physical theories will be suggested by scientific researches and will approve themselves by in their turn suggesting scientific advances. Their principles of explanation will be systematically based on the sciences, and not picked up at random, and their function will be to systematise the fundamental principles of the various sciences " (p. 165). In the chapter on " The Metaphysics of Evolution " we begin to see how this method can be made to work. Metaphysics may be regarded as the " science of the borderland of knowledge; it marks the progress men have made in analysing out the assump- tions of their knowing " (p. 171). We enjoy a discussion of scien- tific Evolutionism viewed as a phase of the Historical Method, pass to the concept of a world-history with meaning, and anon to the question of the relation of higher to lower, as these show in the Time process; history not always accounting adequately for the reality which emerges in time. It is found that a naturalistic Evolutionism will not work. The lower must contain the germ of thfe higher " potentially " or the method fails (p. 194). But in any case, we may comment, the word " potentially " profits us little. Could we conceive, for instance, the 'germs' of the Critique of Pure Reason or of a motor-car. as somehow present in a nebula ? It would not suffice that we were ready to interpret all becoming on</page><page sequence="5">F. C. S. SCHILLER, Riddles of the Sphinx. 409 panpsychistic lines. A thing is " potential," I suppose, when some of the conditions of its production are present; the rest being absent and merely supplied ideally. How many " conditions " of Kant's book or of a motor-car were present in the nebula ? Arguing in this way we may have to contend, not only that evolution is psy- chical in character, but that it is creative within the time-process itself. The word ' potential' only seems to rescue us from a diffi- culty. I pass by the discussion of Aristotle's view of Svyvaus and Evepye.a in relation to Evolutionism; the question, I note, is still stub judice ! The results of the chapter are to the effect that the world-Becoming is a real process, with a beginning and end, that it makes for perfection " without any suggestion of a reversal," that the process is from potentiality to actuality, and that " hence the world possesses more actuality, more real significance and ' Being' in the later stages of the process than in the earlier ". In the Time-order the less perfect precedes. But this order reverses the true relations of things. A teleological method, accordingly, ex- plain: the earlier and lower with reference to the later and higher as relised in the world-end. This End and meaning of the process must not be divined by any exercise of abstract thought, but is to be determined from a survey of past facts in which man has cause to believe-in short from historical data. Under "Formulas of the Law of Evolution " we are invited to consider evolution as the development of individuals in association and later the end of the World-process as that of a perfect society of perfect individuals. It should be borne in mind that Dr. Schiller regards ' atoms' [or 'sub- atoms '] as merely symbols for " spiritual entities akin to ourselves " (p. 269), so that his formula of evolution cannot be rejected as insufficiently broad to cover the phenomena of Nature. 'Natural process ' is, for him, a veil which just lets us glimpse the spiritual activities behind. And there is some evidence, he thinks, to show that individual differences of character obtain even on the lowest rungs of being. "Atoms, crystals, animals, and men " are " suc- cessive embodiments of the process towards individuality " (p. 234). Evolution is interested, so to speak, in the careers of individuals and nothing else. Book iii. opens with a chapter on " Man and the World ". The survey of various uses of the word " infinity " is important, and the author offers good grounds for rejecting the belief in infinite Space and Time. Those of his critics who allow that space may be finite, but favour, withal, the infinity of time, will fare better if they get rid of the empty Time-Frame notion, and recall Mill's definition of time as 'an iniefinite succession of successions unequal in ra- pidity '. Can we not formulate a workable theQry as to how such a succession could have begun ? 1 Dr. Schiller describes time as a " Corrupti,on of Eternity, just 'as Becoming is a Cor-ruption of Being " (p. 257): Being " equable and unchanging " was the pre- 1 See my Individual and Reality, p. 272 et seq.</page><page sequence="6">410 CRITICAL NOTICES: cosmic state. "Time is but the measure of the impermanence of the imperfect, and the reason why we fail to attain to the ideal of Eternity is that we fail equally to attain to the cognate ideals of Being and Adaptation. The question therefore resolves itself into the old difficulty of why the Real is not yet adequate to the perfec- tion of our ideals. But if it could be, is it not evident that there would be an end of Time, as of Change and of Evil, and would. not Time pass into Eternity?" (pp. 257-258). Eternity, as re- instated, will be changeless activity, not a Nirvanic stagnation in which Being lapses into nothingness. The ' objective world' arises out of the interactions between God, -who is a finite personality and not yet perfect,-and the I ultimate egos,' of which we and all lower individuals, subatomic included, are the phenomenal show. These ' ultimate egos', are not occult substrata, but of one tissue with the phenomenal 'selves' (pp. 259 et seq.). According to this Pluralism, the so-called ' objective world' exists incoherently in fragments in innumerable discrete egos. Neither God (who is really only the most potent of the egos) nor the other egos can hold it in a complete form. Even God can hold no more than what the Egos' actions add to His original -spiritual contents. Again, the Egos, just because they help to produce Nature-or rather the many Natures, since there is no common one-cannot also arise out of it in time. Nature does not, swing clear of the finite percipients. It is thus no objective ideal- ism which the author proffers us. Nay, his worlds are in truth but dreamlike shows. "Philosophy has answered the taunt that truth is a dream and God a hallucination by gathering truth from dreams and by tracing the methods of God's working through hallucinations" (p. 282)-the ' objective world' is, in fine, hallu- cinatory, " subjective in its mode of genesis ". It is difficult to see! how, on such lines, one can begin to rethink metaphysically the time and space arrangements presupposed by biology, geology and a-stron6my. God is only an Ego among egos; all these being pluralistic ulti- mates. True, Pluralism is said (p. 344) to be "in a way based on a monism," but this tie " is the most meaningless of all things; it is a mere possibility of the interaction or co-existence of the many ". " If each of the many individual existences had never actually achieved interaction with the others, no world would have existed.'" But it is the achievemenf of this interaction that remains the puzzle. Dr. Schiller cannot regard God and the other Egos as so many centres of conscious activity in a common psychical Ground. This resource might prove useful indeed. But clearly with the elimina- tion of the irreducible ultimate Egos or I monads' Pluralism ex- pires. If, however, there be no common Ground, how did God begin to take cognisance of the, alien Egos ? By what miracle of knowledge did He surmise anything about them before looking for</page><page sequence="7">F. C. S. SCHILLER, Riddles of the Sphinx. 411 them ? By what trick of telepathy across the void did He signify His existence and show that He meant to rule? Or was it the Egos, who by some unintelligible freak of chance, thrust the first notifications of their reality on His startled mind? Even then why should He take strange appearances arising within Himself as marks of alien activities and not as the creation of His own ulti- mate ego? And how could He re-act on and dominate the multi- tudinous hordes who were raining appulses on Him from the dark? The personality of this God suggests a quaint reflexion. What a weird stroke of chance that this particular ' Ego' should be Divine by right of birth, while the other and dominated ' egos' fall, as strugglers of small account, between the millstones of the cosmic process. I note, however, that belief in " the unity of the divine person " is not a matter of principle (p. 361). We are allowed to hold that God is three or even to moot the hypothesis of a " heavenly democracy "-what I have discussed elsewhere as the " supreme society ". But the issue is dismissed, perhaps too im- patiently, as of " no human importance ". Surely all issues which cause mental unrest are of importance. It must be admitted, however, that the breaking out of a further Pluralism within Dr. Schiller's God might add seriously to our intellectual anxieties ! This God is inferred from such facts of the world as are sugges- tive of superhuman Design. Let us concede that marks of such design are to be met with in Nature and History. Is this design necessarily that of Dr. Schiller's god? Much of the design seems hardly such as to warrant inference to a supremely wise and moral person. Further, one is bound to allow that a hierarchy of super- human beings may lie between us and the supreme conscious agency in the Universe. And only " Providences " of minor sorts may be concerned with this planet. Anvhow it seems venture- some to infer a supremely wise and moral God from the ' design' alleged to show in connexion with this planet-so many failures, perverse growths and even abominations have to be reckoned with. Even Dr. Schiller himself, I understand, does not think that the puzzles of pessimism, as indicated in his fourth chapter, are fully dealt with in the later and constructive portion of the book. True; he offers a vastly better vindication of reality than does, say, ilegel, or T. H. Green, but he leaves, withal, many difficulties of no trifling moment on our hands. William James, in discussing Fechner in "4A Pluralistic Uni- verse," contends that there is room for a long hierarchy of super- human beings. If this be the case, polytheism rather tbani theism may be mooted when marks of design are to be accounted for. And there would be no call to suppose that all these minor gods are so wise and moral and powerful as to transcend our human powers of conception. Contrariwise, many of them (whether originally of human derivation or not), may not be more superior to us than we are, say, to the lower animals. Incidentally I note</page><page sequence="8">412 CRITICAL NOTICES: that there is much in our planet's story, biologic and other, which suggests experiment rather than an assured wisdom working out a prepared plan. Such facts as the evolution of Dinosaurs and of the defective and barely satisfactory human body suggest the modi- fying design of imperfect minor gods rather than that of a supreme power. Dr. Schiller regards the Immortality-issue as of the greatest importance. The metaphysical basis for the belief he finds in the uncreated, uncaused plural ' Egos' whose conscious manifestations show as ourselves. There are, he urges, degrees, of immortality. The lowest forms of spiritual existence, e.g., the amceba or embryo show too little and too poor content to feed a rich memory and, failing memory, persistence would, of course, be a farce. " On the other hand, we need not hesitate to attribute to the faithful dog . . . at- least as much immortality as to the brutal savage, whose life has been ennobled by no high thoughts and redeemed by no elevating feeling." Dr. Schiller sees no reason why a " single ego should not pass through the succession of organisms and develop- ments of consciousness from the amceba to man, and from man to perfection " (p. 388). He is, indeed, practically a believer in the doc- trine of the evolution of the individual through a plurality of lives, -though all these lives need not, in his view, be terrestrial ones. Farther on (p. 396) there is a luminous discussion of Heredity considered in connexion with this hypothesis of pre-existence and successive lives. Later in considering the metaphysics of the higher sexual love, he observes that " possibly this emotional im- pulse foreshadows the formation of coalesced existences of a higher order than our present partial and imperfect selves" (p. 407). A suggestion, like so many in this work, of great worth. May I suggest that the supreme finite god in whom Dr. Schiller believes, may be a " coalesced existence," a spiritual society, of this kind and not a private "personality," "which would necessarily be too partial and imperfect, at all? Do we really desire to believe in a person who, by some arbitrary chance, is the unchangeable superior of all other conscious beings throughout the entire time-process and even beyond it?' The final goal of evolution is discussed in the " Conclusion ". It is a perfect society of perfect individuals in which the four great ideals of knowledge, beautv, goodness and happiness are to be realised in a unity at once fusing and transcending them. It is to be a changeless state of equipoise and attainment. Shall I break on the sense of peace which is produced by this chapter by suggesting that we cannot well believe that the Universe is to show only one great Evolution-Era or Time-Process? The prospect of innumer- able Days and Nights of Brahma may terrify, but are there not fairly substantial grounds for' believing in them?I It may seem hard to " turn out" again after a Night of changeless peace, but 'Individual and ReaUty, p. 270.</page><page sequence="9">ALFRED SIDGWICK, The Application of Logic. 413 even the fruition of an Evolution-Era, supervening, as it is said to do, on finite antecedents, can well be conceived to be of finite duration. The Ground, or as I should prefer to put it, the COSMIC IMAGINATION, with the ' centres' of spiritual activity immanent in it, has to begin to change once more, remoulding reality on the lines of yet loftier creation. Its power to construct is not ended once and for all by its passage into the static phase. Three excellent chapters on " Free Will and Necessity,'&gt; "Choice" and "Science and Religion" conclude the volume. I will not dwell on their contents, as this notice is already drawing out to an inordinate length, but they will well repay close attention. To conclude: The Riddles, while eminently suggestive and, at first sight, extremely venturesome in scope is really averse from dogma. The author, indeed, considers metaphysical speculation very risky and is fully aware that his bolder statements are truth- claims rather than truths. "The value even of the constructions lies largely in the criticisms of other views which they imply." But it is much to have broken new ground and to have taken theoreti- cal risks which more conservative and less iinspiring writers prefer to shun. It is necessary for some one to try his luck in paths where angels and even Hegelians fear to tread. The Riddles of the Sphinx has done all that its author had hoped of it. It has forced the conventional dry-as-dust philosopher to realise the way in which he must face the problems set by life, not giving us a stone where we need bread and not imagining that he will be allowed to substitute concept-play for investigations which ought to concern, above all else, the standing and the probable expectations of the Individual.
