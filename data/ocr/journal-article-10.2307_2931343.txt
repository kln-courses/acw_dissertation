<plain_text><page sequence="1">An Avalanche of Creation* By Leon Forrest Now as I pulled into the driveway of Rev. Roper's home (a surprise slab of archi- tecture in this rather poor section of town and done in a mock style of a Frank Lloyd Wright design), I found the porch light was on, quite bright and somehow inviting. My assignment from Aunt Eloise was to find out what I could about the reasons for the revival at Rev. Roper's church. Perhaps to plumb the depths of why he felt his church needed one? But now as I tapped the bell three times, I found something else taking over my mind and soul. I wanted to find out not only why he felt the church needed a revival. But what made Rev. Roper think he was called to preach in the first place. I had been reading about Rev. Maurice Roper for years. His career, off and on, the stage of his church-SOUL OF ZION TABERNACLE-had provided many salty stories of awe, wonder, and dread in the news section of the Forest County Dispatch, and in particular, Aunt Eloise's column. Somehow the physicality of this house lent something to my shifting mind, my stirring spirit. What was it? And then the thought occurred to me that in my wan- derings, I had come across the place where underground movies and experimental films are shown to either members of a secret art society, or their friends. Suddenly I was greeted by the owner, just as I expected to see the door of the minister's house leap open, I heard his grave voice before I saw his face; I was astonished, but there he was alright coming from around the side of the house. His offstage voice for greet- ing startled me. He had a shovel in his hand. He had been shovelling off the last layers of ice from the gang-way in back of the grayish blue house. The alarm in his voice: "Oh it's you. Mister Joubert. Mister Jones," made me feel just then as if I were an intruder, a peace disturber, even a robber of his rest. I immediately recognized the small, well-built, medium-dark-brown-skinned min- ister from his pictures over the years in the Forest County Dispatch. His earthly figure so compact; yet his life so outlandish, intriguing, and often audacious. We sat in the front room, where I conducted my interview with the minister over cups of hot, lemon-minted tea. After sharing two pitchers of beer with Beefeater, I was glad to drink the head-clearing tea. For some reason I don't handle beer as well as I take to alcohol, mainly bourbon or scotch. I have absolutely no palate for gin. And don't serve me two Vodka Martinis, I get killer keen and heartless evil. At one point in our interview-as I found myself more than zealous in trying to discover how much you could trust those moments of spiritual ecstasy to stick to the soul-Rev. Roper addressed the problem of how "high blood pressure" had forced From Work-in-Progress. Callaloo 13 (1990) 703-726</page><page sequence="2">CALLALOO him "to lay low," but that he hoped to return to church services on Sunday; and that the revival, scheduled for the coming week, would "inspire my faith and melt down my high zoning pressure," which, when you think about it presented a wonderously strange paradox, given the furious emotions expressed at these revivals. I allowed my questions to take a more general frame of reference concerning bio- graphical data before I attempted again to generate the sources of my deeper inter- ests-past the revival to the heart of his soul. Finally I threw away my notes, and I put it this way: "Rev. Roper, whether you are talking about the moment of personal ecstasy, in which individual members of the faithful might act out like an ancient dervish, or the spiritual calling to lead God's flock, how substantial is the glow? How long lasting the halo?" Now my question appeared to take his breath away. He swallowed deeply of the soupy tea in his mouth. Then he just shook his fine, small, and well-shaped head, as if the question had not centered down enough. Was it still too obtuse? Too arrogantly and cockily stated, probably. I was immediately peeved at myself. Impishness of it, and yet. Then I started all over again. " . .. What I also mean by asking. Meant by asking this sir is . . . put in another way. How did you know when you were called-to preach?" As soon as this question was out of my mouth, I thought: Is this too intimate? Didn't I ask two questions? Has our dialogue gone far enough to arrive at this most personal question? I was worried as well about those darn voices, which often take me over during an interview and pound home an aggressiveness of ideas, far beyond my nat- ural, more conservative mode of inquiry. Lord, I sure hope old Connie Dixon Rivers doesn't decide to walk the waters of my riddled soul, this evening ... To tap my soul to a heel-bone beat. ". . . Let me ask you something personal Mister Jones. Did you ever have a situation where you, as a youngster, were brought into a scene not prepared for in your daily experiences? Yet not totally uncommon to some vague prior memories? It threatens to celebrate you and send you off like an old, soul-sweet song, at first that is. Then it warbles about to charge you up, even as it warns you. It would washes you over, and scrub you down, even as it rinses you out and hangs you up to dry-out. It forecast a sweetening to the palate and beefsteaks aplenty for the spirit. Takes you back to your first youth. Rattles your bones. Rocks your soul from the bosom of Abraham to the final gathering at the clearing. Skins you down to the skeleton pit of existence." I shook my head in quasi-understanding and partial confusion. " . . . Then plague-take it if it don't arm you and disarm you and soon you abandon the scene. As if you were abandoned by faith. Because too much of the gathering up is based on the old-time-pitched-tent of hallow-used-to-be forgetfulness. And yet with all of your collectible heart, you hunger to return to some parts of it soon enough, that is. Ah but then, you're probably one of those intellectual types." This last phrase drove me, like a stake to the heart. "Rev. Roper, are you referring to the idea of ... The concept of our common at- traction for greener pastures of the collective memory, on the other side?" 704</page><page sequence="3">L CALLALOO _ Ha! Somewhat. But where this'll all lead will be anyplace but the insurance company-on the other side of paradise. For it's boredom with the living delights of the immediate present of the first adventure that beckons you, allows you . . . Hell- fire, even prods and goads you to be opened to this misadventure.... Yet boredom ain't quite the proper word for it, because there is plenty to call you home to give consolation to your palate-and treasury in your memory bank." I was in the tunnel of darkness somewhat. He took a deep sigh, and then a deeper breath, as a famous swimmer preparing to launch an intriguing series of motions of his soul in space-vaulting from the spring- board. "/ ... Mister Joubert Jones, I don't know if you've ever been called away from home to a huge picnic ground, way out in the Forest Preserves. Meeting up with people you haven't met before. Kinfolks, kissing cousins and those you might fear to embrace. Call it a family reunion, if you want to. Out of the clearing and into the great-gathering up. Plenty of games abound. Food to stuff the body to bursting of the soul: a bulge blaring with too many popping cork notes circulating through your horn of plenty. But soon you grow sick of it all, because there is the treasure hunt side of the soul that seeks out leisure-in-treasure, especially if its buried, and the treasured side of the soul that seeks out buried skeletons of the past; and the more dangerous the adventure, the more treasured the experience. Our eternal love for playing hide-and-go-seek, no matter the cost." "Do you mean Rev. Roper that if it weren't for taboos, there would be absolutely no news?" He started laughing. "/ ... Well, something like that, yes." he said. (I immediately recalled one of several scandalous intrusions upon his part, when he entered the church at a wedding, not bringing wine, but a cache of watermelons from the vine for the unwashed multitude.) Now Rev. Maurice Roper started the pot boiling all over again. " . .. Seems like there is a furious forest of runaway children, babbling, yelling, screaming and abounding in handstands and cartwheels; playing jacks, or skipping rope, double-dutch and triple-dutch; bulging and baying; boxing and socking, and apple-throwing; and the boys goosing the gammy gals; wrestling and running races; ear-pulling and bear-hugging and romping and climbing trees and pulling branches and boughs down to hobby-horse ride like Silver, or Whirl-A-Way, or get 'em Scout; hiding and seeking; little kids getting into the jam and stealing the jelly; others, shoot- ing off cap-pistols and making old maid aunts' feathers leap by setting up bulls-eye marks too close to the aunts' card tables, laden down with bountiful bowls of home- made potato salad. Mister Jones, these here young-uns and youths I'm mustering up from my memory vault ain't exactly the kind to play musical chairs, Old Maid, or monopoly in the delicate dust. And then a shrill chorus of teen-age girls jelly-shaking the atmosphere with up-to-date, out-of-tune songs; gossips up to a pitchfork of hot- dogs about the latest gorgeous guys on the loose; and their sassy-stalking older sisters in pants and jeans so tight, if they breathe too hard they'll die of heartache; and if you look too keen at them backfields in motion, you'll lose your place somewhere 'tween Genesis and Revelations, and you'll never look back to the higher angels, so busy 705</page><page sequence="4">CALLALOO going bug-eyes over the angels before you. And flocks of everybody's kids under- cutting your ground, underfoot, at elbow, streaming out of the pockets of the hide- and-seek woods of the forest preserves; up and coming and frothy-mouthed, and sassy-assed full-fledged truants; filling the air with zipping balls; or the lark of their breath, or the presence of their shrill-climbing laughter, into everything-everywhere. Now you talking about whirling dervishes fitful as the songs of pin-pricked balloons, exploding like autos backfiring on a summer's night and you immediately think some- body's pulled a rod, or rioting in ripe red blood. Frankie and Johnnie style. And tottlers rocking back and forth in attempts to move from crawling to walking, and moving side to swaying side, like they going to tip over-they keep on coming. Mister Jones, it's like a swirling fountain of pulp and seeds- this avalanche of creation-bubbling and stirring up, raw but ripe-tongued, and rising to the top in the attention-com- manding manner of a wild, heady-flush, home-made juice, brewed up by the lights of some elderberry uncle's historical recreation. And all you can say, or we uncles and aunts can dream up to say, in reflecting mirrors of time is: well summer may be winding down, but them child-rens, Lawd today, why they ain't heard the news. "/ ... Then Mister Jones, there's always one of those pickle-headed intellectual kinds of kids, who always gets things ass-backwards from Jump Street. Tripping over their feet, and showing their book learning by holding their books upside down. You ever know'd the kind?" " ... Oh sure, Rev. Roper," I said; but I could see he was trying to test me. Then I declared: " . . . Satchels of sad-sacks, bursting with toys, bad apples, racked specs, sour grapes, in bunches; library books; tins of worms, and not for the baiting of fast fish- erman's lines to Jesus, either; marmalade glass bottles, stalked with blades of grass and topped with a lid where there are twelve ice-pick-prick points in it, for the ven- tilation of the seven, yet breathing, stowed away grasshoppers, who are spitting to- bacco and batting their wings against the glass, crazy to fly out. And even these two or three scholar lads are always stumbling forth and falling down out of tune and rhythm and if they aren't flipping themselves down, because they have yet to learn proper posture of carrying twelve library books, while chewing bubble gum, and eye- ing the girls, then for sure, they are being tripped up by the picnic ground court jester fool clown, known for his imitation of every bad thing imaginable under the sun, and particularly, beneath the moon. Destroying well plotted and beautifully arranged fruit bowls by stealing and juggling the peaches and apples and pears, to the delight of the twins, and the tottlers, because of some damn frolicking voice inside his watermelon of a head to do a somersault against society and shock the eyeballs out of civility; and driven to pay homage to pranks, just like they were prayers. These jesters, Rev. Roper, were dropouts by Easter time, in the Kindergarten. "That kind of boy (who even brings his books to say nothing of his homework not only to the picnic but to a family reunion) is often enough called Foggy-Butt-the lap- legged Frog, for starters, and invariably is brought low, as if it were his fate, by that jester, the prank-master, the trickster." "Mister Jones, you got him plain and simple." " . .. I'm telling you Rev. Roper, why sir, have you ever heard tell of a greasy- 706</page><page sequence="5">L___ _ __ _CALLALOO mouthed fox burying his grandmother under a heap of hollybush? Then disturbing one of those Jack-Jimmy-Jump-Long-Horn trickster dudes in the bushes, who's a nat- ural born truant who's always getting hookie and nookie all mixed up intentionally and rhymed out of time, in time . .. in his prime and praying to Heaven it ain't her time? Because you see, our scholar lad beat the fox and the jester-jimmy there to the good quiet, hidden spot, in order to spoon-away over the vegetables of his vocabulary and to discourse with his volumes, and play with his vowel sounds." "You got 'em coming and going," Rev. Roper said. We were both laughing now. " . . . But now Mister Jones, just as this whole crop of wild corn kids, rambling rods and romping jacks, and stuttering young studs, and big-butt Jills and shamelessly spoiled snotty-nosed former tottlers of three-year-old terrors are about to take over, we all suddenly hear this blues-wailing voice, coming up from the clearing (sounding like he's related to Howling Wolf) and a guitar twanging gutsy Saturday low-down sound of absolute fish-fry devilment and hoe-cake wonderment, honed and harmo- nized from the old cotton pickin' country. Shifting back and forth between minting rowdy miracles with his voice, then going for bad on his mouth harp; now pickin' for broke on his guitar. And you don't know what the devil he isn't playing out (but you sure 'nough know it ain't related to kneeling down for a long spell at a prayer meeting) not only because you're a bonified-born-black Yankee, but because the music is spirit moving Bad, and dangerous, as all get-out and get-down, so that you can't study for steady moving your feet, your hips, your back-bone, your elbows (yes and turning them into flapping wings), your toe-tap-bone, your one-butt shuffle; even your collar- bone juts up jamming. And that's when you get to wishing your natural daddy had been a gandy-dancer instead of a reconverted deacon. ". . . And finally, out of the dusk-darkness, the musician's sweat-lathered, medium- dark-brown mahogany face emerges.... Why if it isn't the voice, then the rolling stroll; now the reeling and rocking stride of your father's third cousins' grand-uncle, Daddy-Long-Legs Hopkins (let's call him that for short). Of course you've never met this cousin, nor this musician uncle before, until three hours ago, when you and twenty-one other cousins met the Hopkins' branch at the Union Station (and the train was late) but you could smell their presence before their actual arrival, when the heav- ing and huffing, smoking train finally pulled in, because they had one-hundred and one picnic baskets, bread-baskets, satchels, cotton sacks, and aged brown bags of golden fried chicken and potato-salad and home-made cakes, not only because, and for the picnic and the reunion, but in case the train broke down, or was derailed ... which given the extra luggage on this train.... Well, you see what I mean." Rev. Roper's description reminded me of cousins, bent on driving back to the old country, who always stacked their greased-down and gassed up autos to the quick, with every kind of gear, food stuff, and extra special particular tank of water, lest old Betsy break-down on the wrong side of town. " . . . I'm telling you Mister Jones, when the train finally pulled in three hours and thirty-three minutes late, to be exact, and kin commenced drifting out of the cars and coaches, you thought, well now, no wonder. It probably took them three hours to board up this harvest on the train. Or, given all the preachers, choirs, and hummingbirds 707</page><page sequence="6">CALLALOO for Jesus on this train, they probably thought they'd better store up for the duration, or even the Second Coming. For if the train stopped on the other side of Paradise and there was what one might call a log-jam to Jesus and the great welcoming banquet table, then they sure wouldn't have to worry none about exactly when the honey and milk would get passed on down the line. " ... Mister Jones, what I'm trying to get at is: this was the way you almost met up with Uncle Hopkins. Now the way you were introduced to his presence was some- thing else again. 'Cause you see him and his caravan of kin came down off the platform from the last of the coaches for travellers; and they were toting, best word on the planet for it. Toting a huge tub, three on one side and three on the other. It's the kind some Southern folks grows up flowers and plants in after the white folks throws the tub out; going from Sears-Roebuck to General Marshall Fields, you might say. (But you don't know all this at the time.) They moving out with the seriousness of pallbearers (this last two-time trio, among whom is this Uncle Hopkins, with a guitar strolled 'cross his left shoulder blade) carrying the body of a state official to the cemetery. All that's missing is white gloves and you thinking my Lord did some distant, fossil of a relative wither up and quicken, coming up from Greenville, to Memphis to Forest County, because of high blood pressure? When all of a sudden it occurs to you that. .. why no, that can't be a human-being person in there. Why the covered up spectacle isn't long enough. Nor, can it be a babe, because you would have heard of its death through the grape- vine. When suddenly you are informed, through a whispered word of glee, exactly what these kin are carrying with such dignity and gentleness. It's a wonderous hog in there, who, after all is next to the gospel bird for his appeal to the appetite; yea though he be foul to look upon as Satan up a tree; and more careless about his eating habits, in real life, than a hillside of goats. But when you hear tell what's inside you realize why everything is smelling so triumphant. Tub of a pig. Apple in his mouth. Stenching up so good in your imagination, you've forgotten all about potato salad, yams, butter-drenched corn on a cob, and even lemon-creme pies. And that's when it occurs to you, no these kinfolks must be from Foots, Mississippi, not Greenville. Greenvillians would never carry a hog in a tub on a train. ". . . But just now old Daddy-Long-Legs Hopkins, descends into some old down home mess, wrought up North, near Forest County, at the border line of creation in the modern world and before anybody can call a halt, or call him a long-legged grass- hopper of a leaping liar . . . or bring the living to order . . . or take roll call of the begetting here and now (or quietly account for the misbegotten) well then, Lawd to- day, if Daddy Long-Legs ain't pitching his voice to the very walls of Jericho and mak- ing the Venetian blinds hanging down the windows of the serving bus quake with his wall wailing: I'm gonna tell you something, Baby, when I move 'way from here, I don't want no iceman-gonna buy you a frigidaire, When I move way on the outskirts of town, 'Cause I don't want nobody. . . whoooo. . . who's Always hangin' around. 708</page><page sequence="7">_ _ _ CALLALOO "And then if that isn't strong enough, he rolls a-way-sway-back with: I'm gonna start to burn gas, baby, I ain't gonna burn no more coal, I'm getting tired of that old coal man dipping down into my sugar bowl. "...Then Mister Jones, he just lets all that work on 'em for about ten seconds, stir up the dripping pulp of hip-bone moving creation, you might not say. Now Daddy Long-Legs sets that mouth harp to his lips, blowing, wailing, screaming, soaring, winging, slipping, tipping; laying in the cut, without chasing his breath, like you blow- ing on a hot soup, but not to cool it down too much; signifying down deeper where he dare not testify with his long-tongue, upon this occasion. Meantime his right hand starts talking back out of the trapped fox-lover's grieving and greasy and trembling voice-box, begging for forgiveness." I started to laugh. "But now Mister Jones, if that isn't bad enough, soon Daddy Long-Legs Hopkins lets his eyes roam around the campgrounds and survey the rainbow colors of our curious nation of folks, he then wails with a preacher-serious warning, just before he reaches up on high to the sweet part of his sermon; letting neither guitar, nor mouth- harp speak: Now it may seem funny, baby, funny as it can be, If we have any children, all of 'em better look just like me, When we move. . . way on the outskirts of town. I don't want nobody, whooo-whooo ... always hangin' round. .... Mister Jones, he now lets that old guitar, just copped out of the hock house, re-create the mystifying, spine-bounding long-song sounds; sabbath seasoned, and all mixed up with mountain-jack cries from the denied-heart." Now we were both cracking up and I was thinking, this is going to be an enjoyable interview. And that was when Rev. Roper said in the most proper, and dignified voice. " . . . Mister Jones, can I offer you a refill of lemon-minted in your tea cup? It won't take but a moment to set the tea-pot a-boiling." "Oh thank you sir," I said, handing him my tea cup. Rev. Maurice Roper went off quickly and quietly, into the kitchen. This Rev. Roper was different from a lot of preachers, he didn't have any problems seeing the sacred and the profane as blasting from the same backbone base of the human condition. He didn't have any problems officiating at the marriage of the sa- cred and the profane, and he seemed to see the attributes as the proper mix, base, pulp, and substance of the human agony. But what was he setting me up for? Was he a clever alchemist-only profane so that he might make the sacred even more awe- some. I didn't want simple, emotional responses to the question of ecstasy and the spiritual moment-I wanted much much more. ... And yet I heard the blend of the spiritual and the base, subsumed and reinvented in Ray 709</page><page sequence="8">L___ ___ ___CALLALOO Charles; Mahalia, too. I thought of Ray Charles re-threading the eye of the needle of gospel sound, with the course catgut line of the Blues from the belly of the wail. All other music seemed under-nourished to me, just now. It made me think of Rev. Wilbur "Spiffy" Lumpkins, who worked as a redcap for years to support his family, while he slowly and steadily built up his congregation on the weekends, from twenty-one souls to where he now claimed a membership of one hundred twenty tithing hardies. Why his storefront church, Rock of Pisgah's Mountain, had recently moved into the long abandoned Joe Louis Theatre on the South Side. But the Rev. Wilbur Lumpkins (he was known in Williemain's Barbershop and elsewhere as Spiffy because of his natty dress) loved to bring his experience from his track-lining days home to his homilies in the barbershop of Williemain (and if they were not too rowdy) into his pulpit. A tall, lean, ramrod figure, jet black in complexion with a snow- cap of white woolly hair, which he wore down to his shoulders. Born 1886 (now he was eighty), I could easily hear that wonderfully brewed, deep based, whiskeyed- soothed voice of his wailing out of its crying and then winging to a branch of sweetness at the higher registers. Moses stood on the Red Shor'. Smotin' that water with a two-by-four. Oh boys, can't you line-her? If I could I surely would Stand on the rock where Moses stood. Then soon Rev. Lumpkins turned all of that around on we derailed souls: lining up our faith on the track of the gospel train in order to climb that mountain, but only as option, if you wanted it and could handle it. Now. Rev. Maurice Roper placed a cup of finely-minted lemon tea before me; then he returned to his seat, and cleared his throat. When the words of his lips-conveyed with a delightfully modulated, high tenor-poured forth at a steady stream, I knew immediately that his mood had shifted, if not changed. The continuity was there. Had he brooded over his conversation, while away brewing up the lemon-minted tea? "/ ... Seems like there is a furious forest of children abounding. Like a heap of seeds and pulp rising to the top of a homemade-heady juice attuned to the gabble of the rising voices. But in another way it's all too much to bear, even as the witnessing up of it all is fun. So, you slip off from the general bedlam, actually out of the sheer boredom of the predictable, yea though it be way beyond the ordinary, if you know what I mean . . . off with a select section of the kin-gang, and kissing cousins, onto the side of the house, and then you talk yourself into going beneath the house, where the old folks told you not to go underneath there. I-double-dared you to destruction and tarnation. Told you point blank that the whole house would come tumbling down on your natural head, if you even came too close to the house. And of course you went under that old house, as if their charge not to go there was the 11th Command- ment. Because the house, itself, is reputed to be over one hundred and ten years old, and taking you back to slavery times. And it's hard to remember whether you were talked into going beneath the house by one of your cousins, or if you talked the half- a-dozen or so fellow youngbloods to join you there. But anyway, there you are.... 710</page><page sequence="9">___ ___ ___ CALLALOO And, there you bes. Soon you hear the old Uncle Hopkins put away his singing and playing and as you duck underneath the old house, you see him head off into the woods with a plate of fried chicken, and a young lady at his side. " . .. It's around 7:00 in the evening and dust dark beneath the roaming world of this old house, spread out over fifty feet in each direction. Six guys and one tomgirl; and off you go. "/ ... Then one of your number, quite familiar with the scene and the gossip about it, charges the group with the idea of a buried treasure hunt, right beneath this old wooden house, overlooked by the ancient spirit of a dead man, who comes out of the ground each night to do a little care-taking of the house and then returns at dawn to sleep off his experiences above ground. This leader cousin of yours is trying to find the cracked places in the ground where the dead man's body and spirit have arisen and returned time and time again. And so, off you all go scurrying, sliding, weaving, squat-walking, crawling, trembling, hunting, charting, trying to draw some sign upon the darkened floor beneath the building ... and it's too dark to see the light, when- of-a-sudden, one of the wise-cracking cousins takes a flashlight from his back pocket to aid in finding the crackling spot upon the floor of this earth, exactly where this ancient spirit of the dead man's body and soul reappears each night to do a little care- taking of the premises and then fades back at dawn into this very spot (almost like a trap door in time and space) where the deceased one has arisen and returned, time and time again. " . .. And so, off you all go scurrying, sliding, slipping, tipping-goose-walking, squat-stalking, crawling; trembling in your boots (in case); and generally messing up even your romp play picknicking clothes so bad that no doubt the most active hands of Mama or Auntie at the soapy washboard rubbing and scrubbing these dungarees with a bar of Mule Team Borax, while dosing them in a lava hot pool of blue-steaming water in one of those big old tin battered tubs, stirred with a half-a-cup of the Gold Dust Twins, plus Duz does everything, and a double-shot glass of coal oil-all that can't and wouldn't save the soul of their dirty despair and ruination. Even as these dangling dungarees will probably have the power to stand alone without the presence of a visible body in their boy-bad-glory before the whirlpool of water and in and out of the tub. And yet, Mister Jones, what do you, or I for that matter, really care, for if a boy can't get dirty and get his clothes filthy-McNasty, then he might as well not be made of a pail of snails and puppy dog tails." Despite my intrigue for his story (whatever happened to my question?) Rev. Roper gave new definition to beating around the bush and going around Robin Hood's barn; and yet I found myself caught up in his story, and I said: "So you hunt about that land spread beneath the house for a rag to wipe your dirty face-in a foolish way, reflex action-because you've got to know that any rag found down there has to be dirtier than filth, and older than rain water. Then you think wouldn't it be foxy and wonderful if your face was not dirty, but greasy as a frying pan sopped in melting fat because you've eaten too many chicken breasts and thighs, or polished off too many barbeque bones. And wouldn't it be fine to have one of those ears mopped in butter just now. Let my face be greasy with that corn on the cob." "Yes that's right, now you humming. And if we don't hurry up and find us a huge 711</page><page sequence="10">L___ _ __ _CALLALOO footprint, or a chart in the earth, then we'll just have to fly back out there in a big fat hurry. " . . Soon enough you can't even recognize your first cousins, nor they you-to say nothing of those recently met, distant darlings down at the Union Station. Three of you are making mudpies from where dirt clods and rain water lay, as brief lagoon murky pools; while another faction is tracing and re-tracing certain crackling patterns, hoping to find the actual trap door outline the swollen dirt has assumed, and scared as hell if they do find a pattern. And that's when one of your number, Higginson, produces a mirror, which is about as violent as pulling a razor when everybody is simply playing at the game of signifying. Everybody in their right mind surely does not want the game to go to violence; let's keep a cap on it through signifying, even the Dozens can still chill-out a razor. Don't trouble this secret; let the mystery remain history. But if anybody, especially adults, thinks they can pull you away from this adventure with some predictable games of apple-bobbing, baseball, or tossing horse shoes, then they can go fly a kite." "/ ... Rev. Roper, you are referring to a determination to make this event the most ever, because there will always be horse shoes, rib-roasts, and girls to go chasing after down into the woods. But to move past the formula of action, for the sheer fun of discovery of real danger. Ah now if you can only stop your nervous heart from threat- ening to leap out of your chest." I had Rev. Roper rollicking. "/ ... Why Rev. Roper, not even a chance at tug-of-war?" I offered. "No, Mister Jones, not even that most manly of games-tug of war. " . . . And so the adults are off on the other side, and out back, finishing their barbeque and potato salad; some have tied into the peach cobblers, and the blueberry pies; and Lord, Lawd even unto the very nearly sacred apple pan dowdy, which would tempt Lucifer to learning righteousness; come down out that tree and leave God's apples all alone. Other kin folks are drinking their lemonade; some of the staunch old travellers are handling their bourbon, scotch, or beer, with a steady hand. You hear the sweet bye-and-bye voices of the aunts; and the hard-thump clank of the horse shoes against the stakes, and the hardy-belly laughs of failed chances, spiralling off at pot-luck angles; then the sudden crack of a Louisville Slugger against the rawhide of a baseball; and the young gals screaming after getting goosed-and liking it; then ducking off into the woods with their beaus. Now you start to get nervous all over, from the spine to the nape of your neck, when it sounds as if some parents' voices commenced going round, taking names of the absent and those who have been found and saved from the rod. " . . . Soon it's getting late, beneath this house it's twice as dark as expected. Here fifteen minutes of darkness has descended thirteen times faster than the shadow of a blackbird. Darkness comes after you left-right-and-side-ways like sidewinders' fu- neralizing time; and the voices of the kin grow faint as old men wheezing away before chess games, as they nod off backwards into the cradle of descending night. The only light that's around is the beam from this fool's flashlight, which he keeps playing with, even though the battery is dim and the light from the edges of the house doesn't help too much. And Seltzer and Cousin Higginson start to playing the light of the flashlight 712</page><page sequence="11">CALLALOO off the face of the hand mirror like they trying to stir up, or catch the soul of this underground ghost." "Rev. Roper, perhaps they've heard as how the natives of another world believed that mirrors steal souls. And you don't have to be an American to fall to love with your own image. So maybe, just may-be the boys hope to capture the soul of the dead man in that hand mirror." Then I noticed he seemed to rustle about in his seat, like a small boy wanting to go off to the toilet. I wondered if he was getting slightly pissed at my intrusion into his story from this angle of vision. On the other hand I hoped he wasn't going to use the mirror and the flashlight as a tool to craft a sermon on the Lighthouse to the Soul. Soon he was excusing himself to go off to the bathroom. "Old man's weak bladder," and all that jive. But you just never knew about preachers, most of 'em anyway. With God, you did have options. A preacher like Rev. Roper-or take C. Bostic Boddie, who just might craft up a sermon out of a handful of dust. Standing as he did so close to the throne, thinking as how he caught God's cold, when the Almighty sneezed; then preaching to you about the feverish condition of man's sweat- lathered temple over time, down the crackling corridors of space. This all reminded me of that time I went through the bends of a mysterious form of food allergies. During this period, everything imaginable to eat rendered me more broken out all over than a walking bushel barrel of strawberries-head to toe. I was a horror-streaked bad humor man, with a body not worthy to enter, forevermore, the freak-side-show circus tent, and naked to the bone. Why the mere consumption of a handful of Dr. Carver's lowly peanuts would vault my body into a montage of red splattered pinkish-yellow-brown strawberry splotches and bumps. I discovered myself scratching everywhere and anywhere, anytime, and itching in the most intimate places during the most embarrassing time. I could not sleep with normal repose and slumber without scratching myself to death, virtually. I began to think, though laughingly so, that I was itching, if not inch- ing my way to an early grave. Much of the time, however, I seemed to be clawing into my skin, ferociously. Aunt Eloise even suggested that I wear gloves to bed. To calm this tendency down, I started cutting my nails, down to the quick. The momentary stroke of relief came through ice-cold showers, and an occasional, though ill-advised steroid pill, which when consumed at nightfall, would render my body cleaned-up from head to toe, the next morning. I came to call that pill my "menacing miracle" of relief. I was given to a not too gradual weight loss over time; I seemed to be scraping away on a declining economy of bag-of-bones. No, it was not funny. But my humor and my spirits remained high; around Christmas time of that year, my physician secured a bed for me in the local hospital, though he had some difficulty getting me in; for in point of fact, my doctor and other medics were completely unable to diagnosis the specifics of what ailed me; other than to reveal, what I already knew, that some of my malady stemmed from an onslaught, over time, of consuming too many tomato-based foods. What of peanuts, wheat germ, etc. I asked. They were silent as death. In all other ways, I appeared as solid and sound as one might hope for a young man who is losing his body, if not his soul. Yet, weight lost served to inspire several compli- mentary looks from lovely ladies. The shedding of some twenty-five body pounds, 713</page><page sequence="12">CALLALOO spread over time, made me not only appear taller, leaner, but quicker, and somehow hardier. It changed me from being simply considered as cute ... to lean-mean, dan- gerous, and nifty; darling as well as daring; one blessed with, shall we say, a hard- edge. Then Lucasta Jones's minister, the Rev. C. Bostic Boddie contacted me about all of my woes. He was certain that my soul was "in a spiritual straitjacket." He revealed that the devil was upon me. Why Cuz Lu told him about my ailments, I'll never know. Except for her undying love for me. This toupee-wearing minister called the evening before I entered the hospital, with an announcement that he would pray for me...... "He understands your condition. I understand your condition," he said. Then he started talking about how he caught God's cold, when the Almighty sneezed, as analogy to how he, C. Bostic Boddie, was called to preach. I almost hung up in his face. "Mister Jones, my brother, God is trying to tell you something," he said. I wished to hell that God would tell the physicians something, anything, I thought out loud. After all, I couldn't heal myself. Rev. C. Bostic Boddie informed me that he was pray- ing for me through this ordeal, but his voice over the telephone revealed to me that Lucasta's preacher was thinking that this is the last time I'll be speaking to poor old Joubert Jones. He seemed to know that I was heading for my last days. He would visit me "upon my sick-bed." But oh how he hungered to say death-bed. For I could hear the smack of the spade and the scooping up of the clots of dirt at the edges of his sweet high tenor voice. He sounded ready to usher me under. Then he told of a time in the recent past where he, himself, had been struck down dead, so to speak; yet pitched upwards in a moment of revelation, all of which implied the high vulnerability of life; the tentativeness of all things, visible and invisible. The Rev. C. Bostic Boddie had been looking at television around midnight, as a point of distraction, from his main assignment of waiting up for his dear youngest daughter, Roxie. It was lightning and storming outside when suddenly the television power "flew out of this room" and just at that exact moment he was "struck-down dead" or I should say "vaulted upwards," as if by a force of lightning, but no rather "it was that power of the Light, not made of hands" and his body was power shocked so that he went from sitting on a sofa, as a father waiting up for his delinquent daughter . .. to a man charged upwards upon a chair next to the sofa on his tip-toes, his hair-piece blown ... to virtually climbing the wall. Clawing off the wallpaper. This preacher thought he was being called by the last blast of the trumpet sound- when the final crackle of lightning occurs. I wonder now, if he knew any of Ford's theories on lightning? But suddenly, fitfully, his wig leaped from his head. Like a blast off into the spirit world. The wig flipping business fractured me to laughter, I started coughing to masquerade, or muffle my cries. But he was repeating it all for emphasis: " . . . And so you see Brer Jones, I had been sitting up late, waiting for my youngest daughter, Juanita Roxie, to get back from her date, and you know all the rascality young people can get into nowadays. So, I turned the television on for distraction, instead of turning to my Bible for reference and guidance. Then it started to storming and bolting lightning. Now I'm worrying as much about the dangers of her nature, as I am about the perils of Mother Nature. But I kept thinking, if Roxie doesn't get 714</page><page sequence="13">L___ _ __ _CALLALOO into this house in a big fat hurry, I'm going to ground her, sure as judgment. See I was watching this movie, Miss Sadie Thompson. I was going to make her crawl that line. When all of a sudden that bolt blast broke up my unease, sputtered out the life of that damn television set; and I was charged out of my sox; my wig leaped off of my head. Then I started wailing Nearer My God To Thee. But the Master, Himself, settled me down. I'm telling you Mister Jones, why the spirit of the Holy Ghost, Himself, was steady flying through the lightning cords, and charging through the juice of the powerhouse of the television tubes. Blasting me out of my idolatry." I tried to keep a straight face and not cry out in laughter. So I muffled my cries. Then I assured Rev. C. Bostic Boddie that I wasn't going anywhere (God willing) except the hospital. I was equally certain that he was now setting himself up for the preparatory language for that institution of imminence . .. and then they lowered Brother Jones's body, down down down. Aunt Eloise would prevail over that, I felt certain. Then all I had to worry about was extreme unction. In the distance now I could hear behind the ramblings of Lucasta's preacher's voice, the great black singer, Roland Hayes, singing a favorite spiritual: Prepare me one body, I'll go down. I'll go down. Prepare me one body like a man. The man of sorrows, sinner, see- I'll go down. I'll go down- He died for you and He died for me - I'll go down and die. Prepare me, Lord, one body. Prepare me one body like a man. I'll go down and die, I'll go down, I'll go down. I'll go down and die ... Soon I'd be starting my life all over from scratch, I said, in the telephone to Lucasta's preacher, as I hung up the receiver. But now Rev. Roper was back, and I shot after him with: "/ ... Rev. Roper, this makes me think of a movie house, too, where there is such little light, but the occasional flashlight of the usher helping patrons to find their way to their seats in the darkness; or when somebody hurls the doors of the theatre open; or those faint lights to the right of the seats on the aisle, every tenth row. Or, the flickering lights upon the screen." " . . . It's probably 7:30 in the late summer outside; but it's rushing on toward mid- night judgment underneath that old house; and now your heart is pounding fear and hunger over the adventure and so you tell yourself how you are sorry you left off from the others so quickly, without at least pocketing a piece of Aunt Bronwyn's fried chicken. Then the old alarm starts up within your soul, because of the all-of-a-sudden approaching, name-taking adults. The stalkers and the balkers; sounding out and sounding through, as if clearing out all points of hiding for a muster-magnetic all souls roll call. But what's happening is this: there are suddenly a phalanx of people being set in motion through the picture-taking efforts of Aunt Carrie-Sarah. She is too homely to get attention in any other way. "Aunt Carrie-Sarah can't even cook, which is worst than not even being a gentle- 715</page><page sequence="14">CALLALOO man, if you are masculine, and so she's out there, clearing vocal cords and chords. It's the one time she can finally give directions, since she's an old maid who never devised a way to trip up a potential husband, nor get tricked by some sad sack soul into marriage. Too homely to get your attention without calling for set up shots. Now Carrie-Sarah is in commandment, finally. You feel badly that you are not out there, and worse still, because they have not missed you, nor have they missed some of the others in your underground group, not yet. This makes you feel less than a snotty- nosed rabbit-bucking bad boy. Because your absence can't get their attention long enough to make them weep so hard to lose your presence. ". . . Flashlight spangles you into the spotlight suddenly, and you think it's a camera call for a close up; or that Aunt Carrie-Sarah's using her powerful flash bulb because of the near darkness, outside. You see she got this idea in the back of head, where she's homely enough to get an extra pair of telephoto eyes, that a flash bulb can create radiance at dusk-dark like the midnight sun miracle upon the landscape of Sweden. Those adult voices are becoming more and more powerful, yet more individual to your ears, calling all of you away from your play (even as the camera work is setting up group pictures in sections, and you just know Aunt Carrie-Sarah is tickled-pink- in-paradise). Still light enough on the skirts of things to keep you all from feeling too much danger, even when three charged up rats flee from the danger of your presence, and you start praying for protection of your soul and the souls of the-." "Yes and you start praying for protection of your soul and the souls of the departed and so on and so forth . . . world without end, amen. But you know Rev. Roper, I'll bet anything, there are little packets of Filthy McNasty newspaper bundles beneath that old house once new with children that would carry a fortune of history and news of the disreputable times; right along with tossed away tin cans from discarded parties down into recent days." " . . . Meantime your new-found gang has gone farther and farther beneath this old ramshackle house, and Cousin Stelzer has pitched the quest of the route to the rumor of some dead body buried in the long ago, at this very point where he's standing, like he's some frontiersman. Now he's searching off to the side of the house for a magical lantern and a shovel. But it's Tilly, the tomgirl, who has discovered a lantern, off to the left, and it's far from magical. Cousin Stelzer's back at his check point; he's found something, now he's rising ever so slowly like a ballet dancer from his knees, and he's pulling back something from the floor of the earth, like you ease back a white sheet, slow-motion style, just enough in order to see, down at the morgue, the features contained within the complexion of a dead person's face. He howls out, and all come running, you second in the pack of face cards ... to where Cousin Stelzer is standing and waving that dim flashlight; now he's leaning at a Joker slant and looking down and over; just then Tilly comes to his aid with her lantern, and Higginson brings forth his mirror, on the other side of what you now see is a deep hole in the ground; but as you try to move forward and get past two ahead of you-you trip over a piece of what? A plank? A discarded baseball bat? A (dead man's) show? But you are falling over into the hole filled with bones, and before you know anything all light in the under house dwelling has vanished and all you can hear are fleeting steps of your comrades running for what's left of the light of day." 716</page><page sequence="15">__ _ _ _ _ _CALLALOO Then I heard a long, eerie laugh escape and spiral up from the bottom of my throat; it was of my voice sound all right, but it went on far too long; Rev. Roper didn't laugh at all, but he allowed himself a sad smile of reflection and mirrored regret in my di- rection. I took a long gulp of the remaining dregs at the bottom of the tea cup, not so tangy as before. Finally I got my composure back from the overflow of laughter in this house, which was so quiet now. I said to Rev. Roper, with a straight face: "Sir, I'll take another cup of that lemon-minted tea. But Mister-Rev. Roper, I wish to Heaven, I could have a drink of whatever it is that you have in your cup." Then he went out to the kitchen to get a refill of the lemon-minted tea, and I got to thinking again about little Hans Henson down in that ditch; and then a cluster of pity arose in my heart for Marvella. I could hear her reading that strange poem of hers in clear and measured tones. Not all of it, certainly not, but some of the lines came charg- ing back to me now. Her tribute to Paul, too. Dead on a Southern road. Carrying that little black box, her grail. "Whatever it is that lives is Holy," Mister William Blake said, but did he allow for eulogies. What did the Greeks say? A man's fate is his life; and his life is his fate. But that would not help Marvella any in the straits of her styx; nor in the tabernacle of her long-song sorrows. Haunting words. If not a poem, then surely the lyricism of an aggrieved heart, suspended back into time. What had Clara told Beefeater, "Mister Misfortune throws ringers: blindfolded. Seems like that's our fate." Poor, banished children of Eve. On the road, the load. . . the code. Something like that. Paul's glorious body reduced to ashes ... Rainy road sleeked down by foul fortune Paul in the South; wheeling out Freedom: They edged Paul's truck off the rainy road, With freedom papers in his lashed down load. Beefeater Raines and Sadie Sue knew the code! Quoting the Greeks' idea on fate was akin to calling up Kipling's poem If to Marvella, both no doubt would have possessed equal vintage in the visage of her sorrowing soul. Then I got to thinking about Spiffy Lumpkins and how much his voice made me think of Rev. Roper's and Rev. Roper's his. But it was not so much the voice as the train of thought; and yet they were so profoundly different. Spiffy Lumpkins never left the barbershop without a smile on his face; but before he had left the room to get my tea, Rev. Roper's face had changed. Was this old face card of a gent speaking from the heart? The circumsized heart -even as he was setting me up - and thereby caught up in the chambers of an imagery too profound for intellectual expression of ecstasy, by virtue of his own lantern's light. And then I was remembering that time when I was lost in a myriad of corridors and a labyrinth of caves within a cave. Mirror, mirror / off the wall ... who's the damnest of them all? Who's the damsel pitched to my fall? Youall? Yes and that business about kin and kith and kith and kin had me coming and going. Not through the rye, either. A kind of gathering up of life, as so much loose change of the body. And some coins, never seen before, but with currency and power aplenty stamped upon their faces and sculpted within the minted moment of memory. A firebrand. Suddenly every- 717</page><page sequence="16">CALLALOO thing that is . . . or ever was is black down below. Is the jetted color of a bat's wings, equally eerie below that old mythical house. Frightening too, as a farmhouse turned funhouse of those never sleeping bats -discovered, near Christmas, near the top, in their raven rabid rage. Relatives of daddy's kin, where we went that time and were stopped. Sheriff thought Aunt Eloise was a ... called her a "wet-back." "How did a wet-back get way up here?" It is as if twilight were approaching. But when will it arrive? A galaxy of time seems to be breathless . . . fast . .. standfast. Hold on. Wing in hell. Time Aunt Eloise took me to a seance to see if we could communicate with our fallen down dead souls' past. Even though she was a serious, if not stern, prac- ticing, if not devout, Catholic, and as the room neared pitch black and the candlelight quaked from the seer's breathing. . . suddenly she claimed she heard the voice of our nun cousin the deceased Epistollotta scream into the porches of her ears: "Your pres- ence here Eloise, condemns your soul to hell." And we ran eight blocks in the rain to capture a taxi. Her nun's voice sounding, "as death blowing on the broth of existence," Aunt Eloise said. The Stations of the Cross, in the name of a self-imposed penance, for each evening ... seven nights. "Is limbo itself-Aunt Eloise-napping in the nurs- ery below this uncharted earth?" I asked the still shattered Aunt Eloise upon the last church evening of the Stations. She almost slapped me. Just now Rev. Roper returned and he placed the filled-to-the-brim tea cup before me; his face was pleasant but stern; and he picked up right where he had left off in the conversation: ". . . And not only is it pitch black beneath in the hole, filled with skeleton bones, as your pillow and your bed, but you getting to think of it/them bones, as the outline pattern of a robe, and perhaps even the shroud of your long suit to glory. And it's darker than the deadly woods at the apron of death, just above your head. And soon you find yourself howling and screaming for whom? Naturally?" "Naturally? Momma or Daddy. Or both." "Naturally. And of course, because you have really stepped into it, these adult voices are calling all of you in more plainly than ever; but you can't rise from down in the hole. So there you are in a world full of blackness, upon a bed of bones and struggling to rise . . . ." And now Rev. Roper's voice started to change to preacher- chant with this last statement. I felt rattled within my soul, because this rather sudden turning in his story charged me back to that memory of Hans Henson, down there in the ditch, and I got to feeling guilty all over again. And grew silent and fearful. Was this man some sort of strange prophet? Or, one who is blessed with salient but perilous information, revealed only when you are at the brink of existence. ". . . Yes and deedy, your new-found kin have gradually abandoned you to the treasure hunt, which is all they can think to call the forbidden trip underneath the building. Left you to die, if you want to haul the story into the big picture of life, by their lights. Either through your encounter with the dead spirit rising and falling, whose presence is guaranteed to kilt you; or, the wrath of the parents, whose straps are enough to lace you down to a whelping heap of shucks. Because this was a time when ass whippings were as plentiful and natural as pure air breathing out of the 718</page><page sequence="17">- CALLALOG _O_ hand of the straps, and iron cords of the most benign of parents. Then you've em- barrassed yourself again, not because you got in the game of chance and danger but because you not only got caught, but that you were alone and the last least one caught in the net, which suggests that you are not only hauntingly bad even, but also perhaps even dumb, or stupid, even cursed with bad luck to be the low man on the totem pole of creation, and tarnation. So now your ass has to be double-dutch limbed, in order not only to beat the dickens out of you, but the devil, and bad luck, too, out of you." I was attempting to not shed tears over Hans Henson. "Bad luck out of you, too?" I said almost repeating Rev. Roper totally, and in a hypnotic voice; for once again, I had almost fallen off into the darkness of confusion and out of time, or step with the pace of meaning. "Yes, because you see it's precisely at that moment, when they think it's the worst thing that could happen to you; and limbing your ass to kingdom come because of your waywardness, that He's trying to use your experience, yea your waywardness to direct you home." "Home?" "Yes, home, son." "Hell, he can't. I can't-or whomever it is down in the pit of bones can't rise, much less vault home." Rev. Roper paused for a moment as one who has been drifted away from the centrality of his story, not because of his own controlled meanderings, but by outside voice of his audience. Then he went back to his story, with the energy of an old car, after the battery gets a powerful jump-start. ". . . Now more and more you hear a truer range of familiar voices -like aunts and uncles and cousins - and the unfamiliar ones, as the ones you've only been introduced to this day, all in a whirlwind, like you gonna drown in them-but you'll drown in your own tears, if you don't up and listen for the right one and up and right yourself (unass this situation) ascend from this pit, which will be naturally of course the mortal enemies, and your saviours, one in the same, and the same-as-one, as they were that day God Almighty brought them together as man and wife-your Mother and your Father, so help me God. Them that breathed their life into you. And as you make plain their voices, and now particularly your Daddy's . .. that One you always call on, to make a way out of noway, just as you are calling out to Him now, even as you can see Him in your mind's eye with that strap in His hands, ready and able to chastize your ass to glory . . . Him who you are always calling on when you are down and out. And that's about the condition of your ass down in that sorry hole of a pit. But Mister Jones, sir, why are you looking so funeralizing glum? Have I hit home without meaning to take the depths of your measurement?" Perhaps the look that crept across my face expressed a faint-hearted velleity of spirit or will. Rev. Roper's rambling had me gambling and riffing at the margins of existence. I was both angry and stunned. Irked and engaged. There was a sly look upon his face. ". . . Sir, in the delicate dust of uncharted existence beneath that old house, there was one who was tripped up by his fate. But let me ask you this? Can the white bones of skeletons have wings? Is that where you are letting me off into the darkness?" Ignoring my question, he said: 719</page><page sequence="18">CALLALOO Because that won't be the voice you'll hear out of it all. Not this time. And that's part of the difference. That one voice in the many. Out of the pulp of pithy circumstance." "Now I am getting a little confused on this very point, you appear to be shifting ground underneath me." Just then I recalled the voice of Aunt Eloise, reaching me there in that little town in Germany with news in the wee hours of the morning, about the death of a family member or that time she called concerning the destruction of a dear friend's home, hurled asunder in a tornado; and now recalling what I had for- gotten-how each time Aunt Eloise called, in my groggy condition, I had thought it was my mother's voice for the first few moments; rocked as I was out of the nightmare of sleep. ". . . No. Not this time. This time it is the Grandfather's voice. And you've not heard it before, not exactly. Yet it touches something in you-or, perhaps in your case, it's the voice of a great-uncle." "How exactly does it touch you? Did it touch you? To the core of what? Down home and back to what buried moment in your memory? That's what I'm trying to get at. Was trying to get you to talk about." I plainly had to get this Rev. Roper back on the defensive. ". . . But now back to your question, Mister Jones, because that's exactly what hap- pened to me. Did anything like any of this ever happen to you? So far I mean, Mister Joubert Jones?" He asked this last statement re-checking the full name written down on my calling card. ". . . Well, I've had some experiences with haunted houses, before. And I've known some haunted personages, take W. A. D. Ford, for example, trickster-demon, who still haunts me and this earth, as well. Probably dwelling in the inner bowels of this old earth-awaiting his seventh year cyclical return, no doubt. But that's yet another story. Or take this char- . . . this noted prophetess Miz Rachel Flowers, surely she heard voices. Hears them, too. There is a crazy tap-dancer who haunts my soul, tap- ping his wonderfully wicked rhythms up and down the soul of my backbone. He sometimes gets to working on me and I lose control and start to acting out like him. Taking on his directives. Directives pitched from an inner voice of his very own. It's certainly not a spiritual voice. More demonic than real. More real than demonic . . . I'm reaching now, but I did lose my mother's presence when I was only three years old; and I often hear her voice at wakefulness, or tumbling through me during times of nightmares. Sometimes I heard Dad's voice, too. And I've been on some picnics, as a kind of . .. once upon a . .. breaking away from the tribe . ..

I wonder was this the way that lad in the song Nature Boy got started? Did I fail to mentioned that I hear voices-and that these voices haunt my very soul? I'l ... Rev. Roper, let me confess something to you. I came to talk with you not simply because of this assignment Aunt Eloise fixed up, but because I thought maybe you'd throw some search lights, some lantern beams upon my problems?" His face 720</page><page sequence="19">C ALLALOG _ _ _ _ lit up, as one who has been massaging his face with pure refined peanut oil. But I turned the tables on him, and I could see the face lose its radiance. "Sir do you hear voices? When you hit that moment of ecstasy in your sermons? That sweet part? At the moment now, Rev. Roper, I'm drifting through my life like driftwood. So, I'm not totally disconnected from the general profile of your parable," I said rather shaky now that he was moving in on me like this. Meantime, Rev. Roper was shaking his head in disbelief, and perhaps even fear for my being. I felt the tears coming again to my eyes, as thoughts of little Hans Henson's voice splattered upon the mirror of memory: tears playing a fierce patty-cake upon the Fall leaves, in accord with the bright slapping light of October; and in both cases you are weeping for the beauty of Autumn and the lostness of Summer; and then back-to-school memories, making time and early to bed now ... early to rise, makes a man healthy, happy and wise. Particularly happy if he can rise ... but all of that's long-gone after I now I lay me down to die Mister Summer's suit too thin for Autumn gatherings up. Injun Sum- mer.

Soiled white net-veil of a bride, fairer than all her tribe. What did Beefeater say about "my basket might have been my casket?" No different from any reporter, I guess I was a little unsettled when the tables were reversed and the questions were turned personal (that fucking You business, forged out of the metal mettle too of Rev. Roper's raw-ass soul ... a hounding, hammering, pounding smitty). I didn't want to let on to him my problem of constantly hearing voices and my inability to control their powers over me, body and soul. Yet hadn't I just confessed this malady. Where was my mind? Back to my cut-up ways with Daisy Dawes. A near rhyme. But not pure, j. j. need not worry. " ... But no spiritual calling out of those associations within that search party?" "Rev. Roper, I am not without God. I'm not unaware of what happens to a soul without the sustaining light over his days." "Well, this was my personal spiritual experience of a calling out; genesis of it. Nat- urally when that personal spiritual experience, as inner glow, spoke out to me beneath that house and to my thirsty tongue, and my drinking soul, in the presence of the Holy Spirit (even though I was but twelve going on thirteen) it was like 'ah that's out of Daddy's voice; yes and Uncle Mack's, too.'" Now I was beginning to feel a lot better. "But now, Rev. Roper, had you heard your father's voi-. Well of course you knew your father's true voice." "Not exactly. Because I'm an orphan to this world -and his actual voice is wavering in my world . . . like sky-writing in the Heavens, on a cloud-streaked day of tears." "And yet?" " .. . It was as if I had heard that voice before. All of my life. Just as plain." "Buried deep within you?" I'l ... Well. Let me put it this way: It was the Granddaddy rescue voice, partly-it was beneath the grounding of the Daddy voice I heard.... That week Daddy was 721</page><page sequence="20">L___ _ __ _CALLALOO killed when I was three-his last crying voice, when those white men came and lynched him and Momma pulling me away from that window-and then I was taken off by kin; raised up at the hands of his brother, Uncle Mack Ross Roper, a powerhouse preacher of God's word, in Cleveland, Mississippi. A smoke-cured, yet mountain echo of a voice; wrathful and woe-struck, from that moment when they took his brother to the tree limb. It took them white men coming in lynching legions of tens to pit and hold Uncle down on the ground. . . and him wrestling to get loose from those devils. " . . . Uncle Roper's voice then commences into my life line, as a resounding com- mandment, celebration, back-talk, censure, woe-stomping, woe-curing, fierce back- strapping down.

But now I'm still down there beneath that old house, in that hole of a pit- wishing I had me a pair of wings to hide my face (still shame-face for being tried and failing, too) but also to ascend upon them, and cut to the right and fly fly fly up and UP from down under; when that old retrieval voice of Maurice Roper (the original one) whose voice I never purely heard resounds to the depths of my being, as a glow- ing in the dark robe of every color in the rainbow . .. imploring in a commandment to arise from that pit. But now how to arise but to just get up. Maybe that Voice thought I ought to know how. " . . . And it was this Voice-of-Voices (an echo of eternal life) that I heard down that deep down hole of a pit." Before my eyes now I suddenly saw the coffin of Joseph rise up. Then the mirror of Moses taking it and carrying it with him. Two boxes, one of the Ark of the Covenant, and the other of the dead Joseph. Took the two boxes of bones, side by side down the length of the years, Israel wandered in the desert. Son of Man, son of man can these bones rise? Finally, I came back to my senses. I" ... This is all quite haunting Rev. Roper. You never had heard that voice, but it was-let us say-buried somewhere within you. But you knew it when you heard it?" " . . . I'll strip that latter part from the former, son. It was as if I had heard it before. This voice, I mean. Daddy, Uncle Mack Ross Roper . .. and that Granddaddy that I always heard his sons almost babbling in tongues about rising to such a reverence, then down to a whispered halo shaping of the Word in their voices, when they called upon this grieving counsel in death, out of death. 'The mathematics of common sense married to the oracles of Jeremiah and Jesus,' was the way Uncle Mack Ross Roper put it. As if their voices could reach his ears; and his ears were yet alive to sound. To tap into his divinity line, you might say. " ... Or, in their gloom and disconsolation once or twice a year they'd get to laugh- ing and drinking behind that house (not unlike certain folks getting happy in church). Or, they'd squat and go up under the steps to the house with a lamp, play them some coon can for relief; and they'd pitch up imitations of their father's voice; his censure; 722</page><page sequence="21">CALLALOG his wrath, his woe, his jokes, his side-split small talk; crying in their drinking; laughing out to falling over in their dying out voices. Weeping and wailing for the intelligence of his higher mathematics, his Voice. His long tongue. Just as Sundays, they'd imitate their sermons of their Heavenly Master. I don't believe you know what I'm talking about, son." "But you knew it when you heard it? That time beneath the house? And you knew it was making a new man out of you? That it was taking you from young boyhood- to new young manhood?" "Not only that time . . . not just that." "l. . . That you were being called? Called away from what you were; and where you were." "Not exactly, a-twinkling of an eye. Don't pinpoint it too closely, as a mathematical, split second in infinity. That's alright for me to do, privately, but not for you to say out loud, publicly. But just as I picked up his lantern beneath that house and tripped and fell into the ditch of a hole, It commenced to emerge from out of the Daddy voice, so much like Unc' Roper's stirring-compelling I, myself, was confused. Then it got clearer and cleaner, truer and deeper, wider, and longer, higher and quicker. Yes and I knew I had heard it. It was working on me, at every twist and turn. " . . . And come before my mind of me wrestling with Satan down there on the ground in that old ditch of a pit. I didn't want to get up and I didn't want to stay long, and I didn't want to let go of that Voice for nothing. Knew it could help me to arise from that pit so low as a valley; but that it would tell me just hozw-if I started the rise, by not making that Voice a crux. Commandment in its depths, crevices; demanding I a-rise. AH-Riiisssee. And for a time I lay low-steeling my resolve amid the shock of the first breathing words-listening to the powerful pressure of the words inside of my pounding temple-there in that ditch of a hole of my pitted-down condition. I was afraid where I naturally would have been-were it not for the Words; and now I was rising in His Word. Not Daddy's alone; not Uncle Mack Ross Roper's alone; nor Granddaddy's alone-but on my Heavenly Father's life-line Word, His Word. His long-term, long-tongued WORD! "I'm telling you Mister Jones I recognized it. The framework, the shadow, the light fall, the twilight in the magic and the lightning cord in the rhythm, the crackling up my soul and fury down my spinal column, the nutcracker in my hellish-hellbone-bee- beating pitch to the madness of that ole badness of my midnight wickedness out of my twilight terribleness; spun up through the soul of my soaring. And whatever and whatsoever's buried in me that's akin to His breath got picked up, and pitched forth on His Word, HIS WORD, HIS WORD-just as I had to come up, picking up my feet, and my legs and my arms (as by the numbers of Uncle Roper's instructing me out language, as a small boy) and vault myself out of that pitched down ditch on the strength and power of His life breathing Word . . . come to me like a huge-hearted heralding wind to the North to the South, sidewinders to the East streak-a-lean to the West-robing me up in every color, robing my body up in a shade of the rainbow ... out of the clearing into the great-gathering up, unfolding. Then reclothing; then stripping me away. . . and once I started to rise it helped sweep me up that I . .. that 723</page><page sequence="22">CALLALOO I had wings. The Daddy voice had me re-directed in my misguidance. Pouring light and healing to my hapless condition. Son of Man, can these dry skeleton bones live? The Amazing Grace of it all. "And young man, young man, I came to believe, as I believe now it is all related to the factor and to the fact about God creating man in His image and likeness, out of His own commanding voice to the clay, and dust, earth and soot of this filthy earth, when He reformed existence out of it." Well, this last set of sermonettes, as homilies, was too much for me. I didn't slam on the table in denunciation, but I found myself storming mad. As long as the con- versation had a secular bent to it, I was all right; but as soon as it spiralled towards the Heavens, I just could not take it. And yet, surely I knew where it was all headed, in some great-gathering up moment of emotional upheaval; when I was talking about the meaning of the moment of spiritual ecstasy. What was it that Rev. William I. Hines had said about all of this and the Negro problem. Damn good, too. Not totally focused however. Ole Hines could vault 'em and (vamp 'em, too) with vigor. I put down the tea cup and said, "Thanks for the memories, Rev. Roper and of course the lemon-minted tea; but no thanks, as well. I can't buy into this brandywine of faith." His face grew quite upset. I put away my notebook. I believe Rev. Roper felt betrayed. We were going along so well; the stories unfolding so swimmingly. I tried to explain my condition. I'l ... You see sir, I've been hearing from too many crazy people today. I may be crazy myself. Sometimes I itch from head to toe. Is there no balm in.... And you know I've spoken to you about these crazy voices. And not only today, but since I've come home, which is less than a week. Well, a little bit more. But those weird sisters, Marvella and Rachel Flowers to name but a few ... both of whom have pissed off a wayward brother; a man they both consider to be an idiot. And he is full of voices and discontent and emptiness of spiritual life, except for that portion of his recorded his- tory on the courts, and his record collection, which is for sale. I can see that you don't know what in the Hell I'm talking about. "I can't buy a misshapened faith; forged out of an emotional metal that shimmers in the darkness of nothingness but for a fleeting moment; and apparently does not return to haunt the inventor, even as its basis plagues him, and mainly us; providing no constant glow to ever illuminate and challenge the questioning lighthouse of the mind. Your way only throws a flashlight to me that I should embrace the dusty cor- ridors of death with the glad tidings of the good news-on the other side of town." All the time I was talking, Rev. Roper just shook that fine, noble little head of his with great pity for the discontent of my soul. And then too, after going through this long- term genesis, stations of the cross, agony spun out of wonderment, Lord even Dev- ilment, in order to swing me over to the other side. And all for naught. And naught for all. A naught's naught. Five's a figure. All for the." But by this time he was indeed showing me to the front door; as if I had shown Almighty God, Himself, the back of my hand. I'm equally certain that he was very much prepared to show me the back door. I felt like a creep without a syllable of direction, within the dungeon of my despair. 724</page><page sequence="23">L___ ___ ___CALLALOG Outside the dangers of the street crept in all about me, on cat's feet. And if that wasn't bad enough, there was a powerful, and ghastly fog in the air. Believers steal away from the slaying breath on the edge of the dawn to doom of the slums. Streets running in murder-shock like tears streaking down the cubby, chubby, mahogany brown cheeks of a kindergartner at play, suddenly swept up in the eye of the storm, in a hypodermic tread down the stroll. Slaughtered dreams, empty arms. Believers as- semble in churches for the long-gone tongues, and the bulging eyes, and twisted mouth; for the tongues of righteouness to toll in a breath of brilliance to revel and reveal it all in song; and yes to cover it all up too, in furious rhythms, made of hands ... upon the windshield of Aunt Eloise's car gathered an imagery most strange. And then I beheld a coffin of bones, all mixed up with recordings, and music being piped into the eye-hole portals of the coffins; but the lid was up. And I saw the shad- ows of two men pouring the jagged edges and vertebrae of bones from cotton sacks. So that a smokiness of power flew across the window pane. The windshield became as a panorama of a movie screen. I turned on the ignition and pushed the watering button to start the cleansing process; then I punched the window wiper mechanism; allowed it to whirl-a-way for five minutes. But then after the beating of blades had ceased, the windows remained filthy with existence and a pouring forth avalanche of powdered bones now. So that the windshield appeared, as if covered by fog. I could no longer see the two male shadows, at their work; only the beating of blades (I had started them up again; and then there was the beating of my heart). Finally my head cleared up. Much later the windshield seemed to clear up, too. Looking down at my notebook of quotes from Rev. Roper, in the inner light of the car, the words of Rev. Hines now came back clearly to me, and they seemed to flood over the lines of my inscription: ". . . You see Mister Jones, I am of the staunch opinion that the glory and the shame of black religious experience is emotionalism. On the other hand, I would say that if African Americans could take the emotionalism of their religion and combine it with the rationality of the white man's religion they could remake this culture. Could reshape it; transform it. . . . " And then I said unto him: " ... But Rev. Hines, isn't that part of the point, and the problem, they have been so soundly remade by it ... that it sings in them, rings of them, like John Henry's ham- mer." Historical heartbeat, as the working out of God's will. Why did Almighty God want this to happen? What was God's intention? (In our case, slavery for example, Mister/ Master.) Relationship of the people and individuals to God. Changing concept of God Himself from a polytheism to monotheism . . . African situation too, somewhat. Changing over from many minor gods to one God in three separate persons. Must bring this up with Imani. Haitians had it easier on this count-voodoo links the worlds here. We had to change, or perish-twice. The ever transforming remnant. ... Changing view of God from the beginning idea of a covenant. Contract between God and the individual . .. quid pro quo . . . you give me something, I'll give you something. Chosen people. It ain't easy being One. Civil Rights workers think of themselves (ourselves, the believers) as a chosen people. Born to suffer to refine it, refined by it: America, our furnace of affliction....

His many voices within the One chosen for that occasion. Chosen people is a duty . . . utilmately a burden, too, in terms of the petty pace of persecution to finally go down dead, you need more than a Moses. An obligation, too.

Roper, question our preachers, too. And that's when it occurred to me in the living present that part of my problem with Rev. Roper had been simply this-I'd momentarily gotten his voice all mixed up with the men I was looking for when I spoke to him-Rev. Spiffy Lumpkins, Sugar- Groove, Joseph, Jesus, Frederick Douglass, and Lincoln, and no doubt, David of the Old Testament, and even God Almighty Himself. And not simply about the genesis of Rev. Maurice Roper's calling, either. My soul was still in a spiritual fog. 726</page></plain_text>
