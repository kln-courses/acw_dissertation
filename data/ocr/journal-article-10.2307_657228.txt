<plain_text><page sequence="1">538 apparently still alive in memory, class is no longer a useful point of departure for attacking the ills of society, for there is no longer (if there ever was, another vague area) a class that is capable of promoting the historical needs of the society as a whole (p. 194). What does this leave? Something variously called the introduction of "a pattern of interdependence," the elimination of the "industrial pattern of control as such," the redistribution of social power, the "renegotiation of the problems of unfreedom and emancipation," and the "emancipation of politics from its subordi- nation to economics" (pp. 196-97). Finally translating these densely packed terms into concrete images on the very last page of the book, Bauman leaves us with two suggestions: "as many citizens as possible should share in making decisions," and a variety of "relatively autonomous associations," including publicly owned corpora- tions, in which citizen self-government can be carried out on a practical scale, need to be organized. What these perfectly reasonable proposals have to do with memory, what their relationship might even be to the preceding 197 pages of text, and, indeed, to whom these suggestions are addressed - the answers to all these questions are anybody's guess. In sum, this is a wandering, rather disjointed and, despite its flashes of brilliance, ultimately disappointing book about extremely important matters. Its main contri- bution is that it provokes the reader to toy with the notion of memory as a possible way to think about problems of continuity and change in a political culture, but the author's own attempts to apply the concept to specific historical situations prove less than satisfactory. I don't wish to fault him for the inconsistencies that inevitably arise when one addresses so elusive an issue, but all too often Bauman loses his grip on the problem of memory, allowing his essay to dissolve into a treatise on political economy or a familiar critique of consumerism. A highly original and important social thinker, the author of several deservedly respected books, has failed to live up to his own high standards in this rushed, poorly edited and inconsistent essay, whose often provocative insights could have been presented much more cogently in an article. Nevertheless, though the time may not yet be ripe for a single volume that attempts to synthesize Foucault, Moore, Habermas, Touraine, Dahrendorf, and Offe, not to mention a host of empirical historical studies, the enterprise was laudable. If nothing else, Baumans's book should stimulate some fresh thinking about the issues at hand. Reginald E. Zelnik University of California Adorno, by Martin Jay (Cambridge: Harvard University Press, 1984). In a celebrated commentary on the work of Franz Kafka, Walter Benjamin has argued that Kafka's significance as a writer consists in the fact of his failure. "To do justice to the figure of Kafka in its purity and its peculiar beauty" Benjamin writes, "one must never lose sight of one thing: it is the purity and beauty of a failure." This proposition has the aura of outrageousness about it; on the surface of things, it even seems paradoxical in its inversion of common-sense categories. For what are we to make of the idea that a great work - and of Kafka's supreme importance, Benjamin leaves us in no doubt - is one that has failed?</page><page sequence="2">539 The solution to this riddle is to be found in Benjamin's characteristic insistence upon the sociality of art. Kafka, he argues, fails not because of any incompetence on his part but because he cannot possibly succeed. He has to fail. His failure is determinate and unforgoable; what he sets out to do cannot be done even though it needs to be done. It cannot be done because Kafka's world is as it is: "administered," tortured by class division - which means class domination - commodified and instrumental. In the context of such a world, there are contradictions that simply cannot be overcome artistically. To speak, within art, of transcendence or reconciliation, is to dissemble; and Kafka's inestimable value lies in the fact that he refuses to dissemble. The author writes, in Sartre's famous formulation, to be free. This is as true of Kafka as it is of any writer. But how to write for freedom when freedom cannot be reached through writing? This is the source of Kafka's "failure." His is a necessary quest for an unattainable goal. The limitation, the "fault," is thus not his but history's. What Benjamin has to say about Kafka, his friend and associate Theodor Adorno tends to say about all important art in the modern era. Such art, according to Adorno, is rendered significant not despite but precisely because of its structural "limitations." For at base these "limitations" derive from the social world; they are in truth less "limitations" than the scars and contours of social antagonisms and constraints. Modernist art alludes to the existence of domination and violence and, in doing so, assumes an implicitly critical posture. Telling the truth about the world through the medium of its form, it gives the lie to the world's ideological presentation of itself. Adorno's championing of this dimension of the modernist aesthetic is almost programmatic in its intensity. As Martin Jay shows in his outstanding study, Adorno sees in Expressionism generally, and in such figures as Kafka, Beckett, and Schoenberg in particular, a unique and privileged sensitivity to the prevailing tendencies within contemporary society. What Adorno appears to respect most in Expressionism, according to Jay, is its unflinching truthfulness, its "ruthless fidelity to the suffering of modern man." Consider for example the following passage, which Jay quotes tellingly in his book: "Music will be better, the more deeply it is able to express - in the antinomies of its own formal language - the exigency of the social situation and to call for change through the coded language of suffering. It is not for music to stare in helpless horror at society. It fulfils its social function more precisely when it presents social problems through its own material and according to its own formal laws - problems which music contains within itself in the innermost cells of its technique." Passages such as these enable us to focus on the single most important feature in terms of which Adorno's aesthetic theory represents an advance over that of his great antagonist Georg Lukacs. For all his strenghts, Lukacs remains unreceptive to the expressivity of artistic form. He seems more or less incapable of grasping form as a mediating instance between society and cultural creation, an instance whose representation of the world proceeds according to its own "relatively autonomous" protocols. Adorno, by contrast, demonstrates a quite remarkable sensitivity both to the nuances of form in themselves and to their broader implications. His work is thus altogether free of the lingering reductionism that haunts the margins of Lukacs's writings on literature and threatens, on occasion, to swamp them. Nor, it should be</page><page sequence="3">540 stressed, does Adorno's work ever collapse into formalism, into the mere analysis of form as an exercise in itself. Instead, as Jay shows, Adorno is always concerned with form as an historical medium, pointing to realities beyond itself. Even when he concerns himself with detailed analyses of musical compositions, Jay writes, it would be misleading to refer to Adorno as a "musicologist." For, "as was also the case when he wrote on other cultural phenomena, Adorno always moved out from the music to society." Adorno wrote on culture as extensively as he did because he believed that in the era of monopoly capitalism, art played a singular role. In an age of universal commodifi- cation, art was the only practice still capable of holding fast to its vision of a better world. Jay demonstrates the consistency of this affirmation of art in Adorno's thought. It is to be found in the massive Aesthetic Theory upon which Adorno was still working at the time of his death in 1969. And it is to be found also in an early critique of Kierkegaard, written forty years before, in which Adorno took issue with Kierkegaard's relegation of aesthetic sensibility to a position below that of religious or ethical sensibility. "Whereas Kierkegaard argued for that inferiority (of the aesthetic) because an aesthetic consciousness was still tainted by sensual and material concerns, Adorno praised it precisely for its mixed status, which provided more accurate knowledge of the still unreconciled contradictions of the real world." Art's "privilege," in these terms, rested in its formal characteristics, since it was by virtue of the alienation between art and life implicit in form that art was able to maintain its balance between the negative moment of description of the world and the affirmative moment of utopianism. For this reason, Adorno tended to favor "those works that strive for the utmost immediacy from the present society, defying immediate accessibility and popular impact. By refusing to accept the unity of art and this life, they hold out hope for a future life that will imitate art at its most utopian. For only in the utter uselessness of such works, which stubbornly resist all attempts to instrumentalize them, is the present domination of instrumental reason defied." The best that art can hope to do in the modern era is to resist the tentacular embrace of instrumentalism. In doing so, art defiantly holds open the door for positive social action, even though the agents of such action cannot as yet be glimpsed on the h'orizon. But it is not strictly true that this posture, of sheer resistance, belongs to art only. For Adorno sees his own work, and Critical Theory in general, as contributing to the same task of holding the hegemony of instrumentalism at bay. The Critical Theorist's method, of course, is different from that of the modernist artist. Critical Theory brings to reflection what modernist art expresses unintentionally. Yet both Critical Theory and modernist art, in Adorno's eyes, are concerned "to rescue the emancipatory potential in the fractured cultural reality of today." In commenting upon this view of the "creativity" of Critical Theory, Jay speaks of Adorno as a proto-deconstructionist, for whom the distinctions between "critical" and "creative" discourses are largely tactical rather than substantive. Jay's account of Adorno's critical and philosophical method is truly excellent. Succintly and lucidly he describes Adorno's notoriously complex methodological shuttling between "immanent" and "transcendental" modes of analysis, the effectivity of Adorno's fragmentary and paratactic style, his critiques of both positivism and idealist subjectivism, and his argument for the "complementary inadequacies" of</page><page sequence="4">541 philosophical concepts and the world to which they refer: "the concept is inadequate to the world, but... the world as it is presently constituted is inadequate to certain meanings of the concept." Throughout his exposition, Jay emphasizes the utopian thread that runs through all of Adorno's work. The emphasis is important, for Adorno has been criticized by many commentators for his pessimism - interpreted as unalleviated - and his grim presentation of life in the modern world as degraded, passive and consumptive, ("managed") by external forces beyond its control. Many commentators have linked Adorno's dismal view of human agency with that of Marcuse in One-Dimensional Man. And, to be sure, there are similarities. Nobody could come away from a reading of Dialectic of Enlightenment, a classic book that Adorno wrote with Max Horkheimer, without feeling somewhat overwhelmed by the authors' relentless analysis of the dominative tendencies of post-Enlightenment society. This feeling, moreover, is compounded by the authors' all-too-brilliant demonstration that domination is not an accidental but a necessary correlate of"progress." Just as Walter Benjamin maintained that "there is no document of culture which is not at the same time a document of barbarism," so too Adorno and Horkeimer insist that "progress" and violence require each other. The domination of nature that makes "progress" possible also paves the way for the objectification and manipulation of people in society. Jay cites the following much-quoted sentence from Adorno's magnum opus, Negative Dialectics, in this regard: "No universal history leads from savagery to humanitarianism, but there is one leading from the slingshot to the megaton bomb." Yet Adorno is not a nihilist, and Jay does well to retrieve him from the charge of fatalism. Adorno is an uncompromising thinker; and Jay follows Adorno himself in regarding such a thinker as "in truth the one who does not give up... Open thinking points beyond itself." In these terms, Adorno is perhaps better compared with Ernst Bloch, or with the more characteristic Marcuse of Reason and Revolution, than with the Marcuse of One-Dimensional Man. For although he parts company from Bloch in refusing to ground the potential for human emancipation in an ontological urge toward transcendence, and from Marcuse in refusing to valorize anamnesis, he nevertheless clings to the conviction that without the specter of emancipation, of social regeneration, his work would lose its motivation. Jay reports that Adorno liked to think of his writings as "bottles thrown into the sea" for future generations to recover and reflect upon. This idea of "writing for the future" is deeply informed by an ethical sensibility. In Adorno and elsewhere, Jay documents the extent to which Adorno was hostile both to the substance of bourgeois humanism, with its totalizing inclinations and smugly self-regarding certitudes, and to Marxist humanism, with its anthropomorphism and romantic idealization of the proletariat as the universal class. But perhaps it is still necessary to appropriate Adorno's as itself a humanistic project, if only to distinguish it from the dogmatic "anti-humanism" of the Althusserian and post-Althusserian schools in Western Marxism. In much of his recent work, Jay has been concerned to move beyond the 1960s and 1970s polemics between the advocates of "Critical" and "Scientific" Marxism. His argument is that these polemics conceal the significant overlapping of concerns in the work of such theorists as Adorno and Marcuse, on the one hand, and Althusser, Poulantzas, and Colletti, on the other. (See, for example,</page><page sequence="5">542 his recent study, Marxism and Totality.) This contention is provocative and salutary but not, to my view, ultimately convincing. In the work of the Critical Theorists, there is a willingness to refer to a social morality or ethical vision in accounting for the "appeal" of Marxism. In Althusser's work, such a willingness is condemned as in itself an instance of "humanism." Although there are many other differences between "Critical" and "Scientific" Marxism, to which Jay is fully alert, this particular difference seems to me to warrant the refusal of an identification of Adorno's work with Althusser's as "anti-humanist." In attempting to account for the particularities of Adorno's thought, Jay very effectively uses one of Adorno's own favorite metaphors, that of the constellation. He distinguishes five strains or "stars" in the "constellation" that Adorno's work represents. We have already referred briefly to the "stars" of aesthetic modernism and deconstructionism in Adorno's work. To these Jay adds the "star" of Judaism; that of Marxism (in its heterodox, libertarian but marginalized "Western" aspect); and, finally, that of "mandarin cultural conservatism." Jay places each of these "stars" in historical and biographical context (one wonders about the absence of a sixth "star," that of psychoanalysis), and discusses the ways in which they intersect, blend, and contradict one another within the Adorno constellation. Their juxtaposition within Adorno's work obviously results in certain tensions and paradoxes. Yet it is a measure of Jay achievement in Adorno that we very often come to see these tensions and paradoxes as themselves valuable and insight-producing, rather than as evidence of any theoretical weaknesses on Adorno's part. Jay, indeed, suggests that this tendency to rest in paradox is defining of Adorno's thought. He wants us to see Adorno rather as Adorno saw Schoenberg or as Benjamin saw Kafka, that is, as "an ambitious failure": "I think it is only fair to extend to Adorno the same exculpation that he offered to Schoenberg: 'It is not the composer who fails in the work; history, rather, denies the work in itself.' It was impossible, given that history, for Adorno to find a way out..." This seems to represent a neat and attractive resolution, but Jay's use of the term "exculpation" here tells a story. For if Adorno has a fault, then this fault consists in Jay's tendency to pull his punches in describing the most troublesome of Adorno's primary "stars," that of "mandarin cultural conservatism." The problems that Adorno's mandarinism pose today for a radical appropriation of his work are too little explored in Jay's study. It is not at all that Jay is unaware of these problems; rather, it is that he tends to touch on them only in passing, and hence to leave the matter of their possible intractability entirely up in the air. What is at issue here is less a question of Adorno's historical achievement than of his contemporary value for theorists in the general field of cultural studies. In his introduction, Jay indicates that he considers Adorno's writings to be of the strictest contemporary relevance. Since it is only through direct contact with these writings that the "explosive power" of Adorno's vision can be tapped, Jay observes that one of his principal aims in preparing his study is to persuade his readers of the value of reading Adorno's work for themselves. For many readers of Adorno, however - and this is particularly true, I think, of new readers - his vision is experienced as terminal rather than enabling. Such readers will</page><page sequence="6">543 readily concede the "explosive power" of some of Adorno's insights, but, far from being struck by the appropriativeness or concrete utility of these insights, they will respond to them rather in the manner of visitors responding to works of art in a gallery or museum. Although Adorno's thought is not neutered or domesticated through this process, its radical contemporaneity is nevertheless denied. And what occasions this denial is Adorno's mandarinism. For all its surprises and defamiliari- zations, Adorno's writing often conveys a strong impression of being time-bound. To the relatively uninitiated reader, at least, so much about it seems distinctly out of place within radical discourse. There is its professorial severity, for example, its relative humorlessness, and its devastating elitism. Even more worrisome, there are its impassioned denunciations of mass culture, sounding for all the world like right-wing fulminations about cultural decline or slipping moral standards. When Adorno attacks jazz, or film, or sport, it is often impossible not to conclude that he is entirely wrong, or that he is somehow altogether incapable of grasping the degree to which life on the level of individual experience manages to free itself from the hegemonic determinations of the "administered world." Consider, for instance, the near- absurdity of this characteristic passage on jazz enthusiasts: "They call themselves jitterbugs, as if they simultaneously wanted to affirm and mock their loss of individuality, their transformation into beetles whirring around in fascination. Their only excuse is that the term jitterbugs, like all those in the unreal edifice of films and jazz, is hammered into them by the entrepreneurs to make them think that they are on the inside. Their ecstasy is without content. That it happens, that the music is listened to, this replaces the content itself. The ecstasy takes possession of its object by its own compulsive character. It is stylized like the ecstasies savages go into in beating the war drums. It has convulsive aspects reminiscent of St. Vitus' dance or the reflexes of mutilated animals..." It does not suffice, in face of the dramatic excessiveness of such passages as this, merely to allude, as Jay does, to the problematical character of Adorno's "mandarin cultural conservatism." Jay points to several clearly objectionable emphases within Adorno's thought, such as his entrenched Eurocentrism ("Adorno never felt any real sympathy for American, let alone more 'primitive' forms of culture outside of the West"), his prejudice toward popular culture and his reductive conflation of the cultural forms of fascism and monopoly capitalism. But he never addresses directly the important question, concerning the specificity of Adorno's value for contem- porary theory, that necessarily arises behind the back of these critical identifications. What Lukacs wrote of the Marxist reception of Hegel may be said to apply also to the contemporary radical reception of Adorno: "The task he imposes is to separate out from the complex web of ideas with its sometimes glaring contradictions all the seminal elements of thought and rescue them as a vital intellectual force for the present." This task is not attempted in Jay's study; and the lack represents the only real source of frustration in an otherwise excellent and immediately indispensable commentary upon Adorno's work.
