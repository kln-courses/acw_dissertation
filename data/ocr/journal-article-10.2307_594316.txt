<plain_text><page sequence="1">THE HASHWIYYA * A. S. HALKIN COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY LIKE A NUMBER of other group-names in the works of Muslim writers, the Hashwiyya appear and reappear as a more or less enig- matic entity. Much the same as the Mushabbiha, $ifatiyya, Nawasib, and others, the term is frequently employed but is not usually applied specifically. As a result, the student is somewhat perplexed by the presence of a party in Muslim life whose identity is not established and whose stand on various matters is not defined. The existence of the Hashwiyya is well attested by authorities of all types. Travelers, such as ibn Haukal,1 Mukaddasi 2 and Idrisi 3 come across them in the course of their journeys. The historian Masfidi refers to them several times.4 An incident between a Hashwi and a Mutazilite is related in the Kitdb al-Aghdni.5 More frequent mention is made of them by theological writers, Ghazdli,6 Shahrastdni,7 Iji,8 the S-dfi Hujwlri.9 Yet these references, more often than not, are passing notices with only the slightest attempt to supply anything but the scantiest information. Together with the lack of specific knowledge regarding the true character of the group, confusion has prevailed as to the real meaning of the name. The Dictionary of Technical Terms lists several possible explanations,'0 and no decision has been reached.1" * Dedicated to Prof. Richard Gottheil in honor of his seventieth birthday.

Among the suggested explanations are: 1) people who stepped out from the centre of the circle to the circumference. This is based on an incident which, as Houtsma recognizes, ZA, XXVI (1911), 196, is copied from the secession of the Mu'tazila. Acc. to this, the reading should be Hashawiyya. 2) from _, a body, because of their anthro- pomorphism. 3) in the sense of intermediary, referring it to the Kur'An and the Sunna which reveal God's desires to man. 11 Most of the explanations of European scholars have been collected by Houtsma, ib. 1</page><page sequence="2">2 A. S. Ealkin What is especially remarkable is the unanimous condemnation of the group by Muslims, and the universal anxiety to disclaim any relationship with it. Spokesmen of the many diverse theological schools and trends disown the Hashwiyya and show nothing but disgust for it. The impression one carries away after reading their attacks is that the group were an ignorant, reactionary lot who grossly exaggerated anthropomorphism and were receptive enough to accept any fantastic belief or superstition. Despite this hos- tility, Western scholarship was not slow to recognize that a close relationship existed between the Hashwiyya and the orthodox party in Islam. Van Vloten,12 Houtsma,'3 Tor Andrae '4 have all agreed that the group is to be identified with the anti-Mutazilites. Of the above mentioned scholars, Van Vloten devotes the longest study to the Hashwiyya.15 After tracing the growth of Mutazilism, he contends rightly that the orthodoxy of the Ashtarites was a later historical development which utilized the methods of the Muthazila in reinterpreting the views of the venerated predecessors. But in earlier times an orthodox party had already flourished which actively opposed the methods and conclusions of the Mu-tazila. In this orthodox mass the Hashwiyya were included. The name he derives from hashw, common people, and Hashwiyya will therefore mean " vulgaristes." With no intention to disprove Van Vloten's conclusions,-it will indeed be found that his major thesis is practically true,-a few critical remarks may be in place. Owing to the paucity of sources, the Dutch scholar failed to pursue the transformation of tradition- ism into later Hanbalism and the consequent acceptance by the latter of the Hashwiyya doctrines (His assertion that such men as Mdlik ibn Ands and Ahmad ibn Hanbal " did not concern them- selves with dogmatics"1 is false). He also misunderstood the character of the Ndbita, a group of similarly undefined scope, whom 12 See below. 13 L. c.; see below. 14 Die Person Mohammeds, 138: Da wir es in beiden Fillen (Karramiyya and Hashwiyya) mit Richtungen zu tun haben, die zum Teil nur wegen radikaler tbertreibung gewisser Seiten der orthodoxen Anschauung als Sekten bezeichnet werden.... 16 Actes du onzieme Congres des Orientalistes, 1897, Section Musulmane, 99-115. 16 L. c., 106.</page><page sequence="3">The Ijashwiyya 3 he regarded as the fighting group in the midst of the Hashwiyya; 17 this point is absolutely baseless. Finally, as in the case of the Murjites,12 he accentuated their dogmatic position and overlooked their political views. The last defect was corrected by Houtsma, at least in so far as the Ndbita are concerned.19 He maintained on the contrary that the real characteristic of the Ndbita was their hatred for 'Ali. This again is an exaggeration. It is neither the most peculiar trait, nor is it so positive. It is much more a feeling of friendliness for 'Ali's opponents, but it hardly developed into antagonism, let alone hatred, towards 'Ali. loutsma subscribed to Van Vloten's identi- fication of the Hashwiyya, but rejected his derivation of the name. He preferred instead to connect it with the word hashia, a marginal gloss, and was led to it by the Zaidite Ahlmad b. Yalhya who offered the same etymology and blamed the Orthodox for accepting all tra- dition indiscriminately, even those interpolated by infidels.20 The purpose of this article is to sketch the development and doc- trines of the Hashwiyya. It aims to define the extent to which they are identifiable with the Ashib-al-Hadith and Hanbalites; to account for the universal condemnation and contempt felt for the party, and to offer an explanation of the name in view of the obtained results. A number of recently edited, or newly utilized sources, have provided much valuable material, and have facilitated the study considerably. I. In order to acquire more specific knowledge concerning the views of the Hashwiyya it is advisable to inquire first into their political leanings.1 Heresiographers are so frequently prone to impute theo- 17 L. c., 108. Van Vloten bases his conclusion on the expression ndbita al-Hashwiyya in Fihrist, 180. 18 See his article in answer to Goldziher's conclusions about the Murjites (cf. ch. 1, note 3), ZDMG, XLV (1891), 161-171. So also Kremer, Herr- schende Ideen, 16. '9ZA, XXVI (1911), 201. 20 L. c., 197-200. 1 The discussions concerning the Hashwiyya, both among Muslims and Europeans, have thus far, almost without exception, centered about their theological dogmas. Cf. Shahrastani, I, 68, 76; Iji (ed. Soerensen), 362; Van Vloten and Houtsma, 1. c.; and others.</page><page sequence="4">4 A. S. Halkin logical heresies to sects, particularly to those whose attitudes are not clearly defined,2 that it is preferable, wherever possible, not to utilize the information afforded by the sources regarding their reli- gious dogmas as the primary line of characterization. Furthermore, as Goldziher has demonstrated in connection with the Murjites,3 it is altogether proper to assume, at least in the case of early parties, that a political issue as well as a religious one led to their birth; an issue which in the course of time lost its importance and was forgotten. That the Hashwiyya held political views we learn from several sources. Mastdi alludes twice to theI Hashwiyya and Nhbita as adherents of certain principles in the matter of the appointment of the Imj-m.4 Al-Jdhiz furnishes us much valuable information, biased no doubt by his own Mu'tazilism, regarding the political orientation of the Ndbita.5 He relates that this group bade the 2 Friedlinder as well as some earlier scholars maintain that the Saba- iyya, a ShI'ite sect founded by the Jew 'Abdallah b. Saba, were made " the scapegoat for all subsequent heresies in Islam," JAOS, XXIX (1909), 100; and, at greater length, ZA, XXIII (1909), 319-21. Similar elasticity prevails with regard to the Mushakkiklina, Islam, III (1912), 223-5, the Mushabbiha, Mujassima, Sifatiyya, etc. Cf. Strothmann, Staatsrecht d. Zaiditen, 29-30. 3Muh. St., ii, 89-93; Vorlesungen2, 79-80. The same is true of the two outstanding Jewish groups in the Second Commonwealth, the Sadducees and Pharisees. Curiously, a political origin of the name Mu'tazila- explained by the neutrality of " persons or groups of persons " in the War of the Camel and the Battle of Siffin-has recently been suggested by Ahmed Amin of Cairo. Actes du XVIIIe Congres des Orientalistes, Leiden, 1932, 224. 4Tanbih (ed. de Goeje), 232, 273, 337. We gather from these references that the Hashwiyya believed in the election of the Imam by the community or part of it, as over against the assertion of those who maintained that the Imamate was bestowed by the Prophet and by his successors after him. See below. 6 The identity of the Hashwiyya and Nabita can be affirmed without the shadow of a doubt. In addition to the circumstantial evidence afforded us by the frequent juxtaposition of the two group-names (cf. Tanbih, above), we have direct proof that the two terms indicate the same group. The Taj-al-'Aris calls the Nabita a party from among the Hashwiyya (cited by Van Vloten, 1. c., 108, note 1, who accepts the identification), " Zamakh- shari and others say they are the same as the Hashwiyya " (de Goeje, Tanbih, XXXIX). The statement of ibn Kutaiba that the Ashdb-al-Hadith "were nicknamed Hashwiyya, NAbita, Mujabbira " (Mukhtalif al-Hadith, 96) carries still greater weight, and so also the declaration of Muhammad</page><page sequence="5">The Hashwiyya 5 community cherish the 'Umayyads. "Do not calumniate him (Mu'dwiya) for he is one of the Companions. To calumniate Mulwiya is an innovation. Whoever hates him contradicts the Sunna." 6 To this Al-Jdhiz retorts: " They believe that the Sunna obligates us not to declare ourselves free from one who disacknowl- edges the Sunna." Further on he discusses their attitude at greater length. They hold of course that murder is wrong. " Yet when the murderer is an unjust Sultan or a disobedient Prince they do not permit (anyone) to criticize him., repudiate him, or remove him . . . even if he threatens the righteous, kills the theologians, starves the beggar, wrongs the weak, leaves the borders and frontiers undefended, drinks wine and sins publicly.7 lloutsma rightly corrects Van Vloten's rendering of E i ) to mean more especially their hatred for 'Ali,8 but we need not take it literally for, as Friedhinder has noted,9 the terms ndsib, nawdsib came to mean Sunnites generally even where no hatred for 'Ali was preached. The Muttazilite al-Khayydt also refers to the opposition on the part of his group to the " Ndbita who befriend the oppressive Syrian gang." 10 The most valuable source for the political doctrines of the Hashwiyya is the recently published Firak1 al-Shlta by Naubakhti.11 b. Idris al-Hantali that the Zendiks call the orthodox Hashwiyya and the Rawafid call them Nabita (Majma'at al-Rasd'il al-Muniriyya, ed. Muhlam- mad Munir al-Dimishki, Cairo, 1343, 132-3).-The definition of the term is hard to determine. An etymological relation to the stem y is to my mind out of the question. One is tempted to see a connection with the ethnic group by the same name despite the different " t." Since the sobriquet originated among the Rawafid who represented most conservative views on the qualifications for the Imamate, it is possible that they branded those with laxer views Ndbita, as if to designate that the latter could elect a Nabatean to the Imamate. For a similar application of the term Ndbita see Goldziher, Muh. St., I, 157. Besides, Jahiz repeats that the Nabita were very democratic in their attitude to non-Arabs, and particularly to those who were not Persians. L. c., 122. 6 Van Vloten, 1. c., 118.

Ace. to the editor, the ShI'ite</page><page sequence="6">6 A. S. Halkin In it we read: "When 'Ali was slain, the party which had fol- lowed him, with the exception of a small number in his group and of those who maintained his right to the Imdmate after the Prophet, met the group that had supported Talha, al-Zubair and 'Aisha and joined forces with Mutawiya ibn Abu Sufydn. These comprise the vast majority: the ahl-al-Iashw, the followers of the kings, and the supporters of the victorious, I mean those who joined Mu'dwiya. They were commonly called Murjites because they accepted opposing parties, believed that all the ahl-al-Kibla 12 were believers by pronouncing a confession of faith, and hoped for for- giveness for all." 13 The equation Hashwiyya-Murjites, as indeed Hashwiyya-masses should be noted." Like the Murjites, the Hashwiyya owes its genesis to a political issue. We also learn that the name is by no means applicable to a well defined group, includ- ing as it does virtually the whole community.15 It is important however that the devotion to the 'Umayyads is greatest among the ashlab-al-hadithi6 the later Hanbalites. Mukaddasi speaks of a group of fanatic Hanbalites who carry their love for Mu'dwiya to extremes.17 He further relates an incident at the home of a very pious man in Ispahan. The latter classed Mudwiya with the first four Khalifs. When our author objected he was branded as a Rdfidi.18 In the writings of the Hanbalites this attitude to Murdwiya and the other 'Umayyads is maintained. To Alhmad ibn Hanbal several remarks to this effect are ascribed. Ibrahim ibn Suwaid, who told traditions directly from Alhmad, reported that while heresiographer Abu Muhammad al-Hasan ibn Malsa al-Naubakhti lived in the second half of the third century A. H., introd., XVI. 12 J. e., people who believe that prayer should be offered in the direction of Mecca. It is a more inclusive term than ahl-al-sunna wa'l jamd'a, and was probably preferred by the Murjites for that reason. 13 P. 6. 14 This equation, as already pointed out by Friedhinder (JAOS, XXIX, 1909, 159) is implied by Mukaddasi, 37 &amp; 38. 15 Naubakhti's honesty in reporting the comparatively small proportion of his own party, and throughout the book, is exceptional enough to deserve attention. 16Bad'wal-Ta'rikh, v, 149. In answer to ibn Rawendi, ibn Khayyott con- tends that, far from blaming any of the ancients, the Ashdb-al-Hadith cherish the memory of even those to whom one is in duty bound to hate and feel inimical.

They conceded the execution of these duties to any Imrnm who is appointed after the Prophet." 24 This stand is in every way the stand of the majority of the Ortho- dox Muslims.25 No Imdm was designated by Muhammad. True, there was a tendency to argue for an indirect proof of the choice of Abu Bekr by the Prophet,26 but, as Naubakhti explains it,27 it was 19 Ibn al-Farra', Tabakdt al-Hanabila, ed. Damascus, 56.

Halkin only a retort to the Shl'ite doctrine of a nass for "Ali.28 At any rate, the major premise of the Hashwiyya is altogether in line with the views of the Orthodox on the matter. To the civil wars conducted by the opponents of 'Ali against the latter, the reaction of the Hashwiyya is shared by only one group- though it consists of the predominant majority-, the Ahl-al- Hadith. The range of opinion on the rights of the Party of the Camel,29 or of Mutawiya, in their strifes with "Ali is wide. While the Sh!'ites are unanimous in condemning anyone who took up arms against their only legitimate Khalif, the other factions in Islam, particularly the conciliatory Ash'arites, were faced with a serious difficulty. Realizing on the one hand that "Ali was in the right,80 they found it impossible, in view of the promise of Paradise to Talha and al-Zubair 31 and, above all, of the active participation of Geisha, the Mother of the Faithful, in the campaign against 'Ali, to blame the Party of the Camel outright. Ingenious explanations were therefore sought, and gradually evolved, generally to the effect that those three, far from fighting "Ali, either intended to arrange peace between the warring camps (tAisha) ,82 or finally 28 For the Shb'ites this is a major question.

Her activities in fomenting rebellion against 'Ali right after 'Uthmdn's assassination are well-known, and her hostility to 'Ali, dating from Muhammad's time, outlived her defeat by him as is illustrated by her remark to the victor, Tab.

Above all, it is utilized by ibn Taimiyya.39 But on the whole they preferred the attitude which the IIashwiyya maintained: " The HIashwiyya and Abu Bekr al-AsamM 40 and those who profess their views say that tAli and Talha and al-Zubair were not justified in their war; only 33This assertion is supported by most authorities.

But, as their opponents justly criticize them, they themselves had agreed to an arbitration, and even urged it. Cf. the so-called speech and letter of 'Ali to the Khawdrij in pseudo-ibn Kutaiba's Siyasa, 227-9. 38 Ash'ari, MaklaIt, ii, 457; this became a favorite method with later historians, ib., 454; Ibn Hjazm, 1. c., IV, 160-63 goes into an elaborate dis- cussion to prove that they were actuated by Ijtikad.

Halkin those who refrained from fighting acted rightly. However they cherish them all, though they declare themselves free of their war, and refer their matter to God." 41 This statement is corroborated by other sources, although they do not specify the Hashwiyya by name.42 That this policy of abstaining from judging as well as commending those who did not fight was greatly favored by the Hanbalites is clearly proved by Ibn Hazm: " Sad ibn Abu Wakkas and 'Abdallah b. 'Umar and the mass of Companions were inclined to assume a neutral position in respect of tAli and the Party of the Camel. This policy is adopted by the mass of the Ahl-al-Sunna as well as by Abu Bekr al-Kaisan."43 Ahmad ibn Hanbal is said to have refused to discuss what happened between 'Ali and Mutawiya.44 A similar preference for silence on this subject is also expressed by such Hanbalite writers as treat it at all. 'Abd-al-KIidir al-Jildni (471-560 A. H.), a Hanbalite of S-afic inclinations, while attempting to whitewash all the participants in the civil war, stresses the advisability of withholding judgment.45 Ibn Taimiyya refers to the disputes several times and always urges a policy of being non-committal,46 " Similarly we believe in maintaining neu- 41 Naubakhti, 14. 42 Ash'ari, Makdlat, ii, 458 (he names them ( 1$); Baghdadi, Usfll, 290; Mukaddasi, 293. 43 IV, 153. It is interesting to compare the reasons suggested for the neutrality of these men. According to the Orthodox, MuhI ammad disap- proved of Muslims fighting [Ibn Kutaiba, Siydsa, I, 89-90; the hostility to 'Ali implicit in the answers of 'Abdallah b. 'Umar and Sa'd b.

'Ali (his hesitancy, outweighed by his ambition, Well- hausen, Oppositionsparteien, 65 and 70, does not alter the situation); note also ibn 'Umar's condemnation of those who curse Yezid, Ah. mad b. Hanbal's Musnad, ii, 48-is not difficult to discover]. The Mu'tazilites who do not approve of neutrality account for it in two ways. Some say that these abstained because they felt that their aid was unnecessary in view of the large army which 'Ali brought with him. Others cannot understand it, but are certain that the neutrals sympathized with 'Ali. Intisdr, 100. 44 Tabakdt al-Handbila, 58 and 213. See also ibn al-Jauzi's Mandkib Ahmad b.

God knows best,50 whether it is right or wrong. But we shall cherish them all." 51 Ash'ari, who reports the same declaration almost verbatim, attri- butes it to the Abstainers ( (} J.) ) .52 We do not find any specific remarks from the pen of the Hanbalites about the Arbitration except a report that Ahmad b. Hanbal invoked God's blessing on 'Amr b. al-'Is and Abu Mfisa al-Ashtari.53 However, the efforts made by them to justify Mu'awiya while recognizing that "Ali was more entitled to the Caliphate 54 indicate that their position on this angle of the problem was the same as on the wars.

SulaimAn who, in his zeal for the Shl'ites denied that 'Ali consented to arbitration or appointed a referee; and also denied any battles between 'Ali and Talha and al-Zubair, Makd1dt, ii, 454 and 458. 48 Ras'il, I, 297. 49 The arbitration was agreed upon by both Mu'dwiya and 'Ali after the Battle of Siffin, and they appointed one referee each. But by a foul play 'Amr ibn al-'A, Mu'5wiya's representative, proclaimed the latter Khalif, and Abu M-lsa al-Ash'ari, the other referee, acquiesced. On the judgment of the two arbitrators we find opinion as divided as on the previous issue See MakWlUt, ii, 452-4, Naubakhti, 14-15; Baghdddi, Usul-al-Din, 292-3.

Halkin the political alignment of the Ashdb-al-HIadith and Hanbalites is offered us in the polemics of two mutual opponents neither of whom was a sympathizer of the Orthodox. "The author of the book (i. e. ibn Rawendi) writes: 'The Ashab-al-Hadith censure most of the Companions of the Prophet for drawing their swords against people who pronounce the la-iliha-il-lldahu. They maintain that the right course was followed by Sa'd, ibn 'Umar, 'Usama, and Muhammad ibnl Mlaslaina. These constituted a small group, and those whom they accuse of sin are superior in rank and number.' But he lied regarding the Ashab al-Hadith. The Ashab al-Iadith accuse none of the Companions of the Prophet. On the other hand, they go to such unbounded limits in this matter as to love even those to whom valid evidence compels us to be hostile and steer clear of." 5 Ibn Rawendi does not lie, nor does ibn Khayydt, for both statements are true. II. The theological identity of the Hashwiyya seems at first harder to delimit than the political. Although there is a greater quantity of material extant, that very abundance is an obstacle. Having become, during the centuries, a vague term of insult, the name was made to denote all manner of heresy and vagary. An authentic delineation of their attitude is probably afforded us by Ghazdli who characterizes the Hashwiyya as "believing themselves bound to a blind and routine submission to the criterion of human authority and to the literal meaning of the revealed books." 1 On the basis of this we may surmise that the differences between them and the more rational theological schools will revolve about those delicate questions which have embarrassed thinkers of all religions. They will include such problems as God's essence, His attributes, the pre-existence of the Kur'an, etc. This conjecture is borne out by the available evidence. Overlooking for the present several stray tenets imputed to the Hashwiyya, we may draw our information from three sources. The oldest of these is the polemic of Jdhiz (150-250 A. H.) against the Nabita.2 Says J1hizi: "One group among them (the people) 66 Intisar, 143. 1Al-iktisad fil-i'tiked (tr. Asin), 23-4. 2 On the identification of the Hashwiyya with the Nabita see ch. 1, note 5.</page><page sequence="13">The Hashwiyya 13 asserted that God will be seen,3 without adding any explanation. If it feared being suspected of anthropomorphism, it explained: He will be seen bila kaifa, thus avoiding Tajsrim and Tamwir. But the Nabita sprouted,4 and this secessionist group insisted: He is a body; and it ascribed form and limits to Him and declared anyone who believes in the beatific vision without Tajsim and Taswir to be a heretic.5 Again, most of them maintain that God's Word is excellent and clear, evidence and proof; that the Torah is distinct from the Psalms, the Psalms from the Gospel, the Gospel from the Kur'dn, and the Sura of the Cow from the Family of 'Imran; that God supervised its composition and made it a proof of the veracity of His messenger; that if He wished to add to it, He could, and if to subtract from it, He could; He could alter it if He wished, or abrogate it if He wished; that He revealed it, divided it into chapters; that it came into being through God and none other, and that none other but God is capable of it; yet despite all this, God did not create it. They thus attribute to it all the characteristics of a created object, yet withhold from it the name creation. ... The acts of disobedience of this community had never exceeded sin and error . . . until the Ndbita and their followers, the masses, appeared. Now the prevailing trend of this generation is Kufr, that is anthropomorphism and determinism." 6 We hear next from Mutahhar ibn Thhir al-Makdisi 7 who con- tributes a most dispassionate description of the Hashwiyya declar- ing that they believe "that faith consists of verbal confession, works and knowledge; that it is increased by acts of obedience and decreased by sin; that the most excellent people after the Apostle 3Arabic reads la yura (p. 120), but it is an obvious mistake. 4 A play of words in the original: nabatat al-N4bita. 6 A variant reads: L 1 J* 5 Al-Jahiz' assertion that the rejection of bila-kaifa is the distinguishing mark of the Nabita must be interpreted as the result of a conscious desire not to censure all the Traditionists. That the charge is groundless is evident from the paragraph by Iji, quoted below, as well as from the thesis of the entire article. 8 Van Vloten, I. c., 120-122. Another Mu'tazilite, al-KhayyAt, calls Tashbih, Ijbdr and Irjd' the doctrines of the Nabita, Intisir, 145. A recon- sideration of the Murjite sect will doubtless reveal that it was repre- sentative of the masses of Islam, and that the sectarianism is due to a misunderstanding. 7His book, al-Bad' wal-Ta'rikh was composed in 355 A. H. Islam, XVIII (1929), 41.</page><page sequence="14">14 A. S. Halkin were Abu Bekr, 'Umar, tUthman and 'Ali. They differ regarding the others. It has been reported that Ahmad ibn Hanbal said: " If some one were to say, then 'Ali, I would postpone judgment and follow the tradition of ibn 'Umar I) 8 (They further believe) that 9 Mu'dwiya is the uncle of the Faithful and the Khallf of the Lord; that whoever says the Kur'an is created is a disbeliever." 10 Our third source is Iji who, in his discussion of Muslim sects, has the following to say of the Hashwiyya: 1 "The anthropo- morphist Hashwiyya like Mudar and Kahmas and al-Ilujaimi 12 assert He is a body (not like other bodies)"3 of flesh and blood (unlike all other flesh and blood). He possesses limbs (and organs, and it is possible for Him to touch, shake hands with and embrace the sincerely pious who visit Him and whom He visits in this world) so (it has been transmitted), that one of them said: 1 " Preserve me from the beard and the pudenda and remove me from what is behind it ( ?)" 15 We may conclude from the above fragments that what dis- tinguished the Hashwiyya as a group were their doctrines on the Person of God, on the Kur'dn and on Free-will, which were based 8The reference is to a tradition related by 'Abdallah ibn 'Umar according to which the men were ranked during the life time of the Prophet in the following order: Abu Bekr, 'Umar, 'Uthmdn. After 'Uthman five are mentioned as of equal rank, each of them worthy of the Khalifate: 'Ali, Talha, al-Zubair, 'Abd-al-Rahmdn b. 'Awf, Sa'd. Ibn al Jauzi, op. cit., 161.

Virtually the same information is sup- plied by Shahrastdni, 76-7. 12 From Shahrastani, ib., it appears that these three were all Sh'ites. Ash'ari mentions only the first two, and does not tell anything about their adherence to the Shl'ite party. 13 The parentheses contain Jurjani's running commentary on Iji's work. The attempt to remove likeness to humans is an answer to al-Jahiz. 14 The following statement was made by the Shl'ite (JAOS, XXVIII (1907), 31) Da'ud al-Jawaribi.

But what impresses us in their teachings is their absolute agreement with the Hanbalites- the former ashab-al-hadith. It will carry us too far afield to pre- sent here a detailed exposition of the Hanbalite theology. How- ever a few salient characteristics will suffice to convince us of this truth. The IHanbalites also insist on a literal interpretation of the text. God must be described in the same terms in which He has described Himself.16 He possesses an eye, a face, knowledge, strength, power, will, speech.17 He is capable of pleasure and anger, life, wakeful- ness, rejoicing, laughter, and so on.'8 He sits on His throne,"' descends at night to the lower heavens to forgive and grant requests; 20 He will come to us on the clouds; or accompanied by rows of angels.21 These verses may not be altered or interpreted. But they disclaim any inclination to anthropomorphism and, of course, to its opposite-ta'ttl (divesting) .22 Consequently the famous principle of bila icaif a first enounced by MUik b. 'Ands is their mainstay. It is utilized by the founder Ahmad, and by all his successors repeatedly.23 It follows as a matter of course that the beatific vision is accepted by them literally, again bilc Icaifa.24 18 Ibn Taimiyya, Rasa'il, I, 270 &amp; 387. On 428 he cites a statement by Ahlmad ibn Hanbal to the same effect; Abu 'Uthman Isma'l1 al-Sdbfini in Rasaitl Muniriyya, I, 107; Schreiner, in ZDAIG, LII (1898), 531, note 2. 17 Sdbfini, ib.; Schreiner, ib.; Makdlct, I, 211; see also the Khallf al- Radi's letter of rebuke to the Hanbalites in Ibn Athlr, VIII, 230. 18 SAbfini, ib.; Ghunya, 62; Schreiner, ib. and 532, note 1; Ibn Taimiyya, Rasa'il, I, 441. 19 Ghunya, ib.; SAbfini, 110-112; Ibn Taimiyya, 1. c., 395 and 436-39, 447; see especially his sixth epistle, I, 257-61.

S. Halkin The same unflinching addiction to text and tradition is revealed in their views on the Kur'an. It is literally the word of God 24 which He spoke physically to His prophet.25 But it is an eternal, uncreated Kur'an,26 a true attribute of God like His hearing or seeing.27 This is true not alone of the copy guarded between the two covers. It is equally true of every written copy, whether pre- pared by a pious individual as a lectionary or by a student as an exercise. Every oral recitation of the Kur'An is eternal, and so is the text remembered by heart.28 There can be no differentiation. AIhimad ibn IIanbal and his adherents do not tire of condemning as a heretic everyone who draws distinctions between a divine Kur'an and a human execution of it.29 25 SAbMni, 107; Ghunya, 67. 26 Same sources as in note 24. 27 Ghunya, 67. 28 See ibn HIanbal's letter to Musadad ibn Musarhad, Tabakat, 249; Mandkib, 167-8. Sabfini, 107-8, quotes Muhammad b. Ishiak ibn Khuzaima (see Schreiner, 1. c., 531), Isma'II al-Jurjani, and especially a passage from ibn Mahdi al-Tabari's 'I'tikdd. Ibn Taimiyya gives the idea a some- what different turn so as to make it sound more reasonable by explaining that the Word belongs to him who first spoke it and not to the one who speaks as a reporter or transmitter, Rasd'il, 293. He makes this point even clearer by asserting that " whoever relates in the name of A1hmad and his companions that the voice of the readers and the ink of the copybooks is eternal and pre-existent is a liar and a slanderer. Neither Ahmad nor any other Muslim sage said so," 1. c., 409. Certainly al-Subki is nearer the truth than ibn Taimiyya when he remarks: "No intelligent man will doubt that his utterance is a created act which is of God's creations. How- ever Ahmad denied it because of the evil consequences (or knottiness) of the statement (LI1= ' &amp; J ) ." Cited in Tabakit, 12, note 2. A similar explanation is also offered by Muhammad ibn JarIr (sic! Read Mahdi) al-Tabari in his work I'tikad and is cited by Sabfini, 109. 29 Their anger is directed against the Lafthiyya, the Wakif-ina and the Jahmiyya (on the relation between the Hanbalites and the Jahmitcs see the next note). The Lafthiyya are those who maintain that the Kur'An as pronounced by man is created; the Wdkiffina hesitate to commit them- selves,-an epithet which may well be applied to a good many Ash'arites. For the vigorous condemnation of these groups see Mandkib, 157-9; Tabaklt, 425, s. v. ALJ, 1; Sabfini, 108-9; Ghunya, 65; Ibn Taimiyya, 1. c., 396, with the same explanation as above. But he utilizes a statement ascribed to Ahmad that " whoever says, my reading -of the Kur'An is created, is a Jahmi, and whoever says it is uncreated is an innovator " (Rasd'il, I, 410; see also, Sdbfini, ib.). There can be little question that this tradition is groundless, and is one of those "pious frauds " so numerous in the field of tradition. Cf. also Mawkdl2t-al-Islamiyyin, I, 292.</page><page sequence="17">The HIashwiyya 17 Their doctrines on Free-will closely approach the determinism of the Jabariyya.30 Every human act from time immemorial to the resurrection is inscribed on the Written Tablet.31 God is absolute master of all human acts. He is the source of their fortune and misfortune.32 He is the author of their good as well as evil deeds.33 It is by His will that one becomes a believer or an unbeliever,84 and He determines before a man's birth whether he is destined to enter Paradise or is doomed to Hell.35 Some Hanbalite authors predicated a certain amount of free-will to man, so as to avoid the obvious injustice of punishment for sins.36 Furthermore the belief is current that God feels gratified by the good works of the pious and is angered by the acts of the disobedient.37 But the problem is knotty, not only for them but even for the more rationalistic schools-perhaps even more so. It cannot be said that a man like ibn Taimiyya is satisfied with his solution of this problem.38 Nor SO It is possible that in this determinism lies the reason for their un- relenting abuse of the Jahmiyya. True, they are antagonistic to the sect for its position on the Kur'&amp;n (see references in above note). But it is a little difficult to see why their attacks should be directed against the Jahmiyya rather than the Mu'tazilites. To my mind, the reason is that they sought to distinguish themselves from the group which, like them, believed in Jabar. 3' Ghunya, 73; Ibn Taimiyya, 1. c., 399. 32 Ahmad's letter (Tabakat, 250; Mandkib, 169); abfini, 126-7; Ghunya, 73-4; Ibn Taimiyya, 399-400; Makaldt al-Islamiyin, I, 291. 33 Makalat, ib.; Ghunya, 74. 34 Sdbini, 126; Makaldtt I, 291-2; Ibn Taimlya, 1. c., 271. S6 In Ahmad's letter we read: . &gt;. (A JJ &lt; o i (1c9 )t.-) ... LWi See also below. " This view is defended by ibn Taimiyya who distinguishes between God's kadar and His Will. God is the creator of a will in man which has a certain activity by God's kadar. See Rast'il, I, 399-400, and 271. There is undoubtedly a similarity in this view between him and ibn Ilazm. Ibn Taimiyya's desperate attempt to ward off the charge of Jabarism would certainly meet the approval of Shahrastdni who remarks that whoever grants man any influence at all over his acts is not a Jabarite, 59. 37 Sdbfini, 127; Ibn Taimiyya, 1. c., 400. 38 Cf. the following exposition: They believe that the human possesses power and will and activity, and that he is a chooser ()Lz*.0 ). They do not call him majbfur, since the majbfir is one who is coerced against his choice. God made man capable of choosing what he does. He is a choosing and a willing being, but God creates his choosing and willing capacity, 1. c., 271. To me this sounds very weak, and it is doubtful 2</page><page sequence="18">18 A. S. Halkin did other Traditionists fail to see the insurmountable difficulty of their position. But at the same time God's omnipotence is the only standard of justice, so that the most representative statement of their attitude is to be found in the tradition in which it is related, inter alia, that before the child's birth " God will send an angel to inform him of four things: - his material situation, his religious acts, the time of his death, and whether he will be unfortunate or fortunate. By Him who has power over my life, if one of you should perform works entitling you to Paradise so that only a span separates it from you, that will overtake him which was previously prescribed for him in the Book. He will finally perform an act dooming him to Hell and will go there." These beliefs, with only the slightest variations, recur in the writ- ings of all the Ashib-al-Iadith 39a and the later Hanbalites. The following extracts from the credo of al-Ash'ari, who, though he gave his name to the Ash ariyya whom the Hanbalites considered their bitterest enemies, declared himself a follower of Ahmad ibn Hanbal without reservations and qualifications,40 will sum up the views of the Hanbalites. It should be added that this credo was accepted by no less staunch and pugnacious a partisan than ibn Taimiyya: 41 whether it seemed any sounder to ibn Taimiyya. Certainly the point of view of Sabudni is more in line with traditionism when he states that while evil is God's creation just like good, we should not speak of God as creator of evil, because people think it a defect. In this manner he explains those verses or traditions in which man arrogates certain powers to himself, 1. c., 127. 39 In some versions of this tradition the possibility of a sinful man entering Paradise if it was preordained is also treated. Ghunya, 74. The tradition is cited by all Hanbalite writers, e. g., Sabilni, 126; Ibn Taimiyya, 399; Ghunya, 73-4, etc. For the original sources of this saying see Wen- sinck, Handbook of early Muhammadan Tradition, 54, s. v. Decree. 39a Ibn Kutaiba, for example, expresses himself as follows: " For the Ashab-al-Hadith are unanimously agreed that what God wishes exists and what He does not wish does not exist; that God is the creator of good and evil; that the Kur'an is the word of God, uncreated; that God will be seen on the day of resurrection; that the two Sheikhs (Abu Bekr and 'Umar) are prior; and that we believe in the Tortures of the Grave." Mukhtalif, 19. 40 Al-Ash'ari declares his adherence in Ibdna (ed. Hyderabad), 8.

It becomes clear from the preceding discussion that the dis- tinguishing policy of the Ashab-al-HIadith and Hanbalites is Tawakcuf 1-being non-committal. It consists on the one hand in accepting literally all Kur'dnic passages as well as the oral tradi- tions, and in revering the past generations, and, on the other, in referring to God all the inevitable difficulties which result from this indiscriminate credence. It is a comfortable policy, trying to hold both ends of the rope. Indeed, ibn Taimiyya does not hesitate to call its adherents the middle party.2 It is a secure policy; its adherents do not run the danger of pursuing doctrines which God may abhor; they repeat only what God has said.3 It may even be the sanest policy. Certainly their argument is logical: where faith rests so firmly on the validity of the revealed book and its oral tradition, it has a right to conclude that no contradictions exist in them. If contradictions are apparent man cannot hope to dispose of them. Just as the entire concept of God's omnipotence raises His standards of justice beyond human reason, so that if God chose to call right wrong and wrong right He could do so,4 so in the field 1 Other terms are also current, e. g., Imsdk 'anr, sukiit 'an, etc. 2 "c The Ahl-al-Sunna wal-Jama'a believe in this as they believe in what God has related in his book, without alteration or divesting (&lt;3.L" ) and without qualification or comparison (}9.3). In fact, they are the middle party among the sects of the community, just as our nation is the middle one among nations. In the matter of God's attributes they take the middle course between the Jahmiyya divestors and the Mushabbiha who compare; in the matter of God's works, between the Kadariyya and the Jabariyya; in the matter of retribution, between the Murjiyya and the Kadarite Wa'idiyya and others; in the matter of faith and religion, between the Hariiriyya and the Mu'tazila, and between the Murjiyya and the Jahmiyya; in the matter of the Companions of the Apostle, between the Khawarij and the Raw~afid."

If God can countenance contradictions we must accept them in the belief that they are contradictions only to our imperfect human mind. Besides, the Mutazilites and Ash'ar- ites with all their rationalizing tendencies are compelled after all to enounce certain dogmas which the human mind cannot grasp.6 The Hanbalites take the shorter course and reach the same conclu- sion: Since we are incapable of understanding everything why attempt to understand anything? 7 This sentiment pervades their entire theology and is traced by them to the earliest stages of Muslim dogmatics. Already the Prophet is said to have laid down the principle that human beings are to follow blindly without changing or inquiring.8 Malik b.

To prove the uselessness of the dialectic approach to theology, he adduces the following arguments: 1) the mind cannot tackle it; 2) the references which have been transmitted do not admit interpretation (Ta'wil); 3) the mass of facts, as is known, have been revealed by the Apostle as incumbent, like the five pray- ers, and the fast of Ramaddn, so that interpretation applied to the former is of the same sort as the allegorization which the Kardmita and the Bdtiniyya 17 applied to the Pilgrimage, the Fast, prayers and the other prophetic commandments. Therefore the pillars among these worthy people recognize that the mind has no access to the truth in connection with the theological questions. Since it is so, it is necessary to receive these prophetic teachings as they are.18 Goldziher sums up the position of the Ashab al-Hadith in his characterization of them. " [They] take a purely passive or rather negative stand on these problems. It is marked by the position 13 Ibn Taimiyya, I. c., 433; the passage has been published by Schreiner in ZDMG, LIII (1899), 74-5. 14 Ibn Taimiyya, I. c., 436. 'ZDMG, LII (1898), 528-35.

It does not even make an attempt to penetrate into the meaning of the anthropomorphistic expressions.... A i9 In the face of such an attitude, it was natural for the Muttazila to sneer at the Ashab-al-Hadith, the Hanbalites of an earlier age. It was equally natural for the Shl'ites and the Jahmiyya to scorn them. These groups all maintained certain well defined principles. They attempted to reach conclusions and, in the manner of so many thinkers of all ages, were convinced of the validity of their conclu- sions. Could they regard otherwise a mass of people whose charac- teristic was shirking, who preferred the comforts of an evasive bila kaifa to the dangerous realms of rationally understood divine attri- butes ? What could they think of students who repeated and believed everything that was written instead of reconciling contra- dictory verses, who could speak of an eternal IKur'ln created by God, or of righteous and wicked without choice of their own? What respect could they have for unscrupulous parties which con- fessed their love for every Khalif and ancient without applying standards of justice by which some would be disqualified? The Hanbalites were irresponsible word-mongers, unconcerned about the demands of reason and unburdened with the need for a logical system. It is in this sense that we ought to understand the primary mean- ing of the term Hashwiyya. The name is probably derived from Hashw, redundant speech,20 prolixity, which may be easily applied to loose speaking. The Hashwiyya will therefore be the loose speak- ers, people who do not make careful statements, who do not knit their thoughts into a logical, well developed system, but say words aimlessly and meaninglessly. They are the " parleurs inconsideres " as Quatremere 21 has rendered the term. This explanation does not of course exclude other interpretations. It is even plausible that 19 Zahiriten, 133. '20 Cf. Lane, s. v. 21 Cited in Idrisi, ed. Dozy et de Goeje, 286. It seems to me that this meaning is still preserved by Hujwiri, Kashf al Mahjftb (tr. Nicholson), 167, rendered (to my mind inexactly) " anthropomorphism " by the trans- lator.</page><page sequence="24">24 A. S. Halkin the name was selected because it lends itself to more than one mean- ing. Very possibly the notion of vulgus, baseness 22 may have been implied. The name is definitely contemptuous, and was doubtless applied by the opposing party. Whether it is of Sh'ite or of Mutazilite origin is difficult to determine. Houtsma's contention that the lat- ter are to blame for it 23 is not convincing. Ibn Kutaiba, whom he cites, can barely be claimed in his support.24 Similarly the passage he quotes from the Zaidite-i. e. Shl'ite-Ahmad b. Yahya, explain- ing the term to mean those who accept all traditions indiscrimi- nately 25 is not conclusive. It is more in the nature of popular etymology. It may be noted that the Shilite heresiographer Naubakhti finds the origin of the name in r&gt;tJ l .26 which agrees with our conclusion above. Documentary evidence that the disdainful name was directed against the Ashdb-al-Iadith is afforded us by several sources, both partisan and neutral. Naubakhti, whose truthfulness impresses us, makes the following identification between the IJashwiyya and the leading theologians: " The Murjites then split into four divisions and one division, called al-ShukklCk (the hesitant) 27 and al-Butriyya,'28 consists of the Traditionists, including such men as 22 This is the interpretation suggested by Van Vloten, 1. c., 105-6.

Idris al-Shdfi'i, Malik ibn Ands and their peers among the ahl-al-Hashw, and the masses generally.

Ibn Kutaiba's passage has already been cited. Masddi also employs the two synonymously.3oa Sdb-ni in his polemic against the oppon- ents of the Ashdb-al-HIadith writes: "The marks of heresy are clearly visible on its followers. Their most distinguishing mark and sign is their passionate hatred and contempt for those who transmit the traditions of the Prophet, and their calling them Hashwiyya, Ignoramuses, Literalists and Anthropomorphists." 31 He has preserved for us an important remark made by Abu HItim Muhammad ibn Idris al-Hantali: 32 " The sign of heretics is their disdain for the People of Tradition; the sign of the Zendiks is calling the People of Tradition lashwiyya, aiming by that at a nullification of the traditions; the sign of the Kadarites is naming the Sunnites Mujabbira; the sign of the Jahmiyya is naming the Sunnites Mushabbiha; the sign of the Rdfida is naming the Tra- ditionists Ndbita and Nasiba. But all this is partisan animosity; only one name is appropriate for the Sunnites, namely, Ashab al-Hadith." 3 Ibn Taimiyya tells us that a certain Ibrahim ibn 'Uthman ibn Dirbas composed a work called " The Preservation of the Imams of the Law from Infamous Epithets" in which many statements by the ancients regarding these nicknames were col- lected. A number of the Alkab are listed by ibn Taimiyya and are similar to those in the passage above.34 29 Pp. 6-7. so Vol. V, 148. 30at Murij, v. 443: &amp;4:IJ) L jC L ? S'L. c., 131. 82 195-277 A.

Halkin As a general term of insult, the meaning and purport of which became vaguer with time, it suffered two consequences which have aggravated the problem as to the scope and compass of the Hashwiyya. By those at whom the insult was hurled it was either overlooked or actively rejected. Those who arrogated to themselves the right to employ it used it liberally and indiscriminately. Thus the word lost its harshness and exactness.35 Among the adherents of the Ash.b-al-Hadith-with the centuries their numbers increased; every theologian claimed that he was treading the path of the ancients 36-we find a conscious avoidance of the name for quite some time. Authors like al-Ash ari, Baghdadi, ibn Hazm mention the worthy traditionists by all sorts of name or description 37 but do not employ the word Hashwiyya. Meanwhile the epithet became nobody's brandmark and everybody's weapon. Hanbalites and Ash'arites alike, all certain that they are the true heirs of the ancients,38 treated the Hashwiyya as a group apart from themselves on whom nothing but scorn should be heaped. Suafiites 3, In a work on the sects we find the Hashwiyya characterized as being a sect without a program ( L0 3 3 i;o '0 c(y3|). Cited in Strothmann, 1. c., 29, note 2. 36 'Abd-al-KAhir al-Baghdadi, for example, demonstrates the truthfulness of the Ash'arite claim to orthodoxy by accusing the various sects of having abandoned the path of the ancients and by boasting that only the Ash'arites are the true successors. Al-fark, 304-09. Examples can be multiplied. 37 Ash'ari calls them Wakiftina or merely kailfina (Makdlat, II, 453 and 458). Ibn Ilazm employs the usual expression 3 &lt;9) j Iv, 153; Baghdadi states their position without applying any name to them at all. Usfl al-Din, 290. 38 A charge is made by ibn al-Ahdal that the Hashwiyya Hanbalites falsely claim Ahmad ibn Hanbal as the father of their movement, and that the Ash'arites clear Ahmad of such doctrines, ZDMG, LII (1898), 536. Ibn Taimiyya is similarly accused of being the real formulator of Hanbalite dogmatics; (although another construction may be iput on this remark, judging from Ibn Taimiyya's answers which will also bear out our asser- tions) Rasa'il, I, 409. In the same way, Shahrastani, in tracing the history of Muslim attitude to attributes, considers the Ash'arites as the true followers of Ahmad ibn Hanbal, SufyAn al-Thauri and Daud al-Isfahani, 64-5.</page><page sequence="27">The Hlashwiyya 27 like Hujwiri,39 Ash'arites such as Ghazali,40 Fakhr-al-Din al-Rzi,41 Shahrastani,42 Iji543 Murtada 44 and even Hanbalites treat the Hashwiyya disdainfully, forgetting that they are insulting the very party whom they claim to venerate. A more or less mythical group was called into existence to bear the name Hashwiyya,4 as a scape- goat on whose back all true Muslims loaded the charges made against them. This is brought out most clearly in the following passage from ibn Taimiyya: " My opponent said that members of 39 He brands as Hashwiyya those who do not believe that saints exist at the present time (Kashf al-Mah ji0b, tr. Nicholson, 213; this is a gen- uinely orthodox doctrine, see Ibn Hazm, Fisal, V, 2-12, Goldziher, Muham. St., ii, 281 ff. and 368-378); that the Hashwiyya of Khurasan believe the saints to be superior to Prophets and that God is the locus of all pheno- mena (ib. 236 and 244; both these views were advanced by the Karra- miyya-as is also proved by HujwIri's allocating them in Khurasan, see Shahrastdni, 81 and Baghdddi, fark, 204 and Usiu at din, 167); see also ib. 289 and 316. 40 Al-iktisdd ft i'tikad (tr. Asin), Index II, s. v., Haxuies. 41 According to him the Hashwiyya deem it possible for prophets to commit deliberately both grievous and minor sins. Cited by Goldziher in Islam, III (1912), 239, note 1. 42 Haarbriicker's Index, s. v. Haschwija. 43 See above p. 14. 44 In him we find a perfect example of the uncritical manner in which these statements were made. While he attributes to them, as " anti- rationalists who did not participate in speculative and theological dis- putes," predestination (Jabar), anthropomorphism (without bitla kaifa ), and eternity of the Kur'An, he reports that acc. to Hakim (?), ibn Hanbal, Daud (al-Isfahdni ?), and Muhammad ibn Ishak ibn Khuzaima were adherents of the sect. Horten, Probleme d. spekulatiiven Theologie, 33. 45This assertion does not imply that the extremist views which the recognized parties rejected were not professed by anyone. The existence of sects which believed in a crass anthropomorphism is undeniable. What I maintain is that the application of the name lIashwiyya to holders of extravagant views is wrong, particularly if the application is made by men who hold the ancients in great esteem. In the first place it is con- trary to the very idea implicit in lIashwiyya-after all, anthropomor- phists advance well-defined doctrines. While the differences between the beliefs of a Hanbalite and of a Mushabbih may not be obvious, the term Hashwiyya is orginally'a description of hesitancy and not of any positive conclusions. Secondly, it impresses one as cowardice on the part of people who knew that the nickname was applied to them for centuries to employ the same lakab against others. Finally, this usage indicates a loss of historical perspective.</page><page sequence="28">28 A. S. Jalkin the Hashwiyya and the Mushabbiha and of similar tendencies pre- tended to be adherents of Ahmad (ibn Hanbal). "I answered: The Mushabbiha and Mujassima among those who are not of Ahmad's party are more numerous than those in it. All the Kurdish groups are Shafi'ite, and we find more Tashbih and Tajsim among them than can be found in any other group. The inhabitants of Jilan are Shafi'ites and Hanbalites. The pure Hanbalites do not have as much of it in their midst as there is in the others. The Mujassima Karrdmiyya are all Hanbalites. I said further to him: Who among our partisans is a Hashwi in the sense in which you employ it? Is it al-Athram, abu DMud, al-Merwezi, al-Hilal, etc. . . ? Then I raised my voice and said: Name them, tell me who they are! I) 46 It is also beautifully illus- trated in the Dictionary of Technical Terms. Among the possible explanations suggested for the word Hashwiyya the following is included: " It is said that by Ilashwiyya a group of people is meant who do not favor the close examination of the attributive passages, a literal interpretation of which is unacceptable. They believe what God wishes, while they decide that the literal meaning is not the wanted one." The Dictionary rejects this identification: " On the basis of this, to designate them by the name Hashwiyya is not at all to be approved, for it approximates the view of the ancients." The author of the Dictionary is certain that this is a mistaken explanation. We however know that with slight changes it is the only correct explanation. 46 Rasa'il, I, 410. It appears from ibn Taimiyya's expression " in the sense in which you employ it " that he knew of another meaning, or could have used if differently, perhaps one which would not be so contemptuous. At any rate, he seems to have been aware of the change in connotation. 47I, 397.</page></plain_text>
