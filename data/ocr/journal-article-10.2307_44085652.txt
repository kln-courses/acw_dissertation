<plain_text><page sequence="1">CAROL STEINHAGEN Dangerous Crossings Historical Dimensions of Landscape in Willa Cather's My Antonia , The Professor's House , and Death Comes for the Archbishop What must a man do to be at home in the world? There must be times when he is here as though absent , gone beyond words into the woven shadows of the grass and the flighty darknesses of leaves shaking in the wind , . . . - Wendell Berry, "The Silence" In The Professor's House (1925) both Tom Outland and Roddy Blake warn against the danger of crossing the river to the Blue Mesa. Roddy scorns Tom's warning as trite, observing, "Dangerous crossing; it's printed on signboards all over the world!" (223). Indeed, the idea if not the fact of such signboards dominates this novel, and it might be seen as a major motif of Willa Cather's fiction. Her novels and stories are marked by many dangerous crossings, including movement from one geo- graphical region to another, movement from isolating shelters like at- tic rooms into society, movement from conception to art, and move- ment from life to death. In exploring the primacy of intersections and crossings in Willa Cather and the Myth of American Migration (1995), Joseph R. Urgo emphasizes the cultural significance of Cather's depiction of inter- and transconti- nental movement (193). In three of her novels, however, Willa Cather extended her interest in crossing beyond the range of cultural and his- torical examination of territorial migration. At key points in My Antonia (1918), The Professor's House , and Death Comes for the Archbishop (1927),</page><page sequence="2">64 ISLE characters are brought to the edge of the boundary defined by western concepts of the human place in the universe. It seems as if they can step out of history by surrendering the sense of selfhood that has en- abled western people to perceive and control nature according to hu- man designs. Crossing into this a-historical sense of the human place in the universe challenges not only the concept of human supremacy but also the human capacity to make, to create. It challenges, in other words, the basis of the writer's art. Her characters' movements in and out of historically defined landscapes in the aforementioned novels represent Willa Cather's efforts to come to terms with her respect for the inherent power of nature and for the power of human beings to shape and design that nature. Landscape as it is understood to be the beautifully conceived set- tings of Willa Cather's novels has long been seen as a salient character- istic of her fiction. "More than other writers even from the Midwest," Alfred Kazin concludes, "Cather worked consciously with landscape, was unusually adroit and particular in applying color to her descrip- tions of character and setting" (106). Recognizing the more fundamen- tal role played by landscape, Kazin goes on to declare that for Cather "landscape was character, to be cherished at the last more than human character" (110). For Cather, Judith Fryer asserts, the landscape is "where representation begins; it is the basis for a story" (249). But what is this landscape that is so fundamental to Cather's art? It is not just the natural environments in which her characters function. Land- scape is not to be equated with nature; it is, rather, nature perceived as a separate entity by human beings. It is "the land's shape as it is seen from a particular and defined perspective," both physical and psychic (Conron xviii). Landscape is a seen scene. Raymond Williams's contention that "the very idea of landscape implies separation and observation" (120) is borne out in the Oxford English Dictionary. The word entered the English language in the late-sixteenth and early-seventeenth centuries as a tech- nical term used by painters. Soon its meaning evolved from a picture depicting natural inland scenery to a view of or prospect on such scenery. Only in the late-nineteenth century did landscape come to mean features of the land itself. Early in the history of its usage, on the other hand, "landscape" acquired figurative meanings detached from nature and suggesting only perception. Two historical implications of the concept of landscape are signifi- cant bases for understanding the dangerous crossing concept. As Raymond Williams informs us, the artistic production of landscapes by seventeenth-century Dutch artists like van Ruysdael and Hobbema led to consumption of landscapes as products (124). The perception of nature that characterizes the modern western outlook is strongly in-</page><page sequence="3">Dangerous Crossings 65 fluenced by the aesthetic concept of nature as commodity, a commod- ity that is defined by both the perception of the producer and the de- sires of the consumer. Underlying this economic aspect of landscape is a more fundamental philosophy of the human relationship to the natu- ral environment. As Judith Fryer observes, "The idea of landscape as something separate from life ... is part of a new way of looking at the world in the seventeenth century, one which is rational " (303). The ra- tional assumption of the primacy of the human intellect disjoined from nature, commonly characterized as Cartesian dualism, enables "west- ern man" to recreate nature as the product and instrument of his ideas, values, needs, and hopes. This product, too, is landscape. These his- torical concepts of landscape define the territory wherein Cather 's char- acters, like most people influenced by western culture, are most com- fortable. So comfortable with dualism are most westerners that dualism comes to seem like unity. The human power of perception, reinforced by the power of individual and collective memory, encourages us to equate perception and reality, seeing and scene. As Simon Schama argues in his monumental work Landscape and Memory (1995), For although we are accustomed to separate nature and human perception into two realms, they are, in fact, indivisible. Before it can ever be a repose for the senses, landscape is the work of the mind. Its scenery is built up as much from the strata of memory as from layers of rock. (6-7) The landscape built of memory plays a significant role for Cather 's characters who embark on dangerous crossings. It acclimates them to new territories and it creates for them an approximation of a sense of unity with all life. Herman Melville, following Goethe, called this sense of unity the "'all' feeling." "You must often have felt it," he wrote to Hawthorne in 1851, lying on the grass on a warm summer's day. Your legs seem to send out shoots into the earth. Your hair feels like leaves upon your head. This is the all feeling. But what plays the mischief with the truth is that men will insist upon the universal application of a temporary feeling or opinion. (Davis and Gilman 130-31) For most westerners this experience of unity must remain temporary, if it is achieved at all, because their sense of nature is shaped by the historical forces that have given rise to the concept of landscape. In- deed, the very idea of perfect harmony with nature has been shaped for centuries by the pastoral tradition, making it a product of nurture</page><page sequence="4">66 ISLE rather than nature (Marinelli 15, 22). To truly cross into the realm of all-ness is dangerous because it separates the individual from those literary and historical forces that have given her a sense of selfhood and allowed her to participate in the collective memory that has cre- ated a shared sense of landscape. It is, as Cather recognized, a kind of self-destruction. Even so, the author pulls her protagonists Jim Burden, Godfrey St. Peter, and Jean Marie Latour backward in time, as it were, beyond land- scaped nature. Willa Cather depicts in this experience not just the ex- hilarating ephemeral state described by Melville, but also the potential for another way of being: human consciousness within nature. The way of the ancient Pueblos, as Leslie Marmon Silko notes, challenges the concept of a viewer separate from nature (108). Cather saw this way of being in the Natives of the American Southwest, and recognized in all human beings the yearning "to be dissolved into something complete and great" (My Antonia 18). Her examination of the tension between maintaining and dissolving the boundaries of self and nature reflects not only the historicity of the concept of landscape, but also the evolu- tion of her thinking during the nine-year period, 1918 to 1927, in which she published My Antonia, The Professor's House , and Death Comes for the Archbishop. The life history of Jim Burden in My Antonia recapitulates the his- torical pattern that entailed the re-creation of land into landscape. The dangerous crossing made by the ten-year-old Jim from Virginia to Ne- braska is a psychic journey to the world's edge (16), a westward move- ment that seems to reverse the course of history until he arrives at a place where "there was nothing but land: not a country at all, but the material out of which countries are made" (7). The immediate effect on the boy's selfhood is dramatic: "Between that earth and that sky I felt erased, blotted out" (8). The word "erased" suggests not just a danger- ous but a fatal crossing into a world without landscape. However, Cather transforms her character's dissolution of self into "transcen- dence rather than annihilation" (O'Brien 70). At this primitive stage in his own life history Jim Burden is open to the opportunity for a "natu- ral" cessation of consciousness, an effortless crossing into the realm of all-ness that he experiences in his grandmother's garden. Nothing happened. I did not expect anything to happen. I was some- thing that lay under the sun and felt it, like the pumpkins, and I did not want to be anything more. I was entirely happy. Perhaps we feel like that when we die and become a part of something entire, whether it is sun or air, or goodness and knowledge. At any rate, that is hap- piness; to be dissolved into something complete and great. When it comes to one, it comes as naturally as sleep. (18)</page><page sequence="5">Dangerous Crossings 67 As Jim begins to acquire historical experience, however, he, along with the prairie land that is imprinted with the marks of human his- tory, cannot replicate the "all" feeling. Unlike his symbolic ancestors Adam and Eve, he is not expelled from the garden of happiness; rather, he loses his capacity to be dissolved into the elements as he learns to construct barriers between self and surroundings. In telling the story of his growth and development, Jim Burden shapes the material out of which countries are made and becomes a maker of the country, a land- scapes The defining act of Jim's development is, appropriately, the killing of a snake. Although the snake's age and lethargy undercut the valor of his deed, his friend Antonia celebrates him as a "big mans" (45). The episode marks Jim's emergence into history in two ways. It dramati- cally affirms the sexual differentiation that had begun to introduce ten- sion into his relationship with Antonia (41), and establishes the gendered basis of his selfhood. It also represents Jim's emerging his- torical consciousness. The snake "seemed like the ancient, eldest Evil. Certainly his kind have left horrible unconscious memories in all warm- blooded life" (45-46). Aware of the collective memory of humankind, Jim Burden sees nature through the screen of shared experience.1 As Jim grows into history, he is increasingly aware of the historicity of the land that surrounds him. Ántonia's stories help to integrate the unmade country with Europe, serving as reminders that its flora and fauna are not unique. Stories, too, account for the sunflowers that bor- der prairie roads. The hired man Otto Fuchs reports that they were seeded by Mormons to mark their trail west (27-28). When Jim says that Otto's legend "has stuck in my mind" despite its dubious authen- ticity, he affirms Simon Schama's tribute to the power of "inherited landscape myths" to shape attitudes toward nature (15). This power is also evident in the explanations of the great circle that emerges after the first snowfall (60). In this case the legends of Grandfather Burden and the hired man differ, though they agree that the circle marks the site of Indian ritual. Such interpretations, says Stephen Fender reflect the desire to historicize a land that seems to be without evidence of history (55). As the story of Jim Burden's and the land's development progresses, the marks of history, notably roads and crops, become more pronounced. Grandfather Burden's "clear meditative eye" foresees in the farm country not the produce of individual farmers but "the world's cornfields" (132). At the novel's end, highways have overtaken all but traces of the road that had brought Jim to the edge of the world. He celebrates evidence of human transformation of the land in terms that are appropriately anthropomorphic: "it was like watching the growth of a great man or of a great idea" (298).</page><page sequence="6">68 ISLE The effects of Jim's and the land's emergence into history are evi- dent when Jim, as he is about to leave for the university, accepts Ántonia's invitation to a picnic with her friends. As he makes his way to the riverside site, he begins to feel stirrings like those of his experi- ence in the garden. He observes the sandbars that had served as "a sort of No Man's Land, little newly created worlds" for him and his play- mates (226). After swimming, he is "overcome by content and drowsi- ness and by the warm silence" (227). But Jim can no longer be dis- solved into the surroundings. He cannot cross the boundary created by those conditions that have turned the land into landscape. His per- ception of the country is now defined by the memories that he and Antonia share and by the stories that compose the collective experi- ence of the young people at the picnic. This scene ends with a symbolic episode whose power to inspire is equal to that of the garden scene, but whose images suggest how far Jim and the land have traveled into history. The image of the plough magnified against the setting sun valorizes the instrument of country- making. The plough is not dissolved into its surroundings but stands out against the sun, "black against the molten red . . . heroic in size" (237). This moment of glory is a powerful image of the evolving pro- cess of landscape-making that becomes, in turn, a memory that shapes Jim's perception of the country (254). Travelling further into history does not, however, destroy Jim Burden's yearning to retreat to the conditions of the garden. When he sees the now-maternal Antonia after he has graduated from Harvard and returns to the fields where they had played, he feels "the old pull of the earth" that makes him long to "be a little boy again," a little boy with no history ahead of him (313). But this crossing beyond the bound- aries of time is not possible for one who has been introduced to "the world of ideas" (250) as part of an education that transforms the world into idea. The effect of this idea-lyzing process is evident in the narrative strat- egy of Jim's story: he imprints its landscape with references to paint- ing, verbalizing, and writing. The process begins early in the narrative when, at their first meeting, Antonia asks Jim the English words for "tree" and "sky" (25). The images of the old snake and Mr. Shimerda at prayer are presented as letters of the alphabet - W and S, respectively (43, 84). The circle in the snow appears "like strokes of Chinese white on canvas" (60). A cedar tree cut for Christmas becomes "the talking tree of the fairy tale" after it is decorated (80). Most significantly, the pen, the instrument of Jim's landscape-making, is compared to the plough, the instrument of country-making. The image of the plough against the sun is characterized as "picture writing on the sun" (237).</page><page sequence="7">Dangerous Crossings 69 Jim expresses his affinity for Virgil by noting that in the "Georgics" "the pen was fitted to the matter as the plough is to the furrow" (256). Through these tropes Jim Burden emerges as an American Virgil, a maker of the country describing the process of country-making. The outcome of the aesthetic and historical process of country-mak- ing is re-created landscape. The structure of My Ántonia reflects the beginning and end of this process in two symbolic scenes that domi- nate the opening and closing of the novel: the garden scene reminis- cent of God's creation and the scene on Antonia's farm, an example of human re-creation (326-31). The farmyard of the Cuzak place is domi- nated by a windmill and a cave that serves as a fruit cellar. These mas- culine and feminine symbols declare the Cuzaks' fertility and produc- tivity. They also express Jim's perception of Ántonia as an earth mother, part of the landscape he has made his own. The potential power of female fecundity, however, is symbolically controlled by the thorny locust hedge that encloses the front yard and by the mimosa trees at the gate. There is in Antonia's landscape none of the wildness that Jim felt in the unlandscaped country of his youth. Her orchard is carefully contrived to assure "the deepest peace," guarded as it is by a triple enclosure of wire fence, locust hedge, and mulberry hedge. The peace of the enclosed orchard is different from the happiness of the garden; it is achieved through a carefully designed re-creation of the natural ele- ments that enables them to serve human needs. In Antonia's garden is not only an expression of a universal need for a comforting link to nature, but also of Cather's respect for the power of human creativity. She valued creativity in its most fundamental manifes- tations: cooking, gardening, folk art - as well as in its more sophisticated manifestations such as literature, music, and academic art. In a 1924 in- terview she complained, hyperbolically, that no one made beautiful things anymore because machinery had overtaken the individual's capacity to make (Böhlke 71). Her respect for this capacity is one basis for the persis- tence of hand imagery in her fiction. The hand that stirs, plants, and carves also serves the higher purpose of consciously conceived design, and in this endeavor improves upon nature. So Godfrey St. Peter realizes when he admires his wife's decoration: It struck him that the seasons sometimes gain by being brought into the house, just as they gain by being brought into painting, and into poetry. The hand, fastidious and bold, which selected and placed - it was that which made the difference. In Nature there is no selection. (The Professor's House 61) A re-created landscape like Antonia's orchard becomes a built object that, as described by Judith Fryer, "organizes space, transforms it into</page><page sequence="8">70 ISLE place." Moreover, "words, gestures, the making of things transform timeless space into real places, moments of history re-membered" (257). Just so, Jim Burden's narrative makes the unmade country of the Mid- western prairie and molds it to the shape of personal and collective history. Jim's role as artist-historian is most evident when he describes him- self studying in his room, whose open window allows the earthy prai- rie wind and setting sun to invade his isolated quarters. Recalling his vantage point on the external world, he first describes the sky with a nature simile - "turquoise blue, like a lake," but then employs an aes- thetic simile - "like a lamp suspended by silver chains" - to character- ize the evening star. He goes on to identify the lamp as that "engraved upon the title-page of old Latin texts" and then implies the connection between himself and Virgil (255). The scene is a telling indication of Jim's growing intellectual separation from and aesthetic interest in nature. It also gives him the same perspective on nature as that as- sumed more deliberately by Godfrey St. Peter. The protagonist of The Professor's House has created a study/sanctuary in the attic of a house formerly occupied by his family. From the attic's dormer window "he could see, far away, just on the horizon, a long, blue, hazy smear - Lake Michigan, the inland sea of his childhood" (20). For St. Peter, much further advanced than Jim into intellectual separation from nature, the lake is reduced to a smear. Both scenes place the characters in the conventional pose of figures in Dutch paintings, whose open window lets into a crowded interior a glimpse of the world outside. Cather has described such a painterly convention as an inspiration for the structure of The Professor's House (Tennant 30-32). Her stated intention was to offer her protagonist a means of letting fresh air into a stifling atmosphere. In light of the sig- nificant contribution of Dutch painters to the history of landscape paint- ing, however, it is tempting to find a subtext in her explanation. The landscapes of her sources, like the landscapes viewed by Jim Burden and Godfrey St. Peter, are more evident as seen than scene; the per- spective is more important than what is observed. The emphasis on observation aptly characterizes St. Peter, who has not only created a physical vantage point on the life around him but is a historian of the life that has come before. Unlike Jim Burden, whose narrative takes him into history, Godfrey St. Peter is at the start of his story immersed in history. Underscoring this position, the structure of The Professor's House is a reverse image of My Ántonia's structure: it begins with a re-created landscape and ends with the protagonist's attempt to cross over into the realm of all-ness. The professor's re-created landscape is, like Ántonia's, a garden (5-</page><page sequence="9">Dangerous Crossings 71 7). His garden is more highly contrived than hers, however. An urban enclave, it is surrounded by a wall and covered with gravel; grass has been banished. Its trees and flowers are arranged in the manner of a French garden, alluding to the place where St. Peter has spent his hap- piest years. Here he works off his discontent. Here, during summers when he has sent his wife and daughters on vacation, he lives again as a bachelor, attempting to deny his social and familial attachments. In a sense St. Peter, who is called Mephistopheles by his students (5), is the snake in his own garden. While his landscaping design rigorously con- trols natural growth, he cannot control his own growth from an "origi- nal ego" into the "secondary social man, the lover" who has become enmeshed in a web of relationships that Willa Cather called "the tragic necessity of human life" ( The Professor's House 240; Tennant 109). Just as sexual and gender differentiation is an important stage of Jim Burden's emergence into history, so it has been for Godfrey St. Peter. He knows "that the complexion of a man's life was largely determined by how well or ill his original self and his nature as modified by sex rubbed on together" (242). The professor's attic retreat indicates just how badly his sex-modified nature "rubbed on" with his original self. The only female granted a place in the attic is the sewing-woman Au- gusta, a "spinster" whose sewing equipment serves as a counterpoint to St. Peter's bachelor accoutrements, his smoking paraphernalia and scholarly manuscripts (8, 13). But Augusta's dress forms are such an indispensable part of his meager furnishings that he will not let her move what he calls "my women" to the new house (13). These forms symbolize the only kind of femaleness with which St. Peter feels com- fortable: fragmented body parts suggestive of sexual appeal yet for- bidding. The "bust," whose ample bosom has been the subject of the professor's "risque" banter, is headless and armless. Its inviting chest severely shocks anyone who ventures to touch it, even though its body consists of "a dead, opaque, lumpy solidity" (9). The skirted form is likewise fragmentary, lacking legs and viscera. Though teasingly "con- vincing in her pose as a woman of light behaviour," she does not fool the professor (10). These icons diminish the female sexuality St. Peter fears to isolated caricatured body parts.2 Although the women in Godfrey St. Peter's family are depicted pri- marily as representatives of the social and domestic realms from which he shrinks, they are more subtly presented as representatives of the life force he has denied. While he retreats to his garden and attic, his daughters Rosamond and Kathleen and his wife Lillian mature and evolve as circumstances demand. St. Peter even expresses resentment of Lillian's interest in the future and her readiness to adapt. Her reply, "One must go on living, Godfrey," is a realistic assessment of her role</page><page sequence="10">72 ISLE (78). The larger significance of "living" becomes evident in the next scene, a discussion between Augusta and Godfrey about Catholic lit- urgy and the Magnificat, the song of Mary acknowledging her role as the mother of Jesus. The litany cited by Godfrey contains two meta- phors for Mary's virtues that are variations of the names of his wife and daughter: Mystical Rose and Lily of Zion (83). The life force of maternity is indicated more directly at the end of the novel when Rosamond's pregnancy is revealed (249). On the other hand, Godfrey's productions, his histories, are but surrogates for the life created by women, as his son-in-law suggests by calling the people about whom Godfrey wrote his "sons" (144). Denying and being denied expression of the life force, St. Peter at- tempts to reverse the course of history and return to an original, primi- tive self that experienced life more vitally than his secondary self. He imagines this self to be a creature of nature, a solitary Kansas boy "only interested in earth and woods and water" (241). This primitive self is for the fifty-two-year-old professor a figure in a landscape of memory that is more vivid than is the "smear" of Lake Michigan visible through the attic window. He idealizes his remembered youth as the freedom of the lake itself, and further re-creates the remembered lake by con- sidering it "a part of consciousness itself." This idea-lyzation overshad- ows memories of loss: his father's loss of his Catholic faith, his family's move from the lakeside farm (20-21). So false to history is the land- scape of memory that in it the Kansas boy felt that all "places were alike," when in fact young Godfrey "nearly died of" the move to the wheat lands (241, 21). To accomplish this reversal of history, the histo- rian must alter the facts. The recovery of the primitive self is a dangerous as well as difficult crossing in that it entails a longing for dissolution of ego. In this disso- lution is not only the exhilaration of the "all" feeling but also intima- tions of death. Recognizing that the re-created primitive self "was earth, and would return to earth" (241), St. Peter begins the drift toward non- being that almost causes his death when he falls asleep in his poorly ventilated attic. Had he not escaped asphyxiation from gas fumes by the timely intervention of Augusta, the professor's sanctuary would have become his coffin. St. Peter's decision "to live without delight" (257) and relinquish his landscape of memory is a realistic recognition of his secondary social nature, but it also reflects his reluctance to cross the boundary into a realm of pre-landscaped nature. This reluctance is symbolized by his swimming apparatus. In the lake he professes to love he wears brightly colored rubber visors that make his head look sheathed like the heads of warriors on the Parthenon frieze (57). In this manner he aggressively</page><page sequence="11">Dangerous Crossings 73 isolates himself from the natural environment and associates himself with the created environment. As a swimmer he embodies the sugges- tions of his full name, Napoleon Godfrey, the warrior and seeker of God's peace. The professor is, above all, an intellectual who interprets rather than lives within nature. He needs to have his attic space to think (41); "the habit of living with ideas" has grown on him (141). The division between his mind and body, suggested in his attitude toward the dress forms, is projected in its most blatant guise onto another pro- fessor, Dr. Crane, who studies the physics of space while his disease- ridden body is progressively carved away by surgeons (72, 114). Crane is a caricature of St. Peter's separation from physical nature. Godfrey St. Peter's association with Tom Outland, the student who introduces him to the cliff dwellers of the Blue Mesa, serves in the novel as another view through the window onto open landscape, or out-land. In the second of the novel's three books the window of the professor's memory opens to reveal Outland's story - one that attracts him, as does the memory of his primitive self, because of its reversal of history. Tom has discovered evidence of an ancient people who built themselves into the cliffs of the mesa. Rather than depicting them as human be- ings in harmony with the natural environment, however, he character- izes them as artists whose ruins seem more than anything like sculp- ture (180) and who had a "feeling for design" (182, 197). In Outland's view of the cliff-dwellers is the mark of the novelist's reverence for human powers of creativity. As David Harrell observes, "Cather de- signed the Blue Mesa to be the tangible yet mystical locale for her King- dom of Art" (132).3 The perspective on pre-history that St. Peter gains from Tom Outland is a perspective on re-created landscape, what Tom's mentor Father Duchene calls the "humanized" mesa (199). As Laura Winters notes, "For both St. Peter and Outland, places come to stand for the self" (48). Despite his youth and unorthodox education, Outland is, like Godfrey St. Peter, a man of intellect, a man of history. His experience on the mesa has inspired the capacity to feel stirrings of the "all" feel- ing, of simply "being on the mesa, in a world above the world ... it was like breathing the sun, breathing the colour of the sky" (217). How- ever, his epiphanic sense of being completely at one with the mesa is a work of the mind that he compares to the outcome of a series of experi- ments: "Something had happened in me that made it possible for me to coordinate and simplify, and that process, going on in my mind, brought with it great happiness. It was possession" (226). How differ- ent is Tom Outland's happiness from the happiness of Jim Burden in the garden! Yet it is similar to the proximate happiness Jim feels when he comes to possess his Antonia as part of a re-created landscape. This</page><page sequence="12">74 ISLE I-centered conception of the human place in nature affirms rather than dissolves the boundary between self and environment. As David Harrell notes, artistic possession of this sort - total absorption in and under- standing of the subject - is a "solitary and essentially selfish act of cre- ation" (144). Tom Outland minimizes the danger of crossing the river to the Blue Mesa by making his experience there an affirmation of his power to create landscape. In The Professor's House the idea of the primitive "all" feeling is em- bedded in historical perceptions of land as landscape. Neither Tom Outland nor Godfrey St. Peter can escape from history and the atti- tudes toward nature that are products of historical progression. In Death Comes for the Archbishop Cather experimented with a bolder attempt to reverse the course of history. In doing so she had but to follow the historical record of an actual dangerous crossing: the mid-nineteenth- century migration of Catholic missionaries from Europe to the Ameri- can Southwest. In her interpretation of the missionaries' endeavors she takes her protagonist, Bishop Jean Marie Latour, to a land like that found by Jim Burden, a land that seems to be without history. The Prologue and first book of this masterfully conceived novel are designed to dramatize the reversal of historical progression.4 The 1848 scene in Rome featuring the prelates' discussion of American missions is a garden at sunset, when the light has a quality "of splendid finish" (3-4). Four major symbols of the European countries that "were worn to the shape of human life" (275) appear in the Prologue: the garden, a re-created landscape; academic art - the lost El Greco; sophisticated cuisine of the sort that contained history (38); and language. Surrounded by evidence of the final flowering of their culture, the prelates discuss "the beginning of momentous things" in the New World (6). The land of which they speak, Latour discovers three years later, is so crowded with repetitive features as to seem featureless, a "geometrical night- mare" without design (17). Paradoxically, this New World had an appearance of great antiquity, and of incompleteness; as if, with all the materials for world-making assembled, the Creator had desisted, gone away and left everything on the point of being brought together, on the eve of being arranged into mountain, plain, plateau. The country was still waiting to be made into a landscape. (94-95) Conceived by Europeans to be the locus of the culmination of human history, the New World seems to Latour "older than history" (31), and reminiscent of the scene of the first Creation (99). Unlike Jim Burden, the Bishop cannot, even momentarily, experi- ence a dissolution of self in this environment. Although he is only in</page><page sequence="13">Dangerous Crossings 75 his mid-thirties when appointed, he confesses to being "not very young in heart" (91). Moreover, he cannot surrender his attachment to memo- ries, shaped by his religion and by his youth in France, that enable him to historicize and spiritualize the pre-historic land. When he is lost in the featureless country, he is re-oriented by perceiving a juniper tree as Christ's cross (18). Rock formations appear to him Gothic in outline (94, 127). Sounds and scents draw his memory eastward, often to gar- dens in France (ex. 43). The landscapes of memory that Latour imposes on the American Southwest reflect a cultural as well as a personal trait: the French disposition to arrange, "to discover the logical relation of things" (9). Bishop Latour has the outlook of a French landscape artist. Like Godfrey St. Peter and the adult Jim Burden, Jean Marie Latour is an intellectual, "always a little cold - un pedant " (260). He is subject to periodic bouts of doubt that challenge his spirituality and alienate him from his environment (210). The contrast drawn between Latour and his impulsive, credulous friend Father Vaillant emphasizes the extent to which intellectualizing is fundamental to his being. Their opposing concepts of miracle illustrate the difference between the two men. Vaillant believes in divine intervention; Latour sees apparitions as a matter of "our per- ceptions being made finer, so that for a moment our eyes can see and our ears can hear what is there about us always" (50). In the environment of the Southwest, however, it is difficult for Bishop Latour to maintain belief in a fixed external reality. The effect of cloud shadows on the deserts, mountains, and mesas is to make "the whole country [seem] fluid to the eye" (95-96). The landscape of Latour 's cul- tural and spiritual memory is not imprinted so deeply on his mind that he can ignore the pre-landscaped environment of which he is a part. In its lack of design and fluidity, this environment resists the in- terpretive power that a landscaper gains from achieving a sense of "the logical relation of things." The mission that is at the core of Bishop Latour 's dangerous cross- ing, affirmation of Native Americans' conversion to Catholicism, is the very mission that most threatens his power to historicize and re-create the landscape. In the Natives' land he feels alienated from self, cast out of history, "a naked rock in the desert, in the stone age, a prey to home- sickness for his own kind." In these people who seem not to have changed over time he feels "something reptilian" (103). Among these people whose condition he endeavors to better (35-36) Jean Latour ex- periences a journey into a heart of darkness that echoes the pattern of the classic journey-into-the- wilderness archetype and causes him to lose, for a time, the intellectual perspective of the landscaper. This dangerous crossing occurs in Book Four, "Snake Root," when Jacinto, his guide from the pueblo of Pecos, finds them shelter from a</page><page sequence="14">76 ISLE snowstorm in a dark cave. The cave entrance, described with images of primitive orality, inspires in the Bishop "extreme distaste" (126-27). Jacinto is no more eager than Latour to enter, for he has apparently brought his charge to a place of secret Indian ceremonies. Latour 's dis- comfort with the surroundings and with Jacinto's furtive behavior is heightened by his recollection of dark legends of Indian snake wor- ship and infant sacrifice (122). Like Jim Burden, he interprets his expe- rience in light of "horrible unconscious memories" evoked by the snake. The "remote, black past" (124) that he associates with Indians unsettles his historically informed understanding of the natural environment, as well as his Catholic-trained memory. Cut off from these ego sup- ports, Latour is defenseless when Jacinto invites him to listen to "the sound of a great underground river," "one of the oldest voices of the earth." His only comment, "It is terrible" (130), is reminiscent of Kurtz's exclamation, "The horror! The horror!" in Heart of Darkness. To be sure, Latour has not surrendered like Kurtz to the most base instincts of humankind, but he has recognized a power of nature beyond the com- prehension of the historically shaped intellect. Like Kurtz, he cannot summon the power of language to articulate and interpret his experi- ence. After he leaves the cave behind, recollections of its "horror" be- come part of the landscape of his memory (133). Such an archetypal scene as "Snake Root" almost begs for interpre- tation. The circumstances of the Bishop's descent into the cave with its "two great stone lips" (126) create a strong parallel to the underground descent legends discussed by Mircea Eliade in Birth and Rebirth (1958). Noting this parallel, Steven P. Ryan observes that "mythic heroes the world over undergo" the ordeal of descending into the belly of a mon- ster or the devouring mouth (vagina dentata) of Mother Earth. "Both scenarios involve the hero's . . . return to the womb" (34). From the religious perspective described by Eliade and assumed by Ryan, the Bishop's descent into the cave "symbolizes a decisive battle against the precosmic forces of chaos, darkness, and death," a battle conducted with the weapon of prayer (34). However, as his lingering memories of the dark landscape's horror indicate, the Bishop is not a clear victor in this battle. The novel's depiction of the impenetrable mystery of pri- mal nature undermines a conventional Christian understanding of the defeat of satanic forces. Indeed, Cather's respectful portrayal of Na- tive Americans credits an alternative interpretation of the reptilian as- pect of the cave. This view is found in the Navajo chant "Beauty Way," where a crevice near Canyon de Chelly is the entrance to the under- ground world of the Snake People. They are associated with weather and offer earth people knowledge of the spirit world (Smith and Allen 179-81). In crossing into the territory of snake-worshipping Indians,</page><page sequence="15">Dangerous Crossings 77 Bishop Latour has encountered a land and a people that must be re- spected on their own terms. Bishop Latour 's inability to comprehend the cave and Jacinto's ritual there marks a fundamental difference between the portrayal of Native Americans in Death Comes for the Archbishop and that in The Professor's House. In the later novel Indians are not presented as artists who have re-created their natural environment. They are, rather, living in har- mony with an unrefined environment. In the description of Jacinto's ritual in the cave, which has him "standing on some invisible foot- hold," "listening with supersensual ear" at the hole he has recently covered, is an image of the Natives' extra-sensory relationship with the earth (131). Their acceptance of nature's mystery as "something to be met and spoken with rather than confronted" (Smith and Allen 176) is embodied in Jacinto's behavior. The Bishop, despite his repugnance, wishes "to study a little the curious hole," but his guide's vigilance prevents him from doing so (131). Had he been granted his wish, his "study" would surely have employed the sensory and analytical meth- ods of knowing in which he had been educated. Lacking Jacinto's means of meeting nature on its own terms, the Bishop must remain curious about the mystery that lies beyond the border he could not cross. The Bishop often finds the Natives' "strange literalness" "shocking and disconcerting" (97). However, the symbol of this literalness, the rock, is something Latour can appreciate, for it represents "the univer- sal human yearning for something permanent" (98). Moreover, he can appreciate, even if he cannot share, their relationship to the land: "They seemed to have none of the European's desire to 'master' nature, to arrange and re-create. They spent their ingenuity in the other direc- tion; in accommodating themselves to the scene in which they found themselves" (233). The embodiment of this attitude is Latour's Navajo friend Eusabio, who travels as if he were "the landscape made hu- man" (232). This respectful view of the Native American oneness with the natu- ral environment, contrasted with the white man's way of "assert[ing] himself in any landscape" (232), suggests the possibility of a European like Jean Marie Latour crossing over to the New World, not just physi- cally but spiritually as well: adopting the Natives' way of passing through a country and leaving no trace (233). Such a crossing, how- ever, is not possible. "There was no way" Latour could comprehend the Indian tradition, nor any way he could make an Indian understand the mind of a European (92, 133). The instrument of language, so im- portant in carrying out the priests' mission that Latour and Vaillant speak their native language only on special occasions (39), is inadequate to bridge the cultural and spiritual gap between Europeans and Na-</page><page sequence="16">78 ISLE tives. Jacinto is reluctant and defensive when he reveals to the Bishop the Laguna name for a mountain: Snow-Bird Mountain (90). Perhaps he knows that Europeans have already Christianized the land with names like Sangre De Christo (270). They have landscaped his home with language and he and his people must maintain in silence their sense of the surroundings. The most dramatic act of Christianizing the land in Death Comes for the Archbishop is the building of Bishop Latour 's cathedral. In conceiv- ing this project, Latour draws on memories of the French landscape and French architecture; connecting the special golden ochre in the Sandia Mountains to the rock found near Clermont, he envisions a re- created landscape based upon a landscape of memory (239-240). In planning the project and selecting a French architect, the Bishop evolves from a thinking man who had demonstrated his eye for detail and de- sign (202) to a maker, an artist. He recognizes the aesthetic worth of his cathedral in much the same way that Godfrey St. Peter values the Blue Mesa (Doane 66). The cathedral reinforces the boundaries of Latour 's ego that had been threatened by his trip to the ceremonial cave and his association with " antediluvian" Natives (100). Whereas the cave threatens to draw him down into unfathomed mysteries of the earth, the cathedral, carved out of a mountain, draws him upward into the realm of transcendence. It has earthly significance as well. Even as he contemplates the idea of such a building, "he [comes] to feel that [it] might be a continuation of himself and his purpose" (175). His declaration to Father Vaillant, "That hill, Blanchet, is my Cathedral," expresses not just the affirmation but the enlarging of his ego to encompass the landscape (239). Latour be- comes, like Jim Burden, Godfrey St. Peter, and Tom Outland, a pos- sessor of re-created landscape - or what Simon Schama, in character- izing Mount Rushmore, has appropriately called "manscape" (396). The Bishop admits that finding the rock through divine agency has gratified his vanity (238), and his act of building a church out of rock enacts Christ's metaphor of building His church on a rock, thus historicizing the act and ennobling the builder. Yet there is in Latour 's choice of a rock that makes the tawny church seem "to start directly out of those rose-coloured hills" an echo of the Natives' manner of "accommodating themselves to the scene in which they found themselves" (269, 233). As he ages and prepares for death, the Bishop reconciles the division between old Europe and the New World. He seems to have absorbed the horror of his experience in the cave into his consciousness of all lands and landscapes he has known. In his seventies, having "accomplished an historic period" (271), he moves beyond history. "Calendared time" ceases to be a concern. "He</page><page sequence="17">Dangerous Crossings 79 [sits] in the middle of his own consciousness; none of his former states of mind [are] lost or outgrown" (288). The measure of the Bishop's reconciliation is his garden. It is a dis- tinctly historical landscape, conceived to introduce to Mexicans the dietary merits of fruits and to demonstrate the axiom of Latour 's coun- tryman Pascal: "that man was lost and saved in a garden." Its orchard bears the fruits of Europe; however, its flowers are native to the region (265). Despite the imprint of the French landscape on his memory and in his heart, the Bishop prefers the American land that retains some of it pre-landscaped character. Only when he wakes to "those light-hearted mornings of the desert" can Latour retain the spirit of youth. Only in this remote region that has as yet escaped the invasion of the plough could "the prisoned spirit of man" be released into the wind (273). The Bishop's Euro- American garden and its desert environment offer the comfort of landscape and, at least in the morning, the exhilaration of the "all" feeling. The ending of Death Comes for the Archbishop , for all its apparent har- mony and resolution of temporal conflicts, is a dramatic site of the unresolved tensions created by Willa Cather 's reverence for nature and for the human capacity to possess and alter nature. In many respects the characterization of Jean Marie Latour reinforces those of Jim Bur- den and Godfrey St. Peter. He makes the dangerous crossing into an unlandscaped environment, experiences the ego suspension that sur- render to such an environment entails, and recovers the ego stability that comes with psychic possession of the landscape. The landscape of Latour 's experience, however, goes further than that of Burden or St. Peter to challenge conventional historical understandings of the hu- man place in the environment. The garden that seems to reconcile the European and American perspectives has a malign aspect, being remi- niscent of the garden of the evil sybarite Fray Baltazar, who enslaved the women of Ácoma to care for his fruit trees.5 The plough that was valorized and associated with the pen in My Antonia is, from the per- spective of the dying bishop, an invasive, destructive force (273). Al- though the imperialistic aspects of Cather 's apparent approval of Latour 's mission have been noted by numerous readers, the implicit critique of the taming of the land and its natives is less evident. Death Comes for the Archbishop , more than any of Cather 's novels, challenges the attitudes that enabled the American land to become landscaped. What distinguishes this novel in Cather 's oeuvre is its acknowledg- ment of an environment that cannot be landscaped and of the integrity of the Native Americans who preserve that environment. In Death Comes for the Archbishop , Cather has made the dangerous crossing into the territory of a place and a people that seem not to belong to history.</page><page sequence="18">80 ISLE Having overcome her own sense of "the radical otherness of the coun- try and its indigenous cultures/' Frederick Turner observes, she "makes the Bishop assent finally to the indigenous peoples and, more, to their land of living" (148, 153). That she knew such a crossing to be but a created moment in time is evident in Bishop Latour 's celebration of the revitalizing air of the Southwest: "He had noticed that this peculiar quality in the air of new countries vanished after they were tamed by man and made to bear harvests" (273). Even as she suspends her bishop from history, Cather shows the landscape-making forces looming ahead. The novel that followed Death Comes for the Archbishop, Shadows on the Rock (1931), is set in a historicized landscape. Moreover, it pays unqualified tribute to the human power to make a culture out of a wilderness. The tools of the human makers, even humble kitchen uten- sils, are seen not merely as objects but as the materials of "life itself" (198). After her dangerous crossing beyond landscape, Willa Cather returned to territory more comfortable for one who used her pen to create a country of "the material out of which countries are made." NOTES 1. In this as in other scenes a reader may wonder whether the adult narrator is imposing understanding on his depiction of remembered childhood experi- ence. Surely the language is that of an adult, as is the perception of uncon- scious memories. The perception of evil, however, is attributed to the child, as is the explanation of the snake's historical associations ("he must have been there when white men first came, left on from buffalo and Indian times"). Shlomith Rimmon-Kenan's explanation of the difference between narration and "focalization," a "cognitive, emotive, and ideological orientation" evident in character, helps to account for the varying degrees of separation between Jim Burden the adult narrator and Jim Burden the evolving character (Narra- tive Fiction , Chapter 6). 2. Fragmentation of the female body in this novel is also evident in Au- gusta and St. Peter's banter about women who buy false hair (14-15), St. Peter's appraisal of his daughter Rosamond's body parts (26-27), and "Mother Eve's" remains (192). 3. In a 1916 essay, Cather revealed a similarly aesthetic response to the cliff dwellers of Mesa Verde, the prototype of the Blue Mesa. She expressed appre- ciation of these villages as "a successful evasion of ugliness," and a dwelling place for human consciousness, beauty, and order (Rosowski and Slote 84, 86). 4. Laura Winters makes a case for the Roman landscape's connection to the New World, noting, among other clues, a parallel between the "hidden gar- den" and the hidden sacred place in the New World (69-70). Her analysis, how- ever, ignores the association between gardens and Europe. 5. A subtle juxtaposition of chapters links Baltazar 's story to Bishop Latour. The Friar's legend is interjected immediately after the scene in which Latour feels like an alien among the "antediluvian" inhabitants of the Ácoma mesa,</page><page sequence="19">Dangerous Crossings 81 and longs for his own kind of people, "European man and his glorious history of desire and dreams" (103). The legend of Baltazar casts these desires and dreams in a highly negative light. REFERENCES Böhlke, L. Brent. Willa Cather in Person: Interviews, Speeches , and Letters.
