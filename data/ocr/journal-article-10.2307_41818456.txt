<plain_text><page sequence="1">Music in Art XXVIII/ 1-2 (2003) Concerning the Origin and Dissemination of the Meso american Slit-Drum Mark Howell The City University of New York Graduate Center The Mesoamerican slit-drum is one of a few quintessential pre-Columbian New World musical instru- ments [fig. I].1 (Others in this elite group would include Andean panpipes and the conch-shell trumpet.) The musicologist Robert Stevenson called the Mexican slit-drum, teponaztli, the "omega" of Aztec instruments and paired it with its "alpha" partner, the waist-high skin-drum, huehuetl .2 Stevenson's designation agrees with long-standing reverence for the instrument held by Amerindians who continue to use it in Mexico and Cen- tral America. Early in the twentieth century, in the Sierras north of Mexico City, a shaman entrusted with a teponaztli, wrapped it in human clothes, gave it a human name, and kept it under the church altar.3 Today in Zinacantan, Chiapas, the slit-drum ťenťen, is played only during the festival of San Sebastian.4 When it is sto- red, not only the instrument, but the mallets used to strike it, the tumpline that secures it in processions, and the bows and arrows borne by the bearer and beater are all given daily offerings of candles and incense.5 The slit-drum possesses qualities that make it a particularly revealing object for studies of the ancient music of the Americas. It can be investigated in archaeological contexts, examined through the documentation of its uses since the sixteenth century, observed in contemporary indigenous Latin- American communities, and analyzed acoustically. Much written in the past about the idiophone is accurate (such as the veneration in which it was held outside of its sound-making role), but some assumptions need reexamination, in par- ticular, the instrument's origin and paths of dissemination. The first part of this essay reviews the earliest evi- dence for the slit-drum in Mesoamerica; the second examines indigenous concepts of time and the ritualized nature of trade, factors that influenced both the real and the imagined emergence of the instrument in Middle- American societies. Description. The Mesoamerican slit-drum is a log hollowed out by fire and cutting tools (a construction method also used for dugout canoes).6 A rectangle, cut out of the bottom to accommodate the removal of the interior wood, is sometimes glued back. Incisions, generally resembling the letter "H" turned sideways, are chiseled from the surface to the hollow section, yielding two tongues, with pitches determined by variation in thickness. (In addition to the tongues, the drum body is sometimes struck, producing an additional tone or tones.) Mexican and Central American slit-drums include those constructed from the wood of the passion fruit, Spanish cedar, black cherry, walnut, chicozapote, oak, and hormigo trees.7 The sticks used as beaters are most often tipped with rubber derived from various tree types indigenous to low-altitude regions of tropical America.8 Evidence for the slit-drum in Mesoamerica. The slit-drum spread throughout the landmass of mo- dern Mexico and Central America during pre-Hispanic times.9 The instrument's wide dissemination coupled with the retention of its unique stylistic traits are the reasons some organologists have proposed it as origi- nating and spreading from a single source. Archaeologist Norman Hammond attributes its invention to northern powers like the Toltec (beginning in the early Postclassic era, around 900 A.D.), and explains its introduction to southern Mesoamerica through migration, trade, or invasion.10 © 2003 Research Center for Music Iconography CUNY 45</page><page sequence="2">Mark Howell, Concerning the Origin and Dissemination of the Mesoamerican Slit-Drum 1. Aztec teponaztli. American Museum of Natural History, New York, inv. no. 30.2.1972. Reproduced courtesy of the American Museum of Natural History Library. During the 1960s, in San Pedro Jícora, Durango, musicologist Elsa Ziehm observed a large, house-beam- sized slit-drum (160 cm long by 60 and 40 cm high) that she termed a "prototype teponaztli " . Normally serving as a headrest for sleeping dignitaries, during the maize festival it was used as a platform for dancing. The dance movements consisted of jumping upon the two sections of the beam, a pattern of kinetic activity yield- ing two tones matched by chanting singers.11 Thirty years earlier, organologist Karl Izikowitz cited examples of large hollow logs (without slits) played in similar fashion by Californian Amerindians.12 A performance technique like the ones Ziehm and Izikowitz observed in Mexico and California respectively currently exists in the four corners region (Arizona, Colorado, New Mexico, Utah), where Pueblo Amerindians play log- drums set into kiva floors using their feet. Floor grooves in ancient Mimbres pit structures channeled to re- ceive such logs suggest this practice as beginning before 1000 A.D.13 Related practices were widespread as well as longstanding, with variations on a log-drum tradition known for ethnic groups up and down the Ca- nadian and United States Western coasts.14 However, none of the North American percussive-logs appear deliberately cut so as to create tongues or other shapes that would yield pitch differences. Presumably because the log-drum Ziehm observed in Durango produced two pitches is why she advoca- tes a north Mexican source for the Mesoamerican slit-drum. The corollary is that the instrument evolved into its modern version as it was carried south by migrating Uto-Aztecan speakers (the language spoken at San Pedro Jlcora). Ziehm' s supposition is reinforced by the many Colonial-era reports that detailed the wides- pread use of the teponaztli in northern and central Mexico. Moreover, indigenous Central Americans who con- template a source for the drum, presume it to be an ancestral object or one introduced by Preconquest Me- xicans.15 In spite of the tantalizing nature of this supposition an excavation in Guatemala led by Alfred Kid- 46</page><page sequence="3">Music in Art XXVIII/ 1-2 (2003) 2. Kaminaljuyú anthropomorphic incense censer. Museo Nacional de Arqueología de Guatemala, AOVI, 20. Author's pencil and charcoal drawing. der, in the early 1940s, casts doubt on Uto-Aztecan-speaking Mexicans as inventors of the instrument.16 Kidder excavating Kaminaljuyú (in the western corporate limits of present-day Guatemala City) found in a tomb ensconced in Early-to-Middle-Classic era stratigraphy levels (250-600 A.D.) - and at least three hundred years before the Uto-Aztecan Toltec - a ceramic-incense-censer-lid featuring a figure playing a square-shaped slit-drum [fig. 2]. On the incense censer, the represented slit-drummer's sculpted clothing and accessories were the same as those worn by the elite at Kaminaljuyú, implying that the individual depicted was an historical person im- portant in that society. In addition to the rich vestments the body was painted red, a color symbolizing super- natural power.17 The red paint found in a mortuary context associated with an animated figure, his movement captured in clay, may mean that the character represented a person who had died symbolically in order to be spiritually reborn. If so, the sculpture may depict a shaman or some other individual capable of communi- cating with occult forces. Perhaps the slit-drum was part of the paraphernalia used by this individual for such communication. Mesoamerican artworks that include slit-drummers often also include shamanistic elements such as themes of transformation and rebirth. The Kaminaljuyú ceramic drummer is sculpted showing thick arm and wristbands, enormous earspools, and a heavy double-beaded necklace. Two components are especially prominent, an elaborate hat covering an oversized head and a long goatee, the beard curling up at its end. The large head - made more conspi- 47</page><page sequence="4">Mark Howell, Concerning the Origin and Dissemination of the Mesoamerican Slit-Drum 3.

In contrast, his left one is palm up, posed so that an object can rest on it (perhaps an offering), but no item suitable for this purpose has been discovered in the tomb. The hand making the sound(s) is shaped into a fist that could hold the handle of a sculpted drumstick, but as with the missing component assumed for the left hand, no object that could be inserted into the fist opening has been found. Despite its discovery at Kaminaljuyú, this type of large ceramic incense censer is more characteristic of Teotihuacán, a vast metropolis located in the Central Valley of Mexico, over 1000 km north of Guatemala. But regardless of the distance separating the two, Teotihuacán, the dominant Mesoamerican power during the Early-to-Middle-Classic period (250-600 A.D.), established close relations with Kaminaljuyú, primarily because of the latter' s proximity to valuable jadeite deposits located in the vicinity of the nearby Motagua River.19 Cultural components shared between the two cities may hold answers for music archaeologists as an Aztec myth concerning the creation of both the teponaztli and its instrument companion, huehuetl, invokes ancient Teotihuacán. This myth, relayed to the Franciscan Geronimo de Mendieta in the sixteenth century, begins with the sacrifice of the old gods in order to appease a newborn sun god, lord of our current age. After the old gods were sacrificed, two priests wandered the country in grief. One eventually proceeded to the court of the new sun and sought musical instruments to allay his sorrow. The petitioned deity refused and forbade his retinue to listen to the man's supplications. Nevertheless, two of the god's servants disobeyed and in so doing were moved to sympathy by the priesť s pleas, sung as sad songs. These two servants, named Teponaztli and Huehuetl, were consequently banished and transformed into the musical instruments that now bear their names.20 There is no discernible written language and thus no recorded history attributable to Teotihuacán, but its diagnostic traits, like "thin orange pottery" and talud tablero motifs21 dispersed throughout much of Mesoamerica, attest to the city's widespread influence. Teotihuacán religious concepts, like the cult of the "feathered serpent", were similarly distributed. In fact, Teotihuacán-intrusive ideas often dominated or transformed societies that their emissaries contacted. For instance, the Mayan system of war changed after their Lowland city-state Tikal 48</page><page sequence="5">Music in Art XXVIII/ 1-2 (2003) came under the influence of Teotihuacán in 379 A.D.22 Kaminaljuyú, like Tikal, was similarly dominated early in its history, but by the beginning of the Middle-Classic era (approximately 400 A.D.) it emerged as Teotihua- cán' s near equal southern trading partner in a pan-Mesoamerican exchange network, exporting among other items cacao, rubber, sea shells, animal skins, feathers, cotton, jadeite, and perhaps the slit-drum. Unlike the instrument sculpted on the incense-censer-lid found at Kaminaljuyú, no solid evidence for a slit-drum has been recovered from the site of Teotihuacán itself. Castañeda and Mendoza' s 1933 Instrumental precortesianos includes a photograph of a miniature stone version of the instrument, which was then in the possession of the local Teotihuacán museum, but the authors do not explain the archaeological circumstances of its discovery; in particular whether this drum-model was found during controlled excavations at, or near, Teotihuacán.23 Additional early evidence for the instrument can possibly be ascribed to Remojadas (in modern Veracruz), located on an eastern spur of the Teo- tihuacán-Kaminaljuyú trade routes. Attributed to this site - which is also important in music archaeology for its acoustically complex flutes - is a clay figurine slit-drummer (Shein Collection). The Remojadas ceramic drummer is nude except for a feline-shaped skullcap. This costume fea- ture, the cap could indicate supernatural interaction, as is presumed for the red paint on the lid of the Kaminaljuyú incense censer. This individual, again perhaps a shaman, could be transforming into his nagual, or animal- 4. Slit-drummer on southwest panel, South Ball Court, El Tajin, Veracruz, Mexico. Author's drawing. spirit. Diagnostically, he wears the perplexing grin that characterizes Remojadas "smiling face" sculptures, and is posed positioning a pair of mallets in adolescent abandon above a barrel-shaped slit-drum resting between his outstretched legs.24 The drumming technique demonstrated by this musician, who appears ready to strike the object with both beaters at the same time, differs from the less dramatic technique shown on the Kaminaljuyú censer. The Remojadas instrument is also larger in scale, more prominent, and more like known Mesoamerican slit-drums. And unlike the Kaminaljuyú musician- shaman, the one from Remojadas seems solely concerned with striking his drum. According to organologist Jose Franco, no pre-Hispanic slit-drums have been found in the Veracruz (mid- dle Gulf Coast) region, although several figurine representations exist.25 Despite this claim, the Remojadas example and possible Olmec ones discussed later are the only slit-drum figurines or related freestanding sculp- tures attributable to this area that I have thus far come across. Moreover, like many portable objects ascribed to pre-Columbian cultures, the Remojadas sculpture lacks a verifiable archaeological context. Assuming that the sculpture is from Classic-period Veracruz (400-900 A.D.), together with the Kaminaljuyú censer, it suggests slit-drum use among provinces involved in the Teotihuacán trade network. Excavations at other sites located on these routes will help to verify this theory.26 Rubber-tipped mallets. One way to conceive Mesoamerican idiophones is as a set of components: the instrument and the striking object. Pre-Hispanic and Colonial-era records concerning Mesoamerican slit-drums indicate that rubber-tipped drumsticks were most often used as beaters. (Analogous to the union of the teponaztli with rubber-tipped sticks is the coupling of tortoise-shell idiophones with deer antlers.) No rubber-tipped drumbeaters have been found in archaeological contexts but there is good circumstantial evidence for their use in pre-Hispanic times. Such evidence is found at El Tajin, a large site located a few hundred kilometers north of Remojadas, which filled the power vacuum in northeastern Mesoamerica fol- lowing the decline of Teotihuacán after 600 A.D.27 On the southwest panel of its South Ball Court a relief- sculpture shows an important person (wearing an elaborate headdress and sandals) using a drumstick to beat a small, oblong, elbow-cradled slit-drum. The beater is shown as a short, narrow stick, topped with a conspi- cuously drawn ball, probably representing rubber. Also, a diorama-like scene on a terra-cotta piece in the Karl Stavenhagen collection (attributed to the Classic-era Pacific Coast Colima culture), has been interpreted by 49</page><page sequence="6">Mark Howell, Concerning the Origin and Dissemination of the Mesoamerican Slit-Drum 5. Top and bottom view of Taino slit-drum, from Gonzalo Fernández de Oviedo (1851). ethnomusicologist Samuel Martí as a shaman-led ceremony involving a three-piece instrumental ensemble: slit-drummer, valveless trumpeter, and container-rattle player. While awaiting direction from the shaman, the slit-drummer brandishes two large ball-ended mallets with molded round tips that suggest rubber.28 In addition to these Classic-era coast-culture artworks, a Postclassic Aztec votive offering of several miniature clay teponaztlis, sculpted with comparably sized pairs of ball-ended drumsticks molded onto the slits of each drum, was discovered in excavations under the Mexico City street, Escalerillas [fig. 3]. The ends of these small mallets are incised with cross-hatching, sometimes used to denote rubber balls in depictions concerning the Mesoamerican ball game.29 Ethnohistoric reports provide additional evidence of a relationship between rubber-tipped mallets and the Mesoamerican slit-drum. The Título C'oyoi, an indigenous Guatemalan text written in the early-Colonial era, contains the phrase "(x) quik'oj quic", which Mayan document specialist Robert Carmack translates as: "They played the drum with rubber-tipped sticks/'30 In seventeenth-century Guatemala Fuentes y Guzmán wrote that the tepunaguastle (a corruption of teponaztli) was "toca á golpe de unas baquetillas de madera solida, calzadas por los extremos de ule, que es una materia resinoso/'31 An even earlier (mid-sixteenth-century) account by Landa from the Yucatan included a description of Mayan slit-drum performance technique: "This (slit-drum) they hit with a longish stick at the end of which is a ball of a certain gum that exudes from a tree."32 The principal source for Landa' s gum is the rubber tree ( Castilla elastica ) found in the American tropics at altitudes of 700 meters or less, the typical environment of Gulf of Mexico, Caribbean, and southern Mesoame- rican Pacific coastal zones.33 In the past, the Gulf Coast was particularly important for rubber production. In fact, olii (Fuentes y Guzmán's ule), the Nahuatl name for rubber, is the root of the word olmec, which in Nahuatl means "the rubber people" . The Pre-Classic Olmec heartland bordered the middle and southern Gulf of Mexico, and the earliest examples of extracted rubber, some molded into balls and associated with offerings, were recovered from a spring at the Early-Formative-Era Olmec site, El Manatí, located on the Gulf Coastal plain, not far south of Remojadas.34 El Manatí rubber samples have been carbon 14 dated at 1200 B.C.35 In his book, Instrumentos musicales precortesianos, Martí briefly comments on a pair of artifacts representing slit-drummers sculpted in Olmec style, kept at the Museo Nacional de Antropología e Historia.36 These scul- ptures are probably the same as those shown in photograph number 112 in Castañeda and Mendoza' s Instru- mental precortesianos. In the photograph, two crouching Olmec-style figures are shown hitting large oblong objects cradled in their left arms with beaters held in their right hands. The stone sculptures (likely carved from basalt) have weathered badly, and their appearance is too grainy to allow for a true determination of the nature of the object or the activity engaged in. Nonetheless, the Olmec-style figures closely resemble the slit-drummer sculpted on the South Ball Court at El Tajin [fig. 4]. In each case the sculpted subjects cradle an oblong object in the crook of an elbow while striking the respective object with a beater held in the other hand. Based on the limited evidence available, I posit the Mesoamerican slit-drum (hollowed out from the bottom and with an "H" incised into its top) as having been initially developed on the east or west coast of Mexico or Central America (most likely the Gulf of Mexico), and at least by the Middle-Classic period (600 A.D.) but probably much earlier. There are three primary reasons for this proposition. The first concerns the fact that the inventors were probably from a land that had an abundance of rivers - indicating a need for dugout canoes - and an awareness of the woodworking techniques used in slit-drum manufacture. (The lar- 50</page><page sequence="7">Music in Art XXVIII/ 1-2 (2003) gest concentration of rivers in Mesoamerica drains the Gulf coastal plain, and these flood plains had copious wood supplies during most of the pre-Hispanic past.) Second, rubber used for slit-drum beaters grew wild in the Gulf and southern Pacific Coast woods. People living in those regions would more likely have been familiar with this resinous substance than their neighbors in other parts of Mesoamerica. And third, the earliest, albeit minimal, documented evidence for slit-drums themselves comes from Kaminaljuyú near the Pacific and El Tajin near the Gulf of Mexico. The Remojadas and Olmec examples, if they are truly pre- Hispanic, further substantiate Mexican Gulf Coast invention. Cycling time. Having given some evidence for the Mesoamerican slit-drum as originating in a coastal region (most likely the Mexican Gulf Coast), in the second part of this essay I hypothesize why its invention has more often been associated with cultures located further inland. This exposition involves two aspects of Mesoamerican life that would at first appear only marginal to music. The first is a pan-Mesoamerican belief in the cycling nature of time, and the second is the complex reciprocal relationships involving the exchange of objects and cultural concepts between Highland and Lowland societies (sometimes called Cold and Hot Lands), which is referred to here as "cultural brokerage" (a term borrowed from Eric Wolf).37 I begin with the concept of cycling time. Indigenous calendars were in use from the earliest periods of pre-Hispanic Middle- American civilization. They charted solar and planetary movements, and a 260-day cycle of twenty, 13-day months, possibly representing human gestation periods or corn growing cycles. These calendars were intended to revolve simultaneously, and the initial day name and day number of the 260-day calendar matched up with the initial month name and month number of the 365-day solar calendar only once every 52-years.38 Auspicious dates within this and other cycling periods were noted by timekeepers and major events such as a city or dynasty founding could be situated so as to occur on important dates. These manipu- lations affected perceptions of chronology and the interpretation of history. Consequently time-cycles and the events and myths that sprang up to corroborate important dates within them came to be viewed by Meso- american populations as parts of a grand plan of predestination. To illustrate how this view was manifest I relate one of the better-known stories concerning Quetzalcoatl, the anthropomorphic Mexican god who challenged traditional systems of belief, such as human sacrifice. After confrontations with a rival, Quetzalcoatl departed from the Gulf Coast in a year 13-Reed (according to the Aztec version of the 260-day calendar). He vowed to return from the opposite direction on the same date of the cycle to rule a prophesied future age. When Cortés landed at Veracruz in a subsequent 13-Reed year (coinciding with the Gregorian date 1519), the Spaniard was initially presumed by the presiding Aztec king Moctezuma II to be the returning Quetzalcoatl. Cortés learned about this assumption and used it to win over allies and to gain an audience with Moctezuma II, two factors, which were crucial in his conquest of Mexico. Moctezuma ITs belief in an inherent power attributable to specific dates, a power that was expected to return when a date recurred in a calendar cycle, conditioned his acceptance of the inevitability of the unfolding events leading to Conquest. And although the Mexican king finally realized that Cortes was no god, the destruction the conquistador had by then wrought did end an old way of life and ushered in a new one. As did Moctezuma II, during that epoch other indigenous Mesoamericans abided by cyclical time systems and for them history - in essence - repeated. As revealed in the first section of this essay, prior to Spain's arrival in the New World various ethnic groups from what is now modern Mexico intruded into southern Mesoamerica. These groups and the dates of their entrances include the Olmecs (1000 A.D.), Teotihuacanos (250 A.D.), Toltecs (900 A.D.), Gulf Coast Mexicanized-Mayans (1200 A.D.), and Aztecs (1450 A.D.).39 Northern intrusion into southern areas was endemic and probably perceived by locals as cyclical, with each new occasion being a repetition of the first, or a prior one. Although some north-to-south incursions have been dated archaeologically, local oral histories often confuse(d) such specifics as which ethnic group intruded and when. For instance, for sixteenth-century K'iche' Mayans, the fifteenth-century Aztec takeover of Xoconochco at the southwestern border of Guatemala was probably perceived as analogous to the Teotihuacán intrusion into Kaminaljuyú which occurred over a thousand years earlier. And though as Ziehm and Hammond assert, the slit-drum may have been intro- duced into southern Mesoamerica from the north by one of these Mexican groups, its introduction there un- 51</page><page sequence="8">Mark Howell, Concerning the Origin and Dissemination of the Mesoamerican Slit-Drum doubtedly took place prior to Uto-Aztecan presence in the region. Highland-Lowland relationships. Evidence in Mesoamerican etymology and imagery points to ex- changes of objects and cultural concepts, like language and artistic aesthetics, among people in Highland and Lowland communities.40 A cursory study of the multiple meanings of certain Guatemalan Mayan words helps clarify the correspondences among some of these relationships. The K'iche' word turn has alternately been defined as "trumpet", "twisted rope", and "maguey cactus".41 The latter two definitions are related because Mayans sometimes used fibers from the maguey cactus to make rope. Since the plant was particularly pre- valent in the Highlands of central Mexico, maguey imagery is presumed to have stood for cultural concepts developed there.42 In Mesoamerica, the use of rope for binding objects is associated with domination rituals. It is a message transmitted through the imagery sometimes included on slit-drums, and is in fact a rather common decorative motif on those instruments. The correspondence among these specific elements is best demonstrated in the sculptured images on the South Ball Court at El Tajin (previously described regarding its inclusion of a slit-drum). On the ball-court wall an important figure, Lord Thirteen-Rabbit, is shown in several scenes near maguey cactus, and in one he is engaged in a sacrifice-related accession rite partly symbolized by a captive bound-up in rope.43 An inter- pretation of this sculpture's meaning is that Mexican Highland powers, portrayed at Lowland El Tajin by an image of the non-local maguey plant,44 had helped confer the authority of Rulership on Lord Thirteen-Rabbit. According to this explanation the dominant Highland culture's influence on the Lowland one is shown through the use of symbols representing objects understood by both cultures as associated with the former. Cultural brokerage. The Aztec merchant class, pochteca, organized as a caste, often preceded large- scale trading or military incursions into foreign territories. Because of their familiarity with the customs and languages of different groups, professional merchants were used by host polities to broker exchanges among groups living in different geographical and social environments.45 The Mayan equivalent of the pochteca was known as p'olom and it is known that organized trade was a pan-Mesoamerican tradition that reached back at least to Teotihuacán and more likely Olmec times.46 Outside of the Valley of Mexico, the pochteca probably deferred only to powerful kings and then only when that deference served their own agenda. As the society they lived in was predominately theocratic, it is possible that the power wielded by these merchants was perceived as partly derived from the will of a god, or gods, who was familiar, or made familiar, to the approached groups. The deity Yacatecuhtli protected the pochtecha and therefore may have been perceived by all engaged in the exchange network as the authority that granted them their power. (If so, Yacatcuhtli functioned as a kind of patron saint for merchants). Ritualized exchanges. Anthropologist Nancy Farriss has presented evidence that in the period imme- diately after Conquest, a few pre-Columbian trade routes continued to be used. On one of these, Tabasco cacao was brought to Chicbul, Campeche, where it was purchased using a currency of objects given value by their association with the patron saint of Chicbul. Tabascan cacao growers agreed to this mode of exchange because Chicbul, the Chontal (Putun Mayan) Colonial-era political-religious center, was considered the Post- hispanic successor to the Late-Postclassic Chontal capital, Xicalango. Catholic images from Chicbul conferred power on their acquirers as the representations of pre-Columbian Xicalango deities apparently had for Ma- yans of the Late Postclassic era.47 Some of this power was affirmed in the rituals associated with the delivery of merchandise. One can extrapolate that merchant movement along old Mayan trade routes evolved into modern saint day processions, characterized by office holders in cofradias (lay brotherhoods) who solemnly parade through important streets of a community holding aloft staffs topped with Christian icons and the symbolically charged images of patron saints. Included in the entourages of contemporary saint-day processions are the instrumentalists, like slit-drummers, who play the official music on these occasions. A question is did musicians playing similar instruments also accompany pre-Columbian merchants? Pre-Hispanic relationships among Highland and Lowland societies possibly mirrored the ritualized commodity exchanges in Colonial-era Campeche and Tabasco, but on a grander scale. In fact, Farriss argues that the early success of the Spanish Christianizing enterprise, and the cofradia system's persistence into modern times, pre- supposes a pre-Columbian tradition underlying it. She suggests that originally many of the elite functionaries involved in these fraternities belonged to, by then, the defunct pre-Hispanic merchant classes. I take this suggestion 52</page><page sequence="9">Music in Art XXVIII/ 1-2 (2003) one step further by proposing that music-making functions attached to pre- and early-Posthispanic trade at least partially accounts for the spread and acceptance of instruments, like the slit-drum. Evidence indicating the extent of Highland and Lowland correspondence can be found in the names for a few objects from the pre-Columbian West Indies. There, paraphernalia used for the ball game along with the slit-drum - both theorized as Lowland inventions - constitute the only major culture-related object types shared between Meso and Caribbean America; with the name used for the idiophone indicating its perceived association with Mesoamerican Highland icono graphical concepts. In his study of sixteenth-century Caribbean cultures Dominican friar Gonzalo Fernández de Oviedo y Valdês included two drawings of a West Indian slit-drum, one showing the instrument's top, with an H-cut, and the second, the bottom, with a large square access cutout, proving Mesoamerican influence on design [fig. 5]. Cuban folklorist, Rhyna Moldes states that the name for this Caribbean slit-drum was mayohuacan 48 and Ramón Pané, who translated the 1571 New World account of Alfonso Ulloa, listed Ulloa' s name for a Taino (Caribbean) slit-drum as maiohavau .49 These may be different names for the same sound-producing object or the same word spelled differently, but in both cases the name(s) also means "maguey cactus". A Caribbean name used for both the maguey cactus and the slit-drum presupposes a correspondence between the two objects that mirrors their association as sculpted on the El T ajln ball court wall, with its implication of Lowland-Highland Mesoamerican relationships. (This suggests that Middle- American contact with west Indian cultures may have been a pan-Mesoamerican endeavor.) On the association of objects to cultures. Central Mexican diagnostics like Teotihaucán "thin orange pottery" and Toltec "plumbate ware" were manufactured elsewhere (Puebla or Veracruz for the former and the Chiapas-Guatemala border region for the latter), but to the ancient people who used or knew of these ceramics, the pottery types represented the aesthetics and ideals of the respective Mexican cultures disseminating them, and not those which made them. Assignment of Mesoamerican objects to distributing cultures helps to reconcile the conflict between the slit-drum's association with Classic-era Highland concepts (the fall of the old Teotihuacán gods, maguey cactus, maguey rope, and domination and accession rituals) with the lack of the instrument or its imagery at Classic-era Highland centers.50 With the demise of the Olmec civilization (after 300 B.C.), subsequent Gulf Coast and Pacific coast Lowland cultures devolved into tribute states, beholden to more politically, economically, and militarily-powerful cultures, which from that time forward were generally centered in the Mexican Highlands. Nevertheless, the eastern Gulf-Coastal zone became fixed in the collective consciousness of Mesoamerica, as the home of the sun and even of civilization itself. Material objects associated with the Lowland - cacao, rubber, the ball game, and possibly the slit-drum - became imbued with pan-Mesoamerican religio-political power, which was used by Highland cultures to enhance their dominance.

A famous example is the tecomapiloa, a small slit-drum with an attached gourd, which Stevenson describes as a woman's in- strument (Stevenson, op. cit., 61-62). 19 David Drew, The Lost Chronicles of the Maya Kings (Berkeley: University of California Press, 1999), 240. 20 R.

According to Standley, an inferior rubber was also derived from the sap of certain fig trees (such as Ficus petiolaris and Ficus padifolia) . Fig trees were useful as sources not only for rubber (and canoes) but also for the paper, found in many pre-Columbian codices. The Otomi in Hidalgo, Mexico, still made paper from Ficus trees in the early 1920s (Standley, op. cit., 206). It is interesting to consider the communicative potentials of this single source material, canoes for transportation, paper as a writing and painting surface, and rubber- tipped drum sticks to beat out sounds. 36 Samuel Mar Ú, Instrumentos musicales precortesianos (Cordoba, México: Instituto Nacional de Antropologia e Historia, 1955), 32. 37 Eric R.
