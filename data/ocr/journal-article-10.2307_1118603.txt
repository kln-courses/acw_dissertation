In 1793, Edmund Randolph, first Attorney General of the United States, appeared in the Supreme Court as counsel for two citizens of South Carolina (the executors of a British creditor) who were suing the State of Georgia.1 Mr. Randolph's plea, elegantly and ably phrased, was that individuals were, under the Constitution, entitled to protection from the oppressive exercise of power by the States of the Union; that such exercises were "in derogation of the general sovereignty" of the Federal Union; and that therefore the sovereign States could be sued by aggrieved citizens in the federal courts. The Supreme Court pathet- ically but futilely requested that some member of the Bar take up the gauntlet in opposition to the Attorney General or for its further enlight- enment. Despite the failure of counsel to comply and Randolph's solemn assurance that he was not seeking the overthrow of states' rights, public opinion and the press were vehement in denunciation when the Supreme Court, by a divided vote, announced that the sovereign State of Georgia was liable to federal process. With consummate dispatch, the Eleventh Amendment to the Constitution was passed exempting a State of the Union from suit in the federal courts, lest, as one agitated newspaper put it, the decision in the Chisholm case "fritter the State away to corporations."2 In 1945, Ellis Arnall, Governor of the State of Georgia, appeared in the Supreme Court to represent his state as party plaintiff in an original proceeding.3 Georgia charged in its bill of complaint that some twenty railroad corporations had violated the Sherman Antitrust Act by a conspiracy to fix arbitrary and non-competitive rates through private rate-fixing machinery not sanctioned by the Interstate Commerce Act. The discrimination against Georgia shippers promoted by that conspiracy, according to the allegation, had not only caused injury to the State in its proprietary capacity as a shipper,4 but had seriously injured 1.

Injury to the State in its proprietary ca- pacity was concededly a "make-weight" in the later proceeding.</page><page sequence="2">COLUMBIA LAW REVIEW the State in its sovereign capacity as parens patriae. This impairment of Georgia's sovereignty consisted of holding the State's economy in a state of arrested development, depriving Georgia's products of equal access to a national market, and frustrating measures taken by the State to pro- mote the general progress and welfare of its people. This time eminent counsel were not lacking. Edmund Randolph's lineal descendant, Francis Biddle, filed a brief amicus in behalf of the Department of Justice in support of Georgia's position.5 Four briefs were filed by the various railroad corporate defendants on the return to the rule to show cause alone. Behind the Governor of Georgia and the Attorney General of the United States, in spiritual if not in legal privity, stood the Gov- ernors of all the southern and western States that have since Granger and Populist days been complaining of the vicious impact of discrimina- tory freight rates and basing point systems upon the development of their respective territories.6 When the Supreme Court finally decided in a five to four decision to take jurisdiction over this controversy, the defendant railroad corporations were able to espouse a simpler non- judicial out than the State of Georgia had resorted to in the Chisholm case. Being desirous only of avoiding the specific statutory liability under the Antitrust Laws, they had no need for a Constitutional amend- ment; hence they devoted their efforts to the passage of specific amend- atory legislation, which at the current writing is still pending in the halls of Congress.7 Leaving to one side substantive merits and legal issues, the central problem in both cases was sovereignty. The substance of sovereignty is power-the power to govern one's affairs without accountability to out- side influences and without domination by external sources.8 Sovereignty is not measured by abstract legal status or by formal or verbal expres- sions of deference; it is measured by such concrete criteria as the terri- 5.

Thus, some international lawyers, despite their support of the legal proposition that sovereign states are equal before the law, have acknowledged that no such equality exists in fact, and that in any workable scheme of world organization the relative size and power of the various states must be taken into account.

Accordingly, viewed in power terms, the fear of the Federalists that sovereign States would be frittered away to the status of corporations has been replaced by a certain measure of despondent surmise that most of the States of the Union will never attain such a potent status,9 and this must be apparent to every citizen who has occa- sion to ponder certain simple statistics. The real property owned by the United States Steel Corporation, as far back as 1907, was equivalent to the area of Massachusetts, Vermont and Rhode Island ;1 the premium income of the Metropolitan Life Insurance Company in 1935 was three times the entire tax collections of New York State, where it is incorpo- rated, and that of the Northwestern Mutual Life Company in 1935 was one and a half times the taxes collected by its home state of Wisconsin ;1 and the payrolls and stockholder lists of a large number of corporations contain more names than the census rolls of many States of the Union.12 It was recently said, in connection with a new acquisition by an investment holding company already "engaged in activities ranging from the manufacture of kitchen sinks to the conduct of a stock brokerage business," that "if to this concentration of economic power there is added the tremendous power of influencing public opinion . the result is the creation of a repository of power able to challenge the sovereignty of government itself."13 The aggrandizement of corporate powers and personality has reached a point, as indicated by the Georgia Rate Conspiracy case, where both Federal and State sovereignty are impaired by "a private government of industry."14 In the face of this newcomer to sovereign power, mutual sensitivities to inroads on govern- mental power have been laid aside, and the Federal Government's con- cern for the elimination of coercion and discrimination in interstate 9.

However, it would appear equally applicable to all forms of coercive association in the industrial sphere, including corporations as well as associations of corporations. The articles of incorporation of a corporate concern are "rules of future behavior for its own executives, courts and legislature, laid down by former officials for future dealings with members of the concern."

The economic necessities of our expanding economy and the legal ingenuities which those necessities have pressed into service have converted what started out as a flat, somewhat ethereal, and comparatively inert "corporate fiction" into a rounded, hard and vigorous "corporate instrumentality." While corporate autonomy, in the broad sense, originated as the battle cry of Manchester liberals contending for freedom of individual association and liberation from state controls,16 subsequent history has demonstrated that corporate enclaves, given power, can easily develop far reaching internal repressions and external compulsions. The modern business corporation originally served a useful function in breaking down the economic rigidities and predetermined individual status inher- ent in feudalism and mercantilism, by conferring on individuals the right freely to contract themselves into new forms of association for specific business purposes and change their status. It has, however, like all free institutions staggering under heavy administrative and functional burdens, in large measure evolved into a new corporate feudalism, with a status-and-caste system of its own that will bear careful watching.17 It is unhappily no verbal cliche, but an authentic danger signal, that identifies totalitarianism with a society constituted along "corporative" lines.18 15. Chief Justice Stone in his dissenting opinion urged that the Federal Gov- ernment, and not the state, was parens patriae with respect to the cause of action therein alleged. See Georgia v. Pennsylvania R. R., 324 U. S. 439, 474 (1945). It is not clear, however, why the Federal Government's interest in avoiding discriminations in interstate commerce necessarily deprives a state of the right to complain of direct injuries inflicted on it by the same factual complex. 16. For indications of how "freedom of incorporation" was related to all the other freedoms of association that were in the air during the nineteenth century, see COMMONS, INSTITUTIONAL ECONOMICS (1934) 325. 17. The writer has always suspected that Maine's famous generalization "that the movement of the progressive societies has hitherto been a movement from Status to Contract" [MAINE ANCIENT LAW (1st Am. ed. 1864) 165] was more a rationalization of a laissez-faire predilection than a reasoned conclusion from legal history. It has been pointed out that contemporary commercial life has become in- creasingly full of standardized contractual relationships, such as are involved in a standard insurance policy or employment contract, which are in fact a reversion to law based on status rather than on contract.

CORPORATE SHADOW ACQUIRES CONSTITUTIONAL SUBSTANCE This access of sovereignty, this infusion of virile power into the corporate shell, has been a development of the last century. It took place, of course, because of the easy adaptiveness of the corporate device to the needs of an American industrial and financial life that was expanding into nationwide dimensions and sought an uninhibited medium for im- plementing economic urges. However, there co-existed with these newer social and economic drives a backlog of agrarian and anti-indus- trial forces, more locally based social viewpoints, and a constitutional sentiment strongly attached to the preservation of states' rights. In their search for rationales that would answer these inimical trends, and give substantial status to the corporate fiction in the face of an untoward constitutional and legal vocabulary and a most dim perception of the commercial potentialities of the corporate ways of doing business, the protagonists of the corporate fiction relied on further fictions which they elaborated in the sphere of constitutional law. Fictions, like lies, would seem to win acceptance and gain strength by multiplication. In their search for constitutional fictions to buttress and reinforce the corporate fiction, the corporations have not been uniformly success- ful. They have never succeeded in getting themselves accredited as "citizens" entitled to the protection of the privileges and immunities clauses of either Article IV, Section 219 or the Fourteenth Amend- ment.20 Paradoxically enough, the very case, Paul v. Virginia, that decided that an insurance company was not a "citizen" entitled to such protection held that insurance contracts were not "commerce," and hence not interstate commerce. This fiction (a sufficient but not a necessary one to the result reached by the court) was of manifest service at the time to the cause of state regulation of insurance, but, by dint of several distortions, it was subsequently used as a means of attempting to im- munize certain aspects of the insurance business from federal regula- tion.21 19.

Guerrilla warfare on the validity of their admis- sion to that jurisdiction by dissenting members of the Supreme Court persisted as late as 1859.22 According to Professor McGovney in a lucid article, the Supreme Court has studiously avoided at any point saying that corporations are citizens, a point however overlooked in two Congressional hearings on diversity jurisdiction.23 Federal jurisdiction was finally established on the basis of one fiction that a suit against a corporation was a suit against the stockholders,24 and a further fiction, made irrebuttable, that the stockholders of a corporation were to be deemed citizens of the incorporating state.25 So established has this latter fiction become that it has been held unconstitutional for a state to legislate against it even where the fiction clearly contradicts the facts.26 Incidentally, it may be observed that the procreativeness of corporations is such that corporations have been able to use the fact of domestic incorporation as a means of defeating Federal diversity jurisdiction, as well as of attaining it; this, for example, was unsuccessfully attempted in the Georgia Rate case.27 Chief Justice Taney, in Bank of Augusta v. Earle,28 not only thwarted the corporations' desire to avail themselves of the benefits of the privileges and immunities clause, but also laid down, along magiste- rial lines, the doctrine of comity, which gave the states the right to exclude corporations from their borders at will.

This unimpeded power of the state to exclude corporations was ultimately directly checked by the emergence of the "unconstitutional conditions" doctrine. Under this doctrine it was still admitted that a state could utterly exclude corporations from their confines and that it could impose conditions upon their entry there- in, but denied that the state could impose "unconstitutional conditions" on such admission-a reversal of the generally accepted logical notion that the greater includes the lesser power.30 Before the unconstitutional conditions theory had become estab- lished, however, the corporate protagonists had marvelous luck in another direction. Despite fulsome historical and literary indications to the contrary, they procured accepted constitutional standing for the fiction that corporations were "persons" entitled to the protection of the due process and equal protection clauses of the Fourteenth Amendment.31 In the Slaughter House cases,32 the Supreme Court, speaking five years after the passage of the Fourteenth Amendment, had said: "We doubt very much whether any action of a State not directed by way of discrim- ination against the Negroes as a class, or on account of their race, will ever be held to come within the purview of this provision." Yet, of the cases in the Supreme Court "in which the Fourteenth Amendment was applied during the first fifty years after its adoption, less than one-half of one per cent invoked it in protection of the Negro race, and more than fifty per cent asked that its benefits be extended to corporations."33 29. The classic description of how this proposition came to be nullified by judi- cial application of the interstate commerce, due process and equal protection clauses of the Constitution is to be found in HENDERSON, THE POSITION OF FOREIGN CORPORATIONS IN AMERICAN CONSTITUTIONAL LAW (1918). 30. See Merrill, Unconstitutional Conditions (1929) 77 U. OF PA. L. REV. 879. 31. This fiction, although it had been exhaustively argued to the Court by Ros- coe Conkling in San Mateo County v. Southern Pacific R. R., 116 U. S. 138 (1882), was not accepted by the Supreme Court until the case of Santa Clara County v. Southern Pacific R. R., 118 U. S. 394 (1886). Conkling had been a member of the Joint Congressional Committee that drafted the Fourteenth Amendment and was pre- sumably aware of the racial origins of that amendment and its consequent limitation to natural rather than artificial persons. The evidence bearing on how he "aided" the Court by suppressing and distorting the legislative history of the provisions and artfully substituting for that history his own more or less novel conception is set forth in Graham, "The Conspiracy Theory" of the Fourteenth Amendment (1938) 47 YALE L.

FICTIONS ARE FACTS-AND COERCIVE FACTS No point is made that either the extension or the solidification of the corporate fiction and these buttressing constitutional fictions were not justified by the economic necessities and social drives of the time, and no argument is therefore had with the consequent enhancement of the corporate personality. It is merely suggested that both types of fictions are only ratiocinations which have no provable counterpart in the inherent nature of things. Their justification is two-fold-a positive one in terms of social serviceability, and a negative one in terms of the need for a commercial terminology capable of treating a large business enterprise as a whole rather than resolving it into its countless and un- manageable individual human and property participating factors. Likewise, we need not be concerned with either the ontological or the epistemological status of the corporate fiction (i. e., its "reality" or its "truth value"), except to the extent that such analysis is employed emotionally and as a rhetorical tool, to deprecate or magnify out of proportion the unpleasant or the comforting aspects of commercial and corporate relations. It is not a necessary attribute of legal or other fic- tions that they deceive, betray or stultify,34 or that they interfere with either the comprehension or the adequate regulation of social mechanisms or current affairs. Thus, Pope Innocent IV, who invented the "fiction" theory with respect to the nature of corporations in general, and the states which subsequently adopted the related theory that corporations owed their existence to a "concession" by the state, were dynamic and powerful political organisms that used those fictions to enhance and jus- tify their control over corporations, not to enfeeble or eviscerate that control.35 With the recession of feudal, hierarchical, and nationalist features in modern society and the modern state's increasingly diffused preoccupation with welfare and other interests, however, the corporate fiction, instead of remaining a convenient instrument of discourse, has 34. E.g., as expressed by Jeremy Bentham:-"In the mind of all, Fiction, in the logical sense, has been the coin of necessity-in that of poets, of amusement-in that of the priest and the lawyer, of mischievous immorality in the shape of mis- chievous ambition." C. K. OGDEN, BENTHAM'S THEORY OF FIcrIoNs (1932). Ben- tham's vehement strictures against legal fictions were, however, largely based on his preoccupation with their pernicious influence in the fields of criminal law and procedure, and were directed towards arbitrary rather than reasoned fictions. 35. See Dewey, The Historic Background of Corporate Legal Personality (1926) 35 YALE L. J. 655, 666, 670. There is, of course, no inherent conflict be- tween the fiction and the concession theories, the former leading easily into the latter. The Papacy with its cosmic frame of reference and the national state with its all-inclusive governmental frame of reference were able to police their creations and keep them from expressing a private interest overriding the public interest. The emergence of the doctrine of natural rights, however, has helped to exalt pri- vate as against public rights. 540</page><page sequence="9">CORPORATE FICTIONS largely become an imperious master of action. Particularly has this been true in the case of the modern business corporation, which is centuries removed, in complexity and economic purpose, from the medieval en- claves of civic, intellectual, and religious life (the town, the university, the monastery) on which speculation as to the nature of corporate groups first cut its wisdom teeth. Accordingly, we can discard the corporate fiction only if we are prepared to substitute for it a superior mode of description, and we are not so prepared. Our knowledge of all "reality" is largely referential and symbolic, and fictions, therefore, necessary logical expedients on which we must rely.36 "L'utilite de la fiction c'est de peindre et de resumer elegamment un etat de choses, de lui donner du relief et de la couleur, de simplifier la description d'une situation compliquee; c'est d'etre un excellent procede de conception et d'exposition; c'est de rendre des services a la science et a l'enseignement."37 While the corporate fiction, like all fictions, distorts reality,38 that is true of linguistic as it is of all representational processes and we do not, for that reason, abolish writers, painters, or the media in which they work. To describe a corpo- ration as a fiction is not to negate its reality, or affirm its falsity or spuri- ousness.39 It is not proposed, therefore, that we abandon the corporate fiction, but merely that we recognize the partial and approximative service which it performs as an aid to the understanding. On this basis of understanding and utilizing current linguistic usages rather than discarding them in favor of more rigorous and logi- cally consistent philosophic patterns, it is not necessary to labor relative practical advantages as between the "fiction" theory of corporations and the "real entity" theory for which Gierke laid the authoritative founda- tions.40 Gierke's view, popularized for our tradition by Maitland, is 36. For an intriguing analysis of the extent to which we see "reality" through symbols which distort it, see ScorT BUCHANAN, SYMBOLIC DISTANCE (1932). "A fiction can be substituted for the actual world, and in practice we all do that; but it is not a picture of true reality, it is only a sign used in order to deal with reality, a logical expedient devised to enable us to move about and act in the real world."

See particularly MAITLAND, INTRODUCTION TO AND TRANSLATION OF GIERKE'S PO- 541</page><page sequence="10">COLUMBIA LAW REVIEW that the corporation or corporate group is a real entity on which the law has conferred "legal personality," which permits the corporation to acquire rights and enter into liabilities.41 This theory, while it performs a distinct analytic service, does not dispense with the fictional element- it merely locates the fiction more specifically in the "legal personality" or "right-and-duty bearing" mechanism of the corporation,42 rather than in its property, constituent membership, or other more corporeal inci- dents. Accordingly, if we take the word fiction in its derivative etymolog- ical sense,43 the corporation represents a mental construction, a juridical artifact, the reality of which not only must be admitted but can hardly be ignored. This is likewise true, as has been pointed out, from the stand- point of epistemology.44 Similarly, as a matter of legal analysis, to ascribe legal personality even to an individual is an act of artifice and hence a "fiction." The "real entity" and "fiction" doctrines are on entirely different philosophical levels. The fiction theory is a methodological approach; the real entity doctrine is a proposition in metaphysics designed to give comfort to those who feel that analysis not concerned with real existences is unfruitful; and obviously there can be no inconsistency between doctrines operating in such mutually exclusive universes of discourse. Conflict arises only between those who assume that fictions are neces- sarily phantoms, and those who try to transmute the "real entity" of a corporation into a quasi-biological organism.45 Similarly, people who can take a detached view of "personality" as a matrix of juridically cogniz- able relationships can easily fit such a view in with either theory; only those who insist that "personalities" drink claret or sit in Sheraton chairs, throb or pulsate, or otherwise share the esthetic and visceral at- LITICAL THEORY OF THE MIDDLE AGE (1900); BARKER, INTRODUCTION TO AND TRANSLATION OF GIERKE'S NATURAL LAW AND THE THEORY OF SOCIETY, 1500 TO 1800 (1934); and GOEBEL, CASES AND MATERIALS ON THE DEVELOPMENT OF LEGAL INSTITUTIONS (1937) 547 et seq.

It is only when pejorative or literary connotations are assigned to the "corporate fiction," that one, for exam- ple, associates the "restrictive" theory of foreign corporations (making it hard for them to gain admission to a state) with the "corporate fic- tion" theory, and feels that acceptance of the "real entity" theory will grease the way for the opposed "liberal" theory of free admission.47 In theory and in practice, it is just as difficult and just as easy to deprive a "real entity" of juridical rights outside of the jurisdiction that first decided to give it "legal personality," as it is to strip the "corporate fiction" of legal standing outside the jurisdiction of its incorporation. The important thing for an admitting jurisdiction to bear in mind, as Baty has pointed out, is that a country which "admits" a corporation is introducing within its jurisdiction a foreign scheme of regulation and foreign-created relationships; once this recognition is made, it becomes a verbal quibble whether one should or should not call this set of relation- ships a "personality."48 Similarly, it is undeniably true that the theory of the real existence of corporate entities has been put to articulate and effective use by the protagonists of various schools of economic and political syndicalism. Thus, for example, the guild socialists, the supporters of the Free Church in England and Scotland, those who would like to see greater autonomy for trade unions, have been able to exploit the concept that groups possess a real personality.49 It may well be, however, that the most striking (although largely a silent and unrecognized) triumph of economic syndicalism in modern society-the business corporation-has been attained, not by resort to a sociological theory of real group person- ality deliberately designed as a charter for group autonomy, but by the persistent and canny manipulation of logical fictions. 46.

A corporation can only act legally, i.e., in the sphere of "power- liability, immunity-disability relations, which are the basis of all corpo- rate activity."53 2. The corporation is legal shorthand for the names of all the stock- holders of an enterprise and their duly authorized agents, thereby obviat- ing the necessity for signing the names of the million or so stockholders of A. T. &amp; T. to multitudinous corporate instruments. It is also a device which renders the process of accounting much more convenient.54 3. The corporation is "an important mercantile device rendered necessary by a credit economy" designed "to secure the limitation of liability to the property adventured" by the participants in the incor- porated enterprise. "It is quite in accordance with its medieval tradition that the privilege should be attached to the right to be considered a person, and that this right be brought into existence by some hieratic act like a charter. But in the modern Civil Law the license has already become a mere formality and in American law it is quickly becoming one."55 4. Business corporations have no basic similarity to public corpo- rations like the state; commentators have been misled in their ascrip- tion of reality to business corporations because they have analogized them to those political entities.56 The main grounds of distinction be- 50.

Baty also points out that towns and cities are limbs of government which "specialize in locality rather than in subject matter." He seems to appreciate that public corporations are to some extent "directly concerned with the work of con- 544</page><page sequence="13">CORPORATE FICTIONS tween the two are the involuntary nature of public corporations, and the emotional afflatus that the members of public corporations derive from their participation therein. 5. Public corporations are not voluntary in nature, for one is born within them and there is only a limited degree of power on the part of individuals to change their status therein, e.g., their nationality. In fact, "the state is not really a corporation at all, but the expression of a fact-the fact that in a circumscribed territory the security of life and property is maintained in accordance with certain definite rules which can be changed only in a definite way."57 6. With respect to the emotive effects of civic and public corpora- tions:-"The actual soil of the state or city or country is real enough, and the affection of a man for his physical home is an ancient complex of emotions, however we assume them to have arisen." The emotions which public entities like political parties and fraternal orders and clubs arouse are real emotions "because they are the emotions of real men. They do not add anything to the object which elicits them. They do, however, add something to the person who entertains them."58 With all due apologies for a necessarily truncated summarization, it seems to me that the only one of Professor Radin's premises which can be accepted is the proposition that the corporation is a linguistic and accounting convenience, and that all of the others are open at least to examination. The objections with respect to Professor Radin's analysis are along sociological, philosophical and psychological lines. First, Professor Radin says that, "if the corporation has no power to do a certain thing-I do not mean its ultra vires actions which are often quite within its legal powers-nothing at all has happened, how- ever much the corporation attempts to do it." This excludes the follow- ing acts and powers of corporations, with which both society and Gov- ernment would appear to have a legitimate concern: (a) Activities not authorized by the state, which are plausible ex- tensions or implications of activities which the state has authorized but represent trends which it might wish to scrutinize periodically and to limit. Thus, for example, a corporation may have the right without specific state permission to acquire its own stock. The State, however, may want to reexamine, and lay down restrictions of, that general au- thority, to cope with the economic and social ramifications of specific exercises of that corporate power; it may wish to withdraw or curtail ducting the national life," but is far from appreciating the complete extent to which this is true, supra note 52 at 366, 368, 369. 57.

The individuals within the corporate orbit or within its magnetic field of ex- ternal relations are tied to it by customary mental attitudes and beliefs that have such a strenuous psychological hold on them as to render fur- ther legal strait-jacketing largely a superfluity. Collective opinion is a powerful molder of action, and even the most detached of us are slaves of "the institutionalized mind."60 Furthermore, to the conscious blandishments of collective opinion there must be added the mechanical motor patterns created by habit, which drive people along well-grooved lines of action, including corporate routines. The individual involved in or tied to the corporate complex, therefore, is enmeshed in a Sargasso Sea of ethical custom, morality, tact, decorum, and fashion that in prac- tice exercises a considerable amount of coercion on him.61 (c) Passing from the impalpabilities of psychological conditioning to more external and specific coercions, one finds that the legal or physi- cal sanctions imposed by the state are frequently secondary in signif- icance to the economic sanctions imposed by a man's customers, compet- itors, employees, business groupings, etc. Fear of bankruptcy and fear of unemployment is the essential form of economic coercion upon which is founded the fabric of industrial government.62 The social order and its institutions create a type of legal framework which is distinguishable 59.

It must therefore be founded on a much broader base than can be supplied within a purely judicial framework, such as is encompassed by the traditional Hoh- feldian categories. The corporate steam shovel scoops up an extraor- dinary amount of basic social earth, considering the rather limited area of its legal biting edge.65 The powers of American corporations in fac- tory towns, of Unilever in British West Africa, of the Big Three in Detroit, of mining companies in colonial areas, to only a limited extent derive from their corporate charters and acquired legal rights,66 but rather lie implicit in their control of the economic and social machinery of the regions where they do business.6 Limited liability is undoubtedly the outstanding commercial charac- teristic of the modern business corporation, and one which has thus far had the benefit of outstanding functional research and analysis.68 63. See EHRLICH, op. cit. supra note 61. Ehrlich has metaphorically analogized the numerous relationships in society to a living stream; efforts to catch the whole body of such relationships in "legal provisions" is a futile endeavor to hold the liv- ing stream in a pond, frequently resulting in the creation only of a stagnant pool.

"Knowing few or none of the restraints which control an individual, the corporation has treated competitors, employees, and the public in a purely economic fashion.

Only a limited number of jurisdictions in this country take the view that corporate powers are limited to those specifically conferred in the corporate charter. Thus, one school permits corporations to exercise the powers implied by the pur- poses set forth in the articles of incorporation; and another permits corporations to have the capacity possessed by natural persons.

The point here made is that in these categories of implied powers and powers possessed by natural persons will occur relationships possessing no legally allocable status. 68.

The large-scale business corporation has defi- nite compulsive effects on the various individuals and groups under its hegemony, and has important economic relationships with outside units in the national and international community. "Every association, by the mere fact of its existence, is endowed with some coercive power, and actually exercises some such power in the course of pursuing its object. This coercive power is not necessarily recognized by the community, and the courts of law sometimes disallow particular exercises of it by voluntary associations. Nevertheless it exists, and is freely exercised every day."69 A system of law that hopes to take cognizance of the public policies and interests inherent in these internal and external cor- porate affairs and relationships cannot bind itself by a concept of law that in essence looks to no more than the legal registration of fixed liabilities accompanied by specific sanctions. Passing over from what he considers the inadequate enumeration of significant corporate relationships involved in Professor Radin's po- sition, there are two philosophic pre-suppositions underlying that posi- tion with which the author (probably because of his faith in the valid- ity and utility of a relational logic) cannot agree:-First, the forcible log- ical abstraction of corporate relationships from the "corporation," thereby truly leaving the corporation only a ghost or shell; second, the refusal to ascribe reality to the relationships thus abstracted. In the author's view, if one concedes that there are objects in the world external to our own minds, one must also accept the view that there are relationships linking ;liose objects; that the objects are meaningless when divorced from these relationships and exist only in terms of the relationships; and that it is an irrational endeavor to ascribe any less reality to the linking re- lationships than to the objects linked. Bringing this down to earth, the modern business corporation is a shorthand term for groups of men, physical properties, and the manifold investor, employee, supplier, man- ager, banker, etc., relations which unite these men and properties for certain ends, e.g., the production and sale of goods and services. To think of the men or properties as abstractions apart from the attributes implicit in these relationships is to postulate an attributeless substance, and to conjure up a corporate entity that, being no aid to edification, has no real case for existence.70 By the very act of defining the corporation Douglas and Shanks, Insulation from Liability Through Subsidiary Corporations (1929) 39 YALE L. J. 193. 69. See COLE, SOCIAL THEORY (1920) 128. 70. Professor Radin specifically aligns himself with the nominalist tradition in philosophy, and the traditional motto of the school: Entia non sunt multiplicanda praeter necessitatem.</page><page sequence="17">CORPORATE FICTIONS in such a way as to exclude relationships, Radin has created the very mental ghost and useless entity he decries. The cure for this vacuity, however, lies in his definition rather than in the corporate entity. Passing to the more purely psychological implications of the "non- entity" theory, witnesses for the "voluntary" character of large business corporations can doubtless be found, but one queries whether they will be drawn from the ranks of the thousands of employees of large cor- porations dependent upon their activities and favor for current liveli- hood and life-long security. Nor will they be found among the vari- ous firms doing business with the corporation, that must have its patron- age or go out of business.71 Similarly, the numerous 19th century American towns that were blackjacked into subscribing for railroad bond issues by the threat of being by-passed and having their economic growth permanently stunted thereby can attest to the bludgeoning char- acter of corporations and their investment promotion methods. The inference rather is that the commercial community will testify to a cer- tain compulsive character about the large-scale business corporation; that that compulsive character is to be found in what the corporation does rather than how it is constituted; and that it is not an easy matter to avoid that compulsion by dropping one's membership or affiliation with the corporation.72 Likewise with respect to emotional feeling tones. In the case of benevolent and paternal employer corporations, it is not difficult to vis- ualize corporate employees having a rather affectionate father image of their corporate employer that compares favorably with their affection for their natal city. Similarly, in the camaraderie of pleasant trade dealings and congenial trade association contacts, one can readily see 71. For example, as the Supreme Court so intelligently observed in American Column and Lumber Co. v. United States, 257 U. S. 377, 399 (1921), the place of a definite agreement suppressing competition as to production and prices is supplied: -"By the disposition of men 'to follow their most intelligent competitors,' espe- cially when powerful; by the inherent disposition to make all the money possible, joined with the steady cultivation of the value of 'harmony' of action; and by the system of reports, which makes the discovery of price reductions inevitable and im- mediate. The sanctions of the plan obviously are financial interest, intimate per- sonal contact, and business honor, all operating under the restraint of exposure of what would be deemed bad faith and of trade punishment by powerful rivals." 72. They are, in fact, likely to add this gloss to Radin's view of the corporation as a "fact" (see note 57 supra) :-"In a circumscribed territory [it may be circum- scribed, but the circumscription is wide enough to place our economic livelihood in jeopardy] the security of property is maintained in accordance with certain definite rules which can be changed only in a definite way [and, damn it, we neither made up the rules nor do we have any power to change them]."

While the author is obviously inclined to give firm anthropological status to a corporate entity which Professor Radin says "is not even a shade, or a ghost or a simulacrum" but is "a verbal symbol, a mathema- tical expression,"73 one should not leave the nominalist school without endorsing some of its valuable contributions to the subject. Thus, one may wholeheartedly concur in the proposition that to call corporations Frankensteins and to indulge in similar demonology does not lend clarity to analysis of the legal problems involved, and that the denunciation of the corporate device as such is "a transfer to it of qualities which properly belong to the men who use it."74 In fact, it is a most valuable contribution of the "non-entity" school (and one sometimes overlooked by the protagonists of other doctrines) that it has tended to focus needed attention on the enforcement of individual and personal liability for corporate acts. To the extent that there is more embraced by the corporation than a single indivisible person, effective enforcement of corporate obligations is not possible without effective enforcement of the obligations of the individuals having management responsibilities within the corporation.75 Nor is there any real disagreement with the ultimate conclusion that the corporate personality is "nothing more than the name by which a complexity can be dealt with in discourse,"76 pro- vided the complexity behind the name and the exhaustive nature of the social requirements for discourse are both given due consideration: IV. THE DUAL FACE OF THE CORPORATE FICTION: THROUGH THE LOOKING GLASS In fact, one may go even further than Professors Radin and Morris R. Cohen in saying that nothing is added to the corporate group by hypostatizing or reifying its unity;77 it may even be that something is actually lost and that the public interest is stultified by such a hypostasis. 73.

To take account of the broader sociology and politics of the modern large- scale business corporation, however, it is submitted, requires not only a broad lance but a careful surgeon's scalpel that will delicately probe the component fictional tissues that go to make up the total corporate veil, cauterizing and excising those which are pathological and illusory excrescences and conserving those that are performing organic and real services. The remainder of this essay is a limited foray in that direc- tion. Current experience indicates that the pendulum has largely swung over to the "liberal" theory of corporations. History has repeatedly demonstrated that ideas leap national and state barriers more readily than commodities, and the corporate entity and the legal relations re- volving around it have proven no exception. In the domestic field, Henderson's classic treatise has shown how the due process, the inter- state commerce and the equal protection clauses of the Federal Con- stitution have all been turned to corporate advantage.78 In the inter- national field, there is no restraining impediment of either a Constitution or a governing international law; the theoretically potent doctrine of state sovereignty has turned out to be a fragile barrier indeed against the irresistible economic drive of international combines and corporations. In fact the only effective checks and restraints which combines and corporations have had in international trade were similar rival economic units, and these putative competitive enemies all too often turn out, on closer view, to be cartel comrades.79 The problem now confronting us is this:-Granted a universal acceptance of corporations and of the reality of the corporate fiction by the state, and the equally universal recognition of the rights thereby conferred on corporations and on individuals within the corporation, has the state been able to retain its coordinating function? Are its social in- terests protected, and do corporations duly perform their obligations to the state? Does the state know where to assign responsibility for cor- porate action, and how to exact obedience and compliance? Essential to the answer to such questions is to break up the corpo- 78.

In addition to these "constituent" fictions, there must also be taken into account "sup- plementary" or "buttressing" fictions, calculated to extend the effec- tive scope of the corporate fiction by establishing fictional beachheads in related fields, such as constitutional law;80 "antithetic" fictions, which are used to cure the social and logical infirmities of fictions that are no longer able satisfactorily to encompass existing relationships ;81 and "pervasive" or "compounding" fictions that still further exaggerate the distorting effects of the constituent fictions.82 All of these make their respective contribution to the opacity or lucidity of the corporate com- plex. Moreover, when these fictions diverge from fact, their prolifera- tion acts as an unintentional smokescreen which makes the problem of outside knowledge all the more difficult. Since such knowledge is basic to effective public supervision and regulation, those processes are in their turn balked. Thus, the deficiency of public regulation of large na- tional and international corporations, and the failure of many corporate acts to reflect a national public interest, stems in large measure from this contrast:-The numerous component fictions that make up the "corpo- rate fiction", and the various abetting fictions just enumerated, do not deceive the corporate insider, who knows in what specific fact situations they are fallible or of limited applicability, and who can purposefully manipulate them for legal or public relations appearances. On the other hand, the representatives of the state approach these corporations handi- capped by lack of knowledge of the specific plans and activities of the corporation, and by a mental habituation calling for the application of generalized legal rules to standardized type situations. In the case of an international corporation, where so many significant things take place outside the territorial perspective of the national jurisdiction, under vastly different social, linguistic, and political conditions, the disparity between the knowledge of the corporate insider and the ignorance of the public outsider is greatly broadened, and either an unintentional or a deliberate secrecy on the part of the corporation becomes the rule.

THE CORPORATE FICTION IS MANY, NOT ONE:-CONSTITUENT FICTIONS The "corporate fiction" consists of at least the following constitu- ent fictional assumptions:- 1. That a corporation possesses certain anthropomorphic qualities, such as will This notion, wisely repudiated by the inventor of the corporate fiction theory, is a later contribution.84 Anglo-Saxon law, in making corporations amenable to criminal proceedings if it be demonstrated that they were guilty of evil intent or bad purpose,85 doubtless had a creditable objective in mind-the imposition of a merited liability on the corporate group-but has, in adopting that rule, measurably slowed down the attainment of that objective. It is all very well to say, as John Dewey has done, that the "will" thus attributed to corporations is a shorthand for certain empirical consequences attaching to their ac- tivities and is not a force or metaphysical or psychological entity.86 The fact remains that the courts have tended to reify this "will," and that that reification has raised problems of evidence and conceptual difficul- ties in the theory of proof that has impeded state regulation and judicial handling of these corporations. These difficulties are of course fre- quently intentional, for, as Justice Holmes has said of corporate stat- utes :-"A leading purpose of such statutes and of those who act under them is to interpose a non-conductor through which in matters of con- tract it is impossible to see the man behind."87 83.

That a corporation is a private law individual The Roman law was clear that the corporation originated as a pub- lic law unit, and subsequently acquired a status in private law;91 and, as a corollary, all corporate groups were cautiously scrutinized and cor- rected by the state as to their internal behavior as well as their external relations. With the German emphasis on Roman law sources and Hegelian reverence for the State, this public law association has been retained more consistently in the German legal tradition than it has been in ours.92 Together with this public law association has gone a Steel, 251 U. S. 417 (1920), dealing with a huge corporate consolidation of what had been competing corporations conspiring to crush competition and violate the antitrust laws. The effect of that decision was "by the use of the mystic power of legal incorporation to transform into a single person, incapable of conspiracy with himself, scores of separate corporations which in turn control hundreds of separate plants and comprise thousands of individual owners and a billion of capital."

Or take the much more recent Alcoa case:-The same group held a majority of the shares in both an American parent corporation and its Canadian subsidiary, the latter of which had entered into an agreement to restrict aluminum imports into the United States. This was not sufficient to make the American parent liable for violation of the antitrust laws, in the absence of evidence that it had "authorized" the subsidiary to enter into that agreement. See United States v. Aluminum Company of America, 148 F.(2d) 416, 441-2 (C. C. A. 2d, 1945). However, compare, as indicating that the "single trader" doctrine does not make conspiracy impossible between a parent and its subsidiary, the more modern cases of United States v.

In fact, the very establishment of the concept of a "private" corporation was largely an American constitutional innovation aimed 93. Cf.

However, at a later stage corporations became simple instrumentalities for carrying on business, and their by-laws restricted them to the management of the corporate business. See Williston, supra at 214-5. In a still later stage, when large corporations had acquired a factual predominance in their field of business activity, these legal limitations have become inoperative and un- availing and, like the medieval guilds, corporations have once more largely become the exclusive and unaccountable rulers of their field. 95.

The fate of the heavy industry of the Ruhr, hitherto so detrimental to the secur- ity of the world, is still undetermined, and the suggested international- ization of the Ruhr and of the Iranian oil wells may well leave us with internationally-sponsored industrial organizations of a corporate nature for which we shall have to find international masters. Independently of such internationalization, the determination of whether a corporation is public or private may still have important consequences with respect to the Occupying Powers' control of economic activities in Germany and Japan. Under the Hague regulations,'03 an occupier may take much more 98. For an able analysis of how the status of this new corporate species was first consolidated in Dartmouth College v.

The American program for international development has been to encourage the establishment of privately-owned banking and trading corporations in the international field.'"6 We shall, therefore, be faced with the problem of how these corporations can effectively compete with the publicly-owned and sponsored international corporations favored by the rest of the world. Unless the rules of the game are reasonably fixed, from our standpoint, foreign public corporations will operate to the disadvantage of our own private corporations; on the other hand, outsiders are in no position to know to what extent our private corpo- rations, which receive considerable government backing, are in effect public ones.1'7 This can only result in aggravating the current anarchic operations of international combines in the international community. The only answer to this anarchy is not to insist on outward shibboleths of allegiance, but to find for these combines a clear legal frame of ref- erence and a real master. 3. That the corporation is governed by a single group purpose This proposition has perhaps been most effectively stated by Pro- fessor Barker, who predicates the state's grant of capacity and legal personality to the corporation on the fact that it is endowed with a 104.

The tendency on the part of the Nazi regime to reprivitize large state- owned combines was probably largely motivated by the desire to avoid the war- time international disabilities of public corporations. For an overt admission at the time of the last war that this was why the German government did not wish to become the owner of the Reichsbank, see id. at 58. 106.

Also called for is a subordination of the "partial" common purpose of the corporation to the "general" common purpose of the State;110 ab- sent such an integration, one is bound to get undesirable forms of eco- nomic syndicalism and plural sovereignty.1l Canvassing the status and operations of the modern business corporation, it seems fair to say that adequate integration of its basic purpose with the basic objectives of the state has not been achieved, and that the corporation operates pri- marily as an atomistic and self-determining entity, not subject to any over-riding sovereign purpose.112 Passing from the political implications of the corporate group pur- pose to its ramifications in commercial practice, ascription of a single group purpose to a business corporation seems quite non-concordant with the facts. The point has repeatedly been made that the purposes of the modern business corporation have become excessively broad and multifarious and have lost their original unitary and specific character. Business corporations are no longer restricted to the precise specifi- cation of powers and lines of activity with which they first emerged into history, but may cover all lines of business, grow to any possible size, 108.

However, like a true Germanist, Gierke in fact believed in the control of corporations by a sovereign state which would subject them to even greater controls than in the case of individuals, controlling their internal life as well as their external activities. Id. at lxxxi-lxxxiii. Anyone acquainted with the min- imal extent of supervision by the state over corporations will appreciate how in- applicable this is to current conditions. 112. In speaking of the state (and the same should apply to lesser groups like corporations), Barker attempts a distinction between a group will, acting as a sheer personal force not dedicated to any purpose, and a group purpose. He visualizes the former as the base of fascism and the latter as correlative with the democratic trend. This, however, perhaps does not do justice to the semantic aptitudes of fascists, for even the most arbitrary of group wills can always conjure up group purposes acceptable to itself. In fact, it is only by identifying the "group purpose" of the state with the concept of the "sovereignty of law" (meaning presumably Anglo-Saxon law) that a group purpose becomes for Barker symbolic of democratic society. That identification, laudable as is its ethical motivation, is probably too mystical for a biologically minded Nazi and too sleight-of-hand for the cold lo- gician. In any event it may be noted that the "sovereign law" thus cleverly inter- calated in the social fabric was in itself the product of one or more group wills. 558</page><page sequence="27">CORPORATE FICTIONS use by-laws to define their internal organization and legal rights as they please, and amend those by-laws without recourse to further legislation or other governmental intervention.113 Furthermore, concurrently with the progressive legal toleration of ultra vires actions by corporations have gone unlimited powers to purchase and guarantee the securities of other companies and to act as holding companies.1l4 Sociologically speaking, a group purpose is the expression of a group will and, as will shortly be seen, a business corporation is a com- plicated mechanism containing at least several and at times divergent group wills."15 On this score alone a corporation will automatically possess several group purposes. Finally, in large corporations as in all large organizations, there persists a considerable measure of automatic activity, carried on by routine inertia apparently not specifically directed to any end.116 4. That the corporation is controlled by a single group will This notion is of course on its face not pertinent to the case of one-man corporations and purely formal corporate subsidiaries'17 that have only a bookkeeping or accounting existence. Moreover, the op- erations of large corporations cover such a wide area and are so complex that they present problems which are far beyond the technical scope and comprehension of any one human intelligence. Accordingly, dele- gations and re-delegations of power to act and make corporate deci- sions, both of a legal and practical, formal and casual, nature, are the inevitable order of the day. Conflicting pressure groups will struggle for and will share responsibility for corporate decisions, and multiple and perhaps non-concordant corporate objectives will press for priority of recognition. In such a situation, it is possible to think of a single mind or of a close union of minds furnishing volitional leadership and intellectual domination for the lesser lights of the enterprise, but to 113.

Suppression of, or obliviousness to, the welter of conflicting pres- sure groups that share responsibility for corporate decisions and to the multiplicity of corporate objectives,123 will in a democratic society have the untoward consequences of blurring the issues with which the state should be properly concerned, and of suppressing or overlooking the right of individual deviation from the group pattern. If we take for granted the divorcement between the economic and political spheres which is presumably characteristic of the democratic way of life (a somewhat difficult assumption because men do not compartmentalize as easily as many writers would like them to), the problem becomes one primarily of guiding the internal relationships of the corporation. In other words, it becomes the function of the state to see to it that the in- ternal powers which the corporation has over its constituents do not grow beyond the bounds of fairness and sound social policy. This funcLion the state performs, for example, when it enacts wage-hour legislation, insures the right of collective bargaining, or takes steps to protect the interests of minority stockholders. The democratic state is also under obligation to see to it that individuals are not unjustifiably associated with, and penalized for, corporate action that does not involve them morally or intellectually; this is the function of such legal doc- 118. Of course, on any specific case, the deciding group will, like the ultimately triumphant purpose, of a corporation may be unified. 119.

For both types of supervisory functions by the state, an arbitrary and standing assumption that the will of the employees, managers or investors of a corporation is indissolubly merged in a group corporate will is a confus- ing and ethically disserviceable conception. In the case of a totalitarian state, of course, economics and politics tend to become one. Both the internal and external relationships of the corporation tend to become subordinated to and reflections of the impe- rious and devastating political and military urges that dominate such a state. Unlike the case of the democratic state, where both the group will and purpose of a national corporation or an international combine will be operating on an economic plane logically not relevant to (though in practice often over-lapping or conflicting with) the political orbit of the national state, in the totalitarian state the path of two spheres are con- sciously gleichschaltet or correlated. Thus, in the latter the group will doctrine lends itself to the far more dangerous risk of an absorption of the corporate will into some hierarchy of group wills culminating in a powerful but irresponsible state.124 5. That that controlling group will is the will of:- (a) The stockholders. This proposition used to be stated with somewhat more precision, to wit, it was the will of the majority of the stockholders that prevailed. As the strength of disciplined minority groups in large public corporations became more evident, however, the courts have progressively accepted much lower stock percentages as "controlling," depending on the circumstances of the case.125 Current experience and analysis indicate that control can be attained by groups holding as little as 3% of the total voting stock of the corporation.126 In 124.

Since Veblen, it has been abundantly clear that in the case of any large publicly held corporation the will of the management rather than of the stockholders tends to govern the conduct of the corporate enterprise.131 The law, however, has been slow and circuitous in taking account of this fact.

However, the tenacity of the idea that the stock- holders exercise a controlling group will is well illustrated in the field of promoter's fraud. Here, on the basis of the rule that the stockholders control and are the corporation, the courts had long tolerated fraudulent conduct on the part of pro- moters, provided that the promoters were, at the legal moment the fraudulent con- duct transpired, the stockholders of the corporation. In such a situation the "stock- holders" were presumed to have acquiesced in everything the "promoters" did, because they were one and the same person. When this doctrine was finally over- thrown in a 5 to 4 decision by the Supreme Court, it was on the basis of the anti- thetic fiction of regarding the promoters as fiduciaries for the corporation and its subsequent stockholders and creditors, something which all of the promoters' prior actions indicated they had studiously tried to avoid becoming.

That determination is rendered more complicated (and also more difficult of legal acceptability) by various trends which can be given neither juridical nor formal corporate status, such as the cliquish, nepo- tistic, and quasi-feudalistic strains in corporate management groups, their variable dependence on legal, accounting, engineering and other special "competence" and contact groups, their subjection to the whims of general "communities of interest" within the industry, trade associa- tions and cartels, etc.132 (c) The creditors. In situations where an enterprise is insolvent or on the verge of insolvency, creditors are in a position to divest the stockholders of their normal legal control, replace management, and impose stipulations as to how the enterprise shall be run.133 In the case of international combines, bondholders have in the past in addition been able to call upon the intervention or active assistance of their govern- ments, but in recent years this has been decreasingly true. (d) Labor and consumer groups. As far back as 1932, Professor Dodd, relying among other things on public statements by Owen D. Young and Herbert Bayard Swope, described the large business corpora- tion as an economic institution with a social function owing obligations to labor and the consuming public. In reply, Professor Berle broadly hinted that it was inadvisable, in advance of the clarification and achieve- ment of the rights of stockholders, to abandon the view that business corporations were primarily responsible to their stockholders.134 The progress that has been made in the way of attaining Professor Berle's more limited canon of responsibility is reflected in the legislative, judicial and administrative acts of the last decade. Progress along Professor Dodd's lines is still primarily to be found in the wartime exploits of labor-management committees and contemporary newspaper accounts of labor groups' expectation with respect to price and related corporate policies. However, with a management that has pretty well laid aside entrepreneur psychology and is perhaps more likely to seek self-perpetu- ation than any other objective, the newspapers may yet prove to have the final and overriding word on this subject.35 132.

That the controlling group will is exercised for the benefit of:- (a) The stockholders, (b) The management, (c) The creditors, (d) Labor and consumer groups. There are two conflicting strands of thought that are to be taken account of in this connection. One is the factual presumption that groups with authority to act do so largely in their own interest. The other is the legal system itself, and considerations of social prestige and honor that obligate persons and groups to work in the interest of others.l36 It is both legally and morally true that corporate officers and directors are the managing partners, and ordinary shareholders the inactive partners, of the corporate enterprise.137 A happy ground of coincidence in the case of the corporation is that it is in the personal interest of management to conform to the legal and social system, which dictates that they work in the interest of the stockholders after satisfy- ing the claims of creditors, workers and other interested groups. But this still leaves a substantial area of uncertainty, because frequently different classes of stockholders in the same corporation have divergent interests. Also provocative of confusion is the fact that the stockholders' interest may be a debatable or imprecise one and management's loyalty to that interest either non-existent or too loosely defined to be meaning- ful.138 7. That the controlling group in fact makes all corporate decisions, i.e., "runs the corporation." This assumption for one thing overlooks the passive and negative elements that bulk so large in the "control" of a corporation.

That the corporation is in fact run by management, or a controlling group within the management. 9. That the controlling management group is:- (a) The board of directors. This implies that the directors take a comprehensive view of the whole enterprise and reach decisions on the basis of criteria of "sound business judgment." (b) The production department. On this theory, the engineers and technicians of the enterprise run it in the interests of efficiency, quality, and quantity of product. (c) The sales department. This places leadership in.the hands of the distribution executives, who emphasize volume of sales and short term revenues as the goal of the enterprise. (d) The finance committee. On this assumption, the guiding spirit of the enterprise is that of the investment banker, who would want to run it with a view to financial security and long term profits. In practice, corporate control and corporate policy is a blend of all these elements, varying for the individual enterprise.140 It is clear that a board of directors and even department heads cannot conceivably reach all of the individual corporate decisions that must be taken, and that 139. A good analysis, based on many case studies, of how corporate decisions and policies are arrived at is to be found in GORDON, BUSINESS LEADERSHIP IN THE LARGE CORPORATION (1945), which should be read in connection with propositions 6, 7, and 8 of this essay. Particular attention might be paid Gordon's distinction between "power" (the legal power to change the management), "influence" (the persuasive swaying of management), and "leadership" (the making of corporate decisions). Id. at 150-1. A court has held a parent's "control" over a corporation to be established if "there is no showing that its latent power to resume such con- trol has been extinguished." See Detroit Edison Co. v. S.E.C., 119 F.(2d) 730, 739 (C. C. A. 6th, 1941). "Controlling influence may spring as readily from ad- vice constantly sought as from command arbitararily imposed." See American Gas &amp; Electric Co. v. S.E.C., 134 F.(2d) 633, 642 (App. D. C. 1943). 140. See also note 161 infra. 565</page><page sequence="34">COLUMBIA LAW REVIEW considerable autonomy must be left to the various functional departments and lesser officials of the enterprise. The dominance or weight of any particular management group therefore is a function not only of its legal and administrative standing but also of its aggressiveness and historical status in the enterprise. In other words, there is present in the governing of the large corporate combine a sort of "corporate pluralism" akin to the "political pluralism" of the state.141 The main difference between the two is that the corporate mechanism is much more readily adapted to the resolution of conflicts among the respective groups within the enterprise than the political state is to the settling of conflicts between divergent political pressure groups. Although the bulk of all decisions by big corporations are probably reached in the lower echelons, those which determine the basic status of the corporation within the com- munity and the nation (i.e., financial decisions as to major acquisitions of competitors and expansion of internal plant, dividend and reinvest- ment policy; labor matters; over-all legal and financial organization) tend to be centralized in the chief executive of the firm, be he the presi- dent or the chairman of its board of directors. As for other important decisions not so centralized, there is a reviewing and deciding focus with- in each corporation, be that focus the vice president in charge of a specific function, a division superintendent, or some policy committee drawn from the entire firm. 10. That the controlling group within management has an undiluted economic allegiance to the corporation. Not only do salaries and hopes of promotion frequently lead man- agement to decisions based on personal advancement rather than corpo- rate benefit, but interlocking directorates and outside financial interests held by members of the management group frequently influence corpo- rate decisions. This has been the reason why courts regard with disfavor directors voting themselves salaries, settlements or other emoluments,142 and executing contracts between two corporations on which they happen to be common directors.143 Nor could the phenomenon of "upstream financing" (depleting the financial resources of a subsidiary in favor of 141.

The typical question is this:- Is a corporate director, when he purchases stock in his corporation from a shareholder, under a duty to disclose to that shareholder information, known only to insiders like the director, which will affect the value of that stock? If he does not so disclose, the stockholder, of course, will part with his stock for a smaller consideration than he would otherwise have gotten. The courts originally adopted, though not without considerable hesitation at the outset,145 the view that a corporate director's duty lay to the corporate entity as a whole, and not to the individual stockholders, and that he was therefore under no duty to disclose.146 It was not until 1903 that the minority doctrine that the director owed a duty of disclo- 144.

J. 563; and another leading case, Carpenter v. Danforth, 52 Barb. 581 (N. Y. Sup. Ct. 1868), was a repudiation on reconsideration of an earlier decision, Carpenter v. Danforth, 19 Abb. Pr. 225 (N. Y. Sup. Ct. 1865). These two cases are discussed at length in Dawson v. National Life Ins. Co. of U. S., 176 Iowa 362, 157 N. W. 929 (1916), which also contains a forceful argu- ment against distinguishing the corporate entity from its constituent parts. 146. The above has been generally described as the majority rule, though there have been indications of recession from that viewpoint. Lower court decisions in New York seem clearly to indicate such a departure from the majority rule. Saville v. Sweet, 234 App. Div. 236, 254 N. Y. Supp. 768 (lst Dep't 1932) ; Ham- mer v. Werner, 239 App. Div. 38, 265 N. Y. Supp. 172 (2d Dep't 1933); Levy v. Pacific Eastern Corp., 153 Misc. 488, 275 N. Y. Supp. 291 (Sup. Ct. 1934). But see Stanton v. Schenck, 140 Misc. 621, 251 N. Y. Supp. 221 (Sup. Ct. 1931). That these decisions will be sustained also appears to be a clear inference from such landmark decisions in related fields as Wendt v. Fischer, 243 N. Y. 439, 154 N. E. 303 (1926); Meinhard v. Salmon, 249 N. Y. 458, 164 N. E. 545 (1928); Sautter v. Fulmer, 258 N. Y. 107, 179 N. E. 310 (1932). See also Dutton v. Barnes, 162 Minn. 430, 203 N. W. 414 (1925). This recession has taken the form of saying, for example, that once a corpo- rate director has started making disclosure with respect to his inside information, he must continue making those disclosures.

Similarly, the rationale given in condemning situations where the director buys the stock prior to the sale or dissolution of a corporation is that he is disposing of the corporate property and not of the corporate stock.

It was too strong medicine for the Supreme Court, which in 1909 enunciated a variant proposition that there was, generally speaking, no such duty but that "special circumstances" might cause such a duty to arise.148 The com- mentators on this problem, with two exceptions, uniformly lined up on the side of requiring disclosure.149 While the liberal writers thus ar- rayed themselves behind the banner of disclosure, some of the courts, aided perhaps by the fact that they must cope with the specific workings of remedies as well as the abstract formulation of rights and duties, began, in scattered flashes of insight, to question the practical efficacy of disclosure.150 When Congress finally came to grips with the problem, it sagaciously reversed the trend, abandoned the concept of disclosure and substituted for it an absolute dollar and cents liability. That liabil- ity, however, covered only (a) speculative trading (b) by corporate insiders (c) in registered securities.'15 147. Oliver v. Oliver, 118 Ga. 362, 45 S. E. 232 (1903); Stewart v.

The line between this and the minority rule is not an agreed one. Thus the Supreme Court referred (seemingly erroneously) to the Georgia and Kansas decisions cited in the preceding footnote as "special circumstance" cases, see Dawson v. National Life Ins.

Should a director disclose opinions and estimates, even hopes and pros- pects, as well as facts, and how can he? What limit is there to the imponderables that might influence the value of securities? Might not the disclosure of a surmise that turned out to be wrong damage the corporation or even subject the confiding director to an action in tort? See Goodwin v.

For the gen- 568</page><page sequence="37">CORPORATE FICTIONS There is a plethora of similar situations illustrating the frequency with which corporation management is torn between self-interest and the necessarily more altruistic requirements of the corporation. Courts have had frequent occasion to denounce corporate directors who have initiated a venture, or entered on a new competing business, made pos- sible only by taking advantage of knowledge and opportunities derived from their contacts with, and the goodwill possessed by, their corpora- tion.152 These situations involve problems of business ethics similar to those (usually involving interlocking directorates) where a parent cor- poration preempts for itself a resource or potentiality of expansion avail- able and of benefit to a subsidiary.153 Situations have frequently occur- red where a director has sold corporate property to himself on terms favorable to him but not to the company.'54 Frequently these situations have involved not only the preemption of a "corporate opportunity," but also extensive use of corporate funds and facilities that might have eral common law and legislative background of this legislation, see YOURD, op. cit. supra note 149. However, since the legislation does not cover securities which are not listed on securities exchanges and applies only to situations where the corporate insider buys and sells stock within a six-month period, and since purchasers of corporate stock do not have to sell the stock in order to make a "killing" on it, it deals with only a small segment of the problem. In all fairness it should be pointed out that the first subsection of the 1934 Act, 48 STAT. 881 (1934), 15 U. S. C. § 78b (1940), and the Public Utility Holding Company Act, 49 STAT. 838 (1935), 15 U. S. C. § 79a (1940), provide for the registration with the Securities and Exchange Com- mission of all purchases or sales made by corporate officers, directors or ten per cent or more stockholders. Outside of the great probability that corporate investors will not scrutinize these records, it may be pointed out that this process takes place only after the corporate insider has taken advantage of his inside information and is therefore no real remedy against such abuse. The legislation thus excludes pre- cisely those "parochial," closely held corporations with few and geographically con- centrated stockholders for which disclosure had been concededly a practicable obli- gation. Cf. Nichol v. Sensenbrenner, 220 Wis. 165, 263 N. W. 650 (1935); Saville v. Sweet, 234 App. Div. 236, 254 N. Y. Supp. 768 (lst Dep't 1932). Furthermore, since the holders of stock in large publicly owned corporations registered on ex- changes have already, through legislation and improved fiscal practice, gained a considerable measure of protection, it would seem that the current Congressional solution covers only a small area of the corporate investor's ignorance and de- fenselessness. 152.

That the controlling group's economic responsibility to the corporation is clear in all cases. This assumption is likewise frequently contradicted in practice. Corporate management faces frequently such problems as whether to expand its manufacturing plant in a new or foreign area, to regard that area solely as a market outlet, or to withdraw completely from it; whether or not to manufacture a new product or to repress a new inven- tion; whether to follow a low production, high cost or a high production, low cost policy, etc161 In addition to these moments of economic wavering and uncertainty, the way also lies open for cartel comradeship or political considerations to determine the issue. 12. That the controlling group's political and social loyalties can be determined independently of its economic responsibilities, and are in practice not swayed by economic predilections. Merely to point out that the major powers involved in the last two great World Wars have passed legislation prohibiting trading with the enemy is to refute this thesis. In addition, there have been numerous other situations in which corporations with global business connections have, in pursuit of their economic self-interest, ignored or circumvented economic and social policies of great national import, including not only such prime military security essentials as the disarmament of the de- feated enemy, the stockpiling of critical and strategic materials, and the avoidance of direct revenue or production aids to the enemy, but also such important peacetime programs as taxation, tariff, price control, and the enforcement of antitrust restrictions.162 Frequently this evasion or slighting of national policy results from so-called cartel commitments, i.e., it arises out of friendly and cooperative relationships with foreign 161. For an analysis of the different types of motivations that may be ex- pected to govern the different functional departments of a large enterprise see ROB- INSON, THE STRUCTURE OF COMPETITIVE INDUSTRY (1932). Professor Dodd points out, for example, that not all types of corporate expansion increase the profits of stockholders. Even a management that recognizes fully its fiduciary obligations toward stockholders is likely to be confused when different classes of stockholders are benefited by different corporate policies.

That the controlling group owes political allegiance to that sovereign state: (a) Which has given the group corporate status, (b) Where the administrative center of operations of the corpo- ration exists, (c) Where the enterprise conducts its principal operations. For layman and lawyer alike, nationality has been the accepted determinant of where allegiance should lie.164 Accordingly, an uncon- troverted test of nationality would indicate an unambiguous allegiance, and confused notions of nationality betoken uncertain loyalties. In the corporate field, we find confusion and uncertainty. The equivalent in legal language of the three political assumptions stated at the beginning of this paragraph are that the nationality of the corporation is (a) that of the state which incorporated it; (b) the jurisdiction where its siege social or administrative center is located; and (c) the place of principal exploitation of the corporate business, respectively. The first is the prevalent common law doctrine, the second the rule generally adopted by the civil law, and the third a test which has found some acceptance at the hands of states anxious to subject corporations to taxation and in international law theory.165 However, 163. This process has been so clearly described in numerous books, articles and hearings dealing with the activities of international cartels, that it is unnecessary to repeat them here. One example will suffice:-DuPont, feeling patriotic stirrings, in December 1934 warned the Ethyl Gasoline Corporation that the military security of the United States dictated that Ethyl retain the secret of tetraethyl lead and not surrender it to I. G. Farben, the great German chemical combine. Ethyl, however, was owned 50 per cent by General Motors and 50 per cent by Standard Oil. Gen- eral Motors had an extensive manufacturing plant investment in Germany, the pres- ervation of which was dependent upon continued amicable relationships with the Germans. Standard Oil had contractual cartel commitments with I. G. Farben, en- tered into defensively and committing it to the still further appeasement of I. G. Farben. Consequently, I. G. Farben, and through it the German military machine, obtained the secret. Under such conditions, not only was Ethyl ignoring the na- tional interests of the United States, but it was reflecting the general climate of industrial opinion rather than a commercial policy of its own. It is no wonder that much later, when the United States was already involved in war danger, the stock- holders of Standard Oil refused to break off relationships permanently with I. G. Farben. See BERGE, CARTELS: CHALLENGE TO A FREE WORLD (1944) 23. DuPont, by the way, was not a powerless, side-lines prompter; it owned 23% and controlled 27% of the stock of General Motors.

COMP. LEG. &amp; INT. L. 81, 96-99. There are various minor variations on these basic criteria into which it is not necessary to go for our present purposes. 572</page><page sequence="41">CORPORATE FICTIONS the facility of multiple incorporation and the prevasiveness of compli- cated holding company and similar corporate set-ups have deprived the common law criterion of value as an indicator of corporate alle- giance. The civil law test similarly loses pertinence as a benchmark of corporate allegiance when one considers the easy mobility of corpo- rate managements and records, and the international flavor of large corporate managements.166 The place of principal exploitation of the enterprise has found almost no legal recognition and is extremely difficult to apply as a practical economic test. The lack of validity both as to the political assumptions about corpo- rate allegiance and the legal assumptions with respect to corporate na- tionality is still further evidenced by the fact that, in wartime, the enemy character of corporations tends to be determined by such tests as the purposes to which the corporate activities are directed, whether its activities are of benefit to the enemy, whether its controlling group is enemy in character, etc.'67 Even in peacetime, where the maintenance of the fisc and of the state's taxing power is involved, states have found it expedient to abandon both the common and civil law tests, and call the corporation a national of the place in which its business operations were being carried on.'18 Furthermore, the determination of corporate nationality is fre- quently only the first step in deciding what the public obligations of a corporation are, i.e., the nature of its duties within the state. Courts scrutinize the behavior of a corporation from the standpoint of where its physical properties are located; where its management resides, meet- ings are held, and books and records kept; where its contracts are entered into; where they are to be performed; where the "center of gravity" of the contract is, etc. They then decide what the governing law of a specific transaction will be, on the basis of their evaluation of the relative significance of these "contacts" to the transaction. Interstate and international transactions lend themselves to considerable manipula- tion of these "contacts" by the parties concerned, and consequently to the choice, from among alternative legal systems, of one particularly 166.

The "control" test of enemy character is the reason that courts have regarded the nationality of the stockholders as an important criterion in determining the enemy character of a corporation. See Daimler Co., Ltd. v. Continental Tyre and Rubber Co., Ltd. [1916] 2 A. C. 307, cited infra note 169. 168. On the whole, the related but more colorless rubric of corporate domicile is sufficient to catch the corporation for this purpose. See Note, Corporations in Exile (1943) 43 COLUMBIA LAW REV. 364, 370, 374-5. 573</page><page sequence="42">COLUMBIA LAW REVIEW desired by the parties. Out of this confused medley of so-called conflicts of laws tests, there arise specific economic obligations which tend to dilute and frequently to make nugatory the general obligation of political alle- giance which the corporate aggregate might be deemed to owe to the state of which it is a "national." It is this negation and emasculation of obligation and allegiance which has in large measure led judges to describe corporate nationality as a meaningless concept,'69 and legal writers to try to excise the corporate nationality concept from the baili- wicks of public international law and conflicts of laws.170 14. That the economic and other obligations required by that political allegiance are clear in nature, and can be obtained from specific governmental sources. This is the fiction of the unity of governmental policy, which may well contribute as much confusion in this field as any fiction relating to the corporation itself. Frequently, moreover, the corporation which governmental policy is to regulate in the public interest is one of the strongest of the contending groups engaged in trying to dictate the determination of that public interest. 169. In one House of Lords case alone, Daimler Company, Ltd. v. Continental Tyre and Rubber Co., Ltd. [1916] 2 A. C. 307, Lord Parmoor stated that nation- ality could properly be applied to a corporation [at 349]; Lord Parker and Lord Sumner said that this application could take place only "by a figure of speech" [at 339]; Lord Shaw of Dunfermline held it incongruous to apply the ideas of loyalty and allegiance to a limited company [at 329]; and the Earl of Halsbury flatly said that a corporation was not capable of loyalty and disloyalty [at 316]. The diversity of opinion in the Daimler case may well be contrasted with the rather uniform as- sumption by all the law lords in Janson v. Driefonstein Consolidated Mines, Ltd. [1902] A. C. 484, that a corporation incorporated under the laws of the Transvaal was an enemy alien, even if many or most of its stockholders were British subjects. As McNair points out, however, in the Janson case the conventional doctrine that the company is an entirely distinct person from its stockholders "had to stand the strain of a war, but only a mild strain and in only a small war," McNair, The Na- tional Character and the Status of Corporations, BRIT. Y. B. INT. L. (1923-24) 44-5; this was certainly not true in the Daimler case. By the time of this world war, the enemy character of a corporation is based entirely on the "objective" test of residence or commercial domicile, Sofracht (V/O) v. Van Udens Schweepvaart [1943] A. C. 203, 211, 219. To give proper scope to the British Trading with the Enemy Act, the further fictions were enunciated in this case that the nationals of enemy-occupied countries such as Holland, who had prior to the Nazi occupation been in allegiance to or alliance with the British Commonwealth (and in their hearts and by their actions were still resisting the enemy), were "ter- ritorial and technical enemies"; had come under allegiance to the hostile state; and may be loosely described as co-belligerent with the occupying power.

This is an alternative assumption to that set forth in (14) and is a specific application of the basic utilitarian thesis that private selfishness promotes public welfare. The deficiencies of this naive faith have been so long apparent that it does not seem necessary to spend much time on them in this article.171 Efforts more or less scientifically to appraise the social performance of business have supplanted the uncritical notion that private business activity ipso facto promotes the public interest, but such appraisals involve the acceptance of conflicting, debatable, and clearly non-quantitative criteria.172 This broadly-phrased fiction takes on many specific manifestations. Thus, for example, the assumption is frequently made that a consolida- tion of two or more corporations into a single corporation automatically eliminates needless duplication, promotes engineering efficiencies, and re- sults in cost savings and price reductions. This optimistic assumption is belied by other strenuous but overlooked facts of corporate life-the vested interest of management and labor in the retention of jobs and status; the urgent demand of investors to be paid off and protected- which all too frequently upset a harmony that exists, if at all, only on the surface of the merger blueprint. VI. THE CORPORATE IMAGE BECOMES FURTHER REFRACTED: PERVASIVE FICTIONS There are at least two fictions which deserve special emphasis be- cause of the fact that they compound the fictional character of practically all of the fictions thus far dealt with, and in so doing add to the general opacity and distortion of the corporation as an object and the con- fusion of the public as its spectator. These may briefly be described as:- 171. See, e.g., WALLAS, THE GREAT SOCIETY (1917) 112 et seq. 172. For example, Professor Sumner SLIGHTER, MODERN ECONOMIC SOCIETY (1932) 850, says that the social performance of business should be gauged by (1) its productivity; (2) the costs at which production is obtained; (3) the fairness with which income is distributed; (4) the effect of the industrial system upon se- curity; (5) its effect upon liberty; and (6) the extent to which industrial activities are guided by the general interests of the community rather than by the special interests of small groups.

The "Gargantua is Identical with Tom Thumb" notion. The point has frequently been made that the one-man or family corporation organized to hold a piece of property or even to conduct a small business is not identical, from any practical standpoint whatso- ever, with a large publicly owned national or international combine, that the three story apartment house or taxicab incorporated to limit liability is not the equivalent of U. S. Steel.173 Suggestions have been made-unfruitfully-calling for legislation differentiating the one-man company, the small business concern, and the large business setup, respectively.174 Despite this, there still persists a strong tendency to carry over to the field of large publicly owned corporations, with their complete differentiation of ownership and management and staggering administrative ramifications, the rather clear and direct assumptions as to motivations and objectives which characterize a small, simple and personalized enterprise. 17. The Holding Company Smokescreen. One of the major impediments to an accurate perception of what a corporation is doing, and why, is that most large corporations are in fact a complicated series of top holding companies, subsidiary holding com- panies, operating companies and various types of developmental, sales, credit, and other service companies.175 With this intricate and inter- meshing corporate machinery, it becomes ever more difficult to tell who controls the corporation, where the impetus towards corporate action originates, or whose purposes are being primarily served.176 Catastro- phes such as the famous Kreuger and Toll crash of 1932 bring into 173. See BERLE and MEANS, THE MODERN CORPORATION AND PRIVATE PROP- ERTY (1932); RIPLEY, MAIN STREET AND WALL STREET (1927) 64, 66, 75; see Rutledge, supra, note 113. 174. Fuller, The Incorporated Individual: A Study of the One-Man Company (1938) 51 HARV. L. REV. 1373, 1406. 175. With the obsolescence of the pool and the trust because of their contra- riety to the antitrust laws, and the limitation of leasing as a method of control largely to railroads, the outright corporate consolidation (or fusion) and the hold- ing company have become the two leading American devices for combining the ownership and control of separate corporations under a single head. Of the two, the holding company is much more responsive to purposive and unchecked manipu- lation by insiders. See BONBRIGHT and MEANS, THE HOLDING COMPANY (1932) 27. Continental legal systems have been able to make a comparatively greater uti- lization of other methods of business integration, see LIEFMANN, CARTELS, CON- CERNS AND TRUSTS (1932) 230. For purposes of simplicity we deal here only with holding companies. 176. For example, an investment corporation wrongfully dominated by a parent railroad corporation purchases competing railroads in the interest of that railroad corporation, and not in its own.

V. Phillips,"78 the over six hundred companies within the Unilever combine,"79 the countless subsidiaries of the major oil, chemical, communications and electrical equipment combines. In fact, if one makes the plausible assumption that the major unifying fact in a large holding company setup or international combine is a single financial control,'80 the dependence of the subsidiary would seem to be an inevitable corollary. Not only is the outsider's perception of the combine blurred by the various corporate veils through which he must peer, but these veils turn out to be surprisingly tough fabrics when it comes to judicial and other legal lancing. Another grave problem is the ease with which these various corporate screens can be set up, shifted and eradicated. By their manipulation, a few people with but a slight financial stake in the enterprise are able, by an insidious and slow process which usually escapes detection by all except insiders, to get a foothold within the corporate apparatus which permits them to control it and to direct it towards those ends which they consider desirable, or to withdraw when the going gets rough.18l Corporate subsidiaries, on the one hand, have to a large extent become the manufacturing or sales departments of a single enterprise.182 At the same time there is no gainsaying the fact, on the other hand, that like all functional departments they are vested with considerable auton- omy in matters having to do with the specific physical and day-to-day 177.

This is a Herculean task, and no one corporate Antaeus is like another except in the strength it derives through being in constant contact with the terra firma of every day business realities, ground upon which the outsider and the public alight only from time to time. VII. FICTIONS ARE WISE MEN'S COUNTERS- We have staked our political salvation on a concept of the State as "a bureau for the administration of the public peace and the regulation of equity between private interests."184 We have just won a bloody war against totalitarian states characterized by a "pulverizing, macadamizing tendency . . . reducing to impotence, and then to nullity, all that inter- venes between Men and State."'85 In the process of winning that war, we have learned the necessity of vesting in the state increased controls over economic life. Some of our partners in the conflict, who still share the democratic ideal with us, are finding it difficult to retreat from their wartime patterns of government economic control, and it is likely that they will continue to press for further stability in the international economic sphere and for an expanded role for government in the attain- ment of that stability. Wartime experiences have shown us that, while a state dictatorship may snuff the independent soul and spirit out of the lesser associations and human groupings within the state, business corporations may still serve as redoubtable economic janissaries of their war effort. A lumbering corporation in a strategic location in Florida turns out to be an under-cover, large-scale espionage operation for the enemy;186 the second largest electrical combine in the world, hitherto characterized by unity of top control, suddenly under the imminent threat of war subdivides, amoeba-like, into three separate trusts, having ostensibly different legal and national auspices ;187 we make the startling discovery that chemical companies functioning in this country as osten- sible American citizens are in fact enemy aliens and the still more star- 183.

In delegating to the business corporation the power to govern modern in- dustrial society, our democratic state has rendered itself more impotent and the corporation more puissant than perhaps most people realize. It is of the essence of a viable delegation of power that it can be altered or recalled when occasion necessitates, yet this government has, with respect to various public interests deemed essential to international se- curity and domestic well-being, found its efforts hampered, and for long periods of time frustrated, by a tenacious and usually subterranean corporate opposition. This essay has dealt with one of the prerequisites to an effective reassertion of governmental power-knowledge. A necessary condition of knowledge is observation, and the making of inductive generaliza- tions based on observation. It has been pointed out that generalizations which are arrived at in the field of corporate organization and finance are frequently fictions, but that they nevertheless serve valid societal and scientific purposes. Also, that a proper appreciation of the corporate problem calls for the formulation (and appropriate qualification) of fic- tions not only in the arbitrarily delimited field of corporate law, but in the borderlands of constitutional and international law, psychology, ethics and economics. Observation is the primary intellectual function of a sensibly demo- cratic government. Not only is effective observation a sine qua non of the regulatory job which government must undertake as a continuing process for a few small areas of modern social and economic life and as a sporadic proposition for the remaining areas, but it is essential to the adequate policing of the inescapable delegation of power over the bulk of economic transactions which the modern democratic state must make to private individuals and groups.

What they need is an esthetic reorientation comparable to that of Cezanne and the Cubists in the field of painting-the appre- ciation of the multi-dimensionality of the problem with which they are dealing. Analogizing a corporate fiction to a geometrical plane, the practical reproduction requirements implicit in a court decision or ad- ministrative order (like those of the painting) may limit us to a single two-dimensional plane. Nevertheless, we should bear in mind that our perspective has as its object a tri-dimensional solid consisting of myriad planes. While we cannot do full justice to all of the planes of which the corporate solid is composed, circumstances may require us to select for special emphasis several planes, and to make proper allowances for the distortions caused by such selectivity. We look to the corporate system to continue as a throbbing, but it is to be hoped uncongested, artery that will continue to route invest- ment, labor and management services to the end results of ample pro- ductivity, full levels of employment, and equitable and efficacious dis- tribution of economic rewards. Particularly in the international sphere, corporations, whether they rely on American capital alone or involve cooperative international commitments, should be regarded as not only the carriers of their own private interests, but instrumentalities for ef- fectuating social and economic interests which the national and interna- tional community regards as paramount. Assurance that they will so operate is not a matter which concerns the corporations alone, nor can it be accomplished on the governmental side by juggling criteria of corpo- rate nationality or applicable substantive legal systems. What is needed is a clear formulation of the interests deemed paramount in the national and international business world and the policies which will protect those interests, plus a clear understanding of the convoluted, intricate and somewhat erratic corporate mechanism on which we must rely for the ultimate effectuation of those policies. 580</page></plain_text>
