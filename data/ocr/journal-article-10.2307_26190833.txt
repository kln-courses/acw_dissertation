<plain_text> <page sequence="1"> DoNNA WESt AND RAchEl SuttoN-SpENcE Shared Thinking Processes  with Four Deaf Poets:  A Window on “the Creative”  in “Creative Sign Language” A wealth of literature now exists on the subject of sign-  language poetry. Building on the recognition of sign languages as bona  fide languages, various authors have engaged with poetic, creative,  expressive sign-language compositions and performances as a way  not only to celebrate, analyze, and understand sign-language poetry  and poets (Klima and Bellugi 1979; Sandler and Lillo-Martin 2001;  Sutton-Spence 2001, 2005; Tommaso 2004) but also to critically ex- amine and establish their rightful place in a wider literary tradition  (e.g., Bauman 2003; Rose 1992). By taking existing, digitized record- ings of poetry performances by largely established, professional poets,  linguists are able to analyze sign-language poetry for creative uses  of symmetry, neologism, iconicity, metaphor, repetition and rhythm,  handshape and space (Valli 1990, 1993; Ormsby 1995; Blondel and  Miller 2000; Russo, Giuranna, and Pizzuto 2001; Sutton-Spence and  Kaneko 2007). Alternatively, analysis of established poems provides us  with an opportunity to align sign-language poetry with other liter- ary, cinematographic, and expressive art forms (Krentz 2006; Nelson  2006; Rose 2006). Occasionally, Deaf poets themselves offer insights  Donna West is a postdoctoral researcher at the Graduate School of Education,  University of Bristol.

Other authors may (rarely) invite Deaf native signers to com- ment on and offer their own observations on sign-language poems  (Tommaso 2004, although in this instance, they are simply thanked as  advisors in the acknowledgments). Wolter (2006), to our knowledge,  is the only person who has interviewed a Deaf poet (Peter Cook,  United States) in a publication about traditions of sign-language po- etry, its parallels with creative writing, and its importance for future  Deaf generations. In this largely descriptive piece, Cook describes  and offers perspectives on his established repertoire and reflects on  his influences. In our research, we wanted to understand the thought  processes that British Deaf poets engage in, the strategies they employ,  and the resources they draw on—individually and jointly—as they be- gin to compose sign-language poems. We wanted to know how they  approach, sidestep, overcome, challenge, and experiment with specific  language problems that arise in specific language tasks. Anthropomorphism and Sign creativity Sign-language poets draw on a wide range of tropes in their work,  but we chose to focus on anthropomorphization as one that is very  challenging to less skilled signers and yet so apparently effortless in the  hands of certain poets. Although our focus in this article is the method  we used to understand more about creative processes, it is helpful to  explain a little about the end product they were working toward. Anthropomorphization and personification overlap considerably,  but, essentially, as a working definition, we take the trope as a figure  of speech in which signers apply particular human characteristics to  nonhuman entities or qualities, whether in form or behavior, in- cluding human communication, perhaps through the use of language  (Bouchauveau 1994; Bechter 2008; Sutton-Spence and Napoli 2010). As a framework for understanding how nonhumans are given   human characteristics in creative sign language, we are guided by  the understanding that the signs created in the process will be highly  iconic, and thus we are able to draw on models of sign creation such  as Christian Cuxac’s transfer of person (as described in Sallandre 2007,  Journal Winter Pgs 171-333.indd   189 1/26/2012   12:18:47 PM </page> <page sequence="3"> 190 | Sign Language Studie s for example), Sarah Taub’s analogue building model (2001), and Paul  Dudis’s (2007) work on depiction using a conceptual blending model  in ASL. Taub’s cognitive-linguistic view of iconicity is that it “is not an  objective relationship between image and referent; rather, it is a rela- tionship between our mental models of image and referent” (2001, 19).  Sign-language poets’ creativity extends to their unusual perspectives  of the referents and the subsequently alternative mental models of  the image, perhaps before they even set about developing the creative  relationships between the two. As Taub explains, using the now well-known example for ASL  tree (a sign that is also used in many BSL dialects), the creation of  an iconic sign involves four successive stages: conceptualization, im- age selection, schematization, and sign encoding. In normal signing,  the concept of a tree will include all that a signer might be expected  to know about a tree, including that trees are not human. However,  during the process of anthropomorphization, creative signers create a  world in which we “know” that trees do have human characteristics  and thus will add attributes to what one might “know” about a tree  (for example, that it has eyes and can use sign language). For normal  image selection, the signer selects a prototypical sensory image of a  tree. For ASL tree, discussed by Taub, the visual image is of a tree  that consists of a trunk, spreading branches, and the ground in which  it is rooted. The poets will explore the possibilities of leaving aside the  prototypical image and finding new, less-expected ones such as im- ages that show the tree’s head or eyes or focus on its twigs as fingers.  In schematization, the essential features of the visual image that has  been selected are extracted to form a simplified framework that can  be represented by signs. In Taub’s example of ASL tree, only three  fundamental features are selected: a long vertical shape representing  the trunk, spreading branches, and a flat surface. Poets who are an- thropomorphizing a tree may find they need to select the tree’s eyes  or fingers as features. In encoding, appropriate articulators are chosen  to represent the schematized elements: For Taub’s standard sign tree,  example, the upright forearm represents the trunk, the open palm and  fingers stand for the spreading branches, and the horizontal forearm of  the signer’s nondominant hand is the ground. Poets, however, might  Journal Winter Pgs 171-333.indd   190 1/26/2012   12:18:47 PM </page> <page sequence="4"> Shared Thinking Processes with Four Deaf Poets | 191 consider embodying the entire tree, in which case the human trunk  represents the tree trunk, the arms represent the branches, and the  fingers represent twigs. Creative anthropomorphization necessarily stems from the blend- ing of two conceptual spaces—those of the signer and those of the  entity depicted—as both the signer’s body and the surrounding space  come into play and as events are depicted rather than simply described.  As Dudis (2007) observes, depiction involves a signer representing  an animate participant in an event. The result is a visual blend of the  “Real-Space signer and the Event-Space interlocutor” (7), where the  signer’s actions, posture, and expression are interpreted as those of the  interlocutor. Our research aimed to learn how the poets solved problems such  as might occur at each of the stages Taub identified and how they  achieve the conceptual blending required to enable audiences to in- terpret the anthropomorphic depictions. think-Aloud protocols The inspiration for our method of using shared thinking processes  came from the problem-solving, cognitive-psychology elicitation  technique of the think-aloud protocol (van Someren, Barnard, and  Sandberg 1994; Tirkkonen-Condit and Jääskeläinen 2000). The think- aloud protocol is designed to reveal the ways in which a human  subject solves a particular problem by describing out loud whatever  thoughts come to mind as the person tackles the problem. This then  yields information that cannot necessarily be gleaned by looking at  or analyzing an end product or artifact (van Someren, Barnard, and  Sandberg 1994). A think-aloud protocol can also be used to compare  different problem-solving strategies. Adopted by translation studies, as Stone (2009) outlines, the think- aloud protocol can be used to evoke the decisions one makes when  one is creating (in Stone’s case) a translation of a text from English to  BSL. Participants are invited to express out loud their thought pro- cesses relating to the translation task. Crucially, they are also invited  to reflect on their work or artifact and retrospectively to suggest  improvements in their translations. The usefulness of the think-aloud  protocol lies in its fluidity and its cyclical process, together with its  Journal Winter Pgs 171-333.indd   191 1/26/2012   12:18:48 PM </page> <page sequence="5"> 192 | Sign Language Studie s creation of a reflective space. Stone’s (2009) appropriation of the think- aloud protocol for sign-language interpretation makes use of trans- lation output for comparison between Deaf and hearing participants.  We wanted to borrow from the think-aloud protocol but work it into  an illuminating, collective, shared event. A potential limitation of the  think-aloud protocol is the effect that the “observer” might have on  the individual “subject” (van Someren, Barnard, and Sandberg 1994).  By asking four people to come together to think about and discuss  with each other their thought processes when solving problems in  creative sign language, we hoped to minimize that effect. Deaf collective Research practices Aside from the inherent logistics of planning and arranging a group  discussion using the shared thinking process, we were mindful of the  fact that we were asking four professional Deaf poets with busy lives to  spend an evening with us, working hard. Experience has taught us the  importance of venue (Rachel’s sitting room works very well; a room  in a university building does not), food (again, timing of the meal and  the menu are of the utmost importance) and time before and after  the work activity for warming up and cooling down (cf. Ladd 2003):  chatting more generally, sharing news, and discussing things other  than poetry. In terms of the task at hand, we negotiated our roles as  hosts and as researchers with our own expertise. For the designated  evening we devised a skeleton structure that we hoped would provoke  curiosity, insight, questions, and observations. Although the conversa- tion was mostly led by the poets, we occasionally allowed ourselves  to intervene with questions or comments, while respecting the poets  as the creative experts. The shared thinking event was filmed, copied  to DVD, and sent to the poets as a record of their collective work. What We Asked them to Do We invited four British Deaf poets (Richard Carter, Paul Scott, Donna  Williams, and John Wilson) to participate in a conversation in which  they shared their creative, cognitive, and linguistic processes with each  other to witness and share the real-time development of anthropo- morphization within creative sign language. We asked them to “think  aloud” (that is, sign openly to each other) about the challenges of cre- Journal Winter Pgs 171-333.indd   192 1/26/2012   12:18:48 PM </page> <page sequence="6"> Shared Thinking Processes with Four Deaf Poets | 193 ating anthropomorphic signing in relation to a range of different enti- ties that we chose for them—animate, inanimate, and abstract—and  presented to them as single words on slips of paper. We deliberately  did not use pictures of these entities as we did not want to influence  the poets by the use of images. For the animate entities, we selected a range of animals for their  different physical forms, especially body parts that might be recruited  for signing or other forms of communication: monkey, snake, octopus,  crab, snail, tortoise, bat, spider, zebra, and pig. The inanimate entities  were chosen for similar reasons: light bulb, bicycle, submarine, star,  mirror, volcano, clock, fork, spoon, and pencil. The abstract qualities  were drawn from a list of abstract nouns in English: beauty, death,  confidence, envy, fragility, honesty, indifference, loyalty, luxury, and  pride. In retrospect, we now realize that an English list of these abstract  qualities may not have been the best source because it hid the fact  that many of these words appeared to have no direct translation into  BSL as abstractions. The poets clearly understood all of the concepts,  but they did not necessarily sign them as abstract nouns. We asked the poets to consider these entities and qualities and  solve the following problems for creative representation in sign lan- guages: What is their appearance? How do they behave? How do  they communicate? If you were to accord them human qualities, how  would they behave, and how would they communicate? The poets  were asked to sign whatever they were thinking, doing, or feeling as  they attempted to answer these questions. In the process they often  embodied the entity, made meaning of everyone’s questions and com- ments, and created anthropomorphic, poetic examples. Think-aloud protocols—and therefore shared thinking  processes— work on the principle that problem solving is about seeking answers  to questions that seem to have no immediate answer. For example,  “Can (or how does) a pencil experience the world and communicate?”   Solutions are sought from the environment or from external informa- tion (van Someren, Barnard, and Sandberg 1994), in this case, from  each other. We observed that various solutions can be co- constructed.  The poets collectively owned the processes, used the shared thinking  processes to support and bounce ideas off each other, and develop  their thoughts to work up into new poems. They encouraged each  Journal Winter Pgs 171-333.indd   193 1/26/2012   12:18:48 PM </page> <page sequence="7"> 194 | Sign Language Studie s other by means of questions and reinforcement. They also discussed  meanings, explored creative possibilities, built on each other’s initial  creations, offered feedback and counterperspectives, and developed  humorous, poignant, clever, skillful, and entertaining narratives and  vignettes. The shared thinking process as a collective extension of the think- aloud protocol can be framed as an innovative problem-solving tech- nique if we view anthropomorphism as presenting various challenges  for sign-language poetry creation. That is to say, although anthropo- morphizing animals, objects, and abstract nouns was presented as our  overall aim, we were asking the poets to articulate and transcend the  various problems the task presented. We were interested in how the  problem-solving techniques were expressed and in the artifacts cre- ated as a result. As the poets tackled these problems, we observed specific tech- niques. The poets watched each other’s ideas, articulations, attempts,  and vignettes and offered alternatives, based on their own knowledge,  creative skills, and linguistic abilities. At other times we noted the “try  it for size” strategy, in which a poet improvised a miniperformance for  critique by the others. They also shared particular tasks, such as de- veloping fast-paced poetic improvisations; they prompted each other,  offered encouragement, made overt choices as to which task they wish  to undertake (“I choose zebra”) or gave direction (“Why don’t you  try the volcano?”). Finally we saw the “hang on a minute” interjection,  when they offered specific, linguistic critiques of the task and related  performance to the inherent problem of the anthropomorphism of  inanimate objects. Some Examples from the Shared thinking process conversation In this section we offer selected examples from the ninety-minute  shared-thinking conversation on anthropomorphism and creative sign  language, in which the poets developed their ideas and attempted to  solve the problems the anthropomorphism presented. We watched as  they identified the concepts they wished to focus upon, chose the  images they wished to create to represent those concepts, and decided  how to transfer these images to specific signs. In presenting these  Journal Winter Pgs 171-333.indd   194 1/26/2012   12:18:48 PM </page> <page sequence="8"> Shared Thinking Processes with Four Deaf Poets | 195 examples, we reflect on the strengths and possibilities of this kind of  methodology and the opportunities to witness the embryonic stage  of poetic composition, which later becomes a refined, finished poem.  We found that the poets used the shared thinking process to extend  each other’s creativity and to collectively push the boundaries of their  creative lexicon. Much of it was done humorously and in a collabora- tive environment that we might term “jamming.” The poets used the  techniques they came up with to teach each other new insights and  even new skills. Extending Each Other’s Creativity and Creative Lexicon In the following two examples, the poets observe, comment on,  and stretch the linguistic and narrative possibilities when anthropo- morphizing animals. In the first, Richard and Paul discuss whether  an octopus, with eight tentacles, can sign and, if so, how limited its  vocabulary might be: RC: When you said “old,” that’s two fingers, so an octopus could sign  old1 with two tentacles, couldn’t he? PS: Or he would sign old (with two 1-handshape tentacles) RC: Right! (laughs) Richard has come up with the idea that the fingers can represent ten- tacles because of the similarity of shape. He creates the established BSL  sign old (which uses a bent V handshape—that is, bent index and  middle fingers), using articulators that will be understood as tentacles  rather than fingers. The choice of old is not random but comes from  the fact that BSL octopus uses the bent index finger (X handshape)  on both hands, and Richard is trying to find a sign using two bent  fingers. Paul picks up this idea and builds on it by realizing that octo- pus tentacles are less ordered and constrained than are the fingers on  one hand and that octopus can be easily modified, allowing him  to come up with a highly productive sign that has the same number  of fingers as old, articulated at the same location but made with the  index finger of each hand (see figures 1a–c). In our second example, the role of the spider, with many eyes and  eight legs, is expanded through humor and neologism (see figure 2): Journal Winter Pgs 171-333.indd   195 1/26/2012   12:18:48 PM </page> <page sequence="9"> 196 | Sign Language Studie s Figures 1a, b, c. With help from Paul, Richard experiments with old (as signed  by the octopus).  DW: I was thinking that the spider could be good for security, hang- ing from the ceiling. JW: Yes, like a housekeeper with a huge ring of keys at her waist,   bustling around [and] locking everything up, her skirt like a huge  web. DW: I missed how that is linked to the spider. JW: A Victorian housekeeper with a big ring of keys, and so all the  legs can each lock doors as she walks around, making sure every- thing is secure and safe. RC: Or, imagine it’s a hotel, and the spider shows the guests to their  rooms, and there are eight rooms (1 2 3 4 on one side of the hall- Figure 2. The spider unlocks all eight doors simultaneously.  Journal Winter Pgs 171-333.indd   196 1/26/2012   12:18:48 PM </page> <page sequence="10"> Shared Thinking Processes with Four Deaf Poets | 197 way and 5 6 7 8 on the other), so the guests all follow the spider,  then the spider unlocks all eight doors at the same time (extends  legs outward, unlocks, retracts legs) (much laughter). JW: And she can carry all the bags! And put them into the bedrooms  at the same time, too! Donna has introduced the specific concept of a spider that can  provide scope for the language play by focusing on the spider’s eyes,  web-spinning ability, and manner of hanging from the ceiling. Natu- rally, this would allow a spider to see everything and allow it to un- dertake the human task of providing security through surveillance.  John then brings a rather different world knowledge about spiders to  the discussion. He picks up on the idea of security and moves it from  surveillance to locks and keys, thereby bringing in the new, related  concept of spider silk as a web rather than a single strand, so that the  visual resemblance of the round web can work for human clothing,  in this case a Victorian housekeeper’s dress. Richard, in turn, builds on  the idea of a host (taking a different aspect of the housekeeper who  combines security with hospitality) but still thinking about keys. How- ever, he now imagines that the spider’s eight legs, represented in BSL  by eight fingers (four on each hand), could be used instrumentally to  hold eight keys to unlock eight doors at the same time. In doing this,  Richard has started to create a very different sort of blend of real and  event spaces with a new partitioning. The event blend created now invites audiences to see the actions  depicted as including visible instruments held by invisible hands. John  extends the same idea of the eight fingers and uses them as eight arms  so that the hospitable spider can carry eight bags for eight guests. The  events depicted in the new blend have changed again: This time the  real-space signer’s hands, which are articulating the handling classifiers,  depict the event-space spider’s visible hands holding invisible suitcases.  (Note that nobody is bothered by the fact that the spider apparently  has two more legs to walk on while using the eight legs as arms or  hands. After all, the poets need to select only certain features from the  basic concept, as we mentioned earlier in relation to the schematiza- tion in Taub’s model). Again, we can see how the poets trade ideas  and build on them, resulting in the final signs that satisfy them all. Journal Winter Pgs 171-333.indd   197 1/26/2012   12:18:48 PM </page> <page sequence="11"> 198 | Sign Language Studie s Offering Reflections, Analysis, and Commentary The poets reflected on whether inanimate objects can communicate  through signs or some other means. Their comments provide useful  insight into how they expect their compositions to be interpreted. In  this example, Richard has just improvised a spoon as it is taken from  the utensil drawer, used to scoop ice cream, and then placed in the  dishwasher, and the poets then ponder how the spoon communicated  or might be expected to communicate: RC: The spoon can’t sign, can it? Only facial expression, and then  when it leaves the drawer, it says “bye-bye” to its friends. JW: But how? How does it say “bye-bye”? RC: Through its face. JW: But it signed! So it means we accept that the spoon signs. RSS: I think we do accept it. JW: Yes, we have to, but, when Richard did the spoon saying “bye- bye,” in my head I saw a spoon without hands! So yes, I see  his character, but I also see just a spoon. So Richard-as-spoon is  blended with the image of a spoon. The poets have all reached the agreement that a spoon can have a face  (that is, the bowl of the spoon, which resembles the human face in  shape and is positioned at the top of the handle, which can be seen  as the spoon’s body); as such, the spoon can use facial expression to  communicate emotions and reactions. However, they have also agreed  that the spoon has no hands because there is nothing about the form  of a spoon that can map on to the human hands. Their discussion  acknowledges that it is not possible to modify any part of the object’s  form to create logical “hands” in a way that they often did for the  animals (such as the octopus mentioned earlier and other animals  discussed later). Richard’s solution to combine facial expression with  fully “human” signing is satisfactory because of the image it gener- ates for the audience. Thus, in the blended space created, the poets  are able to select the aspects of event space they wish to use in their  depictions. As they selectively blend real and event conceptual spaces,  the poets have decided which of the abstracted counterparts of the  real-space signer and the event-space anthropomorphized character  Journal Winter Pgs 171-333.indd   198 1/26/2012   12:18:48 PM </page> <page sequence="12"> Shared Thinking Processes with Four Deaf Poets | 199 they can practically use and which they cannot. Depiction of dialogue  in this instance is separated from depiction of actions. Development and Humor: Jamming One of the key features of the shared thinking process was the way  in which the poets engaged in rapid-fire improvisation and poetic  development, quickly building on each other’s ideas before collaps- ing with laughter. Here they attempt to anthropomorphize a volcano,  working out a way in which the geophysical concepts associated with  a volcano, such as shaking and forceful movements, can be transferred  to a human, perhaps as indications of anger, while also exploring  parallel causes of the volcano’s anger, including pain. They are work- ing with the well-known conceptual metaphor that human anger is  pressure in a container (Lakoff 1987), and they explore this in reverse  by explaining the contained pressure in the volcano as anger. They  map the concrete domain of the volcano onto the abstract domain  of human anger, thereby anthropomorphizing it. This idea of pres- sure in a container leads them to think about other reasons to release  the pressure in a container, with similar high-pressure emissions of  a fluid. Poets are highly skilled linguistic wordsmiths, but even the  finest wordsmiths can enjoy laughing about squeezing pimples or  desperately needing to go to the toilet. RC: Why don’t you try the volcano? DW: A volcano? Hmm. RC: I think it would be really angry, ready to explode. JW: Like global warming and all the lava explodes. DW: Or an earthquake? JW: An earthquake, yes, it could be about some people who build a  house, but the digging of the foundation really hurts the earth, so  it explodes with anger. PS: Or it could be like a huge pimple ready to burst (shoots out  from cheek). JW: Or hand up, need to pee! Oh, lava bursts out. RC: Too late! And it’s the same with maybe a sneeze. In the following instance, the poets, having played with the signing  animals for a while, find that the novelty has worn off, so they take  Journal Winter Pgs 171-333.indd   199 1/26/2012   12:18:48 PM </page> <page sequence="13"> 200 | Sign Language Studie s on a new challenge. Playing with the imaginative range of possibilities  of animal communication, they break free of the idea of signed com- munication and experiment with other visual means, while retaining  certain Deaf cultural references such as subtitles or PowerPoint slides: RSS: Can the spider communicate? RC: Can. Spider can. DW: Through fingerspelling.2 RC (to DW): But its legs are different. They’re hard and straight,  compared to the octopus, whose tentacles are more flexible. PS: But maybe the spider is more fragile and has to be more  careful— when he’s fingerspelling it’s easier to break one of his legs off, so  he has to fingerspell more carefully, and a spider could never work  as a typist because that would definitely break his legs if he tried  to type. RC (to PS): But, also, a spider can communicate through shooting  out his thread like a web but writing instead. And we could read  that. That’s communication, isn’t it? And it could be really fast  writing. He could get really good at it. Or like subtitles! (spider  web-writing really quickly) or maybe PowerPoint even (spider  web-writing projected onto PowerPoint slides). Conceptually, the poets’ narrative development of the behavior of cer- tain animals was idiosyncratically creative in some aspects but firmly  located within British and, thus, British Deaf culture stereotypes. In  the next section, we see how, as four Deaf people, they build on the  shared conceptual image of what it would mean to be a “human pig”  by considering the features of a Deaf “human pig.” They then revisit  the other animals and find in them prototypical members of the Deaf  community: RC: The pig, I imagine that everyone looks at him and thinks he’s  just a bighead because he thinks he’s really important, but he’s not.  He’s not important at all. Actually more important is the zebra,  compared to the pig. That’s what I feel anyway. The zebra’s pretty  smart; the pig’s just ugly. He might be smart with money, but the  zebra—he’s intelligent. JW: And the pig is no good at looking after himself and needs others  Journal Winter Pgs 171-333.indd   200 1/26/2012   12:18:48 PM </page> <page sequence="14"> Shared Thinking Processes with Four Deaf Poets | 201 to take care of him? Like a social worker, a doctor . . . he’s hope- lessly lost by himself. He only communicates through “oink oink.” RC: And the monkey . . . JW: Ooh chat chat chat chat endlessly. RC: I feel the monkey went to mainstream school, so his signing is  all over the place, and so others don’t want to have anything to  do with him. PS: Like a clown. RC: So the monkey became deaf, so they put him in mainstream  school, where he had no idea what was going on, no communica- tion. He was all over the place, and that affected his behavior. He  was hyperactive, and as he grew up he got more and more isolated  from other Deaf people. Perhaps from this discussion we learn almost as much about the poets’  views on the intervention of support services for Deaf people and  Deaf education—and the impact of this on Deaf people’s communi- cative abilities—as we do about the poets’ skills in attributing certain  human characteristics to animals. When we devised the list of animals  for this task, we included the monkey as the animal that most closely  resembles the human form and is the only animal with hands. We  thought that the monkey would be most likely to sign. Apes, after all,  are the only animals who have learned to sign (reportedly—Pinker  [1994] provides a useful assessment of the claims). Instead, however,  John started the discussion by using the strong visual image of a mon- key’s prominent, chattering teeth, with the lips drawn back, imme- diately taking us to a Deaf person’s view of communication through  oralism. Perhaps the negative equation of monkeys with sign language  is too powerful to explore further in a positive sign-language setting,  or perhaps the similarity between monkey hands and human hands  was too strong even to merit further exploration because of the lack  of challenge. Once the image of the senselessly chattering monkey was  selected, Richard picked up on the lack of meaning and developed  it to show that the monkey could perhaps also sign, although only  in a meaningless way. Following on that, he makes a very powerful  statement about the effects of mainstream education on many deaf  children.

Their easy mutual construction and  development of ideas were replaced by more overt sharing of expertise  and explicit guidance. We witnessed several emerging strategies for  dealing with abstract concepts, one of which was to play with acro- nyms. This is a very new technique in BSL poetry and was developed  by Paul.3 Here he gives Richard some ideas on the concept of envy  (see figure 3): PS: I was thinking about e.n.v.y. with V in the middle. V has to stand  there, keeping the other letters at arm’s length. They’re not happy  because the other side keeps trying to keep up with them, so V has  to keep them apart. envy-pulled-apart. But Y is just there on  the end, shrugging his shoulders. RC: Or, E means energy or enthusiasm? And he keeps trying to butt  in, which really irritates V. And E wants to be the same as Y, and V  has to keep them apart. And Y doesn’t really know what’s going  on. V says, “Oh, it’s nothing. Don’t worry,” to Y, then tells E to be  quiet. V is stuck in the middle. Figure 3. Paul and Richard experiment with e.n.v.y.

Immediately, Richard develops this new idea by drawing on a device  used in some sign-language games in which the letter of an English  word generates a sign whose meaning, when translated into  English,  also starts with that letter (Smith and Sutton-Spence 2007). Paul agrees  and fine-tunes the idea to bring it closer to the idea of envy, so be- tween them they have created an acronym that shows elements of  envy. Encouraging and Stretching Creativity and Confidence A key feature of the shared thinking process is the way in which  these poets, some more experienced and established than the others,  encouraged creative and linguistic development in each other. They  offered feedback, examples, and support when they judged it to be  needed. Here, Donna, the least experienced of the poets, is eager to  take on a particularly challenging task: anthropomorphizing a pencil.  She has clear ideas about the narrative but struggles to express it using  creative BSL, and Richard encourages her to think about viewpoint  and expression (see figures 4a–c): DW: I was thinking about the pencil. And the anticipation of being  picked up and starting to be written with, but something’s wrong.  I’m too blunt, so I need to be sharpened. Ow! Ow! And they  keep turning me in the sharpener. It really hurts—until I’m sharp  enough (shakes head, recovers), so I start to write, but, no, I keep  making spelling mistakes, so in the end I’m thrown away . . . but  I’m not sure where to go next with this. After that, I’ve kind of  run out of ideas . . . RC: (becomes pencil) And this pencil is selected—the pencil is  brought upright suddenly, but before I know it, I’m heading  straight for the pencil sharpener! (face is pushed into round hole  of sharpener—sharpener rotates repeatedly around the face of the  pencil, which is then sharply withdrawn—the pencil looks trau- matized and relieved) (shows long, smooth, slim point extending  Journal Winter Pgs 171-333.indd   203 1/26/2012   12:18:48 PM </page> <page sequence="17"> 204 | Sign Language Studie s Figure 4. Donna’s pencil recoils from the sharpener and Richard develops the narrative. forward from face), so I show what it is I can see as the pencil,  being plunged into the sharpener. And then my face being vigor- ously rubbed all over by the paper as my point is used to write  with. And the more I’m used, the blunter my face becomes (shows  point becoming flatter), so back into the sharpener again I go, and  that happens again and again and again. DW: (Nods) But that feels more comedy than poetry, I don’t know . . .  but yours looked better. RC: No, no, just give it a go . . . keep trying. Narrative Extension and Backstory As the challenges increased, the poets seemed eager to work with  each other on developing narratives that utilized anthropomorphism.  For example, when it proved difficult to become a bicycle in terms of  communication, they instead found fun and satisfaction in telling the  bicycle’s autobiography. There are many examples in this discussion of  narrative extension, but in this one the poets decided to go back in  time in order to reveal the bicycle’s history. Again, they watched each  other and took turns building, developing, and linking. John started by applying human emotions and behavior to the  bicycle: A small child’s bicycle became a baby bicycle that sucks its  thumb, even though, formationally, a bicycle has no parallel for map- ping onto the thumb. He then extended the concept to bicycles of  other sizes, equating size with age and attitude (see figure 5): Journal Winter Pgs 171-333.indd   204 1/26/2012   12:18:48 PM </page> <page sequence="18"> Shared Thinking Processes with Four Deaf Poets | 205 Figure 5. John’s baby bicycle. JW: I was thinking about a baby bicycle, you know (thumb in mouth),  first bike, with training wheels and little handlebars, [who] looks  up with envy at a bigger bike, who sneers down at baby bike. This  bike has two, bigger wheels, no training wheels, yawns, whatever,  then looks up at an even bigger bike! This one has huge wheels,  and it looks with disdain at the other two with their tiny wheels!  So all the different-sized bikes . . . Paul acknowledges the turn and then continues with a plot-driven  narrative that maps more of the bicycle parts onto his body (see   figure 6): Figure 6. Paul’s bent bicycle spokes. Journal Winter Pgs 171-333.indd   205 1/26/2012   12:18:48 PM </page> <page sequence="19"> 206 | Sign Language Studie s PS: Or, here’s a bike with a broken wheel, slowly spinning (the  open fingers of one hand become bent spokes on the face as the  wheel)—oh poor thing, poor bike. The story of what happened:  It’s Christmas, and a child comes running down the stairs to see a  big present (shaped like a bicycle—two wheels), and the present  beckons to the child to come near it. She unwraps it—wow, a  bike! “Come on! Put one foot here (L pedal) and the other here  (R pedal).” Slowly the pedals start moving—uh oh! The bike hits  his head on something—never mind, try again! RC: (Laughs) Yes. PS: Pedaling faster now, oh, really fast, the bike is getting out of breath,  tongue out, panting with effort. Use the brakes! Brakes extend  from handlebars out of bike’s ears. Brakes hard on now (two flat  hands press tightly together in front of bike’s nose—as brake pads  on wheel rim—bike is cross-eyed with the strain), but it’s too hard,  and the child goes over the handlebars—that’s what happens! RC: Or, to go even further back, to the factory where they made  the bike . . . so here’s the first wheel, put in place, and here’s the  second wheel, and then the frame is connected (becomes the bike),  pained expression as the axle is fitted to the left and right hips  for the wheels to be attached, then my body is lifted, rotated, and  placed on the factory line, where my front forks are positioned  and bolted on. Next the curved handlebars out to the sides from  the back of my head . . . Discussing, Reflecting on, and Giving Feedback on the Task at Hand The end of the conversation offered the poets a chance to reflect on  the shared thinking process and the task at hand: RC: I feel when we’re here in this workshop environment, discussing  ideas, it’s very different from standing on the stage and performing.  On stage, I’m not actively thinking, how am I going to do this? I  just switch to performance mode and improvise. But here we’re  actually trying to think about that process, which is very different. JW: Yes, here we’re being given words and having to think on our  feet. But if you went away and thought about how you would  create a performance, that would be very different. Being given  Journal Winter Pgs 171-333.indd   206 1/26/2012   12:18:48 PM </page> <page sequence="20"> Shared Thinking Processes with Four Deaf Poets | 207 a word here forces you to think on the spot. And that’s very dif- ferent. When you’re working creatively on your own, that’s very  different from here, being given a word and trying to think out  loud how you would do it. . . . I think it’s a bit like dipping a cup  in the ocean. There are a thousand ways to do this. So maybe the  first time, no good, throw the water away, fill up again. The waters  will slowly recede, but there are plenty of choices about how to  fill up your cup. Almost too many choices. concluding thoughts The conversation about shared thinking processes yielded a great  deal of analysis, material, and information about technique, all with- in a supportive and fun environment. A great deal of what we saw  that evening relied on the existing relationships among the poet-  participants. In many ways, this was a leap of faith for all of us. Some  poets are happier than others to be on display, to articulate their  thoughts to others, to take risks, and to try out ideas in front of their  peers. As researchers, we did not simply sit back in comfort and watch  the show unfold. We remained mindful, critical, aware, and engaged  throughout. We can only wonder where similar, one-to-one conversa- tions between poet and researcher might have gone and what could  be discovered and created in alternative research settings. However,  we can say that, for the first time, we were able to glimpse some of a  Deaf poet’s thoughts in the process of being creative in sign language.  Most of the time this is an isolated process, an engagement between  poet and image, analogy, event, observation, and emotion. It would be  possible to interview poets one at a time and ask them what is go- ing on inside their heads as they play with ideas. However, when we  gave copies of the recording of their conversation to the poets, they  reported how much fun it had been and how much they had enjoyed  and learned from the experience. The collective process also permit- ted joint problem solving by creating a blend of mutual teaching and  learning, both ad hoc and post hoc rationalizing (see van Someren,  Barnard, and Sandberg 1994), narrative and linguistic development,  and extension through improvisation and humor. None of this would  have occurred if these poets had been working alone. Journal Winter Pgs 171-333.indd   207 1/26/2012   12:18:48 PM </page> <page sequence="21"> 208 | Sign Language Studie s Some of the ideas first contemplated in Rachel’s living room  emerged as fully fledged poems not two months later at the 2010  Bristol Sign Poetry Festival (see Richard Carter’s Mirror, and Paul  Scott’s Two Books available within the anthology at www.bristol.ac.uk /bslpoetryanthology. As we were writing this article, the poets were  making plans for the 2011 festival, at which they anticipated leading a  sign-language poetry workshop for the next generation of Deaf poets,  and we expect that they will make use of many of the insights we all  shared after that night. We suggest, therefore, that shared thought pro- cesses not only reveal new insights into the moment of creativity but  also allow for richer engagement with the problems of sign-language  poetry. The result is new compositions and new knowledge to pass  on to future Deaf poets. Acknowledgments With grateful thanks to Richard Carter, Paul Scott, Donna Williams,  and John Wilson.
