<plain_text><page sequence="1">RELIGION AS AN IDEA.' RECENT philosophical literature presents, among other note- worthy features, a peculiar handling of the subject of relig- ion. This peculiarity in treatment may be described as a more or less conscious commingling, even confusion, of elements. On the one hand, writers are concerned to make plain the bio- logical and sociological function of religion and they give defi- nitions accordingly: "Religion is a substitute in the rational world for instinct in the sub- rational world." ' 1 The -writer of this paper wishes to call attention to the fact that he is not concerned to establish any form of faith but simply to inquire whether the term "religion" does not demand a more exact connotation than is given it in recent discussions. 2 Lester F. Ward: Article. "Essential Nature of Religion."</page><page sequence="2">Religion as an Idea. 67 "Religion is a suppression of our fallible wills to what we conceive of as a higher will, the restraint of individualistic impulses to racial ones. This restraint seems to me to be of the very essence of religion." 3 "Religion is the effective desire to be in right relations to the power mani- festing itself in the universe." ' These definitions, exhibiting, as I have said, the functional value of religion, rest on the experienced fact of a reality, not ourselves, which is practically omnipotent. On the other hand there are definitions which seem to find in religion a fact hav- ing other value than that of restraint. "Religion is an excitement of the cheerful, expansive, dynamogenic or- der. Religion cannot be a mere anachronism and survival, but must exert a permanent function whether she be with or without intellectual content and whether, if she have any, it be true or false." We are prepared by these words, for the more formal defi- nition of religion as "the total reaction of the individual in the presence of that which is primary and enveloping. Religion adds a newr dimension to life and spreads out a new reach of freedom making easy and felicitous what in any case is nec- essary." We may place in this second class of definitions, Arnold's conception of a power that makes for righteousness, also Fiske's quasi-psychical energy, and last of all the recent ex- pression of Professor Royce before the Amrican Philosophi- cal Association 6 where he says: "Religion, in its higher sense, is the consciousness of practical relations to a real but unseen spiritual order whose authority, as furnishing the rule for con- duct, is conceived as absolute and whose worth and dignity are recognized as supreme." This Professor Royce pronounces the most important business of the human being. It is plain that these definitions, while differing in the gen- eral conception as above indicated, agree in failing to discrimi- nate between what religion is as a given, present reality in the evolution of thought and belief, and what religion is as rep- ' Henry Rutgers Marshall: "Instinct and Reason." 4 Ira W.

We are concerned to know not only what religion is here and there and elsewhere, but what religion ought to be if the most fully developed man is to profess religion. Among the quotations cited above, the utterance of Pro- fessor Royce comes nearest to our present thought. He de- clares religion to be the consciousness of practical relations to a real but unseen spiritual order. Here, as he tells us, we have a rule of conduct that is absolute and of a supreme worth and dignity. There is noticeable in all this handling of religion, not ex- cepting the last, a desire to get on without what is known in orthodox parlance, as a personal God. Professor Royce re- lates us to an unseen spiritual order. The writer must not, for one moment, be taken to imply that this rejection of the ortho- dox teaching is due to prejudice or narrowness. The fact is exactly the contrary. Such views as those of Professors Royce and James are the result of a conviction that we must have a higher, larger, and in every way diviner conception of religion than the creed of orthodoxy provides. The gross anthropomorphism of all religions has inevitably brought it about that religion now attempts to get itself ex- pressed without any anthropomorphism whatsoever. Doubt- less there is below this still a further consideration, viz. the conviction that the existence of a personal God cannot be ac- cepted by enlightened reason. Now it is the purpose of the present paper to insist that whether you can or cannot believe in a personal God is a mat- ter totally distinct from the question as to whether such belief is essential for the highest religious conception. A man may be alike justified and constrained to say: "Religion for me means belief in a personal God; if I cannot secure such a belief, I shall not profess religion. 'An unseen spiritual order' must be an order of unseen spirits, or spirit if it is to determine my conduct or character." Since on all hands definitions of religion are put forward, and since nearly all of these are in terms of the vaguest gen- erality, the writer submits one from the concrete approach:</page><page sequence="4">Religion as an Idea. 69 Religion is the binding of human personality to a supreme personality. The differencing marks of this definition are clear. First, religion is a binding-there is in it a conscious- ness of obligation. Second, this obligation is to make oneself like the supreme self. Third, this supremacy is due to and grounded in a transcendent excellence of character and noth- ing else. As the Best Being, and for no other reason, has God a right to me. Underneath the entire definition is the idea of personality. What does personality mean? It means self-con- scious intelligence. It is no objection to say that self-con- scious intelligence cannot be defined-for this is the ultimate and no ultimate can be defined. The question before us is whether philosophy can furnish a higher definition of religion. There is no need in this paper to enter into historical considerations or to attempt to show, by distinguished examples, that wherever religion has been most powerful and comforting, it has exhibited faith in a Living God. We are concerned wholly with the idea and with the question as to whether the human mind is capable of any higher idea. It is safe to say that all will agree to set apart the word God to stand for the highest conception of which we are capable. Have we anything higher or can we create anything higher than the conception of a Supreme Self-Conscious Intelligence? It is interesting to note that men as far removed from ortho- doxy as Mr. Spencer, distinctly assert that we are not capable of any higher conception. It is interesting further to observe that in the same breath with which he says this, he adds: "That is no reason for not believing in such an existence." "How do we know," he asks, "that there may not be a being as far removed from the limited intelligence of man as man is from the intelligence of the brute?" Here, as the writer be- lieves, we meet a most diffusively pernicious fallacy in all rea- soning on this subject. We do not know how much greater realities there may be than those we do know and must know, therefore let us not believe as we know and must know but exactly as we do not know and cannot know. There is scarcely anything more astonishing among the dis-</page><page sequence="5">70 International Journal of Ethics. plays of human reason than Mr. Spencer's attempt, made many years since, to reconcile science and religion. Tracing the conceptions of science and religion to their irresolvable re- mainders, he found these to be the same for each, viz. an un- knowable. The only characteristic of this reality is existence -weiter nichts-as though there could be for any conscious- ness a "somewhat" which was not a "somehow." Consider the religion of it. Science and faith on their knees before an existence of which not the slightest state of con- sciousness is to be had! All determination is negation, there- fore if you speak of God, He is no longer God. Here we are reminded of Mr. Bradley's caustic footnote, "Appearance and Reality" page i28: "I do not wish to be irreverent, but Mr. Spencer's attitude towards his Unknowable strikes me as a pleasantry, the point of which lies in its unconsciousness. It seems a proposal to take something for a God simply and solely because we do not know what the devil it can be. But I am far from attributing to Mr. Spencer any one consistent view." The fact of the matter seems to be that our refined culture is so shocked by the least anthropomorphism in approaching God that no God whatsoever is left to approach. We all know the favorite argument here and upon what assumption it is based. The finite cannot conceive the infinite,-because the infinite is exactly that which is beyond the finite. How shall anyone grasp that which he cannot grasp? Nothing seems more co- gent than this-and nothing is more genuine nonsense. The nonsense is the necessary outcome of man's determination to give objective reality to the creation of his own mind. The distinction between noumenon and phenomenon-infinite and finite-is in itself, i. e., as representing the state of the case be- yond man's consciousness, an utter figment. The finite means nothing but our present relations with the infinite. We touch the infinite on every side, are parts of it, ourselves declare its nature. To say therefore that we cannot have a solitary state of consciousness about it -is the extreme of folly. Whenever, by permission of Mr. Spencer, we know the pitiable phenomenal we know the infinite. It is to be hoped that this old "inconceivability" argument</page><page sequence="6">Religion as an Idea. 71 will play no farther part in discussions about matters of fact or about inferences from fact. The only inconceivability worth talking of in an infinite universe, is that which is dis- played by the incongruent elements of a conception-such as a round square or a double unit. When we pass from form to matter nothing is to be ruled out as impossible because, up to date, our experience is lacking in a given direction. Not long since it would have been pro- nounced as impossible as it was inconceivable, that we could look through nine inches of solid oak. Yet many of us have done this, and should one come forward saying "I can project my thought by a wordless, wireless telegraphy, through miles of space," a fitting modesty would bid him do so and show the doing to others. Let us then say the phenomenon is the nou- menon appearing; in knowing phenomenon, we know noume- non. We return to the definition of religion as a binding of our personality to a supreme personality, and assert that, as an idea, a conception, this is higher than the vague presentations found in current literature on the subject. Test the definition from the side of the intellect and from the side of the emotions. Intellect assures us that self-con- scious intelligence is a fact-also that it is a fact of very high rank. No distinction is more evident than that between the thing and the thought of the thing. The thing knows not that it is a thing; the thought knows and knows that it knows. Noow this fact, which none can dispute, must be taken at its full value and the only way to do this is to realize that the fact came by way of the universe itself. The universe has produced a self-conscious individual who is aware of the universe and of himself as aware. This transcendent fact should give a new meaning to reality, should illuminate it from every side, show- ing that the universe is in no sense static, also that self-con- scious intelligence may be in no sense static. Because self-conscious intelligence is, within our experience, exhibited through the limited centers of individuals, does it in any sense follow that no unlimited self-conscious intelligence is possible? Consider the highest expression of human intel-</page><page sequence="7">72 International Journal of Ethiics. lect as such-taking as a type, Aristotle the "Master of them that know." Here the relation of finite to infinite is of the lim- ited and serial order, but evidences of something else are also present. The unrivaled dialectic is simply a direct and relatively complete contact of consciousness with its subject matter. In like manner the painstaking accumulation of facts and the grasp of the subjects through their history is the relatively complete adjustment of consciousness to a world-process. What then compels us to maintain that the idea of an intelli- gence exceeding that of Aristotle as his exceeds the intelligence of the oyster is contradictory? Contradictory to what? Not to experience for experience points in that direction. To the ne- cessities of thought? Not at all, if once we banish the figment of our own devising that the infinite is whatever the finite is not. A supreme self-conscious intelligence then is our highest God-concept. We demand that the power that makes for righteousness shall know that it is making for righteousness, that the quasi-psychical energy shall be so far and so dis- tinctively psychical as to know what it is about, that the "unseen spiritual order" shall be somewise approachable, that it shall mean something more than is embodied by the nega- tive term invisibility. Spinoza's God-idea, like all his ideas, is crystal clear and ex- hibits our present thought in masterly statement-"God is a being, each of whose attributes exhibits an infinite and eternal nature." This Spinoza rightly assures us means that each at- tribute is absolutely infinite, not infinite suo genere only. The entire' being of God is in each-in the attribute mercy in the at- tribute power, in the attribute omniscience. God is absolutely just in His mercy and absolutely merciful in His justice-so through all attributes. It does not dispose of our thought to say that such a God is the noblest work of man, for in saying this the entire position of the paper is granted. We seek to know exactly what God must mean for us, the term God being used for our highest conception. Our contention then is with those who, claiming to have the most advanced God-idea, speak to us in abstractions of the</page><page sequence="8">Religion as an Idea. 73 "presence of that which is primary and enveloping," and tell us that religion means "an excitement of the cheerful, expan- sive, dynamogenic order." It really seems that we need not, as we certainly cannot, concern ourselves much about that which is "primary and enveloping." We certainly need some way of getting an authority which, as Professor Royce says, will furnish a rule for conduct whose worth and dignity will be rec- ognized as supreme. There is no consciousness so intellectual that it can divest itself of such need, for the need is grounded in the very essence of intellect. To intelligize is to perceive. To perceive is to perceive somewhat. Thus in our most ab- stract generalizations are we tethered to facts-concrete, indi- vidual objects and persons. From the point of view of intellect, consciousness of self is the highest reality attainable. Kant's transcendental self, in the unity of apperception, makes experience possible-and Hegel's reflective self, as the last, highest, stage in the evolution of reason, thinks reality as a union of contradictories. Now comes the distinctive doctrine of our day, scientific evolution, and shows a process in which the simple has be- come the complex, the homogeneous the heterogeneous, and, last of all, shall we say, comes the growing appreciation of this doctrine as an exposition of the nature of being, of the uni- verse. Most interesting is it to observe that this appreciation carries us back to Kant and to Hegel. My meaning is that a newer emphasis has been put upon self-consciousness as a re- ality this universe was at work at-was determined to exhibit. A newer meaning is put upon struggle, contest, as the only way to character, self-determined excellence, moral worth. "The far-off event" has drawn so near as to suggest the meaning of it all-this stormy, struggling, developing life of ours. It remains to consider the God-idea from that other side of human nature, the side of the emotions. Long ago Mr. Bain thought to tell us the truth about religion when he said: "Re- ligion, being primarily an affair of the emotions, means must be sought for heightening these." Man not only reasons, he feels. About this there can be no question. All ethical judg-</page><page sequence="9">74 International Journal of Ethics. ment-standards class themselves under reason or feeling as the ultimate source of appeal. With regard to feeling, two facts are of fundamental import. These facts are clearly and forcibly stated by Hegel.7 "Feeling is the immediate and, as it were, the closest contact in which the thinking subject can stand to a given subject." "Trained and sterling feel- ing is the feeling of an educated mind-and it is with such a mind that the rectified material enters into its feeling and receives form." "If any man on any topic appeals not to the nature and notion of the thing, or at least to reasons, but to his feeling, the only thing to do is to let him alone, be- cause, by his behavior he refuses to have lot or part in common rationality, but shuts himself up in his private and particular self." The first of these facts will doubtless be universally admit- ted. There is nothing so essentially, peculiarly, our own as our feelings. We can in a sense envisage, put out of ourselves, our thoughts; this we can in no sense do with our feelings. Yet the first fact has more in it than this truth. "Feeling is the closest contact in which as thinkers," we can stand to a given subject. This means that thinking alone will not and cannot relate us as closely to a given subject as we are capable of be- ing related. The subject is not ours until we have felt it; if we are unmoved by the truth we are not in possession of the truth. One of the most radical defects in modern education, and a defect for which no provision seems anywhere contemplated in our reconstruction of curricula and our fads, is met ex- actly in our overestimation of the intellectual and underesti- mation of the emotional. In our reaction from sentimentality and gush we have attained that rarified extreme where feeling is "bad form" and we all know that when anything is "bad form" it is at its worst. As illustration the writer has in mind a "reader" for a large eastern publishing house who gave as his chief ground for rejecting a manuscript, the fact that it irritated him by surprising him every little while into states of feeling. This critic's horror of melodrama as "bad'form" had robbed him of the divinest reality belonging to human nature, viz. its right to feel. Many educators would admit that to establish a pupil in 7 "Philosophy of Mind." I quote from Wallace's translation, pages 68-69.</page><page sequence="10">Religion as an Idea. 75 pure tastes and likings is to come very near saving him in his earthly career. This admission is the admission of feeling as the fundamental reality of character. No reformation in edu- cation could compare in beneficence with that which would develop within the pupils the feeling side of the truths they learn. This brings us to our second fact of fundamental im- portance. Feeling should be a trained feeling, i. e., the feeling of an educated mind and this because "it is with such a mind that the rectified material enters into its feeling and receives form." This thought is to be considered from two sides. Feeling de- pends upon fact for its right to exist. Secondly, all fact as such is capable of producing feeling. Consider the first statement. Feeling has its source in fact. This justifies feeling, saves it from sentimentality and gush. Recall, in this connection, the statement of Professor James. "Religion must exert a permanent function whether she be with or without intellectual content and whether, if she have any, it be true or false." This appears to tell us that religion will continue to serve us in the expansive way before men- tioned, whether she have any substance or not, or whether the claimed substance be true or false. How much can religion expand us if we do not know that it means anything at all, or, if it does, that its meaning is true? We should be unwilling to credit Professor James with such a position were it not for other statements in the Gifford Lec- tures and for his argument, in the "Will to Believe," to show that argument is unnecessary. His teaching there is that by wanting a fact very much we create the fact-as where a young man creates love in a young woman by refusing to ac- cept her "no" and by insisting that she must love him. It seems strange that Professor James did not reflect upon an- other alternative, viz. that the young man's intense desire may have made a different young man of him-brought out nobler traits, kinder thoughts and acts, so giving to the young woman the facts which won her affection. Whether, psychologically speaking, the James-Lange theory of emotion be accepted or decidedly modified as now seems</page><page sequence="11">76 International Journal of Ethics. probable, the reality of trained feeling cannot be questioned or the philosophical significance of such feeling disputed. The active temperament when possessed by a strong conviction brings things to pass and this conviction, be it distinctly ob- served, means that certain things are true and certain con- clusions justified. Now persuade such a temperament that nothing can ever be learned as to the truth or falsity of cer- tain doctrines, and all feeling with regard to the doctrines, ex- cept possibly regret, will cease. We deal here, as is plain to all, with a question of method, and it seems most essential that two very distinct matters be recognized as distinct and, if settled at all, be settled separately. Examine the definitions of "pragmatism" and "pragmatic method" given by C. A. Pierce and Professor James. Says Mr. Pierce: "Consider what effects, that might conceivably have practical bearings, we conceive the object of our con- ception to have, then our conception of these effects is the whole of our conception of the object." Says Professor James: "The doctrine that the whole meaning of a conception ex- presses itself in practical consequences, consequences either in the shape of conduct to be recommended or in that of experi- ence to be expected, if the conception be true is pragmatism." These statements agree in setting forth pragmatism as a method for clarifying a conception. That method is the analy- sis of the conception, its resolution into the consequences involved in it, consequences in the shape of conduct to be rec- ommended or of experience to be expected. Now it may be admitted that, for such clarifying result, the method is most admirable. We can thus determine the meaning of the conception for us in our present attitude to- ward a subject under investigation. It is a totally different thing however to interpret being, reality, after such a manner. When we come to metaphysics for an account of existence, we want to know what the whole affair means, why these things work out such results. It surely is no answer to show that conceptions are "workable" and bring certain consequences. The definition of Professor James contains ethical and the- oretical factors-the former where the conception involves</page><page sequence="12">Religion as an Idea. 77 conduct to be recommended, the latter as it involves conse- quences to be expected. Here something more appears to be contained than the mere determination of consequences. The method itself is determined outside itself. Why shall we rec- ommend certain conduct seeno to be involved in our concep- tion? This question brings up again for settlement all the disputed topics concerned with ethical standards. In like manner from the theoretical side the method re- quires verification by experience and so shares the strength and weakness of the inductive procedure. The application of this method is given by Professor James himself in his article, "The Will to B'elieve"-and the method here deals with the fundamentals of religious faith and avowedly claims to be a "defence of our right to adopt a believing attitude in relig- ious matters in spite of the fact that our merely logical intel- lect may not have been coerced." That we have a right to believe in spite of our reason no one will question, for what can "right" mean here except legal ability? That we can thus believe is not at all established by the author of the defense. His reference to the fact that men are much more under the influence of their feelings in all matters of faith, than of their reason, does not at all justify them in such surrender to feeling; neither does it, in the slightest degree, prove that they get on without reason when they yield to feeling. The influence of feeling simply leads to the over-estimate of certain facts and the disregard of others and so to a wrong conclusion-but in no sense to a conclusion professedly at vari- ance with the facts. Men have still a strong sense of shame in attempting to believe the absurd, and it is important to con- sider that there is no such thing as the "coercion of a logical intellect." The "logical intellect" rejoices in being itself, seeks no other freedom, has no sense of coercion in following the co- gent, because logical, process of an argument or a demonstra- tion. We seem then constrained, in the name of reason, to re- ject the method of saving faith urged by Professor James and to abide by the old attempt to give a reason for the faith that is in us.</page><page sequence="13">78 International Journal of Ethics. Have we reason to believe in the existence of a supreme personality whose nature is the ground of our sense of religious obligation? The answer to this question must be gathered from the facts of experience-our individual experience- and surely, on Professor James' own showing, no harm will result if the question be answered in the affirmative. "But," some one may ask, "what if it be answered in the negative and there should, after all, be a God? Well, if He be a God worthy of the name He will respect and honor the sincerity of the unbelief and no harm will come to the unbe- liever who erred through ignorance. It is plain then that the inductive method which has served so well in the discovery of physical laws, may admit of appli- cation and be of service in determining our conclusions in mat- ters of religion. There has been, and is, as much disagreement in science as in theology. The history of the inductive sciences presents a series of errors so extended and thorough-going as to parallel any contradictory dogmas and abandoned positions in the history of religious and psychological speculation. We have advanced in science by the use of experimental method and there is no reason whatsoever why this method should not be taken, in its broadest sense, as the method of fact-handling. The scientist is now well assured that there are facts as fact-like as anything he can perceive under his micro- scope or resolve by his chemicals. We have a right in the name of science to demand for these facts full recognition and a just estimate. A universe that produces consciousness, con- science, and reverence, must be interpreted in the light of these facts, as the acorn must be interpreted by the oak, and not by chemical analysis. The later stages of a process are as real as the earlier-more than this, they alone expound the pro- cess. The realities that are found in the fully developed man whose body, mind and feelings are at their highest, are worth more to solve the mystery of the universe than any con- ceivable application of the genetic method. We reach the final topic of our paper, which is the relation of religion to the emotional life of man. Having said that feel-</page><page sequence="14">Religion as an Idea. 79 ing is man's innermost possession, that the deepest, purest feelings are those springing from the loftiest religious con- ceptions, having insisted also that such feelings must be nour- ished by a rational belief in the existence of a reality capable of calling them forth and giving them nourishment, let us consider the fitness of our concrete definition of religion to sup- ply this need. The religious man is convinced that he is bound by a su- preme personality-that is a supreme self-conscious intelli- gence. This binding is due to the excellence of a being be- tween whom and himself there is kindredness of nature. Man believes, to use Fiske's words, that "he is not without kith and kin in all this universe." Let it be granted that our loftiest emotions are love, rever- ence, worship, sympathy, and that we are at our best when these are most intense and abiding. It seems to follow that Kant's assertion about reverence holds with regard to all the emotions named. "Reverence," Kant tells us, "can be felt only for persons, never for things." Love, worship, sympa- thy, these in like manner can be experienced only for persons, never for things. If we are without a personal God in the world we shall necessarily be without the truest reverence, af- fection, and sympathy. There is something pathetic in the at- tempt of spiritually minded thinkers to ignore this fact and to advance in their spiritual life by generalities and abstractions. The most singular exhibition of this pathetic situation is shown by those who try to content themselves with the im- personal immortality of being known by posterity-known in their poems, their statues, their books, their legislation, while they, "the feeling, thinking, acting, men shall sleep in their urns." Meanwhile signs are becoming more and more abundant that the individual man is asserting himself, and that he re- fuses to cry quits with the universe because posterity will know of his present doings when he has parted with all conscious- ness forevermore. The outcry of Nietzsche is the outcry of the individual, an outcry of protest against absorption in the mass-whether country or church. The longing to know</page><page sequence="15">80 International Journal of Ethics. whether, if a man die, shall he live again, was never more in- tense than at this very hour. Our feeling is to be a trained feeling and we shall do well to consider that all-fact is capable of producing such feeling. Nothing could be more disastrous, alike for the individual and for the society where his influence is exerted than un- trained emotion. Life cannot advance by disordered, unre- Ilected impulses. Our impulses must somewise lead out of beyond themselves and this they can do only when an ideal, a meaning is found in them, by means of them. They must contain more than mere emotion; a fact must be their cause and an end their goal. When we consider the world-view of to-day as an intellect- ual result constructed for us by modern science, we cannot re- fuse to acknowledge a body of fact every way qualified to de- velop, strengthen and guide our emotions. We have right to feel in view of what we know, and, were this knowledge set forth as it should be in our schools, colleges and universities, strong characters as active centres for good would result. Idealism has come again, come with renewed power, and this is due to an acceptance of all facts with at the same time, a clear discernment of a meaning, a purpose, wrapped up in these facts. It is surely in place to ask what have the facts to offer as warrant for belief in God and for religious feeling as a binding of ourselves to Him. W. R. BENEDICT.
