<plain_text><page sequence="1">THE DEVIL AND SAMUEL CLEMENS By COLEMAN O. PARSONS MANY travelers have heard villagers boast of their lake that every attempt to fathom its depth has failed; the lake is—and this in awed tones— bottomless. So it is with the hydrography of the human spirit. The central depths will hold some mystery which no heaving of the lead can adequately sound. The lesser depths can be charted, and the leadsman's task is not difficult when he can cry out, "Mark Twain." The American tragi-comedian who assumed this pen name was alternately a crony of death and a playboy of life. Like a silver quarter, he would present the face of a benignant goddess encouraging trust in God and liberty; then, with the agility of a Mexican jumping bean, the coin would flip itself to reveal a baleful bird of prey. Perhaps neither the optimist nor the pessimist was the essential man, for both characters went to make up the whole man. Happiness cap tured more hours of existence, and despair achieved greater intensity. Each mood was a safety valve for something sup pressed by its opposite. For the sake of clarity, I shall neglect the better known Mark Twain and concentrate on Samuel Langhorne Clemens in an effort to discover the source and the mythology of his gloom. II In her old age, Jane Lampton Clemens told her son, "You gave me more uneasiness than any child I had." Perhaps it is she, not Aunt Patsy Cooper, who in "Those Extraordinary Twins" distinguishes between the Siamese twins, Count Luigi (Sam beating his breast as freethinker, dissipator, selfish egotist) and Count Angelo (a combination of Orion and Henry Cle</page><page sequence="2">THE DËVIL AND SAMUEL CLEMENS 583 mens) : "Up to all kinds of mischief and disobedience when he was a boy, I'll be bound. I lay his mother had trouble to lay her hand on him when she wanted him. But the one on the right is as good as gold, I can see that." There we have the familiar pair again, Tom and Sid Sawyer, brothers representing natural urges and rebellion in sharp contrast to duties and submission. It is almost as if Tom Jones felt ashamed of recognizing some thing sly in Blifil or as if Charles Surface persuaded himself that Joseph Surface was the better man. Albert Bigelow Paine describes the boy Sam as a queer, fanci ful, uncommunicative, delicate, pranksome runaway who wouldn't even stay put in his sleep. Sam explains in his "Auto biography" that, when he was a juvenile problem, his mother was thought to be a confirmed invalid, "destined to pass soon away." Every time Sam hurt her, every time Henry was held up as an example of thoughtfulness, there may have been just a suggestion of the frail, courageous, and loving martyr being hastened to her grave. Jane Clemens seems to have lived on her nerves, and nerves have a way of snapping under boyish bom bardment. She had a tremendous capacity for forgiving and understanding the wayward, but. such generosity can deepen as well as lighten the consciousness of transgression. Sam never met anyone who could surpass her in the pity and indignation of her humanitarian eloquence. This "most gentle spirit," mis tress of "an unstudied and unconscious pathos," could lash, shame, deride, and defy oppressors—in mild tones. Thus she could make a brutal father hang his head in penitence or com pel a cruel carter to take the blame on himself and promise never to whip his horse again. Now, Sam like Count Luigi was on occasion an oppressor of his meek brother, and the same sword of justice was impartially held over his head. Sam's spitefulness toward his brother Henry is much more significant than the usual fraternal animosities. Although, as Orion says, Henry leaned "on Sam for protection," the older brother at times proved a shaky support. To begin with peccadillos, once Sam taunted the pride of the family into</page><page sequence="3">584 THE VIRGINIA QUARTERLY REVIEW leaping over a splintery stump while wearing a new cotton velvet suit. A ripping was heard, and Sam roared and jeered as the "cotton-tail rabbit" went weeping home. Malice, boredom, and youthful spirits met in gleeful conjunction when Sam, lean ing out of a third-story printing-office window, dropped the hollow shell of a watermelon on Henry's head. Henry got back at Sam with a cobblestone, as he had once before when his brother ambushed and clodded him. What was wrong with Henry? What trait aroused a hostility, strangely coupled with love, a hostility which, translated into other terms, was to make Sam suffer ages of remorse? Henry was, I am afraid, one of Burns's "unco guid," a moral prig. "The best boy in the whole region," harmless and inoffensive, with "an overflowing abundance of goodness," Henry could not help being "exasperatingly" model in his "truthfulness and obedience." Although Clemens later admitted that Henry was the original of Sid in "Tom Sawyer," he insisted that his brother was "a very much finer and better boy," which hardly made him more acceptable. Without being vicious, Henry had a way of tattling, of capitalizing on his mother's preference, of letting the blame fall on Sam's head. Sam Clemens had a sensitive eagerness for love—especially for the approving love of his mother. But "sturdy, industrious, dependable" Henry, his complete antithesis, stood in his way, basked in the maternal sunshine, and irritatingly came off with a favorable verdict whenever he and Sam took their disputes to the domestic tribunal. Even when Sam was punished for a rare misdeed of Henry's, his tardily enlightened mother con sidered the thrashing one on account. In retaliation, Sam tried to get Henry into trouble with Mrs. Clemens—but never suc ceeded. Hence the resentment, mingled with love, the shame for feeling hostile to good people, the sense of rejection, un worthiness, and guilt. Sam Clemens pondered much on "Genesis," in which he could have found a parallel to his own symbolic lot, with the Lord serving as referee instead of Jane Clemens:</page><page sequence="4">THE DEVIL AND SAMUEL CLEMENS 585 And the Lord had respect unto Abel [the younger brother], and to his offering: but unto Cain, and to his offering, he had not respect: and Cain was very wroth, and his countenance fell. And the Lord said unto Cain. ... If thou doest well, shalt thou not be accepted? and if thou doest not well, sin lieth at the door.... Cain rose up against Abel his brother, and slew him. And the Lord said unto Cain.... A fugitive and a vagabond shalt thou be in the earth. And Cain said unto the Lord, My punishment is greater than I can bear.... And the Lord set a mark upon Cain, lest any finding him should kill him [the curse of longevity]. And Cain went out from the presence of the Lord, and dwelt in the land of Nod, on the east of Eden. This passage suggests the more somber episodes in the brothers' relations. In "The Facts Concerning! the Recent Carnival of Crime in Connecticut," dwarfish, moldy Conscience reminds the author of how, though treacherous, he was trusted in a doglike, loving fashion by his younger brother. The tor mentor gleefully insists: The latest picture you have of him in health and strength must be such a comfort to you! You pledged your honor that if he would let you blindfold him no harm should come to him; and then, giggling and choking over the rare fun of the joke, you led him to a brook thinly glazed with ice, and pushed him in; and how you did laugh! Man, you will never forget the gentle, reproachful look he gave you as he struggled shivering out, if you live a thousand years! ... "Beast, I have seen it a million times, and shall see it a million more." In sober fact, Henry survived almost to his twentieth birth day in comparatively sound "health and strength." The hint of disastrous consequences of the ducking, borrowed from the skating tragedy of Sam's friend, Tom Nash, speaks not only of a richly dramatic imagination but of an almost masochistic eagerness to increase the burden of guilt. The feeling of remorse was less factitiously morbid in 1858. After getting Henry the unpaid post of "mud" clerk on the river boat, Pennsylvania, Sam Clemens had a circumstantial dream of his brother's corpse in a metallic coffin. When the boilers burst at Ship Island, below Memphis, Henry inhaled live steam. Sam arrived later to watch</page><page sequence="5">586 THE VIRGINIA QUARTERLY REVIEW by his mattress bed and to insist that a medical student should "judge" the eighth grain of morphine prescribed for the patient, if disturbed. Whether Henry died of the clumsily measured overdose or of another cause, Sam found his dream sadly matched by reality. His guilt was threefold, for he got Henry the job in the first place, he gave him fatal advice about being brave during an accident, and he prompted the apprentice physician. He had failed as his brother's keeper. I cannot escape the conviction that Samuel Clemens' guilt complex was rooted in his relations with Mother Jane and Brother Henry. His nostalgic yearning for the age of innocence and his belief in the sinlessness of animals are evidences of his lifelong compulsion to shake off the cruel burden. To maternal influence is probably due his love for the brave, high-minded invalid type, which attracted him to the arms of Olivia Lang don. The Twainian humor may also be domestic in origin, for Sam soon learned that a smart jest turneth away wrath, that a pun can placate the strong and protect the weak. Another way to meet the situation was defiance of the powers which impose on boy and man codes which he cannot live up to. I doubt whether Sam ever openly defied his mother, and secret defiance wasn't much use, because it made him feel a sneak and therefore culpable all over again. Instead, his thwarted hostility may have been rechanneled into a grudge against local harsh characters, monarchs, and the anthropomorphic God best known to him through Presbyterianism but obtrusive enough in other sects and in Catholicism. But if Sam Clemens' "first and closest friend" gave him a legacy of fears, she added to it the counterbalance of courage. Her largeness of heart, her unflagging interest in everything and everybody, her sympathy for the friendless inspired in Sam a love of humanity which his later bitterness over the impos sibility of improving mankind sometimes concealed but never obliterated. Clemens' humanitarian protest was launched against all forms of violence—coercion of opinion, lynchings, wars; his sense of guilt fixed on death. In Hannibal, when a drunken</page><page sequence="6">THE DEVIL AND SAMUEL CLEMENS 587 tramp was locked up in the calaboose, Sam impulsively invested in a box of lucifers to give the poor wretch materials for enter tainment. The tramp clumsily burned down the jail and him self in it. For weeks, in waking or sleeping consciousness, Sam, the unintentional murderer, was clawed by remorse. I have already mentioned Henry's death. Some eleven years earlier, when his father died, Sam could not help thinking that he had not been a good son. John Clemens' ghost did not walk after the funeral, but Sam's body did in somnambulistic torment. With the deaths of his wife and of all his children except Clara, Samuel Clemens, grown old, agonized over little kindnesses neglected and was haunted by a vague specter of responsibility. Thirty-four years after the death of his twenty-two months old son, Langdon, he recorded the possible cause in his "Auto biography." For a third of a century he dwelt with his remorse and, though moved to 'fess up like a naughty child, was too timorous to clear his conscience until the mark was indelible. In Elmira, New York, Clemens had taken his delicate son for a long airing in an open barouche on a raw, cold morning. While the father was in a reverie, the furs slipped off Langdon's bare legs and the tot was almost frozen. Soon afterwards he died of diphtheria in Hartford: I have always felt shame for that treacherous morning's work and have not allowed myself to think of it when I could help it. I doubt if I had the courage to make confession at that time. I think it most likely that I have never confessed until now. Life became for Sam Clemens a brief and happy trudging along the right road, followed by an inexplicable wandering from it and by long years of futile, unutterable yearning to re turn. The waters of the Mississippi, gliding from mysterious reaches north of Keokuk to fabulous realms south of St. Louis, were for a time free from insistent adult values and provided sanctuary for the natural boy. From the river banks, young Clemens surveyed a domain of primal simplicity, in which re freshment from the sun's rays, incidental cleansing, a fish diet,</page><page sequence="7">588 THE VIRGINIA QUARTERLY REVIEW and shaded slumber temporarily banished all niggling duties. Thaumaturgically sealed by south-running water, Glasscock's Island beckoned the swimmer—a Garden of Eden saved from the world's complexities and corruption. But just as the cool retreat of the cave became entangled in the boy's mind with thoughts of being lost, frightened, hungry, near dead, so the river took on more somber meanings. Two of Sam's friends were drowned in the Mississippi. And in winter its glittering appeal became as treacherous as the song of the Lorelei. One night, Sam and the postmaster's son, Tom Nash, stole away from home to skate "without permission." When the river began to break up about midnight, the boys took an hour to make their fearful way back to shore over floating fields of ice. All perspiring, Tom fell short in his last leap, struggled to shore in a bitter bath, took to bed, and had "a procession of diseases" culminating in scarlet fever. His doom was to go through life stone deaf and ludicrously impaired in speech. Sam Clemens never recovered from the shock of this confutation of ideal justice, this horribly disproportionate punishment of a small sin. Indeed, he himself might have been the victim of cosmic cruelty. The incident turned over and over in his mind until it emerged in three different forms in his "Notebook" (May 27, 1898) and "Autobiography" and in "The Mysterious Stranger." Ill The need for him to understand why each individual's earthly paradise is lost, why life becomes sullied, led Samuel Clemens from his own baffling experience to mythology, philosophy, and religion. In "Genesis" he read that Eve, forbidden to eat of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil, succumbed to the wiles of a serpent: "In the day ye eat thereof, then your eyes shall be opened; and ye shall be as gods, knowing good and evil." Having eaten of the fruit of wisdom, Eve and compliant Adam immediately became ashamed of their nakedness and of their disobedience. Besides toil and sorrow, the punishment of</page><page sequence="8">THE DEVIL AND SAMUEL CLEMENS 589 the greedy pair was banishment from Eden before they had a chance to plunder the tree of everlasting life. This was the supreme decision of human history, the moment at which the sense of guilt entered consciousness. That Clemens saw Adam and Eve's dilemma in the light of his own is made clear in "The Turning-Point of My Life." Circumstance and man's natural disposition work together inexorably. Tempera ment is born in a man, "and he has no authority over it, neither is he responsible for its acts By temperament I was the kind of person that does things. ... I still do the thing commanded by Circumstance and Temperament, and reflect afterward. Always violently." In a deterministic sense, Clemens would have agreed with the Calvinists, "In Adam's fall, we sinned all." But if Adam and Eve had only been asbestos-temperamented like Luther and Joan of Arc instead of helpless and butter-tempera mented, the catastrophic apple would have remained on its branch! Clemens was not satisfied until he had written his own version of "That Day in Eden" in the form of a passage from Satan's Diary. Adam and Eve had an understandable curiosity about good, evil, and death, but, lacking experience, they could not possibly comprehend Satan's explanation that innocence is the inability to distinguish right from wrong and that the Moral Sense, which makes that distinction possible, "is a degradation, a disaster ... the creator of wrong; wrong cannot exist until the Moral Sense brings it into being." In answer to heedless Eve's question, Satan admitted that the Moral Sense could be acquired by eating the forbidden fruit, but he did not urge the indulgence. When Eve ate and uninterested Adam followed her lead, Satan felt sorry: "Poor ignorant things It was pitiful." Thus was the search for the cause of mortal misery delayed by the Moral Sense, the acid which sometimes curdled Samuel Clemens' milk of human kindness. This faculty of differentiating between right and wrong he found discussed in W. E. H. Lecky's "History of European Morals," of which he owned a well-worn copy. Opposed to the stoical, intuitive assertion</page><page sequence="9">590 THE VIRGINIA QUARTERLY REVIEW of a genuine benevolence was the Epicurean, experiential insis tence that every action is selfish, being rooted in the impulse to avoid pain and to pursue pleasure. Clemens borrowed the phrase and its capitalization from such men as Shaftesbury and Francis Hutcheson, pernicious revivers of a classical doctrine (sensus decori et honesti), but he sided with George Berkeley and other anti-Moral Sense writers in debunking the concept. With the opposition's attempt to substitute more realistic and objective guides for what it considered muddled, individualistic enthusiasm, Clemens was only occasionally in sympathy. Both thought and a fantastic ethical sense, in conflict with natural necessity, have adulterated all human impulse and action. Re bellion against the Moral Sense, a fraud which the rare good man would try to see through, makes it imperative to reverse practically all its decisions. Thus a crusty doctor, "the Only Christian" of "Was It Heaven? Or Hell?" persuades twin maiden ladies to override conscience and to do good by telling lies. Self-righteous townsmen, conventionally "good" men who boast of the Moral Sense, are attacked with Burnsian vigor in "The Man That Corrupted Hadleyburg." The comic extreme of Clemens' wistful moral anarchy is achieved in "The Facts Concerning the Recent Carnival of Crime in Connecticut"; the author outlives his morbid scrupulousness and slays his shrunken, persecuting Conscience. Unfortunately, the denial of man's ethical capacity may leave the need to choose as per sistent as ever. In his protest, the American was temperamentally at one with Nietzsche in his attack on "bad conscience," with Ibsen in his characterization of modern man as suffering from "sickly conscience," and with Sudermann in his derision of the "con science of the race." Clemens' chief intellectual defense of his position was that of the relativity of morals: the Creator has given man no moral code; our laws and our conscience, man evolved and based on finite experience, have empirical validity at best. But most of the time his reaction was one of unreasoning trust in something like Rousseau's natural man and, if that créa</page><page sequence="10">THE DEVIL AND SAMUEL CLEMENS 591 ture eluded search, in a blessed Noah's Ark menagerie of sinless beasts, on a par with Swift's invariably right Houyhnhnms. With Oliver Goldsmith, who wrote "The Logicians Refuted" in imitation of Swift, he could fancy . . . that this boasted lord of nature Is both a weak and erring creature. That instinct is a surer guide Than reason-boasting mortal's pride; And that brute beasts are far before 'em, Deus est anima brutorum. The Moral Sense is ridiculed by the Old Man of Clemens' mechanistic gospel, "What Is Man?" but it also turns up in more imaginative works. Huckleberry Finn is a more mature crea tion than Tom Sawyer because he emerges from a boy's care free paradise into a sadly real world. He is the protesting battle ground on which conscience, custom, and law (the Moral Sense in different aspects) clash with primal sympathy, the impulsive will to freedom, over the question of aiding or preventing Negro Jim's flight. The Moral Sense goes down in defeat. In contrast, the boys of "The Mysterious Stranger," as Van Wyck Brooks has pointed out, have neither sufficient courage nor gen erosity to stand up against the witchcraft mores of their day. Sam Clemens had at last lost faith even in boys; a sustaining ideal had degenerated into an illusion, sorrowfully recognized as such. If adolescent nature was weak and corrupt, he was ironically thrown back on Calvinism. Having already trans formed predestination into determinism, he now accepted total depravity—for all but the animals. So it is appropriate that his spokesman, Satan, who is beyond good and evil, beyond pain and happiness, should sneer at the Moral Sense: No brute ever does a cruel thing—that is the monopoly of those with the Moral Sense. When a brute inflicts pain he does it innocently; it is not wrong; for him there is no such thing as wrong. And he does not inflict pain for the pleasure of inflicting it—only man does that. Inspired by that mongrel Moral Sense of his! A sense whose function is to dis</page><page sequence="11">592 THE VIRGINIA QUARTERLY REVIEW tinguish between right and wrong, with liberty to choose which of them he will do. Now what advantage can he get out of that? He is always choosing, and in nine cases out of ten he prefers the wrong. There shouldn't be any wrong; and without the Moral Sense there couldn't be any. And yet he is such an unreasoning creature that he is not able to perceive that the Moral Sense degrades him to the bottom layer of animated beings and is a shameful possession ... He [the bullock] is not besmirched with the Moral Sense, but is as the angels are, and knows no wrong, and never does it. When Clemens lost an ideal, he suffered for it himself and, through satire and irony, he made others suffer too. We may remember that Thomas Gray, in his Eton Ode, sees "the little victims" playing, "regardless of their doom" of adult woe and evil. Yet to the question whether these innocent boys should be warned that all men are alike condemned to groan comes the forbearing reply: Thought would destroy their paradise. No more; where ignorance is bliss, Tis folly to be wise. Not so Clemens in his blighted mood. Entering into Satan, he does a cruel thing. He perseveringly demonstrates to the boys of Eseldorf that life is utterly miserable. At the conclusion of the events, the narrator, Theodor Fischer, is a sadder and a wiser adolescent, but a far less happy one: Satan-Clemens "vanished and left me appalled, for I knew, and realized, that all he had said was true." It is as if Sam Clemens had finally come to resent Tom's, Huck's, and his own brief squatters' rights in a fool's paradise. IV Clemens was not satisfied to end his enquiry with the excres cent Moral Sense. Someone must have been responsible for the consciousness of sin. Milton had sung of sin and redemption in "Paradise Lost" and "Paradise Regained," accepting sin as a reality and tracing it to Satan. Denying the reality of sin, Cle</page><page sequence="12">THE DEVIL AND SAMUEL CLEMENS 593 mens wrote of guilt and blamed God for the horrible affliction. Whereas Milton's emphasis was ethical, that of Samuel Clemens was psychological. In "Eve Speaks," the first mother pro nounces it unjust of God to punish and debase mankind for an act of unreflecting disobedience which could only have been bad if the Moral Sense had been functioning before the apple was eaten. In this interpretation, our first parents and Satan appear not as enemies but as common victims of impulses and compulsions beyond their control. All three were insanely punished for not exercising a perfectly illusory free will. Satan, in fact, is like a'drugged, fate-driven commentator on the human tragedy. He foreknows, yields information, and sorrowfully observes the consequences of a cruel God's planting the Moral Sense tree, or tree of the knowledge of sin, in a garden inhabited by the unwary. In Milton, Satan actively plots, initiates strata gems, and corrupts mankind for vengeance' sake, while God foreknows, forbears from any saving gesture, and comments. Clemens was consciously reversing the rôles of divine autocrat and rebel, for in a letter of 1858 he exclaimed to Orion, "What is the grandest thing in 'Paradise Lost'—the Arch-Fiend's ter rible-energy! " Sam Clemens might at last say with the old Indian chief in Mary Johnston's "The Witch": "But devils' [white men's] devil not what I call devil. Devils' god what I call devil." The marginal comments in Clemens' copy of the "Memoirs of the Duke of Saint-Simon" repeat the condemnation: "God made these animals. He must have noticed this scene [of pre tended grief] ; I wish I knew how it struck Him ... We have to grant that God made this royal hog [Louis XIV] ; we may also be permitted to believe that it was a crime to do so." What aroused Clemens' theological wrath was the God of the Old Testament. As a married man, Clemens could not con tinue the concession of Bible-reading because the fables and myths contradicted reason, besides playing up a tribal God who was irascible, vindictive, and fickle. He would probably have expanded the remark of New England's Samuel Johnson, that Calvinism reflected "dishonour upon the Best of Beings," to</page><page sequence="13">594 THE VIRGINIA QUARTERLY REVIEW include all religious isms. Like the monster in Browning's "Caliban upon Setebos; or, Natural Theology in the Island," a satire on Calvinism and the anthropomorphic idea of God (Setebos), he conceived of a supergod, Caliban's Quiet and Clemens' Creator: There may be something quiet o'er His [Setebos'] head, Out of His reach, that feels nor joy nor grief, Since both derive from weakness in some way. Samuel Clemens' Creator of the Universe may owe some thing to Voltaire's "Zadig": "All that you see ort the little atom where you were born had to be in its place and in its fixed time according to the immutable orders of Him who embraces all There is no chance." The same celestial determinist turns up in the discourse of Macfarlane, a Cincinnati boarding-house friend of Sam's during the winter of 1856-1857. The Scotsman traced everything back to "a few microscopic seed germs, or perhaps one microscopic seed germ," planted by the Creator; from that point on, as Sam recalled the doctrine four decades later, life had evolved progressively until it encountered a snag in envious, selfish, vengeful, drunken, unclean, thieving, per secuting, murderous, patriotic man. Clemens' ideas also derived from eighteenth-century ration alism, which imported for American consumption the English and French deistic conception of a Supreme Geometrician, deviser of a perpetual motion machine which ran according to the laws of its own structure. Once the springs had been wound up, this many millennia clock ticked on, and none of its cogs could be held accountable for grating against other cogs. Sam Clemens' brand of deism is reminiscential of Tom Paine's "The Age of Reason," with its substitution of mind for myth, and unconsciously of the youthful Ben Franklin's extremism: God the mechanic, the questionableness of sin and personal immor tality, the denial of divine providence and human free will. Although these doctrines were mouthed "in Satan's cause," as orthodox Timothy Dwight protested, they persisted.</page><page sequence="14">THE DEVIL AND SAMUEL CLEMENS 595 In an article of 1870 which his wife dissuaded him from pub lishing, Clemens explained that the Creator, without making any promises to mankind, had ordered the machinery of the uni verse beneficently, exactly, changelessly. The unwritten laws are equal and impartial to all men, and if the Creator does choose to ordain immortality for man (a thing immaterial), he will not be unjust to the beneficiary. When Samuel Clemens let his mind dwell on God, he was likely to be pessimistic, but when he contemplated a Newtonian-deistic Creator, as in his "Note book" of 1899, he swung toward optimism. And no wonder! for a perfect artisan and artist rules the magnificent universe by means of materials, thoughts and character, forces and laws which He alone originated. The only trouble with the Creator was that He kept on withdrawing from the dust-fleck earth and its atrocious gadfly gods until He became infinitely remote —almost lost, in fact—in the immensities of the universe, in the austerities of cosmic harmony. Hence Clemens' thinking tended to shift its focus from the nebulosity, inscrutability, and indif ference of the Creator to his manifestation on earth in that "automatic machine," the mind, and in the workings of law: "I believe that the universe is governed by strict and immutable laws." Against such Icarian flights of reason the Young Man protests in "What Is Man?": "This is an infernal philosophy of yours." V The Clemens theology was trinitarian. It involved contempt for the Old Testament God, championship of the insulted and injured Satan, and immense respect for the universal Creator. But at no time does the American theologian manage to keep these three necessary persons of his trinity in mind at once. His animosity against God throws him into a despair which obliterates the Creator or which confuses man-made deity and aloof deistic reality; his support of the underdog Satan may lead to the transfer of some of the Creator's attributes to the great rebel; or absorption in the austerely efficient Creator</page><page sequence="15">596 THE VIRGINIA QUARTERLY REVIEW makes both God and Satan fade out of sight. The tenets of Clemens' creed were achieved separately and were never inte grated; thus the creed itself was unstable and seldom consola • tory. The earth is at one gloomy moment of reflection a "for gotten potato"; at another, the Creator's laws "inflict pain and suffering and sorrow. . . . Without a doubt He had an object, but we have no way of discovering what it was"; and at still another, man's purposeless evolution is "probably matter of surprise and regret to the Creator." These Hardy and Kafka moods certainly brought no comfort. Like Ivan Karamazov, Clemens challenged God on the score of injustice, thought suicide a legitimate exit from the spectacle of cosmic wretched ness, and dared suspect that God and Satan were only emana tions of the thinker. In fine, he was a God-struggler, too much a "child of unfaith," as Janko Lavrin says of Dostoevsky, to believe fully in God or Satan. Satan was the most dynamic and meaningful figure in the new trinity. In comparison to him God simply wasn't good enough and the Creator wasn't definite enough to fill a mortal's religio philosophic life. I shall trace in some detail the rehabilitation of Satan, as he ascends from the position of terrifying devil to that of Clemens' and the Creator's alter ego. The news of the real Injun Joe's death reached Sam Clemens accompanied by nocturnal thunder, lightning, and deluge. Dur ing that wild summer rumpus, as church and local lore made unhappily clear, Satan had come in his spectacular way to hale a great sinner to the nether world. In "mortal terror" over his own "lost condition," poor Sam repented his many sins, ener getically resolved to do better, and supplicated for "just one more chance." But Satan was almost immediately to appear in a different—and more appealing—light. A Hannibal boy was expelled from Sunday School as beyond control. When he dis appeared from town, it was rumored that he had been snatched away by the devil at flight. Then, after a long time, he turned up as a glorious small functionary on a steamboat. Thus the "notoriously worldly" scapegrace, the devil's own, gained</page><page sequence="16">THE DEVIL AND SAMUEL CLEMENS 597 eminence, whereas Sam Clemens was punished for his ortho doxy by "obscurity and misery." This "shook the bottom" out of Sam's religious teachings—as well it might. Although the devil of Negro slaves and white churchgoers in Hannibal remained frightful, he became an object of con cerned pity in the Clemens household. Sam's mother, like Robert Burns in "Address to the Deil," unconsciously fol lowed in the footsteps of Origen and St. Thomas Aquinas in conjecturing that Auld Nickie-Ben might still have a chance of amnesty: "I'm wae to think upo' yon den, Ev'n for your sake!" She asserted that, although "wicked and abandoned," Satan was but a sinner among sinners. As such he had been treated most unfairly. Despite the irrefutable fact that he was "our one fellow and brother . . . who had the highest and clearest right to every Christian's daily and nightly prayers," no petitions ascended to the heavenly throne for him. Later, in "Concerning the Jews," her son, being no great hand at pray ers, imagined himself a literary man of law presenting Satan's case: I have no special regard for Satan; but I can at least claim that I have no prejudice against him. It may even be that I lean a little his way, on account of his not having a fair show. All religions issue bibles against him, but we never hear his side. We have none but the evidence for the prosecution, and yet we have rendered the verdict. To my mind, this is irregular ... Of course Satan has some kind of a case, it goes without saying. It may be a poor one, but that is nothing; that can be said about any of us. As soon as I can get at the facts I will undertake his rehabilitation myself, if I can find an unpolitic publisher. It is a thing which we ought to be willing to do for any one who is under a cloud. In "Is Shakespeare Dead?" after linking the Bard and Satan as "the two Great Unknowns," Clemens launches into a fabu lous account of his own very precocious collecting of data about the Arch Enemy. Insisting that his Sunday School teacher, a stone mason, supply him with materials for a biography of Satan, the child prodigy was rebuffed because of his irreverent, even flippant, attitude. Actually, Sam felt "the highest respect</page><page sequence="17">598 THE VIRGINIA QUARTERLY REVIEW for Satan" and had no desire to scoff at him; instead, his attack was to be directed against "the Satanic Traditioners." Despite his teacher's horror of this even greater sacrilege, attention craving Sam wrote the life at the age of seven and forever lost the entrée to respectable homes. Milton aided in the formation of Samuel Clemens' idea of Satan. In the ringing lines of "Paradise Lost," the proud Arch angel displays very impressive originality and "go," for which heaven afforded no expression, because a heartless, stuffed-shirt autocrat demanded an unvarying celestial routine. Urged on by a natural desire for prestige, Satan rebelled and was rusticated like Italo Balbo to a Dark Continent. Once in his new realm ("Better to reign in hell, than serve in heav'n"), he showed how the burden of sin and guilt could be defiantly borne or courageously ignored. Milton's "fall'n Cherub" gives birth to Sin, cohabits with her, and sires Death. In "Eve Speaks," Satan comments that the Moral Sense at least brought death, which would one day seem good to Adam and Eve. In less serious vein, Clemens recalled Milton's allegory when he named two black cats Satan and Sin. To Clemens,, who felt no reluctance about reinterpreting Milton, the obvious leader in a crusade against the Moral Sense (or sin) was Satan, whom he began to reinstate with humorous verve. By shuffling assorted personages, he took Satan out of the company of imps and master devils. Thus he could venture the opinion that Huck's character "is no better than those of Solomon, David, Satan, and the rest of the sacred brotherhood." He early docked Satan's silly tail and tricked him out like the operatic Mephistopheles, even adding a body of radium and a skin of polonium in order to make him as modern and scientific as the Curies. Clemens wrote several friendly letters to Satan, an interview with his nether majesty, and early drafts of the adventures of that worthy's celestial nephew—all unpublished. "A Humane Word from Satan" was conveyed by human agency to the readers of Harper's Weekly. In his "Notebook" of May 27, 1898, and in "Concerning the Jews," Clemens re</page><page sequence="18">THE DEVIL AND SAMUEL CLEMENS 599 quests respect for Satan's lofty executive abilities as "spiritual head of four-fifths of the human race, and political head of the whole of it I would like to see him ... and shake him by the tail." Ignoring the faux pas of allowing the tail to grow back, he hopefully attempted in published "Letters to Satan" to lure his tropical highness out of a three-century retirement for "a pleasure tour through the world in person, instead of doing it by proxy through me. You have many friends in the world; more than you think." As the Mysterious Stranger, Satan does visit the world in the guiltless person of his nephew. The Creator type brought back from infinite space and slightly humanized, he is also Samuel Clemens in eloquent defense of determinism, innocence, and solipsism. The composite picture sketched in all of Clemens' writings is that of a being who is less transstellar than the Crea tor and less hardhearted than God; Satan emerges as God of This World, a truly daring, free, and inquisitive spirit in op position to factitious theologies and illusory realities. As for a god of evil called Satan, the monstrosity never existed. After several thousand years, "our fine race" has been convinced "that there is no such thing as a witch ... no such person as Satan," no such place as hell. The American's laudation of his own par ticular Satan contains a suggestion of Canon Docre's worship of Satan in Huysmans' "Là Bas" as a reasonable and just god, "King of the Disinherited, Son who an to overthrow the in exorable Father!" But Clemens' paradoxes arise from partially frustrated love of humanity; Canon Docre's, from warped egotism and sadistic hatred. In the nineteenth century, Clemens' regard for Satan is more akin to that for the honest, "progres sive, inquiring," democratic "Bon Diable" of popular fancy described in his friend Moncure D. Conway's "Demonology and Devil-Lore," and it is most akin to that expressed by Jules Michelet in "La Sorcière." The French historian finds Satan, after being "unjustly driven out of Heaven," occupying him self in this world as a champion of reason, compassion, liberty, science, and progress against human and divine authoritarians:</page><page sequence="19">600 THE VIRGINIA QUARTERLY REVIEW "We are bound to pay him homage, to admit he may well be after all one of the aspects of God." VI While he was doing a workmanlike job of setting Satan on his feet, Samuel Clemens did not neglect Satan's own,—Negroes, heathens, witches, and the daughters of Eve. Just as he resented the tyranny of God in the macrocosm, so did he cry out against oppression in the microcosm. His sympathy flowed forth to Negro slaves. The "nigger trader" who bought his merchandise in Missouri for consumption on Southern plantations was a "human devil" conveying mortals to hell. Every humiliating aspect of slavery revolted Clemens, but his quintessential fury was concentrated against the supreme brutality of lynching. In "The United States of Lyncherdom," he speaks of lawless executions as increasing until they are almost an American mania. The secret places of every community's heart foster a "deep disapproval of lynching," but eagerness to imitate ring leaders and lack of moral courage keep it suppressed. Men of spirit are needed to form better mores. The reasoning is the same that Satan uses in "The Mysterious Stranger" to explain the witch mania in sixteenth-century Austria. In both essay and novel, the Moral Sense, from which the other animals are of course free, is arraigned. Whether the person being hanged, stoned, or burned was a Negro or a supposed witch, Clemens saw the same sheepish malice at work, and horror filled his soul. Lynching represented the acme of modern cruelty to Cle mens' mind, and witchcraft persecution that of feudal and Renaissance times. The link between the two was perhaps the Maid of Orleans and not the Hannibal slaves' witch-voodoo lore which Bernard De Voto describes with great insight in "Mark Twain's America." The slaves' narrative stressed the processes of witchcraft, not the mob violence they aroused. As a boy in Hannibal, Sam Clemens read the martyrdom of Joan of Arc and became a lifelong partisan, idealizing her as per sistently as he did Olivia Langdon. In deciding whether Joan</page><page sequence="20">THE DEVIL AND SAMUEL CLEMENS 601 was commissioned of God or of Satan, English and Burgundian Catholics gave credit to the latter, accusing the peasant girl of reverencing not saints "but devils in disguise" and of doing homage to the Arch Fiend. Thus she was burned at the stake as a witch, "the very child of Satan." The reader of "Personal Recollections of Joan of Arc" finds himself emotionally in volved with the author in the cause of Joan against her Christian accusers; if godly men can do such wrong to the most extraor dinary person in the world, then welcome, Satan, as an ally! The seven long narratives, the autobiography, and the two travel books in which Clemens introduces witchcraft associate persecution chiefly with England, France, and Austria. The classic witchcraft hysteria of Salem, Massachusetts, seems to have interested him only slightly, although he did write this note in his copy of Cotton Mather's "Magnalia Christi Amer icana": "The wise man of one age is the idiot of the next." Samuel Clemens also abominated the forcible Christianizing of the heathen—the Blessings-of-Civilization Trust's moving in on "the person sitting in darkness." But whether he was wrought up over a converted Moro, a rabbled witch, or a hanged Negro, he was tempted to gloat over these outrages as irrefutable proofs that the human race was utterly brutal, damned, and depraved. Fortunately for Clemens' sanity, humanity fell into two cate gories—the lifebearing, nourishing, protective female, and the competitive, grasping, destructive male. The distinction is least unfavorable to man in "Adam's Diary," for the hero, though unimaginative, blundering, and comical, is not actively mali cious. In "Eve's Diary," the first mother, like Sam's Jane and Olivia Clemens, is inquisitive, resourceful, loving, and pathet ically victimized by uncontrollable forces. Scorning those forked radishes misnamed lords of creation and feeling that his mother, wife, and daughters had been much kinder to him than his fallen nature deserved, Clemens was misanthropically dis appointed in Adam, father, self, and mankind at the same time that he idealized Eve, mother, wife, and womankind. With Byron he "despised the human race because he despised him</page><page sequence="21">602 THE VIRGINIA QUARTERLY REVIEW self. I feel as Byron did, and for the same reason." Maddening knowledge of one sex was balanced by reassuring ignorance of the other sex. As the knightly champion of injured woman kind, Clemens broke a lance "In Defense of Harriet Shelley," stood up for Joan of Arc, and became almost hysterical over Mrs. Minor Morris' mistreatment in Teddy's White House. Like Jonathan Swift, Clemens populated his Lilliputs chiefly with men. VII In the psychic malaise induced by a sense of guilt, Samuel Clemens tried to gain control of the consciousness of sin by understanding his own experience, by penetrating the meaning of Biblical mythology and revising myth in the light of his own knowledge of psychology and the accursed Moral Sense, and by creating a neo-trinitarian theology. He exchanged the customary functions of God and Satan and entered into defenses of Satan's supposed allies on earth,—the black man, the witch, the misbeliever, and the weaker vessel. Additional evidences of one of the most fertile neuroses a genius ever fostered are Clemens' incessant narcotic activity of composition, reading, billiards, and engagements; blind dependence on the Moral Sense of others; occasionally ostentatious shouldering of his burden, followed by assertions of unworthiness; disclaimers of responsibility; conjectures as to God's responsibility and the Creator's indifference; emphasis on man's insignificance in rela tion to the immensities of space and time; attacks on business cheats and verminous mankind in general, with a suggestion for exterminating the pest by shutting off the supply of oxygen; compensatory hero-worship (General Grant) and elation over his own power, prestige, and wealth; and a fixation on "kind, benignant" death, suicide, and madness. Bernard De Voto comments on the Clemens domestic tragedies in "Mark Twain at Work": "He walked the narrow edge between sanity and madness." And Clemens, in his own "Notebook," observed: "When we remember that we are all</page><page sequence="22">THE DEVIL AND SAMUEL CLEMENS 603 mad, the mysteries disappear and life stands explained." But interpreting life as nothing more than a bedlamite's vision did not satisfy Sam Clemens as long as it did Luigi Pirandello. A much more pleasing fancy was that, as Calderon expresses it in the title of a play, "Life Is a Dream." Pater, Schopenhauer, and Pascal fondled the same idea, which achieved classic utter ance in lines which Clemens quotes in "Is Shakespeare Dead?": "We are such stuff As dreams are made on, and our little life Is rounded with a sleep." Clemens' final statement on dream philosophy is supposed to be pronounced by Satan, whose incognito is Philip Traum or Dream, in "The Mysterious Stranger": Life itself is only a vision, a dream Strange, infixed, that you should not have suspected that your universe and its contents were only dreams, visions, fiction! Strange, because they are so frankly and hysterically insane—like all dreams: a God ... who created man with out invitation, then tries to snuffle the responsibility for man's acts upon man, instead of honorably placing it where it belongs, upon him self; and finally, with altogether divine obtuseness, invites this poor, abused slave to worship him! . . . There is no God, no universe, no human race, no earthly life, no heaven, no hell. . . . Nothing exists but you. And you are but a thought—a vagrant thought, a useless thought, a homeless thought, wandering forlorn among the empty eternities! Having dethroned God and exalted Satan as a necessitarian, anti-Moral Sense divinity, Clemens then called on Satan to abdicate. But the abdication speech is not actually Clemens' final word on dreams. It is rather one of his final words, for he liked to have two such words—a hopeful and a hopeless one. Much of his unpublished work has to do with the relativity of reality, the transcending of illusions like time and space, and the confusion of dream and waking. In "The Great Dark," the vindictive Superintendent of Dreams plants in ship passengers' minds a doubt of waking reality and a belief in dreams. The whole voyage, in fact, is a vision in which the malevolence and purposelessness of life are projected into a brief, intense night mare. The boundary is traced more distinctly and more cheer</page><page sequence="23">604 THE VIRGINIA QUARTERLY REVIEW fully in Clemens' "Notebook" jotting of January 7, 1897. In dreams his "unhampered spiritualized body flies to the ends of the earth in a millionth of a second. Seems to—and I believe, does. ... It was not a dream—it all happened. I was actually there in person—in my spiritualized condition." To the ques tion of dreams being conterminous with mortality comes the heartening answer: "When my physical body dies my dream body will doubtless continue its excursion and activities with out change, forever." Thus immortality, one of the egotistic values of orthodoxy which Clemens had scrapped because of reason, antagonism to God, and conviction of the Creator's lack of interest, was regained through dreams. In these thoughts Clemens agrees with other dream sages. Henry Holt advances similar theories in "On the Cosmic Relations": The dream has claims to be considered part of an eternal life.... Most savages, and not a few savants, think the soul actually does go to the place where, in dreams, it seems to go. . . . The dream life contains so much more beauty, so much fuller emotion, and such wider reaches than the waking life, that one is tempted to regard it as the real life, to which the waking life is somehow a necessary preliminary. So orthodox be lievers regard the life after death as the real life.... For one, I would infinitely prefer my dream life to any fancied heaven I know of. The companion piece to "The Mysterious Stranger," steeped as it is in pessimism, is the optimistic, autobiographical narra tive, "My Platonic Sweetheart," both of which were conceived in Austria in 1897-1898. The shorter tale covers the years 1854 1898, in which on an average of once every two years, a spirit ually changeless girl of fifteen met and loved the author, an invariable seventeen, in his dreams. The "Notebook" also em phasizes the Peter Pan nature of Sam Clemens' dream self: "I was never old in a dream yet." "My Platonic Sweetheart" presents this wistful sketch of a faith: In our dreams—I know it!—we do make the journeys we seem to make; we do see the things we seem to see; the people ... are real, not chimeras; they are living spirits, not shadows; and they are immortal and</page><page sequence="24">THE DEVIL AND SAMUEL CLEMENS 605 indestructible. They go whither they will; they visit . . . even the twinkling suns that wander in the wastes of space. . . . When we die we shall slough off this cheap intellect, perhaps, and go abroad into Dreamland clothed in our real selves, and aggrandized and enriched by the command over the mysterious mental magician who is here not our slave, but only our guest. Being a unique solipsist had become a bore to Clemens, just as Byron felt out of sorts until he created the Byronic heroine. The author and his platonic sweetheart, both equally real, existed in a paradise of uninhibited innocence resembling that of "Paul and Virginia." And again a dream philosopher is on Clemens' side, this time Hornell Hart: "It has been shown that a person may create a more or less elaborate dream-world of his own, and that by telepathy he can share to a greater or less extent the dream-creations of others." An advantage of dreams which Clemens does not discuss is that they emancipate the sleeper from the Moral Sense. In "A Chapter on Dreams," Robert Louis Stevenson tells how his Brownies brought him scenes of "Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde" in his sleep: "My Brownies have not a rudiment of what we call a conscience." Sam's close friend, William Dean Howells, discussed the subject in "Impressions and Experiences": The dreamer is purely unmoral—good and bad are the same to his conscience; he has no more to do with right and wrong than the ani mals; he is reduced to the state of the merely natural man; and perhaps the primitive men were really like what we are all now in our dreams. Howells conjectures that our waking consciousness is "the offspring of conscience" and that dreams show us "what we would be without our souls, without their supernal criticism of the mind." To Howells the mind was without pity or remorse in dreams; to Clemens it was reinstated in its kingdom of sinless ness, for it was the supernal heckling of the soul that made waking life seem intolerable to him. Because that unjust intru sion, the Moral Sense, made us inferior to other animals and because the mind was evolved to pick over, choose and reject,</page><page sequence="25">606 THE VIRGINIA QUARTERLY REVIEW and ceaselessly regret decisions presented by the Moral Sense, Clemens reveled in the impulsive, guiltless realm of dreams. It was one of his tragedies that his subconscious mind also stocked morbid, harassing dreams. For the most part, however, dreams, in releasing Sam Clemens from the nightmare of life and from dependence on a deity, fitfully restored him to the true state of man before the fall. VIII Janko Lavrin speaks of the "Promethean love of humanity" which compelled Dostoevsky and his fictional God-strugglers to demand an accounting even from God for man's suffering. There was much of the Titan in Samuel Clemens. A Prome thean protest against human limitations issued constantly from his lips. He was chained to a rock no less by the irreconcilability of his simple ideals and his complex wants than by man-made codes. The dread witnessing of his own and other men's torment was like a vulture tearing at his liver, which miraculously re newed itself until the punishment of rebellion survived the will to live. His works, like Prometheus' useful arts, have been a boon to mankind. Through his personality, his Huck, Tom, and Satan, and his dreams, Samuel Clemens has at last been loosed from the rock to become a Prometheus Unbound, admonishing the generations with Voltaire, "Cast off all super stition, and be more humane."</page></plain_text>
