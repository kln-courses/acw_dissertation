<plain_text><page sequence="1">Epistemology and Exchange: Marx, Nietzsche, and Critical Theory* by Nancy S. Love Jurgen Habermas argues that critical theorists' analyses ofthe dialectic of enlightenment contain a performative contradiction. By identifying reason with repression, they undermine the foundations of their own cri- tique.' Habermas traces this performative contradiction to Friedrich Nietzsche's influence upon critical theory, but a significant gap appears in his analysis of it.2 Habermas argues that Adorno, by associating identity with exchange, extends Marx's critique of political economy to instrumental reason. He also maintains that Adorno adopts this Marxian critique too hastily, neglecting its instrumental biases.

By critical theorists, I refer to first generation members of the Institute for Social Research. Since my primary concern is epistemology, I focus upon Theodor Adorno's negative dialectics. I also consider his collaborative work with Max Horkheimer. For gen- eral discussions of their relationship see: Susan Buck-Morss, The Origins ofNegative Dialec- tics: Theodor Adorno, Walter Benjamin, and the Frankfurt Institute (New York: The Free Press, 1977); David Held, An Introduction to Critical Theory (Berkeley: University of California Press, 1984); MartinJay, The Dialectical Imagination: A History ofthe Frankfurt School and the In- stitutefor SocialResearch, 1923-1950 (Boston: Little, Brown, and Co., 1973). More specific discussions of Nietzsche's influence upon critical theory appear in Mar- tin Jay, Marxism and Totality: The Adventures of a Concept from Lukdcs to Habermas (Berkeley: University of California Press, 1984); James Miller, "Some Implications of Nietzsche's Thought for Marxism," Telos 37 (Fall 1978); Peter Piutz, "Nietzsche and Critical Theory," Telos 50 (Winter 1981-82): 103-114; Gillian Rose, The Melancholy Science: An Introduction to the Thought ofTheodorAdorno (New York: Columbia University Press, 1978). OnlyJay, who sug- gests that Adorno and Horkheimer's analysis of exchange in the Dialectic ofEnlightenment is drawn as much from Nietzsche's Genealogy of Morals as Marx's Capital, discusses Nie- tzsche's exchange principle (The Dialectical Imagination, 259). For a more complete examination of contradictions between Marx and Nietzsche themselves, see my Marx, Nietzsche, and Modernity (New York: Columbia University Press, 1986). 7'</page><page sequence="2">72 Epistemology and Exchange Adorno, aware of those biases, complements Marx's economic with Nie- tzsche's psychological critique of exchange. It is this Nietzschean ex- change principle which Habermas ignores.3 In this article I examine how Marxian and Nietzschean exchange principles interact in critical theory, where they diverge and converge, and why they simultaneously suggest and subvert such syntheses. I argue that Habermas has identified a performative contradiction between Marxian and Nietzschean principles of exchange. By including Nie- tzschean exchange in critical theorists' genealogy, I clarify the conse- quences of this contradiction. I portray critical theorists' epistemological skeptism and political solipsism as products of logic as well as history. This supports Habermas' argument that another response to modern society is possible. Yet Nietzsche's exchange principle also reveals the limitations of Habermas' alternative and the need for a more radical re- construction of rationality. The Contextfor Critical Theory The performative contradiction Habermas identifies in critical theory involves logic, but it originates in history. It is critical theorists' response to the continued existence of capitalism and a series of socialist catastro- phes. In "The Authoritarian State," Max Horkheimer describes the problem history poses for critical theorists: "Despite pious references to the Hegelian logic of leaps and reversals, transformation appeared essentially as an extension of scale."4 Economic, political and psy- chological transformations have thwarted and deformed socialist revolutions. Economically, the material preconditions Marx required for so- cialism already exist. However, in the West, state planning has controlled the business cycles which were to precipitate revolution. Eastern economic plans have also increased, not decreased repression. State capitalist and state socialist experiences suggest that Marx's theory of revolution conflates two distinct stages: the imposition of state economic control and the liberation from it. The former may inevitably occur, but 3. Jiurgen Habermas, Philosophical-Political Profiles (Cambridge: The MIT Press, 1985) 111. 4.

Domination has outlasted economic planning because instrumental rationality retards revolutionary will. Instrumental rationality objectifies life: it "recognizes no function other than the preparation of the object from mere sensory material in order to make it the matter of subjuga- tion" and it apprehends being "under the aspect of manufacture and administration."6 Economically, capitalism and socialism similarly objectify nature as matter, men as producers, and their interaction as products. Politically, state capitalism and state socialism transform market freedoms into administrative plans. Under the authoritarian state, capitalist or socialist, repression becomes an administrative necessity. Horkheimer says: "With each bit of planning completed, a bit of repression was originally supposed to become unnecessary. In- stead, more repression has developed in the administration of the plans."7 Potential opposition sources, e.g., trade unions and proletarian parties, become cogs in a bureaucratic machine. Even utopia follows the administrative structure. Lenin's dream that society will become a single office and a single factory with equality of labor and pay is a Weberian nightmare.8 In the authoritarian state, commodities and plans rule and "Men [are] conceived as objects, ifnecessarily as their own."" This self-objectification is the most insidious transformation which occurs. Critical theorists regard the subject itself as a psychological "object" prepared from "mere sensory matter." We are quite literal- ly subjected. However, according to Marcuse, liberalism at least defended individuality, the assertion of self against society. In con- trast, the technological society which has superceded it encourages compliance and adjustment. Instrumental rationality is internalized: "Individuals are stripped of their individuality, not by external compul- 5. Theodor Adorno, Negative Dialectics, trans. E. B.

Adorno and Horkheimer characterize the contradictory condition of modern man: "The submission of everything natural to the autocratic subject finally culminates in the mastery of the blindly objective and nat- ural."" With this, they transform Marx's dialectic of production into the dialectic ofenlightenment. What though does this transformation involve? Needless to say, Marx's conception of an inevitable, imminent revolution contains his- torical errors. But do those errors also call for reconsideration of Marxist theory? What is the relationship between practical and theoretical causes of our contemporary condition? Is Marxism implicated in the dialectic of enlightenment? How does critical theory stand with reference to the Marxian dialectic? Marx's Dialectical Materialism The primary problem for attempts to articulate critical theorists' rela- tionship to Marxism is their reluctance directly to attack Marx. Instead, they criticize humanistic and scientific Marxism. To make explicit their implicit critique of Marx, I examine his anthropological and anthropo- morphic tendencies. These tendencies link the so-called early and late, humanistic and scientific, Marx. My focus is epistemology, and this raises a second problem. In the effort to defend his materialism against its idealist adversaries, Marx neglected epistemology. Engels' later attempts to fill this void are, to say the least, controversial. Although I cannot explore their intellectual collaboration here, I address this problem by emphasizing passages where Marx, if only incidentally, corroborates Engels' views. I begin with Engels' famous question, "Are we able in our ideas and notion of the real world to produce a correct reflection of reality?," and his infamous an- swer: "Yes.''2 By examining the component parts of dialectical material- 10.

Love 75 ism, I demonstrate that Marx concurs with this answer and how this im- plicates him in the dialectic of enlightenment. As a materialist, Marx argues that a material world objectively exists, that is, exists independently of knowing subjects: "To say that man is a corporeal, living, real, sensuous, objective being full of natural vigor is to say that he has real, sensuous, objects as the objects of his being or of his life, or that he can only express his life in real, sensuous objects."'" Our thoughts reflect our sensory experience of this material world. Marx re- fers to ideas as "the material world reflected by the human mind and translated into forms of thought" and to ideology as the "reflex," "echo," or "sublimate" of material life.14 Although the objective existence of matter and the ability of our thoughts to reflect it are premises of dialectical materialism, Marx bypasses philosophical arguments to this effect. Dialectical materialism is a "real, positive science" where "real" and "positive" mean sensuous- ly ascertained: "This method of approach is not devoid of premises. It starts out from the real premises and does not abandon them for a moment. Its premises are men, not in any fantastic isolation and rigidi- ty, but in their actual, empirically perceptible process of development under definite conditions."'5 These premises of dialectical material- ism are to be neither understood nor defended abstractly. In fact, Marx argues that philosophical abstractions have no value independent of history.16 He rejects the Kantian (as Engels later rejects the neo- Kantian) incomprehensible "thing-in-itself," and the related dis- tinction between reality and appearances, practically not theoretical- ly. As Engels says, "If we are able to prove the correctness of our con- ception of a natural process by making it ourselves, bringing it into being out of its conditions and using it for our own purposes in the bargain, then there is an end of the Kantian incomprehensible 'thing-in- itself'."7 13.

Like the idealists they criticized, they are metaphysicians. Theirs is merely a metaphysics of matter, not mind. Engels characterizes a metaphysician: "For him a thing either exists or does not exist; a thing cannot at the same time be itself and some- thing else." Unlike metaphysicians, dialecticians "comprehend things and their representations, ideas, in their essential connection, concatenation, motion, origin, and ending."" Dialecticians explore how man's productive and conceptual relations to nature and socie- ty develop historically. They maintain that neither objects nor our conceptions of them are immutable. Marx's own critique of previous philosophical and social scientific concepts illustrates this development. Marx argues that Hegel (and presumably Kant) were the philosophers of political economy: "It is self-evident.., that "spectres," "bonds," "the higher being," "con- cept," "scruple," are merely the idealistic, spiritual expression, the conception apparently of the isolated individual, the image of the very empirical fetters and limitations, within which the mode of pro- duction of life and the form of intercourse coupled with it move."'9 Contemplative materialists analogously expressed the standpoint of civil society: they only substituted the domination of things for the domination of"Being."20 Political economy, these philosophers' so- cial scientific analogue, also has done "no more than interpret, sys- tematize, and defend in doctrinaire fashion the concepts of the agents of bourgeois production who are trapped in bourgeois pro- duction relations.''21 Socialist science takes a "new standpoint," that of' 'social humani- 18.

Although Engels develops the dialectics of nature and Marx focuses on man's dialectic with nature, Marx explicitly agrees that nature, like history, verifies dialectics. This should notbe surprising, since his premises require it. On the one hand, to declare that man imposes dialectical structure upon nature is to revert to an idealist metaphysics, to declare mind predomi- nant over matter. On the other hand, to declare nature undialectical is to revert to a mate- rialist one. Matter exists objectively, but not structured as objects.

Marx argues that capitalist class relations alienate men from their productive activity, their products, and their fellow men. Political economists objectify each aspect of this alienation in a corresponding commodity fetish. First, men are alienated from their productive activity. The reality here is that laborers sell their labor-power to capitalists who control whether or not and the conditions under which they may work. The corresponding commodity fetish is that all sorts of human labor have a quantitative equivalent form or exchange-value. This fetish ob- scures the qualitatively different social utility of various sorts of la- bor. Second, men are alienated from their products. The reality here is that private laborers produce, private capitalists appropriate, and all men exchange products. The corresponding commodity fetish is that, given the equality of all sorts of human labor, all products have a quantitative equivalent from or exchange-value equal to the labor- power required to produce them. This fetish obscures the qua- litatively different social use-value of various commodities. Third, men are alienated from their fellow men. The reality here is that men interact only in exchange. The corresponding commodity fetish is that "the mutual relations of the producers, within which the social character of their labour affirms itself, take the form of a social rela- tion between the products."23 This fetish obscures the social charac- ter of human labor. When Marx demystifies these fetishes of political economy by ex- posing their origins in capitalist class relations, his point is not that political economists - or their philosophical compatriots - fail to reflect reality. Theydo reflect it. More precisely, the appearances they portray are distortions only because reality is itself distorted. Their concepts are simply limited by their historical context. From a differ- ent, more advanced, standpoint scientific socialists transcend those limits. Yet socialist science only exposes, it does not overcome the diver- gence of appearance and reality in capitalist society. Although the so- cialist scientist understands commodity fetishes as distorted appear- ances of a distorted reality, those distortions persist. As G.A. Cohen 22. Marx, "Theses" numberten. 23. Marx, Capital 1: 72.</page><page sequence="8">78 Epistemology and Exchange expresses it, "Things do not seem different to a worker who knows Marxism. He knows they are different from what they continue to seem to be."24 As long as labor remains alienated, things will not be as they seem. This introduces another, more profound Marxian relation be- tween theory and practice. Man not only knows life through labor, and can thereby overcome the "incomprehensible thing-in-itself." Science also can only become true, reason can only correspond to reality, practically, that is, through the creation of a society where things are as they appear. This as I understand it is Marx's point in the second "Thesis on Feuerbach": "The question whether objective truth can be attributed to human thinking is not a question of thinking, but is apractical question. Man must prove the truth, i.e., the reality and power, the this-sidedness of his thinking in practice."25 For Marx, the interrelated material and mental separation of subject and object in capitalist society is cause for revolution not skepticism. Engels argues that what Marx calls the "pure- ly scholastic question of skepticism" actually signals incipient revolution: "The growing perception that existing social institutions are unreason- able and unjust, that reason has become unreason and right wrong, is only proof that in the modes of production and exchange changes have silently taken place with which the social order, adapted to earlier eco- nomic conditions, is no longer in keeping."'26 In a socialist society where subject and object correspond materially they will do so mentally as well. Appearances will no longer distort be- cause reality will no longer be distorted. For now, socialist science with its premises (matter and men) and its standpoint (social humanity) is needed to reveal the divergence of appearances from reality. However, after realizing its truth, science will become superfluous.27 The socialist negation of the negation is clearly a positive: "This communism..,. is the genuine resolution of the conflict between man and nature, and between man and man .... Communism is the riddle of history solved, and it 24. This discussion draws heavily upon G. A.

Clearly, they disagree with Marx on more than the immi- nence and inevitability of revolution. They attack the identity of objects, including the subject, with themselves and one another. Identity-think- ing is "productive and conceptual species-imperialism" typical of the dialectic of enlightenment.29 Such species-imperialism links the early and late, humanistic and scientific Marx. Since the charge of species-imperialism spans these standard divisions of Marxism, it is best examined in terms of his anthropological and anthropomorph- ic tendencies. Although Marx rejects Feuerbach's natural anthropology, he posits a self-proclaimed "historical anthropology" of social producers. Whether man's social "nature" is ultimately a"species-being" or an "ensemble of social relations," Adorno argues that the subsumption of empirically unique individuals under a collective social subject represses individual- ity.30 With this emphasis upon individuality, Adorno distances critical theory from proletariat and party; both are repressive collectivities. Adorno and Horkheimer also distance themselves from Marx's empha- sis upon our productive nature. "To make labor into a transcendent hu- man activity," says Horkheimer, "is an ascetic ideology .... In that so- cialists adhere to this general concept, they make themselves into carriers of capitalist propaganda."3' Only bourgeois ideologists portray labor as man's self-realization. Instead of production - a realm of necessity which persists in Marx's socialist society - critical theorists propose various forms of"purposive purposelessness."32 Production involves not only the anthropological objectification of humanity, but also man's anthropomorphic objectification of nature. An ontology of labor epitomizes this objectification: nature exists to be subjugated, to be made into products. Adorno argues that Marx's cri- 28. Marx, 1844 Manuscripts 84. 29.

He concludes that "If the alien were no longer ostracized, there hardly would be any more aliena- tion."33 Other Marxist concepts are equally anthropomorphic. Adorno criticizes "reification," in part, because it restricts dialectics to epi- phenomena, i.e., to symptoms, not causes, of human suffering. But he also argues that reification, like alienation, presents thingness as a "radi- cal evil" to be annexed by "philosophical imperialism."34 Attacking Marx's distinction between reality and appearance, Adorno also charac- terizes the "image" or "reflection" theory of knowledge as a materialist reversion to idealism, even barbarism.35 Productive and conceptual imperialism, anthropologism and anthro- pomorphism, converge in Marx's notion that practice proves the truth. As critical theorists read it, the "second thesis" reduces truth to power. This makes scientific socialism the extension, not the transcendence, of objectification. True revolutionary practice depends not upon scientific formula, but upon the intransigence of theory. In response to those who would characterize this position as left Hegelian, Adorno says, The call for unity of theory and practice has irresistibly de- graded theory to a servant's role, removing the very traits it should have brought to that unity. The visa stamp of practice which we demand of all theory becarrie a censor's placet. Yet whereas theory succumbed in the vaunted mixture, practice became nonconceptual, a piece of the politics it was supposed to lead out of; it became the prey of power. 36 He suggests that: The remaining theoretical inadequacies in Hegel and Marx became part of historical practice and can thus be newly re- flected upon in theory, instead of thought bowing irrationally to the primacy of practice. Practice itself was an eminently the- oretical concept.37 33. Adorno,Negative 172. 34. Ibid. 191. 35. Ibid. 205-207. 36. Ibid. 143. 37. Ibid. 144.</page><page sequence="11">Nancy S. Love 81 A concept, he implies, which uncritically reflected enlightenment reas- on. In accord with this analysis, critical theorists minimize not only humanistic (labor, alienation, and reification) but also scientific (produc- tion and reflection) Marxist categories. These categories, and Marx to the extent that he adheres to them, are implicated in the dialectic of enlight- enment. To transcend the theoretical limitations of Marxism they draw upon anew concept of exchange, that of Friedrich Nietzsche. Nietzsche's Genealogy ofMorals Although he is still often omitted from their genealogy, critical theo- rists turn to Nietzsche to transcend Marx's complicity in the dialectic of enlightenment. Adorno and Horkheimer praise Nietzsche as a merciless historian of the bourgeois ratio and base their critiques of it upon his concept of psychological exchange.38 In examining that exchange prin- ciple, I also focus upon Nietzsche's epistemology, exploring its material- ist and dialectical aspects. This strategy allows me to demonstrate why critical theorists think Nietzsche can complement Marx. Nietzsche criticized materialism, but he was still fundamentally a materialist. Like Marx, he maintains that a material world exists in- dependently of knowing subjects. But he differs from other materialists, including Marx, in his conception of that material world and man's place in it. What Nietzsche criticizes is materialist atomism which he mistakes for materialism itself."9 He argues that materialist atomists, like the idealists they criticize, are metaphysicians. In their search for "reality" they merely descend to things rather than ascend to being. Contrary to both, Nietzsche asks us to "Suppose nothing else were 'given' as real except our world of desires and passions, and we could not get down, 38. Adorno and Horkheimer 119. 39. Nietzsche equated materialism and atomism in the following passage: "As for materialist atomism, it is one of the best refuted theories there are... thanks chiefly to the Dalmatian Boscovich... Boscovich has taught us to abjure the belief in the last part of the earth that'stood fast' the belief in 'substance,' in 'matter,' in the earth-residuum and par- ticle-atom: it is the greatest triumph over the senses that has been gained on earth so far." (Nietzsche, Beyond Good and Evil, aphorism #12). Elsewhere, he probes the "rudimentary psychology" the faith in the ego as cause residual in the atom.

One has to risk the hypothesis whether will does not affect will wherever 'effects' are recognized - and whether all me- chanical occurences are not, insofar as force is active in them, will force, effects ofwi 11.41 With this concept of matter, Nietzsche reveals that he is also a dialectician, despite his critique of dialectics.42 His dialectic is simply more radical than those - again, Marx's among them - which he crit- icizes. Marx also rejects materialist atomism (he calls it empiricism) and argues that neither subjects nor objects are entities. Yet for Marx, boundaries between man and nature, man and man persist. Socialist production and socialist science as negations of the negation presume the existence of opposition and the need to master it. Mastering oppo- sition, according to Nietzsche, differs from transcending it. His world as will to power has no boundaries to be mastered. Man as a subject is not related to objects, even in Marx's dialectical sense, but only to other congelations of force: "The subject alone is demonstrable; hypothesis that only subjects exist - that 'object' is only a kind of effect produced by a subject upon a subject - a modus of the subject."'4 Even the subject does not exist as an entity. Nietzsche de- scribes the subject as "no subject, but an action, a positing, creative, no 40. Friedrich Nietzsche, Beyond Good and Evil, Basic Writings ofNietzsche, translated by Walter Kaufmann (New York: Random House, 1966), aphorism #36. Nietzsche explicit- ly distinguishes his monist materialism from idealism: We are to see the world "not as a deception, as 'mere appearance,' an 'idea' (in the sense of Berkeley and Schopenhauer) but as holding the same rank of reality as our affect as a more primitive form of the world of affects in which everything still lies contained in a powerful unity before it undergoes ramifications and developments in the organic process." I should note that Nietzsche can consistently espouse materialism and skepticism. The distinction between material- ist and idealist ontologies must not be confused with that between skeptical and realist epistemologies. For example, Kant and Hume belong together as skeptics, whereas Hegel and Engels belong together as realists. 41. Nietzsche, Beyond Good and Evil, aphorism #36. 42. What Nietzsche criticizes and understands as dialecticsperse is a dialectic of reas- on. (See: Twilight ofthe Idols, 476-479). This target he shares to some extent with Marx: both deny that reason determines reality. Further, neither precludes the adoption ofa differ- ent, both would probably say de-mystified, hypothesis that history is dialectically or- dered by man's tendency to expand his creative - producing or willing - powers. 43.

The subject is merely an ordered plurality of drives which discharges its will in relation to other such pluralities: "No things remain but only dynamic quanta, in a relation of tension to all other dynamic quanta: their essence lies in their relation to all other quanta, in their 'effect' upon the same."44 For Nietzsche, the notion of a world structured dialectically is profoundly undialectical; it is a con- tradiction in terms. A dialectical world is fundamentally chaotic: "The total character of the world..,. is in all eternity chaos - in the sense not of a lack of necessity but of a lack of order, arrangement, form, beauty, wisdom, and whatever other names there are for our aesthetic anthropomorphisms. "4" According to Nietzsche, subject, object, and their identity are aes- thetic anthropomorphisms which originate in a psychological ex- change coterminous with society and humanity. He argues that con- sciousness, the capacity which distinguishes humans from nature, re- sults from social repression. The "oldest state" was a "fearful tyranny" which "brought man to reason" by punishing him for disobeying social norms. The idea of punishment draws its power "in the contractual [ex- change] relation between creditor and debtor, which is as old as the idea of 'legal subjects,' and... points back to the fundamental forms of buying, selling, barter, trade, and traffic."' The original instinctual artists who formed man exchanged the creditor's psychological pleasure in inflict- ing physical pain for the debtor's infraction of the communal con- tract. Later, theologians and moralists spiritualized punishment; they replaced physical with psychic pain. The history of culture is the spiritualization of cruelty. Nietzsche regards Christianity as its culmi- nation: man now owes a debt (sin) to a creditor (God) which can never be repaid. Guilt, which also originates in the "very material concept of debts," is his torture. Needless to say, Nietzsche thinks humanity has been "dearly bought." When man became reasonable, he also became ascetic. Prevented by society from hurting others, he hurt himself. He internalized his instincts. It is the subject's imposed identity, its equivalence to an internalized communal contract, which man projects outward in attempts to make 44. Nietzsche, The WilltoPower, aphorism #635. 45.

Nietzsche argues that.once one sees the subject as a fiction many other realizations follow. With subject and ob- ject, the idea of their identity, indeed distinctions between truth and illu- sion, reality and appearance, disappear. It is only after the model of the subject that we have invented the reality of things and projected them into the medley of sen- sations. If we no longer believe in the effective subject, then belief also disappears in effective things .... At last the "thing- in-itself'" also disappears, because this is fundamentally the conception of a "subject-in-itself." But we have grasped that the subject is a fiction. The antithesis "thing-in-itself" and "appearance" is untenable; with that, however, the concept "appearance" also disappears.47 Subject, object, and their identity are fetishes of psychological ex- changes. Man has projected his self-denial outward, denying life as will to power. With his notion of psychological exchange, Nietzsche announces the death not only of God, but also of truth as man has known it. Theism and atheism, Christianity and science, rest on the same shaky foundation, "on the same overestimation of truth (more exactly on the same belief that truth is inestimable and cannot be criticized)."48 For although sci- entists demystify metaphysical truths, they retain a metaphysical faith in truth. They expose successive horizons as illusions, but leave man with a horizon - the value of truth - which presumes that the resulting world without truth is valueless. Their nihilism merely expresses a different pole of man's mistaken faith in truth: the Christian's heaven is true; the scientists' world is false. By showing the pyschological exchange in which truth originates, Nietzsche demystifies both poles. He says, "The categories aim, unity, being which we used to project some value into the world we pull out again; so the world looks valueless." And, he con- cludes: "Faith in the categories of reason is the cause of nihilism. We have measured the value of the world according to categories that refer to apurely fictitious world .... What we find here is still the hyperbolic naivete of man: positing himself as the meaning and measure of the value of things."49 47. Nietzsche, The WilltoPower, aphorism #552. 48.

Love 85 Since Christianity and science express ascetic psychology, liberation re- quires that both be overcome together. This Marx fails to do. With his concepts of subject, object, and their eventual identity, he continues to deny life and refuses to affirm the "innocence of becoming." Yet Nietzsche's alternative, his conception of life as will to power is equally, if differently, repressive. That conception contains two para- digms of power: power as recurring energy and power as domination.50 Critical theorists adopt the former paradigm to expose the origins of Marxian identity-thinking in psychological exchange, but they reject the latter paradigm as expressive of economic exchange. It is the bourgeoisie who posit a pre-social man, see society as an exchange, respond skeptically to truth, and counsel love of fate.5' Nietzsche is a profound critic of the bourgeois ratio, but he too conforms to it. According to Adorno, Nietzsche's philosophy is profoundly positivistic.52 Critical the- orists' task is to turn his reactionary argument against Western culture to- ward progressive enlightenment, to combine Nietzsche's psychological with Marx's economic critique of exchange. Epistemology, Exchange, and Critical Theory This combination of Marxian and Nietzschean exchange-principles appears in Adorno and Horkheimer's "primeval history of the subject," which links economic and psychological expressions of equivalence. Adorno tries to transcend those equivalences by establishing the non- identity of subjects and objects with themselves and one another. He ar- gues that transcending equivalence involves three related concerns: indi- viduality, particularity, and non-conceptuality. Adorno and Hork- heimer defend individuality by attacking subjectivity. They argue that historically "Men have always had to choose between their subjection to 50. Ofelia Schutte develops this distinction in her Beyond Nihilism: Nietzsche Without Masks (Chicago: University ofChicago Press, 1984). 51. For these criticisms of Nietzsche see: Dialectic of Enlightenment, 97-99; Minima Moralia, Aphorisms #59 #60 #61. 52. Adorno argues that Nietzsche ultimately is a positivist: "Nietzsche, the irreconci- lable adversary of our theoretical heritage in metaphysics, had ridiculed the difference between essence and appearance. He had relegated the 'background world' to the 'backwoodsman,' concurring here with all of positivism .... Ifa man rates all phenomena alike because he knows of no essence that would allow him to discriminate, he will in a fantasized love oftruth make common cause with untruth."

Yet in order to subject nature to themselves, men first had to differentiate themselves from it. Like Marx and Nietzsche, Adorno and Horkheimer claim that rationality distinguishes man from nature. But their analysis of its origins parallels Nietzsche's not Marx's. Adorno argues that rationality results from fear of society as well as nature. Individuals became subjects, i.e., they internalized social norms, to avoid ostracization and/or punish- ment. He claims that civilization was "unimaginably hard for people to bring themselves to undergo": "The instinctual energy of the homo economicus who lords it over the homo psychologicus is the compulsive love for what was once hated; it had to be hammered in.''54 Psychological and economic exchange coincide, and both are coterminous with hu- manity. Adorno and Horkheimer argue that the rationality with which man subjects external nature reveals his internal subjection. As concepts re- place the "primal cry" and objectify nature, so the "I" breaks the "im- mediacy of primary relations" and objectifies the self.s5 Adorno says that the "unity of consciousness" is itself "a reflection of the logical identi- ty."56 He concludes that consciousness not only creates subjects, it also destroys them, by making them objects.57 To escape this subjection, the ego must become the locus of social opposition not social oppression.5 This is the meaning of Adorno's assertion of individuality instead of sub- jectivity. Unlike subjects, individuals are not monads but pluralities of drives. They are "boundlessly elastic, subjectless subjects."59 Adorno argues that subjectivity denies particularity as well as individ- uality: "The superiority of objectification in the subjects, not only keeps them from becoming subjects; it equally prevents a cognition of objec- tivity."60 Idealists and materialists externalize the ego, projecting its 53.

Their respective concepts of being and things tyr- annize over reality and fail to reach it. Reality, contrary to their concep- tions of it, is incomplete, contradictory, and fragmented. Adorno says "While our images of perceived reality may very well be Gestalten, the world in which we live is not; it is constituted differently than out of mere images of perception."6' Unlike previous materialists, Adorno respects the concrete particular's non-identity with itself and his concepts. The particular is that which cannot be named: "The concept of the particular is always its negation at the same time; it cuts short what the particular is and what nonetheless cannot be directly named, and it replaces this with identity."62 He concludes that the liberated subject will also liberate ob- jects; he will be their agent, not their constituent. As the object's agent, Adorno is a dialectician as well as a materialist. But, again like Nietzsche, he would transcend dialectics dangerously undialectical structure.63 Non-conceptuality must replace the conceptu- al correspondence of subject and object. Adorno acknowledges the difficulties this creates: "We can see through the identity principle, but we cannot think without identifying."64 He concludes that dialecticians must "think against thought." "As thinking," he says, "dialectical logic respects that which is to be thought the object even where the object does not heed the rules of thinking."65 Dialectical thought respects objects by excluding ontological con- cepts, e.g., premises, standpoints, and positivity, and focusing instead upon "inner-historical complexes." Like ontological theorists, critical theorists distinguish between essence and existence, but in a profoundly different way. The former seek concealed or manifest intentions by posit- ing a metaphysical reality beneath or beyond phenomena. The latter in- terpret unintentional realities within phenomena themselves, creating a "nonmetaphysical metaphysics." Adorno describes his dialectical method, which he says Marx "largely" (an important qualification) shares, as immanent critique. Immanence illuminates essences by ex- posing "the contradiction between what things are and what they claim 61. Theodor Adorno, "The Actuality of Philosophy," trans.

Constellations reconstruct aphenomenon so that its essence becomes visible within it. Adorno ar- gues that "By themselves constellations represent from without what the concept has cut away within: the 'more' which the concept is equally desirous and incapable of being."'67 Because they transcend con- ceptualization, these "inner-historical complexes" represent a third possiblity beyond positivism and idealism.68 Adorno exemplifies this method in his critique of identity-thinking. Immanent critique reveals that the more the subject is objectified, the less it is constitutive. That rev- elation appears through the constellation of productive and conceptual exchange. According to critical theorists, individuality, particularity, and non- conceptuality avoid extending the "coercion of conscience" to the "realm of theory." These "concepts" allow their dialectic to transcend Marxian and Nietzschean limitations, to overcome economic and psy- chological exchange. Critical Contradictions We have seen that Marxian and Nietzschean exchange principles are incomplete and that each illuminates the other's limitations. A Marxian critique of Nietzsche exposes his denial of the identity, even the exist- ence, of subjects and objects as bourgeois. Nietzsche's skepticism may accurately express the real separation of subject and object (for critical theorists their disappearance) in capitalist society. Still Nietzsche, like political economists, mistakes this "given" reality of exchange relations among egoistic individuals for nature. Marx says, "For the bourgeois it is so much the easier to prove on the basis of his language, the identity of commercial and individual, or even universal, human relations, since this language itself is a product of the bourgeoisie, and therefore in actu- ality as in language the relations of buying and selling have been made the basis of all others."69 When Nietzsche rejects truth as equivalence, he 66.

Marx, The German Ideology 102.</page><page sequence="19">Nancy S. Love 89 also reinforces the bourgeois separation of subject and object. He denies that that separation and the suffering it causes can be overcome, and he accepts separation and suffering by affirming life. Unlike Nietzsche, Marx regards man's alienation under capitalism as an argument not against truth, but against alife which fails to conform to it. According to Nietzsche, this Marxian position is ascetic, an expression of the life-denying will to truth. Marx does demystify metaphysical truths, beings and things. But his concepts of subject, object, and their eventual identity under socialism still express a metaphysical faith in truth. Marx too has mistaken his "given" reality, psychological exchange relations among egoistic individuals, for nature. By denying life because it does not conform to truth, Marx reinforces man's psychological re- pression. He creates a new secular "will to nothingness." Nietzsche says of scientific socialism: "In summa: one has tranferred the arrival of the 'kingdom of God' into the future, on earth, in human form but funda- mentally one has held fast to the belief in the old ideal."'7 Unlike Marx, Nietzsche regards man's ascetic psychological sickness as an argument not against life, but against truth which denies it. The mutual limitations of Marx's and Nietzsche's exchange principles suggest that syntheses of them might transcend economic and psycho- logical oppression. Yet this mutual critique shows what subverts such syntheses. Marx and Nietzsche each succumb to the exchange relation which the other attacks: Marx criticizes capitalist economics from an as- cetic psychological perspective; Nietzsche criticizes ascetic psychology from a capitalist economic one. Their perspectives contradict, not com- plement, one another, and this is not a dialectical contradiction. Combi- nations of their critiques illuminate, but do not obviate, this contradic- tion. They end in schizophrenia, not synthesis. The contradiction between Marxian and Nietzschean exchange prin- ciples appears in critical theorists' insistence that subject and object are separated both historically and ontologically. Adorno expresses both positions in the following quotation: "The subject erects that block [be- tween subject and object] by claiming supremacy over the object and thereby defrauding itself of the object. As truly non-identical, the object moves the farther from the subject the more the subject constitutes the object.))71 70. Nietzsche, The WilltoPower, Aphorism #339. 71. Adorno, "Subject and Object," in The Essential Frankfurt School Reader 507.</page><page sequence="20">90 Epistemology and Exchange Adorno's insistence that subject and object are only separated histori- cally is ascetic: he continues to deny life for truth. Along these lines, Adorno argues that associating his critique of identity with irrationalism is "horrid sophistry."72 Thought is currently a commodity, but ultimate- ly it is inseparable from freedom. When Adorno associates rationality and freedom, he abandons Nietzsche for Kant. He claims that Nie- tzsche's merciless exposure of the identity of domination and reason "implicitly liberates from its hiding place the utopia contained in the Kantian notion of reason as in every great philosophy: the utopia of a hu- manity which, itself no longer distorted, has no further need to dis- tort."73 Adomno acknowledges the question he raises here: Do critical theorists have a hidden conception of Being? But he refuses to answer, maintaining only that such a conception of Being is unnecessary to criti- cal theory.'7 If such a conception is present, it represents a reversion to species-imperialism. If a conception of being is absent, if subject and object are "truly non- identical," Adorno becomes bourgeois. He also acknowledges this ob- jection to critical theory. Some he says will accuse him of "unfruitful negativity."''75 This accusation arises because Adorno's attack upon iden- tity involves more than a critique of commodity exchange. Negative dia- lectics, as Adorno describes it, is a critique of"constitutive consciousness itself."'76 But, if rationality and society are repressive, then only the speechless solipsist is free. Adorno does argue that the isolated individ- ual now perceives reality better than a functional collective does. He also says that direct communication is no longer a criterion of truth. Since concepts establish equivalences, the isolated individual's freedom can- not be communicated. Adorno criticizes even proletarian writing for codifying oppression, and characterizes writing, now that demy- thologization has destroyed language, as a Sisyphean task.77 Adorno 72.

Love 91 knows that he has assumed a privileged position beyond society: "Criti- cal privelege becomes a privilege the world's course is as dialectical as that."78 But he adopts this "position" not entirely with a bad conscience. He maintains that his intransigent theory serves a true collective, though he literally cannot say how. Critical theorists leave this contradiction between Marxian and Nietzschean exchange principles unresolved. To the charge of "un- fruitful negativity," Adorno responds "it is history which retards the movement of thought to its presuppositions."79 History forces critical theorists simultaneously to maintain the necessity and deny the possibil- ity of a rational society. Yet might this contradiction be product of logic as well as history. Critical theorists cannot choose Marx or Nietzsche; both are implicated in exchange. Nor can they combine Marx and Nietzsche; inadequate alone, together they are incoherent. But are these the only al- ternatives? Are they even alternatives, or do they share a certain logic? By questioning these alternatives, Habermas claims to find a way out of this cul-de-sac. Critical theorists cannot go forward, but they can go back. They can retrace their steps and search for another path.so Adorno and Horkheimer do not, as Habermas argues, hastily overextend Marx's ex- change principle. But they do proceed hastily from Marx to Nietzsche, from uncritical acceptance of instrumental rationality to uncompromising rejection of rationality as instrumental. Both responses follow the same logic, both are steps along the path of instrumental rationality. Both miss another, more promising path - that of communicative rationality. I cannot adequately examine Habermas' concept of communicative rationality, his alternative to the dialectic of enlightenment, here. I have a more limited purpose. To conclude, I want to show how this analysis of Marx, Nietzsche, and critical theory clarifies the problem Habermas con- fronts: his reconstructed rationality must transcend psychological as well as economic exchange. I also want to suggest that Nietzsche's exchange prin- ciple reveals a potential limitation of Habermas' solution. If productive and administrative systems are adequately anchored in a communicatively rationalized life-world, then Habermas may provide an alternative to economic exchange." My concern is whether communica- 78.

Habermas argues that the dialectic of enlightenment reveals "coercive relationships of sys- tematically distorted communication."82 However Adorno, by refusing to ground critical theory, conceals the concept of non-coercive communica- tion upon which this revelation rests. Traces of communicative rationality nonetheless appear in Adorno's philosophy, specifically, in his concept of reconciliation. According to Habermas, reconciliation "has the structure of a life together in communication that is free from coercion."83 Habermas argues that this life is anticipated in speech whenever we try to speak the truth: "Critique lays claim to no more than what is implied in everyday discourse, but also to no less."s4 Habermas' ideal speech situa- tion clarifies the pragmatic presuppositions of speech, the criteria for non- coercive communication. Communicative ra-tionality requires "inter- subjective symmetry" in "assertion and dispute, revelation and conceal- ment, prescription and conformity." Habermas refers to these three symmetries as "a linguistic conceptualization of what are traditionally known as the ideas of truth, freedom, and justice.''"85 But are these presuppositions of speech adequate foundations for criti- cal theory? And is symmetrical intersubjectivity an adequate image of non- coercive communication? Although Nietzsche's analysis of psychological exchange is too radical, it does suggest that Habermas' alternative isn't rad- ical enough.86 Symmetrical intersubjectivity establishes equivalences be- tween individuals. An instructive parallel appears here between proletari- an dictatorship and ideal speech. They represent realizations, economic and psychological, respectively, of exchange.

I want, then, to distinguish my criticisms of symmetrical intersubjectivity from poststructuralists' Nietzschean-inspired attempts to abolish subjectivity. Those attempts manifest the same performative contradiction as critical theory. Poststructuralists, how- ever, address this paradox of total critique rather differently: they affirm a pluralism of meanings and powers. Habermas has argued that poststructuralists' use of Nietzsche has conservative implications.

There are no laborers, no capitalists because all are laborers, all are capitalists: "Both sides of the relationship are raised to an imagined universality - labor as a state in which every person is put, and capital as the acknowledged univer- sality and power of the community.""7 The ideal speech situation analo- gously recognizes no communication differences. In Nietzschean lan- guage, there are no debtors, no creditors because all are debtors, all are creditors. Again, both sides of the relationship assume an imagined uni- versality: speech is a state in which every person is put, and truth orjustice are the acknowledged universality and power of the community. The problem with these equivalences - or symmetries - is that they apply a universal principle to particular indivdiuals. In constructing social relationships, they abstract from concrete individuals differing needs and capacities. For this reason, Marx argues that equal right, like every right, is inevitably unequal. "Right by its very nature can consist only in the applica- tion of an equal standard; but unequal individuals (and they would not be different individuals if they were not unequal) are measurable only by an equal standard in so far as they are brought under an equal point of view, are taken from one definite side only... everything else being ignored."88 Freedom is not this realization of equal exchange, but the transcendence of exchange altogether. To transcend exchange, critical theorists must pursue what Seyla Benhabib has called radical intersubjectivity. Radical intersubjectivity in- volves the recognition of concrete, specific, not abstract, generalized indi- viduals. This recognition is not found in the formal reciprocity of rights, but in a norm of complementary reciprocity. Benhabib's definition of complementary reciprocity is worth quoting at length: "Each is entitled to expect and to assume from the other forms of behavior through which the other feels recognized and confirmed as a concrete, individual being with specific needs, talents, and capacities. Our differences in this case comple- ment rather than exclude one another."89 She argues that such a norm con- firms not only our shared humanity, but also our human individuality. in Foucault's Theory of Power," Canadian Journal of Political and Social Theory 10:1-2 (1986).

Benhabib does not, however, draw her critique of Habermas' universalism from Nietzsche's exchange principle.</page><page sequence="24">94 Epistemology and Exchange Radical intersubjectivity is not absent from the history of critical theory. Indeed, elements of it appear in the works of these authors. Marx says that the "higher phase" of communist society crosses "the narrow horizon of bourgeois right in its entirety" and inscribes on its banner: "From each ac- cording to his ability, to each according to his needs!"'9 Nietzsche praises the transcendence of justice: "Justice which began with, 'everything is dischargeable, everything must be discharged,' ends by winking and letting those incapable of discharging their debts go free." He calls this self- overcoming of justice "mercy"; it is "the privilege of the most powerful man, or better, his - beyond the law."9' Adorno's concept of reconcilia- tion affirms interrelatedness without identity: "The reconciled state would not annex the alien with a philosophical imperialism, but would find its happiness in the fact that the alien remained distinct and remote within the preserved proximity, beyond being either heterogeneous or one's own."92 Though he misinterprets Adorno on this point, Habermas' linguistic con- cept of freedom as "significant rapport despite the inviolable distance be- tween the partners," rapport which he describes as "communication un- der conditions of individuation," does include aspects of radical intersubjectivity.93 Like Nietzsche, Habermas also recognizes the limita- tions of justice. He argues that a gain in rationality occurs when moral questions are transformed into problems ofjustice. But this transforma- tion also involves a loss of sensitivity to specific contexts. He concludes that "This necessary disregard for the complexity of concrete life..,. calls for specific compensations that make good the deficits with regard to the ap- plication and realization of moral insights."94 Critical theorists must develop these elements of radical intersubjec- tivity. They must redirect rationality from rights to needs, from justice to mercy, from identity to interrelatedness. This path leads beyond psycho- logical and economic exchange. Since Nietzsche prompts our search for it, Habermas is wrong to reject his challenge to Enlightenment. But Habermas rightly refuses to follow him, for radical intersubjectivity is a path Nietzsche failed to find. Nietzsche's path, the path of non-identity, leads beyond rationality and society, and leaves exchange behind. 90. Marx, Critique ofthe Gotha Program 531. 91.
