<plain_text><page sequence="1">BECKETT'S BARBOUILLAGES Bill Prosser Permutations are readily acknowledged as one of the stocks-in-trade of Beckett's writing. What is perhaps less widely appreciated is how they also haunt his copious marginal drawings. Stretching from an interbreeding of the simplest geometric shapes to a brood of fully-fledged human figures, these doodles seem bent on stirring-up our imaginations through their subtle twists and turns. And how do they differ essentially from his texts? The word doodle's1 meandering etymology admirably suits its ambling, evolving phenomena. First recorded around 1620 it meant a simpleton, from Dudeltopf or nightcap: by compounding Dudel, meaning twaddle, with Topf, pot, seventeenth-century Germans dreamed up some suitable headwear for their nightly visits to the land of nonsense. But presu mably long before then our onomatopoeic impulse had crowed "cock-a doodle-doo," so giving rise in the eighteenth century to a doodle-doo man for a cock-breeder and doodle for penis, perhaps from "cock"; hence a doodle-dasher was an onanist and a doodle-sack both the pudendum muliebre and then (by eye-watering anatomical association) the bagpipe. By the nineteenth century, calling someone a doodle no longer meant a numskull but a swindler, and so to doodle became to diddle. Also dating from the nineteenth century is the nickname doodle-bug - more recently familiar from World War II - with its raggle-taggle trail of applications. First meaning an American tiger-beetle and then some gold-prospecting gear, it became early twentieth-century slang for a small car, before RAF banter dubbing the droning, German flying bomb. Although occasionally a particular variant of doodle has a precise regional association (for example, in Lincolnshire doodlings are young foxes), most uses are widespread and generally undatable with any precision. A common thread seems to be rest and relaxation, as to doodle has variously meant to dandle a child to sleep, to prepare a makeshift bed, to trifle, to fritter away time, or to dawdle. Dr Johnson speculated that the word is made by contracting do little.2</page><page sequence="2">374 Bill Prosser Its contemporary meaning stems from Frank Capra's 1936 film Mr Deeds Goes to Town, in which doodling describes the activity of several characters whose mindless drawings epitomise the ubiquity of pointless pastimes. But aesthetic appreciation of doodles had in fact already occurred a decade earlier. In 1926 La Revolution surrealiste published a selection of spontaneous drawings that decorated the blotting pads of a French ministerial meeting. Famously attracted by the irrational and impromptu, the Surrealists picked a bizarre mixture of doodles, including animated faces, patterns and a fully knicknacked mantelpiece, together with a text enlivened by the descriptive phrase "le spermatazoi'de de rat" (Aragon, 15). As far as I know, this verminous ejaculation had no role in conceiving the present French expression for doodle, griffonnage, meaning a loose sketch or scribble. Nevertheless, echoes of nonsense and irrationality survive in the more wayward barbouillage, apparently synonymous with griffonnage but having the added figurative connotation of twaddle (cf. Dudel), or, more relevantly here, rigmarole. Rambling, going round the houses, is, of course, a key Beckettian ploy. Christopher Ricks said that, rather like the music of Bach, one would never love Beckett if one doesn't love permutations. Lessness, for example, was composed by a series of chances involving 60 separate sentences grouped into 24 paragraphs, each sentence appearing twice. This might be seen as a more modest version of Raymond Queneau's One Hundred Thousand Million Poems, in which a sequence of ten fourteen-line sonnets, each with an identical rhyme scheme, was printed onto recto pages with the lines cut into fourteen strips. Lifting a single line, or more, creates a new sonnet, and Queneau calculated that reading for 24 hours a day it would take 190, 258,751 years to complete all the possibilities. Perhaps the most famous of Beckett's many permutations are the episodes of Murphy's biscuits and Molloy's sucking stones, one of which at least comes to some sort of satisfactory conclusion. Between these two of course lies Watt, and its description in aching detail of Mr Knott's potential perambulations around his room, as he pinballs from window to door to fire to bed in every conceivable combination. All of them, as Hugh Kenner remarked, "written out in a trance of obligation" like "some schoolroom imposition" (23). This sequence is preceded in the novel by another alterative cycle when Watt remembers lying stone-cold sober in a ditch, listening to three frogs croaking Krak! Krek! Krik! at precise numerical intervals of</page><page sequence="3">Beckett's Barbouillages 375 "one, nine, seventeen, twenty-five etc., and at one, six, eleven, sixteen, etc. and at one, four, seven, ten, etc. respectively" (150). On the manuscript page all the kraks, kreks and kriks are meticulously annotated, making sure that each appears at exactly the right interval: krak and krik, for example both appearing at number 49.3 On the opposite page are Beckett's workings-out, where, with each sound starting from position number one, krak proceeds in eights, krek in fives, and krik in threes, and where all overlaps are ringed. The lowest common denominator of 3, 5, and 8 is 120, so all three unite in chorus at number 121. But Beckett's permutations are not confined to the linguistic. In a 1961 letter to Alan Schneider, about to put on Happy Days in New York, Beckett included a series of sketches showing his ideas for how Winnie might sit or stand, and how Willie should be hidden behind the mound, or if visible remain off-stage in a 'hole' (Harmon, 86; fig. IF). Despite Beckett admitting that "of course the proportions are all wrong" (89), Schneider found the drawings "most helpful," saying that "The mound is going to be exactly as you pictured it" (91). Bearing in mind the extravagance of some recent productions - Peter Hall 2003, Deborah Warner 2007 - it is interesting to note that in his next letter to Schneider Beckett says of the set that it should be of "a pathetic unsuccessful realism, the kind of tawdriness you get in 3rd rate musical or pantomime [...] laughably earnest bad imitation" (94). The drawings themselves faintly echo these sentiments in their lack of naturalism, but are workmanlike rather than ridiculous, with varied contour shading and occasionally enough descriptive detail to give Winnie a whiff of personality. The position of her knees in drawing D (as opposed to drawing E) has a purposeful lightness rare in diagrams. Throughout she stoically performs a series of sit-ups in a hummock of varying transparency, as if being washed in waves of murky then clear water, bobbing umbrella and handbag beside her, while Willie repeatedly puts aside his newspaper and starts swimming. Here Beckett's drawings are helping him decide what and how these two are doing on the stage, and how they might in turn appear to an audience. Elsewhere he drew permutations of something that will not be seen by a viewer, or reader, at all, except in their mind's eye. Once again, the Watt manuscript shows Beckett figuring something out, in this case four variations of the painting in Erskine's room.4 Surrounded by a square, densely-shaded frame, each version has a diagrammatic planet and satellite, with the former's circumference</page><page sequence="4">376 Bill Prosser punctured by a small hole at ninety degrees clockwise from its orbiting dot. Watt was fascinated by this picture, hanging in the room with the gap in the circle at the bottom and the dot to the east. How was the effect of perspective obtained? How was the illusion of movement in space achieved: he wondered what the artist had intended to represent [...], a circle and its centre in search of each other, or a circle and its centre in search of a centre and a circle respectively, or a circle and its centre in search of its centre and a circle respectively, or a circle and its centre in search of a centre and its circle respectively, or a circle and a centre not its centre in search of its centre and its circle respectively, or a circle and a centre not its centre in search of a centre and a circle respectively, or a circle and a centre not its centre in search of its centre and a circle respectively, or a circle and a centre not its centre in search of a centre and its circle respectively, in boundless space, in endless time (142) Two such lost souls made Watt cry, "refreshing him greatly" (142), and he then wondered what the picture would look like upside down, or on its right side, or left, with the dot and gap to the west and north, north and east, or south and west respectively. In fact he took it off the wall and held it in front of him in each of these positions, but liked it much less. So although there is no image of the painting printed in the book, Beckett carefully drew each alternative, presumably to help him describe its revolving orientations more succinctly. Pictures such as this are rooted in aspects of Modernism, particularly those of pure design exemplified in Bauhausian shuffling of geometric forms: twelve squares containing circles in which the square's area is divided precisely into half-white and half-black; ditto using straight lines instead of curves (figs. 2, 3). These graphic transpositions echo in a drawing by contemporary artist Andy Black (fig. 4) based on the structure of Beckett's Quad. Instead of actors, Black cast his index, middle, ring, and little fingers in the roles of A, B, C, and D, and then dipped them in an ink wash before performing the play digitally on a sheet of paper. The scurrying rhythms of Quad owe something to doodling's lazier energies; how something that initially has a particular purpose,</page><page sequence="5">Beckett's Barbouillages 377 say a crossing-out, can evolve into something more absent-mindedly elaborate. For instance, a scribbled-over square on the page containing drawings of Erskine's painting has a diagonal rhythm more carefully stroked on the manuscript of Endgame (fig. 5). Beckett often wrote on paper divided into 5mm squares like this, and would frequently fill them in, perming a range of the half-blocked, the barred, the arced, and the starred (figs. 6-9). Sometimes he would subdivide them, or pair them together (figs. 10-13). These basic building blocks form the foundations for further fabrications: four squares summon up an angular butterfly; diagonal lines are infused with an early pregnant bowing; the containing, outlining external square can be lost, leaving the symmetrical pro portions and structure of a wheel, which can then be more intricately embellished (figs. 14-17). Occasionally, these combinations mutate awkwardly and produce results like the bulbous grafting in figure 18. Alongside these geometrical developments, another occurs that also has its roots in the blots and waves of correction. This time they spawn decorations to words or their immediate surroundings. In Mr Deeds doodling referred particularly to the filling-in of letters, and coincidentally Beckett was also idly stroking his alphabets: Dr Johnson appears in his "Dream" Notebook of the early 1930s (fig. 19). His embellishment of enclosures continued well into the 1950s, as can be seen in Happy Days (fig. 20), which also exhibits another favourite - a precisely crenellated underlining. Sometimes such regular rhythms mutate, darkening and dangling a choppy sea or a row of blackened shark's teeth (fig. 21). Alternatively Beckett would simply frame words, say an address and date (fig. 22), or canopy them, as in figure 23's elaborated 'ignorance.' Occasionally playful embellishment infiltrates individual letters - giving characters character - such as those that appear in figure 24. But the cursive ringlets and winding trails that gestate in the word 'Blifil' flourish even more freely in the next theme from the canon of Beckett's doodles, which I call organics. Liberated from the rigidity of squared grids or the determination of letterforms (although perhaps influenced by school handwriting exercises), his shapes can now writhe and wriggle into loops and spirals - here a slithering whorl, there a wrought-iron twisting (figs. 25-30). Now and again, these supple fusions have the skeletal structure of animals or people, with potential arms, legs, and head spewing from a single spine (fig. 30). More fully fleshed is the serpentine energy that</page><page sequence="6">378 Bill Prosser runs through many of his deliberate figures (figs. 31, 32). Two could easily form 'S's in anthropomorphic alphabets, besides showing finer organic rhythms sharply nuanced into blunt expression (figs. 33, 34). By scrutinising such specifics one can appreciate how promiscuously Beckett rang his visual changes. His faces and clothing, in particular, echo with bursts of cursive dexterity and clumsy dressing. Take, for instance, a wide selection from Human Wishes. Figures 35 to 44 show a series of heads facing right. Anyone attempting to draw a face finds that a profile is the simplest way to give personality - far easier and more evocative than drawing a head directly from the front. Differences of nose- and chin-angle can make a face apparently aggressive or compliant, and a mouth seen from the side can readily express mood. Here, many of Beckett's folk appear glum, and sucking a pipe seems futile, but some cheer up, or at least put a brave face on things. A few cast their eyes downwards, and one has his conical cap clamped so firmly over his eyes that he cannot see anything at all (fig. 40). Another stares with enough dilated anxiety for two (fig. 41), and is followed by a buoyant Pop-eye, sailor's cap pushed roguishly back in time-honoured put-'em-up fashion (fig. 42). Features sometimes rhyme, as in figure 43 where a hook-nose balances a hooked ear, but figure 44's identity seems dissonant - a priapic nose and melon-slice smile culminate in a sharpness absent from his three scarecrow strands of wispy hair. The manuscript contains an even larger number of profiles that face left, the natural direction for people who hold a pen in their right hand (figs. 45-66). These begin with a soppy grin levened by a beguiling openness of face, quite different from figure 46's earnest achiever and the tight-lipped smugness of figure 47, whose glasses squarely mimic the shallow right-angle of his hat. More subtly, the downward diagonal stroke of his eye doesn't quite follow the line marking the bridge of his nose, and neither does the underside of his nostrils lie exactly parallel with his upper lip; nudged disparities that inadvertently express the suppressed mobility of his face. Something similar appears to be happening in figure 48, where the minimal energy from four sets of near parallel lines is enlivened by swoops marking brow, lip, and chin. But lacking the expressive focus of an eye, the combined result just looks narrowly hedonistic. Figure 49's glowering spiv has the doodled equivalent of a conspiratorial waxed moustache, yet his counterpart (fig. 50), similarly angled, appears resigned - even abject - beneath his workman's cap. Beckett</page><page sequence="7">Beckett's Barbouillages 379 has made a small blot service as the gentleman's ear, and similar off the-cuff manipulation is at work in figure 51 to produce this bristling smoker, briar-chomping between hidden teeth, and again in figure 52, where a cleverly incorporated blot stares vacantly aloft. Unusually, Beckett tilts this whole head upwards slightly, a slant invigorated by tassels of hair drawn at a distance from the neck, giving a sway of air and space. Differently blinded, figure 53's head appears thatched, complete with zig-zag decorative ridging, so that he can only sniff and gape at his surroundings. A frequent dodge, seen once or twice already, is a gawping eye shaped like frog-spawn. In figure 54 this is coupled with a needle-point nose and slicked-back hair, and in figure 55 glowers from under an arcing eyebrow and a surging comb-over. Figure 56's hair, if indeed he has any, is neatly skull-capped, and the angles around his eye lean gently away from the rectilinear repeats of his profile and mouth, giving him a hesitant, quizzical glaze. A rare female follows - pouting, lipstick heavy - with an elliptical eye like half a stylish pair of spectacles, its bridge nipped in the steep valley between her brow and nose (fig. 57). With her looping hairdo she is as carefully coiffed as the Mosleyesque martinet's sleek brushback (fig. 58), but his regimented combing probably also extends to his moustache, and perhaps even his eyebrows. Figure 59 has a neat sweeping, too, each strand angling gradually from left to right until it exactly matches, in its penultimate stroke, the slope of his nose. None of the other faces hints at a complexion, but the lines jostling around his cheek suggest bracing ruddiness or the trophies of acne. A simple skull-capped soul, figure 60, bobs downcast on his extended neck, followed by a thug, with a low forehead, an ear like a butcher's hook, and no neck at all (fig 61.). Several profiles are made with rhyming loops, including figure 62, woozily focussing his spawn eye, and figure 63, which, out of context, would be right on the edge of legibility. There are other extreme faces, too, seeming squashed, as in figure 64, or tugged, such as figure 65, or even, in one case, melted (fig. 66). There is only a single double-profile (fig. 67), which blends many recyclable components - frog-spawn eyes, snub nose, up- and down-in the-mouth - in fractured symmetry. Symmetry, or at least near symmetry, plays a large part in the next cluster: heads shown full-face (figs. 68-87). Figure 68, for example, has his hair, nose, ears and mouth</page><page sequence="8">380 Bill Prosser pretty well balanced, with only his pear-shaped eye spoiling his even features. Or figure 69, where general equilibrium is faintly put out of kilter by an upwardly mobile ear and gondola smile. (Incidentally, this face plays fast and loose with the primary colours of cartoon expression, in which eyebrows that point upwards denote anxiety or unhappiness. Displayed that way here, they are combined with a broad smile, so producing a psychologically complex, mismatched pairing, that might suggest pathos or even the attempted masking of genuine fear.) His frizzy hair shows how Beckett garnishes heads to embroider each personality. We can contrast figure 70 's nondescript clump with more renegade and challenging hairstyles such as spikes (fig. 71), or a crowded sprouting like a row of seedlings (fig. 72). In figure 73 such outcrops appear to have been dampened or gelled, and figure 74's are smarmed carefully forward, while figure 75's strands have grown into an asymmetrical fringe flopping into his up-all-night eyes. Parallel diagonal strokes also decorate headgear, as in texturing this peaked cap (fig. 76), but otherwise hats are either entirely infilled or left blank. Figure 77 looks to be wearing a trapper's toque with its flaps meeting under his chin, while a variety of rounded crowns appear as a tin helmet (fig. 78), a bowler (fig. 79), a flat-brimmed sombrero (fig. 80), and a derby (fig. 81). Figure 82 shows a rugged top hat, which might then have been crunched or crumpled (fig. 83). Most spectacularly, a tall, brimless number wafts a billowing, spermatic veil (fig. 84). A couple of faces flaunt spawn-eyes that have been deliberately turned into spectacles, one wearing an inverted pair of pince-nez that fashion a nose (fig. 85), and another, a Sartre look-alike, coolly gazing through his heavier, intellectual, frames (fig. 86). A single dash drawn through this scholar's lips might reveal a gapped tooth, but figure 87's mouth is crammed with lines that scramble messily around two fangs rooted in his lower gum. Beckett turned a similar blotted stain into a retreating head (fig. 88), and also drew a few other characters seen from behind (figs. 89-91). The first of these displays an extraordinary complex of geometrical patterning inside what at first sight appears to be a straightforward afro, while the next parades a regularly divided plaid cap and the third a neat pair of tight bunches - or alternatively the drooping outer ends of a wonderfully extravagant moustache. Permutations of style, fabric, and decoration seen on clothing are equally discrepant. Trousers, for instance, show a gradual evolution</page><page sequence="9">Beckett's Barbouillages 381 from simple and delicate shading on a pair of jodhpurs (fig. 92), through a more emphatic tonal imposition on waddling overalls (fig. 93) , to the energetic scumbling that fill some sag-crotch breeches (fig. 94) . Eventually, such impacted pen-work becomes complete and fills the legs entirely, as in an exaggerated indiarubber U-bend and its stiff support (fig. 95). Angles play their part, too, in deciding how best to elaborate leg-wear. A hurdler's trousers are diagonally hatched with slight differences, following the pitch and thrust of each thigh and shin, giving them energy and impetus (fig. 96), while a runner's legs each parade a precise military stripe, diagrammatically emphasising their forward momentum (fig. 97). Sometimes tonality is added in such a way that it becomes texture or pattern, as on a horse-shoe backside, where punctuated jabs can be seen as indicating the nap of coarse cloth (fig. 98). Elsewhere, horizontal strokes are clearly intended to be a hooped, convict-like pattern, which, like prison sentences, are handed down both heavy and light (figs. 99,100). From time to time trousers explore the wider seams of tailoring, from the exotic, as in pairs of pantaloons and plus-fours (figs. 101, 102), to the functional, as modelled by figure 103's workman's trousers, carefully tied at the knees. A pair of bell-bottoms (fig. 104) could be nipped at knee-height, too, neatly adjusting their length so as to brush the insteps of a protruding pair of shoes. Just as he presses trousers into different patterns and styles, so Beckett chops and changes footwear, sometimes mixing and matching within a single pair. To start with, figure 105 shows a couple of straightforward stack-heeled winkle-pickers, but frequently a pair can contain one pointed and one round-toed shoe, as in figures 106 and 107 (both with a hint of laces), and again in figure 108. With one foot hidden, perhaps figure 109 shows a matched pair, as indeed might be the bootees in figure 110. Some clump-heeled round-toes could be clogs (fig. Ill), and perhaps a couple of flat-footed Oxfords are seen in figure 112. Lastly, one of a neatly laced pair has been unfortunately transformed into a blotted orthopaedic lift (fig. 113). Variety also clothes Beckett's upper bodies. Like trousers, these are sometimes loosely filled (fig. 114), but generally are more closely ribbed and show a clear directional flow (fig. 115). Beckett himself often chose to wear roll-necked pullovers, and frequently donates them to his drawn characters. Figure 116 disports a particularly open weave, which narrows in figure 117 and tightens still further in figure 118. Hatched so densely with blobbing ink onto cheap, absorbent paper,</page><page sequence="10">382 Bill Prosser figure 119's jumper appears to be emanating a dark, fibrous glimmer. On one occasion, a roll neck carefully segments into an elaborate Elizabethan ruff (fig. 120), while on another a shallow V-neck reveals a smart collar and tie (fig. 121). These particularly regular tonal striations have a loose and wavy motion, gently overlapping their boundary edges and subtly evoking the pullover's fluff and pattern, marking it as perhaps an Arran, or a heavy cricket sweater. Only one trenchcoat appears on Human Wishes (fig. 122). Seen from the back, it has a keenly detailed belt but we can only guess at its frontal fastenings. On many of the other garments this is a simple matter of observation. Figure 123, for example, has a high-necked, body-hugging jacket with four heavy buttons, like pom-poms, lining its front. An arc of protrusions seen from the side, like a row of pendant nipples, droop from figure 124, while figure 125 has a more modest selection ascending tightly below a smart cravat. Figure 126's bodice has been pinched right to the collar with a neat chain of sibling hoops, a regular family of buttons. Elsewhere such loops can be seen as a patterned tie (fig. 127), or a single circlip and chopped dangle that form an engorged footballer's knot (fig. 128). Further subtle details can sometimes be seen, from the hint of pockets on each side of a jacket (fig. 129), or a pair of minimal vest pocket slashes (fig 130), to a blouson's emphatic patch, complete with its folded V-shaped flap (fig. 131). A home for chucking odd bits and pieces could also be found in figure 132's belt-pouch, slung around the waist like a World War II gas-mask holder. Patterns, letters, faces, hairstyles, boots and shoes, trousers, jumpers, coats, buttons, pockets and flaps, this, then, is a shallow trawl through the oceanic labyrinth of Beckett's doodles. But even such a modest haul from his accumulation of geometries, grotesques, germinations, and Grand Guignol poses a simple question. How, aside from the obvious, do they differ from his writings? For a start, apart from the very specific drawings of the paintings in Erskine's room, or of Willie's moves around the mound, the permutations described here have no clear intentionality, even one as open-ended as that, say, of Daniel Spoerri's An Anecdoted Topography of Chance, and certainly entirely lacking the controlled precision of that found in Watt or Molloy. More particularly, his drawings show little of the varied graphic poise and focused reflection seen, for example, in the work of a masterful draftsman like Saul Steinberg. Although diverse, none of Beckett's doodles display the levels of practical visual scholarship and</page><page sequence="11">Beckett's Barbouillages 383 erudition whose literary equivalents so evidently fertilise his texts. Instead, like doodling more generally, they blossom from a mixture of accidental juxtaposition and osmosis, a gradual assimilation of chance ornamentations and the vernacular imagery of their day ? cartoons, caricatures, advertisements and so on. In a way this is what makes them fascinating. True doodling operates on a kind of auto-pilot when the mind is engaged elsewhere, and the evolving forms that result are often as much a surprise to the artist as any audience. It is in fact the place where automatic drawing, so highly prized by the Surrealists, is acces sible to everyone. Much academic energy is taken up locating precise sources for Beckett's philosophical, theological, and literary allusions. With his drawings this is impossible, as they are cooked up from ingredients too anonymous to be pinned down. This, surely, must be to our advantage, for denied the more traditional route of exegesis, we are forced to take from the pictures simply what they offer on their own terms, as presented. Freed from any feasible expectations to provide fixed influence or meaning each image can tickle our fantasies; which with luck might turn out to be as effervescent in spirit as the drawings themselves.
