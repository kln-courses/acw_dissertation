DANA RAPHAEL Human Lactation Center, Ltd. 666 Sturges Highway Westport, Connecticut 06880 Quiatt has reviewed some selective conse- quences of aunting behavior in primates (AA 81:310-320, 1979). He sees a possible advantage in kidnapping (as a method of learning mater- nal roles) and in a variety of other mothering acts. The major direction for the actions he describes goes from an individual other than the mother toward the infant. My work examines aunting (uncling, fathering) behavior and the relationship of other group members toward the mother as the major recipient of the activity (Raphael 1969). I suggest this interaction is adaptive, having evolved in response to primary supportive "needs" of the mother and her new-</page><page sequence="2">REPORTS AND COMMENTS 635 born. One of these is the mother's capacity to lactate. There are significant differences between the acts discussed here and those of Quiatt (1979) and McKenna (1979). I limit the flow of move- ment to supportive, positive behavior directed toward the mother. This action is part of, but not synonymous with, allomaternal behavior. It does not include kidnapping of the infant from the mother--an action that is undoubtedly stressful to the mother and most likely under- mines her milk supply. Grooming behavior, on the other hand, would be a part of it. The behavior of the most significant supportive in- dividual, whom I call a doula (1975), is stressed. I suggest that this individual's (or these in- dividuals') presence near the mother/infant pair in human and other groups of mammals determines the success or failure of the breast- feeding process. Lactation is not a simple, automatic process. When the infant sucks, nerves in the breast stimulate the pituitary gland to release the hor- mone oxytocin into the bloodstream. This hor- mone operates on the muscles surrounding the cells that contain the stored milk. It triggers them to contract and eject the milk into cisterns near the nipple where the infant can suck it out. It is a very complex function which, particularly for the primapara of human and nonhuman mammals, requires a period of time for the body to establish the pathways and reflexes unique to lactation. The emptying process must also become synchronized with the infant's ap- petite. A supportive network is tied into this delicate- ly balanced process; unless it is present, the operation is short-circuited, and the milk ejec- tion reflex will not function. In order to lactate successfully, mammals, whether animal (Ely and Petersen 1941) or human (Newton and Newton 1948), must be secure within a suppor- tive network (Raphael 1973). To get a clearer picture of the relationship between supportive networks and lactation we reviewed 143 studies of mammalian groups (Ra- phael, Breakstone, and Hale 1977). We looked into what Jane Lancaster (1976, personal com- munication) describes as the interactional pro- cess "within the female core" and included in the search a look at "the ways that males relate to it." We noted that a strong female/female pattern of interaction was at the core of this supportive behavior in most, but not all, of these groups. For example, Jolly (1966) states that after a birth the lemur mother huddles over the infant while all members of the troop make an effort to touch and groom both the mother and the neonate. Jay reports that several female langurs approach and gather around the mother in an attempt to gain access to the new- born. The females put their faces to the new- born, smelling, licking, and gently nudging it. The neonate is so attractive to them that they move along with the mother handling or at- tempting to handle him (1963). This behavior is not only apparent in primates. There is some interesting documen- tation on dolphin group behavior. As the future mother's labor progresses, other females become excited and withdraw with her from the rest of their group. After delivery, some may assist the mother by buoying the newborn (and the mother if need be) to the surface to breathe. Lilly describes a similar response in several female dolphins to a distress call from a sick group member (1963:116). Even a dead calf was pushed to the surface by several females for four hours. Young porpoises orient to females other than their mother for an extraordinary length of time - up to six years. Among roe deer, there is a description of a doe supporting a mother during the delivery and assisting in postpartum infant care (Prior 1968:99). Darling reports a "matriarchal" social system among the red deer. One mature hind is "the leader of each group . . . the sexes are separate for the greater part of the year" (1937:68). Quiatt and others use the word "aunt" to describe this type of caretaking behavior by other females. I have suggested that this term tends to be misleading (1967). For one thing, the anthropomorphic implication is obvious, connoting a blood-tie relationship which is often but not always the case. Kummer describes this supportive interaction and also writes of his hesitancy about using this kinship term: "In several primate societies the mother is assisted (in infant rearing) by other group members, especially juvenile females, and adult females that happen to be without infants. This role which ethologists have unfortunatley named the 'aunt' role, usually fell to the mother's closest grooming companion. Some mothers came to use the 'aunt' as a babysitter while they them- selves were feeding elsewhere" (1971:80). In place of "aunt" I have used the term doula, which I suggest more precisely fits the in- dividuals performing this supportive role. Doula activity is a kind of mothering behavior by in- dividuals toward an infant and/or mother. It is</page><page sequence="3">636 AMERICAN ANTHROPOLOGIST [83, 1981] an ancient Greek word used to describe "those individuals who surround, interact with, and aid the mother at any time within the perinatal period, which includes pregnancy, birth, and lactation" (Raphael 1973:24). The term doula eliminates a kinship bias, even though the relationships are often familial. In reality females in a monkey or ape group are close relatives, half-sisters, aunts, cousins, etc. The fact that female groups are essen- tially closed units with practically no transfer of females between groups, keeps the extend- ed families, which exchange males, within a neighborhood. Hence the doula relationship probably involves kin and the benefits go to the doula (experience), the infant (extra care and social network), and the mother (time off to feed) [Lancaster 1976, personal communi- cation]. By designating this special term to describe a particular behavior occurring at a particular time, the behavior of the actors is more easily delimited. And, as the infant matures, doula behavior can be observed as it disappears. Besides helping with the specific needs of the mother and infant, doula support is experi- enced by the infant, and that information is stored for later adult expression. Poirier writes: "A direct relationship exists between the social- ization and learning processes of infants and their subsequent adult roles" (1975:13). The presence of a doula reduces the shock of separa- tion. The Lowe's guenon monkey infant, for ex- ample, does not experience a "traumatic" wean- ing, apparently because it "starts about two months before the birth of the next sibling and is eased (into the next stage) by the presence of 'aunts' " (Bourliere, Hunkeler, and Bertrand 1970:314). As Quiatt points out, for juvenile females and females without young, care of other infants functions as motherhood practice. "The role a female must learn is that of being a Mother . . . most, (perhaps all) adult females have experience in caring for young even before they themselves give birth" (Poirier 1975:15). I want to stress that attention paid to the in- fant by individuals other than the mother can be functionally adaptive for the mother as well. She may be permitted priority access to the food supply. The troop may slow their pace to ac- commodate her, and their solicitious behavior could serve to help conserve her energy. Their close presence may also function to protect both herself and her newborn from predators. In baboon troops, because of the interest in the infant, strong bonds develop between the mother and other adults (Chance and Jolly 1970). Carpenter reports that during parturi- tion the howler monkey may become the focus of attention for several other females, and this attraction continues throughout the infant's early development (1965). Patas monkey mothers may leave their infants in the care of another female while they feed or engage in other activities (Hall and Mayer 1967). Strong social bonds with females other than the mother is reported for the gorilla and with sisters or half-sisters in the chimpanzee. Kleiman and Eisenberg say that in the majority of canid species, "care of the young includes as an im- portant element, provisioning of the female and her litter by other adults" (1973:648). Indeed, Mech reports that "probably all [wolf] pack members help feed the female and her young" (1970:145). Though not common, the doula role is played by a male (douli) in many species. The most dramatic example is the gibbon. The protective and guardian function of the male when accom- panying the mother/infant pair certainly offers the essential supportive help that permits lacta- tion to be successful. Thoughtful researchers have described paternal behavior in a variety of mammals (Barton 1972; Mitchell and Brandt 1972). Indeed there is a range of maternal/pa- ternal behavior from total to partial care from both sexes. And yet it has become very obvious that the former typologies used to describe these animal groupings were biased towards the male and did not coincide with reported patterns of suppor- tive interaction. Categories describing domi- nant and subdominant males, the multi-male group, the one-male group (Kummer 1971), the solitary animal, and the single mate with his harem, no longer suffice. A more valid way of viewing the so-called harem group would be to visualize it as a strong core cluster of females with young, attended, protected, or serviced by one or more males. Lionel Tiger puts it this way: "The whole point of being a mammal is extensive caring be- havior on the part of the females for their young. In terms of kin selection theory, one would expect that if social organization is ex- tended beyond the mother-immature offspring relationship in mammals, that certainly the most expectable - or at least one of the most ex- pectable - extensions would be that of related females assisting one another in their caring roles. The literature bears this out" (1977, per- sonal communication). Many researchers have been struggling with</page><page sequence="4">REPORTS AND COMMENTS 637 these simple social forms. For example, note Bertram's conflict as he defines a lion pride as a one-male group, yet describes the pride as "the stable and permanent social group of related adult females plus their cubs plus whatever adult males are in possession of that pride at that time" (1973:215). Similarly, Hall calls the group a "one-male unit... highly organized around the adult females, the adult male hav- ing a clearly defined role as breeder and as a watcher for external threat, with all major in- itiative within the group coming from the adult females" [our emphasis] (1967:275). Count has been working on these patterns for thirty years. .. re male "maternal" behavior. When in 1951 I began exploring what was to become the "biogram" idea, understandably I as- sumed that it was axiomatic to make female parental care the original point of reference. Then, I discovered that, the care of and pro- vision for offspring was perhaps more primal- ly attributable to the male sex, among the vertebrates. Obviously the evolution of intrauterine gestation combined with the in- terjection of the lactation physiology and bio- chemistry gave, so to speak, the "inside" track to the females. But this is peculiar to the mammals. We are mammals ourselves, so we have committed the provincialism of assum- ing it all to be primarily female, which it is not. So the mammalian scheme is the special case, needing special explication" [Count 1974, personal communication]. Several researchers have pondered the presence and significance of allomaternal/ doula behavior. Crook says that an ecological adaptation may account for the increased pat- tern of female/female interrelationship among social primates: "Populations overcrowded in relation to environmental commodities show an increased male exclusion from reproductive groups . . . sex ratios in reproductive units show a decrease in male representation under (harsh environmental conditions)" (1970:125). Klingel infers that the female/young cluster may form a stable and often permanent group without the presence of males: "Family groups are not held together by force by the (zebra) stallion, but form a stable group even without him . ." (1965:86). Recent studies clarify the pattern of female to male separation especially after estrus, during pregnancy and for the postpartum/lactation periods. Some suggest each sex has its own separate social system. Among the squirrel monkey, for example, it is the activities of the adult female that determine the movements of the troop (Baldwin 1969:41). The male baboon may appear to be the leader of the troop because of his position at the head of the line, but Rowell states clearly that "he is not the leader in the sense of deciding the direction in which the troop is moving. This appears to be chosen by the adult females of the group .. ." (1972:32). Since the traditional social structure models are not useful for this type of analysis, we sug- gest it might be better to consider this behavior on a continuum of the complexity of inter- actional patterns based on the number of in- dividuals in the group, their sex and the degree and number of interactions. William Irons (1977, personal communication ) applauds this idea: "A continuum suggests a quantifiable variable and is far superior to the practice of using inflexible pigeon holes." Others are also thinking in this direction: "As we attain greater awareness of the range of variation in these social groups, more dimensions will be recog- nized" (Fox 1976, personal communication). In summary, our work questioned the com- monly used classifications of mammalian group- ings and found most of these rubrics unsatis- factory (Raphael, Breakstone, and Hale 1977). We do not propose a new simplified typology for the classification of social patterns but suggest looking at interactional patterns to explore post- partum behavior. A supportive member (or members) of the group, the doula, was identi- fied. The presence of that individual (those in- dividuals) was discussed as beneficial to both mother and infant. Allomaternal/doula/sup- portive behavior was suggested as a functional response to some basic needs of the mother/in- fant pair. The lactation function was suggested as a primary variable. In fact, female supportive groupings may provide the necessary environ- ment on which lactation depends. References Cited Baldwin, J.
