<plain_text><page sequence="1">Between Determinism and Indeterminism: Notes Toward a Potentialist Metaphysics 1. FISHER SOLOMON What one might call the popular French episte- mology...has edified us in recent years with a number of works, certain of which have attained great recognition.... The philosophies underly- ing these.., works are themselves diverse, some- times even in opposition. But curiously, they all have a common trait: all outrageously glorify chance, noise, 'fluctuation.' All make random- ness responsible... for the organization of the world. -Rene Thom (1983) What is a success when the possibility of failure continues to constitute its structure? -Jacques Derrida (1982b) In the sober conclusion to his lifelong dream of a Book that would achieve, in a single overpowering blow (coup), the dialectical resolution and closure of aesthetic history, St6phane Mallarm6 wearily reports that "A Throw of the Dice Can Never Abolish Chance." No single gesture or play, that is to say, can ever surmount its own essential play-fullness, can ever realize the dialectically determinate and universal aesthetic totality of Mallarme's Hegelian vision. Un Coup de Dis accordingly represents the determinate destiny of Hegelian me- taphysics as the empty dream of a shipwrecked Master, foundered upon the shoals of a universal contingency. Might we not regard this peculiar expression of dialectical disillusionment as an allegory of our own post-dialectical predica- ment, our own Nietzschean resignation to the "iron hand of necessity shaking the dice-box of chance?" For do we not find today a similar critical sense that dialectical determinism has yielded to an anti-dialectical "freeplay," that meta- physical "destiny" has been forever undermined by what Jacques Derrida has called "destinerrance," that is, by the irreducibly contingent movement of the "trace," the ever-incalculable oscillations of "diff6rance?" Do we not find our- selves facing today, like Mallarm6 nearly a century ago, nothing more than the contingency of the die, the untranscendable play of chance? SubStance No 55, 1988 18</page><page sequence="2">Between Determinism and Indeterminism 19 It has not only been criticism that has suffered a loss of dialectical confi- dence, of course, for in the century since Mallarm6 began his foredoomed ex- periment, the determinate universe of Newton and Laplace has been undermined as thoroughly as has Hegel's unfulfilled vision of Absolute Knowledge. Thus, as Frank Coppay writes: In the last hundred years of onslaught by mathematics, philosophy and the hard sciences, the clockwork universe has come unsprung. Axiomatics is reeling from an uppercut by G6del's theorem. The biologist's pre-biotic soup bears a striking resemblance to Mallarme's throw of the dice. Literary deconstruction, in its re- fusal to ascribe origins, centers, or identities to authors or texts, has introduced a wave of anti-causality into the analysis of works of art (Coppay 1983:7). But before declaring the paradoxically "final" triumph of indeterminism, we might note a puzzling contradiction in the scene of freeplay itself. For as Cop- pay adds, in spite of the randomness and indeterminacy of a universe appar- ently come "unsprung," we can still, improbably enough, "tip over a probability board and watch in security the little beads spill pathwise into a bell curve: nearly every time. We can computer-generate random-number se- quences. This means, irony of ironies, that we can program improbability" (1983:7). But how, it might be asked, are we to interpret this "irony of ironies," this paradoxical regularity within the scene of play? Are events, in reality, deter- mined by an orderly and ordering power whose secret we have not yet uncov- ered? Is "chance," in other words, simply a name that we give to processes whose causational logic we do not yet know? Or is it the other way around: that reality is constituted by an incalculable sum of accidents and that any etiologi- cal regularity we may "find" in it simply reflects our own subjective will-to- order? Or is the question more fundamentally problematic than even this, finally reducible neither to a deterministic nor to an indeterministic answer, remaining undecidably entangled in a metaphysical web of discursive opposi- tions that can never be transcended in the name of the real? Each of these in- terpretations is a familiar feature in the terrain of contemporary criticism and theory, but what I wish to propose here is that there is a fourth possible inter- pretation of the relation between determinacy and indeterminacy, an empirical interpretation that would posit the real complementarity of necessity and chance in a world that can be objectively known within empirical, rather than discursive, limits. This interpretation, I will suggest, has been at least implicitly antici- pated by Aristotle's metaphysics, and has been further explored by contempo- rary physicists and philosophers of science. But before turning to an examination of this fourth alternative, we might first briefly survey the first three, beginning here with the deterministic perspective. In an essay revealingly entitled "Stop Chance! Silence the Noise!" (1983), Rent Thom presents a vigorous defense of the deterministic option, a defense that, in Antoine Danchin's words, "refuses the discontinuity of appearances, and seeks to account for the real in continuous terms" (1983:63). For Thom, that is to say, the apparent discontinuity or randomness in natural events con- ceals a fundamental order that it is the task of scholarship to discover. "Is the</page><page sequence="3">20 J. Fisher Solomon world subject to a rigorous determinism, or is there a 'chance' that is irreduc- ible to any description?" he asks accordingly; and his answer is clear: "As a philosopher the scholar can leave the question open; but as a scholar, it is for him an obligation of principle-under pain of internal contradiction-to adopt an optimistic position and to postulate that nothing, in nature, is unknowable a priori" (1983:12). To believe otherwise, Thom insists, to "assert that 'chance exists' is therefore to take the ontological position which consists in affirming that there are natural phenomena which we shall never be able to describe, therefore never understand"-a choice that he associates with "the wave of ir- rationalism and anti-scientism of the 1880's, the waves of the apostles of the 'crisis of science': the Boutroux, the Le Roys..." (1983:11). Chance, Thom concludes, is essentially "an entirely empty, negative concept, therefore with- out scientific interest. Determinism, on the contrary, is a source of fascination-for the one who knows how to scrutinize it" (1983:19). To so scrutinize the world, seeking a determinately "noiseless" order be- hind the "noisy, anarchic, clamoring, mottled, striped, streaked, variegated, mixed, crossed, piebald multiplicity" of experience as Michel Serres interprets it (Serres 1983:56), is to conceive a universe in the image of an "enlightened" rationality that according to Serres constitutes an artificial restriction of the in- finite and imageless "possibility" that underlies the house of reason. That is, as Serres writes, reason, in the person of "Leibniz... builds this world like an apartment placed at the peak, the summit, the apex of a pyramid. Rare, unique, perfect, rigorously calculated with optimum principles, in the middle of all possible worlds, it separates like a distinct point from a mass of shade" (1983:56). It is in such an "apartment," Serres believes, that the "politician" and the "scientist" dwell, those figures whose "function... is to be right," to be "official servants of the truth" (1983:57). But the "philosopher," who "wants to allow the possible to be free," who "does not protect himself with the truth as with a shield or sword," and who "does not seek to end fears in the dark," has no care for the summit; rather, he turns his gaze upon "the base of the pyramid" of being, an "infinite base [that] cannot be structured by rigor- ous and lucid reason" (1983:56-57). Beneath the appearances of formal order, Serres argues, beneath the "information that is phenomenal," there is "chaos- white noise," an infinite possibility and multiplicity that prompts the philoso- pher to conclude that "what is knowable and what is known are born of the unknown" (1983:54). And so, Serres writes, the "Ancients were right to think chaos a gaping abyss. The multiple is open and from it is born nature always being born. We cannot know what will be born of it. We cannot know what is in it, here or there" (1983:56). For the philosopher, accordingly, there is nei- ther knowledge nor truth. He must be willing to immerse himself "in white noise, in the mottled clamor of the confused," in the infinite "set of possible things" that forever exceeds the corrals of rational calculation (1983:56). Such a reversal and disruption of rational dialectics is by now a familiar fea- ture of a critical landscape strewn with Nietzschean landmarks. Within the confines of this terrain we can accordingly recognize a set of well-known con- ceptual oppositions: rationality vs. irrationality, science vs. skepticism, deter- minism vs. indeterminism. The theoretical antagonism between Serres and</page><page sequence="4">Between Determinism and Indeterminism 21 Thom thus predictably repeats the fundamental antagonisms of Western me- taphysics. But if this is the case, should we not consider the significance of the very structure of such oppositions? Should we not scrutinize, that is to say, the difference that articulates the oppositional concepts of Western metaphysics and accordingly defer any attempt to master either structural term? Such a scru- tiny, such a strategy, Derrida has written, would "no longer [tolerate] the op- position of activity and passivity, nor that of cause and effect, or of indetermination and determination" (1982a:13) but would "solicit" instead the undecidability of their oppositional relation. Rather than choosing either determinism or indeterminism, in other words, Derrida interrogates the dif- ference, the interstice, that continuously has articulated the oppositions of metaphysical thinking throughout its history, the paradoxically undecidable yet structured movement of a sameness-in-difference that he has provisionally described as the differing/deferring motion of "diff6rance." As Derrida puts it, the "same, precisely, is diffirance (with an a) as the displaced and equivocal pas- sage of one different thing to another, from one term of an opposition to the other," an opposition that Derrida does not seek to erase or dialectically re- duce, preferring instead to critique it in order "to see what indicates that each of the terms must appear as the diffirance of the other, as the other different and deferred in the economy of the same .. ." (1982a: 17). The effect of such a scru- tiny, of course, is to undermine every concept of the real, to solicit or shake both empiricity and rationality, "exposing" each as untranscendable concepts of metaphysics, denying their extra-metaphysical or extra-discursive validity. Like Serres, then, Derrida undermines the Enlightenment's desire for an ontological foundation in "reason" and "order," but he does not do so in the "name" of dis-order, chaos, or "white noise." For the non-name of "dif- f6rance" represents neither a determinate nor an indeterminate foundation; rather, "diff6rance" undermines every base, every foundation, every ontology. Here the "pyramid" of being rests upon no foundation at all: it trembles, cer- tain neither of order nor of disorder, of determinacy nor of indeterminacy, nor of any decidably specifiable ontological principle. It is in this context that we may understand Derrida's rhetorical (or is it grammatical?) question posed at the head of this essay: "What is a success when the possibility of failure continues to constitute its structure?" (1982a:324). For without any foundation for judgment, without any standard subsisting outside the field of our own metaphysical discourse, we could not be- gin to determine just which term in a success/failure opposition would be nor- mative: a "presence" against which the other term might be defined as a privative absence or failure. Is success the norm? Failure? How could we tell, when a "normative" failure would itself constitute, paradoxically enough, a "success" if looked at from the right perspective? Our very ability to tell the dif- ference between oppositional concepts thus has been undermined before we can even come to those concepts themselves. Indeed, as Irene Harvey puts it, the whole purpose of Derrida's project is to make such oppositions "enigmatic," that is, "to make resound. . oscillate.. .vibrate, or ring" the "irreducible du- plicity" of metaphysical thinking (1986:34). Thus, three possible interpretations of the determinacy-indeterminacy op-</page><page sequence="5">22 J. Fisher Solomon position: first, Rene Thom's "optimistic" choice for determinism; second, Mi- chel Serres' celebration of unconstrained possibility, of indeterminate white noise; and third, Jacques Derrida's deconstruction of all metaphysical polari- ties, suspending the very opposition between indeterminacy and determinacy without seeking either a synthesis or a solution. But as I have suggested, there is a fourth view, one which would mediate between determinism and indeter- minism through an analysis of that very factor that we can find empirically demonstrated in such phenomena as a probability board, a dice game, or the laws, say, of genetic inheritance. That is, between the absolute certainty of a determinate order and the absolute uncertainty of a universe whose processes of becoming are wholly random, we may find an empirical reality that is nei- ther wholly determined nor wholly undetermined but which demonstrates a capacity for regular behavior that can be apprehended through an objective in- terpretation of material potentiality or probability. To demonstrate and support such an interpretation (which might be char- acterized as a "potentialist realism") we might begin by looking at some of the responses posed by those exponents of "the popular French epistemology" whom Thom has accused of championing indeterminism. Significantly, they all begin by refusing to see the issue in Thornm's either/or terms. Ilya Prigogine, for example, responds to Thom's charges to the effect that as far as he is con- cerned chance and necessity never come into opposition in empirical reality in the first place. "It is traditional to set the deterministic and the random sche- mata against each other," Prigogine writes, "whence, moreover, the possibility for two opposing dogmatisms, that of chance, from which Monod was not ex- empt, and the dogmatism of determinism with which the expose of Rene Thom is larded. Now, if there is a surprise in this domain of the sciences," he con- tinues, "it is that these two views on nature complement each other to a much greater extent than they conflict" (1983:39). So "why choose?" Henri Atlan asks. "I refuse the injunction to choose between two contradictory metaphysi- cal postulates; or rather, I accept them both at the same time. In fact the exclu- sive choice of either leads only to the a priori exclusion of a part of our experience of the real from the field of knowledge, without it being clear how such a conclusion may be justified or beneficial" (1983:45). In his own response to Thom's accusations, "Beyond Determinism: The Dialogue of Order and Disorder," Edgar Morin proposes that "We need to leave behind the ontological opposition chance/necessity" entirely (which is not the same thing as preserving the opposition in order to suspend its terms in an enigmatic oscillation), "and consider their co-presence" instead (1983:28). That is, "We must... renounce the ideology/idolatry/idealism of determinism as well as the ideology/idolatry of the god Chance.... We must abandon, as impoverished and dead-ended, the idea of a solely deterministic or solely ran- dom universe" (1983:29). Morin's argument here is empirical, not simply "metaphysical," for while, as Morin observes, "the notions of chance and ne- cessity are logically [and thus, in a certain sense, "metaphysically"] antagonis- tic and tend to exclude one another," the fact remains "that we see them as related" in actual experience (1983:29). Thus, distinguishing his position from "Michel Serres' adventurous exclamation: 'Yes, disorder preceeds order and</page><page sequence="6">Between Determinism and Indeterminism 23 only the first is real,' " Morin declares: "'What is real is the conjunction of or- der and disorder,' and I say that the problem of all modern knowledge is to conceive this conjunction" (1983:23). But how are we to conceive it? For Morin, we must begin by comparing "the present state of the problem of determinism" with past understandings (1983:23). For we must "not forget that the problem of determinism has changed over the course of a century," Morin writes, and that in "place of the idea of sovereign, anonymous, permanent laws directing all things in nature there has been substituted the idea of laws of interaction, that is, laws depend- ing on the interactions between physical bodies that depend on these laws" (1983:24). For example, "gravitation does not govern material bodies: it gov- erns the relationships between material bodies, and, without physical bodies or before their formation, there are no laws of gravity" (1983:24). In other words, we might say that the "laws" that govern material behavior do not transcend the systems in which they appear. They are not universals in the sense of tran- scendant Forms or Ideas but constitute instead the calculable behavioral proper- ties of particular material systems. Thus, rather than speaking of "laws" at all we should instead think in terms of the orderly behavior of specific phenomena, because, as Morin writes: Order means that there are other things besides "laws": that there are con- straints, invariances, regularities in our universe. The idea of order is richer than the idea of laws, and it permits us to understand that constraints, invariances, constancies, regularities depend upon singular, or variable conditions. Thus, it is the peculiar conditions of the genesis of our universe that determined the con- straints, which in turn determined the appearance, selection and stability of cer- tain particles, from which rules or laws of interaction between these particles were constituted. Thus, in place of the homogenizing and anonymous view of the old determinism, there has been substituted a diversifying and evolutive view of determinations (1983:24-25). Such a concept of universal order is dynamic rather than static, for rather than seeking a single, immutable causal origin behind the ordering of natural be- coming, it posits instead an eternal process of material action and interaction. This process, of course, is not without its contingencies, but this does not make it rationally unknowable because, as Morin argues, empirical contingency does not symmetrically oppose ordered regularity: rather, it can be seen to asym- metrically complement it. For as Morin writes, just "as order is not identified with the determinism of general laws governing nature, disorder, though it still includes it, is not identified with randomness or chance. Disorder is not a notion symmetric to order. It is a macroconcept which, while still containing the idea of random- ness, can include sometimes the ideas of disturbance and dispersion." Disor- der, too, has a material base, Morin suggests, for it burst "into the physical universe, along with thermodynamics, as heat, that is agitation, dispersion, degradation (of energy)," and has secured "itself in microphysical individual- ity, not only in the atoms or molecules of a gas, but in all subatomic particles,</page><page sequence="7">24 J. Fisher Solomon whose behavior is random, that is, unpredictable for an observer" (1983:25- 26). Disorder, the relative unpredictability of the behavior of microphysical en- tities, is thus, paradoxically enough, a regular feature of material reality. But while this irreducible unpredictability has, of course, prompted most twentieth-century scientists to abandon the ideal of a rationally predictable or determinate universal order, it is important to see what has taken its place; for it has not been a return to sheer irrationalism. That is, where in Newtonian physics "the foundation," as Niels Bohr has put it, "was laid of a deterministic description permitting, from the knowledge of the state of a physical system at a given moment, prediction of its state at any subsequent time" (1958:84), quantum-era physicists have laid a new foun- dation grounded in the statistical probability of sub-atomic behavior. Finding himself unable to obtain sharp measurements for both the positions and mo- menta of sub-atomic phenomena (thus violating the Newtonian requirement for a precise description of the initial state of the system), the quantum physi- cist statistically approximates the most likely states of the system. For example, in testing the behavior of a given "quantum of action" (say, a light photon), an experimenter can project a single light quanta through an aperture in order to record its absorptional behavior on a screen on the other side of the aperture, but he cannot be certain in advance of his experiment just how it is going to be absorbed. Sometimes the photon is absorbed as a wave, and sometimes as a particle. Jeremy Bernstein explains that according to the Born-Jordan inter- pretation of this experiment, "one cannot predict with certainty what an indi- vidual light quantum will do when it arrives at the aperture. One can only state what it is most likely to do-something that is determined by the Schr6- dinger wave function" (1973:175). Werner Heisenberg's interpretation of the philosophical implications of quantum-level experimentation and measurement accordingly concludes with the "decisive concept, that the laws of nature determine not the occurrence of an event, but the probability that an event will take place, and that probability must be related to a wave field that obeys a mathematically formulable wave equation" (1961:9). Now, the fact that the physicist's knowledge of a given physical system has been crossed by probabilistic uncertainty can be inter- preted as a kind of objective verification of what Derrida calls "destinerrance," because our certainty with respect to the destination of a particle that we our- selves have sent may seem to bear an analogy to the "destinerrance" of a Der- ridean post card, that is to say, of a missive whose possibility for misplacement can undermine our confidence in its postal "success." Actually, I would say that there is an equivalence here, but that this equivalence lies not in the errance of the two systems but rather in the probabilistically calculable potentiality dem- onstrated in each case that enables us to distinguish between a successful pre- diction and an unsuccessful one. For there is a difference between "destinerrance," which eludes restrictive calculation, and probabilistic potenti- ality, which can admit the hierarchical ranking of possibilities. A post card, af- ter all, stands a better chance, under ordinary circumstances, of being successfully delivered than not. Even Poe's "purloined letter" arrived at its proper destination before being stolen. "Success," in other words, is defined by</page><page sequence="8">Between Determinism and Indeterminism 25 the empirical norms of arrival. If we really didn't trust the post office we wouldn't use it. Similarly, the utility of the wave equations lies in their ability to approximate to a calculable margin of error the probable behavior of elec- tromagnetic quanta. A physicist cannot be certain just where a given electron in a given orbit or energy level may be found, but he can objectively calculate its most likely location and thus arrive at a certain understanding of the overall structure of an atomic system. How, then, or rather, why this should be the case poses a difficult philosophical question, a question to which Heisenberg has proposed an interesting answer. The "decisive step away from classical physics" that the wave equations have introduced into modern science, Heisenberg suggests, "can be inter- preted as a quantitative formulation of the concept of dynamis, possibility, or in the later Latin version, 'potentia,' in Aristotle's philosophy." That is, Heisen- berg continues: The concept that events are not determined in a peremptory manner, but that the possibility or "tendency" for an event to take place has a kind of reality-a certain intermediate layer of reality, halfway between the massive reality of mat- ter and the intellectual reality of the idea or image-this concept plays a decisive role in Aristotle's philosophy. In modern quantum theory this concept takes on a new form; it is formulated quantitatively as probability and subjected to mathe- matically expressible laws of nature. The laws of nature formulated in mathe- matical terms no longer determine the phenomena themselves, but the possibility of happening, the probability that something will happen (1961: 9-10). Thus, as Henry Stapp has put it, the "wave function of the quantum theory is most naturally interpreted as representing 'tendencies' or 'potentia' for actual events" (1986:265). And I would accordingly argue that it is precisely through the Aristotelian concept of dynamis, of empirical or material potentiality, that we may begin to conceive the "conjunction of order and disorder" of which Morin writes. What, then, is dynamis? In Aristotle's metaphysics, dynamis constitutes the "material" potentiality, power, or capacity of a thing, or kind of things. That is, as Aristotle writes: all things which are generated, whether by nature or by art, have matter; for there is a potentiality [dynamis] for each of them to be, and also not to be, and this potentiality is the matter in each (Metaphysics 1032a 20-22). Now, in the most general sense that Aristotle gives it, such a potentiality for be- ing constitutes the "ultimately underlying substrate" of nature, an eternal and ungenerated universal capacity for actuation in specific forms. But while the substrate as such is real, it is not so in a Platonic sense because it is essentially formless, and while it underlies particular genera and species it has no genus of its own. In other words, material potentiality, conceptually taken in itself, is not an entity, not a thing, but, rather, is an essential condition for the constitu- tion of empirical things. Conceiving such a "substrate" accordingly requires a modification of traditional realism. For this reason I would characterize an ac-</page><page sequence="9">26 J. Fisher Solomon ceptance of the reality of material potentiality as a "potentialist realism" by which the real existence of unextended material potentialities would be pos- ited, but only with the understanding that a "potentialist realism" as such is incomplete without the positing of Aristotle's equally essential concept of the eternal and ungenerated principle of formal actuation (energeia). For if the sub- strate of things were limited to the pure, indeterminate potentiality of "matter," such a potential would by definition be incapable of formal realization, thus leaving open the question as to how an indefinite substrate comes to be actu- ated in specifically formalized beings. Indeed, an ontology grounded in dynamis alone would seem to conform to the implied ontology of Michel Serres in which the "base" of the pyramid of being is conceived as a pure possibility that overshadows the mere beings of generated experience. The ontology of a "potentialist realism," to the contrary, would privilege neither the principle of indefinite potentiality (dynamis) nor definite actuality (energeia), but neither would it suspend their relation in a symmetrical opposition. So how might we otherwise conceive their relation? In Aristotelian terms, we can define the relation between material potenti- ality and formal actuality purposively, for natural "generation," as Aristotle writes, "is for the sake of an end; and the end is an actuality, and potentiality is viewed as being for the sake of this" (Metaphysics 1050a 8-9). For example, "An- imals do not see in order to have sight, but they have sight in order to see" (Metaphysics 1050a 10-11). Any particular member of the genus of "animals," in other words, has a capacity or potentiality for sight, but the capacity for sight must be formally actuated as seeing in order for it to emerge as an actual- ity. This does not mean that an animal must see and that blindness is ruled out for either special (e.g., moles) or particular cases, but it does define the stan- dard by which a failure to see might be constituted as a failure, as a "privation" of a certain natural capacity. Now, it is easy to ascribe to Aristotle a certain tel- eologism here, both in view of his own speculations on the "Prime Mover" and the general history of Scholastic Aristotelianism, but the teleology involved here is a specifically functionalist rather than a transcendentally universalist one. As W. Wieland has put it, while "teleology certainly plays an important role in Aristotle's science," it "is simply not that universal cosmic principle that it became in the course of time" (1975:142). Rather, according to Aristotle, as we reflect on the formal nature of specific things (or kinds of a thing) we find that they are ordered with respect to specific purposes, but these purposes do not have a universal extension, that is to say, have no universal form of their own. Different purposes belong to the different kinds of things in the world, without there being any final telos to which all things tend. Thus, again in Wieland's words, we may "see in Aristotle's conception of telos... a concept of reflection whose significance lies in its application to particular states of affairs... ," (1975:159) rather than to a transcendentally universal goal. The purposive actuation of a thing can be conceived accordingly in terms of a specific formal order, but this order subsists only in so far as it has come into composition with the relatively dis-ordered material potentiality that it ac- tuates in concrete beings. Potentiality, we might say, is never to be found in itself but only in a specific state, while actuality has always actualized something. For</page><page sequence="10">Between Determinism and Indeterminism 27 example, "The being of a triangular bronze will be a composition [synolon] of bronze and a triangle" (Metaphysics 1045b 15), Aristotle writes, but as H.G. Apostle explains, a "triangular bronze is not a composite of a triangle and a bronze in the sense that these two can be separated and exist apart and also be combined. Every instance of bronze has some shape, and every shape is with some matter, and bronze is to triangle as matter to actuality" (Apostle 1979:353). A bronze triangle, in other words, unites a specific material poten- tiality with its realization as such, but while the reflective principles by which we conceive this conjunction of potentiality and actuality may be separable for the purposes of a conceptual analysis, they are not separable in reality. As Aristotle puts it, "each thing is a kind of unity, and potentiality and actuality taken to- gether exist somehow as one" (Metaphysics 1045b 21-22). To complete our onto- logical formula for a "potentialist realism," then, we would have to say that the 'being' of an object consists neither in potentiality (dynamis) alone nor in actu- ality (energeia) alone, but rather in a dynamic composition (synolon) of what we might call "potentiality-and/also-actuality." And it is through this formulation that we might attempt to conceptualize the empirical conjunction of order (or regularly recurring shape) and disorder (or dynamic potentiality) in the things of our experience. The significance of this complementary conjunction or composition of po- tentiality and actuality lies in the way in which it modifies Serres' positing of the "base" of the ontological pyramid as pure "possibility" without arguing for the static identity of universal "matter"; for while it does not deny the ex- istence of the relatively indeterminate potentiality of being, it equally does not ignore the formal actuality of beings, their existence as regularly appearing and durational forms. This formulation still raises severe conceptual difficul- ties, however. For it might be asked, how are we to conceive the process by which potentiality becomes actual? Is becoming, for example, a step by step (or "digital") process, a series of discrete actuations? But then, where do we draw the line between actuations? Can't each formal actuation be divided into a smaller one, thus implying that no actuation can ever get started at all--just as Achilles can never catch Zeno's tortoise? Or is the process of formal actuation a continuous (or "analog") movement? But if this were the case, where could we draw the lines around a specific actuation in order to identify it as "this thing here" in the flux of becoming? Struggling with questions such as these, Alfred North Whitehead has pro- posed a sort of "digitalized" process ontology that sets a limit to the devisibil- ity of each unit "event" of becoming. That is, for Whitehead becoming occurs as a function of the actualizing atomization of discrete events within a poten- tialized "extensive continuum." As Whitehead puts it, the "extensive contin- uum" constitutes: that general relational element in experience whereby the actual entities experi- enced, and that unit experience itself, are united in the solidarity of one common world. The actual entities atomize it, and thereby make real what was anteced- ently merely potential. The atomization of the extensive continuum is also its temporalization; that is to say, it is the process of the becoming of actuality into what in itself is merely potential (Whitehead, as cited in Hurley 1986:102).</page><page sequence="11">28 J. Fisher Solomon Now, what "articulates" (though this is not quite the right word) the "exten- sive continuum" with the unit events of its actuation, is an event of becoming which, while it introduces spatio-temporal extension into being, is itself spatio- temporally unextended. That is, Whitehead writes, "'Extensiveness becomes, but "becoming" is not itself extensive' "; for "'in every act of becoming there is the becoming of something with temporal extension; but that act itself is not extensive, in the sense that it is divisible into earlier and later acts of becoming which correspond to the extensive divisibility of what has become"' (as cited in Hurley 1986:102). The act of becoming, for Whitehead, is thus a dimension- less "leap" of sorts through a kind of "fifth dimension" beyond spatio- temporal extension-"if," as Patrick Hurley puts it, "there is such a thing as a dimension that is not extensive" (Hurley 1986:103). In this way, Whitehead tries to avoid the implications of Zeno's paradox, for if the event of becoming itself is unextended then it cannot be infinitely divided. The atomized event of becoming accordingly appears as a minimal unit in a succession of unit-events. The trouble here, of course, is that Whitehead appears to have resolved the problem of discrete actuation by explaining the becoming of the spatio- temperal world in non-spatio-temporal terms. The centering motivation for spatio-temporal extension, in other words, appears to lie outside the play of space and time: a decentered center operating on the margins of actual and po- tential being. Jacques Derrida has long since deconstructed metaphysical no- tions of this kind in such essays as "Structure, Sign, and Play in the Discourse of the Human Sciences" (1972), but I would argue that Whitehead's solution is less "metaphysical" (in the bad sense) than it sounds. For it is not only the metaphysician who encounters a non-extended "space" between extended ac- tuations: the same might be said for the physicist who finds that there is no di- visible continuum between the energy levels of quantum states, no space "through" which a quantum of action "passes" as it emerges in a discontinu- ously different orbit. The fundamental units of atomic reality, as implied by Planck's analyses, seem to exist as units, as discrete energy actuations. In other words, there really seems to be an essential dimensionlessness to dimensional becoming. And this dimensionlessness, I suggest, can be understood in terms of the atemporal and spaceless relation between a specific potentiality and the formal actuality in which it is realized. Let us look at this relation again. Potentiality as such, we might say, is with- out spatio-temporal extension because it lacks any formal definition or actual- ity in itself. But at the same time, I am suggesting that there is no potentiality as such but only potentialities that belong to discretely actuated situations or things. Thus, a given potentiality is always found in some actual state. Now, we experience the formal actuality of a thing, not its potentiality, for a potentiality, as such, is only a rational concept. Still, it is one with an empirical foundation, something, that is to say, that we can take into account in our experience of ac- tual phenomena. A potentiality can be conceived in this sense as a kind of property inherent in specific physical situations, an "invisible" property that can be characterized as the unextended or dimensionless propensity to behave in rationally calculable ways that we find displayed in empirical reality. In es-</page><page sequence="12">Between Determinism and Indeterminism 29 sence, it is just such a concept of potentiality that underlies Karl Popper's "propensity interpretation" of the probabilism of quantum theory-an inter- pretation that, as we may see, also refers back to Aristotle's metaphysics. That is, while taking care to distinguish between his "propensity interpre- tation" of quantum mechanics and Aristotle's metaphysics of particular sub- stances, Popper has formulated what essentially amounts to a "potentialist" metaphysics in its own right. For Popper, in short, potentialities, or behavioris- tic "propensities," belong not to individual things in a "substantial" sense but to "total objective situation[s]" (Popper 1983:359)-e.g., the experimental conditions in which a physicist may seek to test the conjectured probability for a given quanta's particle-like or wave-like behavior. Thus, Popper writes, "the interpretation of the formalism of quantum mechanics is closely related to the interpretation of the calculus of probability" (1982a:64). Such an interpretation offers two choices: we may either view the calculus of probability subjectively, arguing that proba- bilistic calculations represent nothing more than our habitual beliefs about things, or objectively, arguing to the contrary that probabilities are objective properties of discrete empirical situations. Traditional, Humean empiricism, of course, subscribes to the first interpretation, but Popper's "propensity inter- pretation" of the probability calculus suscribes to the second, insisting in the spirit of scientific realism that "we can look upon probability as a real physical property of any concrete unique physical situation" (1982a:72). That is, as Popper ex- plains, the probability of a given event's occurrence is a part of the material "dispositions" or propensities of the situation at hand-as an unloaded die displays an experimental propensity for equi-probability in a sufficient num- ber of repeated throws. This propensity, Popper argues, can be viewed as an objective property of dice-throwing, but it is a peculiarly non-physical prop- erty because probabilities, as such, cannot be directly experienced. One only experiences an actual dice throw which, in its particularity, can defy expecta- tion. Still, the fact remains that in a large number of throws a propensity for equi-probability can be demonstrated, just as the beads on a probability board regularly form up into a bell curve, as Coppay remarks. The proof of this is that we can modify such intangible propensities by, for example, loading a die, which will produce a different set of dispositional properties-otherwise, no one would bother loading one. The relation between a propensity and the situation in which it inheres is thus a peculiarly dimensionless one. As Popper puts it, "the propensity or probability [inherent in a situation] is not (like baldness or charge) a property of the member of the population (man, particle) but somewhat more like the popularity (and consequently the sales statistic) of a certain brand of chocolate ... It would be awkward," Popper continues, "to speak of a 'duality' (a sym- metrical relation) between a bar of chocolate and the shape of the distribution curve of its propensity to be sold tomorrow" (1982a:82). A propensity, in other words, like an Aristotelian potentiality, does not subsist in an independently extended form of its own: it only subsists with respect to actual situations in which it remains empirically invisible and yet rationally calculable. It is in this sense that Popper describes a propensity as "a somewhat abstract kind of phys-</page><page sequence="13">30 J. Fisher Solomon ical property"; nevertheless, Popper argues, though a propensity is "invisible" to actual perception and is unextended as such, "it is a real physical property. To use Lande's terminology, it can be kicked, and it can kick back" (1982a:72). Popper's appeal to invisible material "dispositions" or propensities may sound rather like an occult reference to some sort of quantum era Schopen- hauerian "will," but if the reference is "metaphysical" it is only with respect to physical forces and quantities. As Popper explains: I have tried to explain the idea of a propensity as a kind of generalization of-or perhaps alternative to-the idea of force, mainly because the idea of force was also first viewed with suspicion by rationalist physicists who rightly viewed it as occult and metaphysical. But since then we have learned (or so I hope) that phys- ical science explains the known by the unknown, and the visible world by a hypo- thetical invisible world; and we have got used to the idea of forces. (Newton was never quite happy about the idea of an attractive force; Heinrich Hertz tried to do without it; and so did Einstein.) Thus we may likewise get used to that of pro- pensities (1982b:95). Such propensities, in other words, are not anthropomorphic desires, the blind struggling of a foundational will: they are a part of the dynamics of actual ma- terial systems. Popper's suggestions for the "metaphysical programme" that follows from his interpretation accordingly recall the Aristotelian metaphysics to which Heisenberg refers, for as Popper writes, such a program "might be summed up, in the concise language of the Ionian cosmologists, by the state- ment: 'Everything is a propensity.' Or in the terminology of Aristotle we might say: 'To be is both to be the actualization of a prior propensity to become, and to be a propensity to become.'" Thus, Popper continues, the "Aristotelian view of inherent potentialities and their actualization" can be "developed into a relational theory in which relational structures, instead of inhering in each ma- terial thing, may be characterized by*potentialities" (1982a:206). What distinguishes Popper's relational metaphysics from Derrida's decon- struction of the metaphysics of presence lies precisely in Popper's acceptance of the empirical reality of potentiality and the rational calculability that follows from such an acceptance. Similar to the "potentialist realism" I am arguing for, Popper's position does not hold the present or actual to be a determinately static identity; nor does it suspend the present or the actual between the meta- physical poles of determinism-indeterminism. Rather, according to a "poten- tialist realism," the present can be regarded as a situational synthesis of actuated propensities that in turn bear real though spatio-temporally unex- tended potentialities for future actuations. Thus, where Derrida remarks that a description of the movement of "diff6rance" as "an 'originary' and irreduci- bly nonsimple... synthesis of marks, or traces of retentions and protentions ... reveal[s] itself to be inadequate" (1982a: 13), a "potentialist realism" would accept the movement of becoming precisely as a synthesis of actuated potenti- alities that in turn bear rationally calculable propensities for future actuation. But where, it might be asked, do potentialities or propensities come from? Certainly not from some final "matter" existing by itself or in itself, unex- tended and indifferent. Rather, contemporary physical research suggests that</page><page sequence="14">Between Determinism and Indeterminism 31 the primary constituents of material reality (forces, quarks, and so on) are themselves not static realities but instead constitute dynamic fields of relation in and through which actual quantum entities are actuated. The ontology im- plied here suggests neither a monism of possibilities nor a dualism of separable potentialities and actualities; in fact, the relation of potentiality and actuality can be defined neither as a dualism nor as a monism. What is more, a "poten- tialist realism" does not seek to account for the origin of the ontology of potentiality-actuality but only for that orderly regularity in nature by which the normative and the accidental may be rationally distinguished--not suspended-within the infinite suspensions of "difffrance." For his part, when asked "Can it be said that.. .'potentia' has a profound origin?" Heisenberg answers quite simply, "To a certain extent, yes" (1961:35). The profundity of this "origin" is precisely in its unfathomability, but this does not mean that potentiality is simply a reflection of human reason; somehow reality does present us with a world of potential regularities. We can, more often than not, experience the regular behavior of a probability board, or the probabilistic calculability of a quantum of action, or the statistically pre- dictable course of genetic inheritance. It is logically possible, of course, that a probability board might display a different curve each time, or that sub-atomic quanta might behave differently in every experiment, defying not only all cal- culation but all identification as well. But somehow this does not seem to be the case, and it is this paradoxical regularity, this probabilistic constraint on the logically possible, that a potentialist metaphysics would seek to conceive.
