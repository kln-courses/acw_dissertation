XI</page><page sequence="9">PART I POTTERY</page><page sequence="10">CHAPTER ONE INTRODUCTION TO THE POTTERY OF DEIR EL-BALAH Bonnie Gould, Trude Dothan and Avriel Adler The pottery from Deir el-Balah derives from nine strata, extending from the Late Bronze Age to the Byzantine period. The bulk of the ceramic corpus dates from the Late Bronze Age II (Strata IX-V), the main period of occupation in both the settlement and the cemetery. The pottery from Stratum III dates from the Philistine period, Stratum II from the 10th century BCE, and Stratum I from the Byzantine era. The Late Bronze Age II ceramics from Deir el-Balah are dominated by a large assemblage of locally made utilitarian wares that are predominantly Egyptian in style. A limited range of traditional Canaanite shapes, typical of the Late Bronze Age, appears alongside this central group. The paucity of non-utilitarian wares is conspicuous in both the settlement and the cemetery of Deir el-Balah: only a few vessels of relatively fine execution, including imports from Cyprus, the Greek mainland, Crete and Egypt, were found. Afew vessels of local manufacture imitate Cypriot and Mycenaean imports. Several alternative methods of constructing a ceramic typology were initially considered. The ideal method, according to function, was rejected as being too hypothetical on the basis of our present knowledge (Holthoer 1977; although we rely heavily on Holthoer's ceramic typology of Egyptian and Nubian wares, his separation of vessels with primary function indicators, such as storage jars, beerbottles, stands, etc., was employed only selectively here). A typology dependent upon stratigraphy proved to be redundant, as the same ceramic types appear throughout the Late Bronze Age levels. Consequently, since the pottery from Deir el-Balah is characterized by a variety of ceramic traditions, our approach was to identify provenance-related groups: Egyptian, Canaanite, Cypriot and Mycenaean/Minoan. Within each group, the ceramic typology was constructed in the conventional manner, dividing each group according to form. The distinction between vessels of Egyptian and Canaanite style was not always clear. Occasionally, a combination of the two ceramic traditions produced a truly hybrid vessel. In other instances, a particular ceramic type appears contemporaneously in both Egypt and Canaan, a circumstance that obscures its original place of manufacture. Thus, in the case of the utilitarian wares from the Late Bronze Age II levels, there are forms that are classified as Egyptian in style, others that are Canaanite in style, and a third group of hybrid forms that are represented in both cultures. All of these groups, regardless of their ethnic association, display common technical and morphological features. This is true of the fabric that characterizes most of the utilitarian wares, a homogeneous local clay invariably tempered with organic matter. The technique of clay preparation used in the wares found at Deir el-Balah is considered to be of Egyptian inspiration and is not well documented at Late Bronze Age Canaanite sites. However, the kind of levigating material used in the preparation of clay depends on the raw materials immediately accessible in quantity and at minimum expense. All common inorganic tempers, with the exception of fine sand, are rare at Deir el-Balah. Organic matter was the cheapest raw material available in the immediate vicinity, as is evident from the inclusions found within the locally made wares. The use of straw as a temper is a typically Egyptian feature. 3</page><page sequence="11">CHAPTER ONE Other technical and morphological features that characterize the utilitarian wares suggest that the methods of pottery fabrication employed at Deir el-Balah were more akin to Egyptian than to Canaanite traditions. These include such features as perforated bases, fingerprints, rope impressions and string-cut bases - all common characteristics of New Kingdom pottery found in Egypt. Surface treatment, consisting of a red wash, red rim, and red, blue and occasionally white bands, is reminiscent of Egyptian modes. Red, blue and yellow pigments were found during excavation of the settlement, indicating that these wares were produced at the site. In general, the utilitarian wares from Deir el-Balah are carelessly fabricated, characterized by unsmoothed surfaces and asymmetrical shapes. Certain standards were employed here with regard to terminology and the description and illustration of the ceramics. Throughout the study of the Egyptian-style pottery, we refer to R. Holthoer 's classification of Egyptian and Nubian wares (1977: 41-59) as well as the various suggestions put forth by La Groupe Internationale (1975). In view of the close relationship between the Egyptian and Canaanite ceramic assemblages, these standards were imposed on the classification of the Canaanite- style pottery as well. This study aims to illustrate the ceramics from Deir el-Balah in a manner that suits the character of the assemblage. One must employ caution when constructing a ceramic typology; an attempt to impose an arbitrary framework on objects that were created according to different standards can result in misleading conclusions. In this study we found that a flexible approach to the material helped to dismiss many of the problems inherent in a ceramic classification (e.g., transitional types, composite shapes). Further, our analysis credits the individual potter with many of the peculiarities displayed by particular vessels. In summary, we prefer to downplay the differences between the Egyptian and Canaanite ceramic repertoires and to view the assemblage as a single unit that resulted from the intermingling of Egyptian and Canaanite ceramic traditions. The Late Bronze Age wares are generally presented in this volume both in the typological figures in their appropriate chapters and in plates according to their context. The ceramics from tomb deposits and associated loci (in Vol. I, Chapter 1) are illustrated according to context; however, some vessels from the cemetery are also employed as parallels in the typology, since the cemetery yielded complete examples of most of the types found only in fragmentary condition in the settlement. Assemblages from individual Late Bronze Age loci (Pis. 1-59) are arranged on the plates in the following order (whenever possible): Canaanite style, Egyptian style, Cypriot and Mycenaean imports and their local imitations. A somewhat different approach was adopted for pottery assigned to strata postdating the Late Bronze Age. The pottery of Stratum III (Pis. 60-64) derives from four pits assigned to this stratum, as well as from the wadi and from scattered surface finds. Only the pottery from the four stratified pits is illustrated here, first Philistine wares and then other wares (Dothan 1982). Stratum II wares appear in limited quantities; sherds mostly deriving from the wadi of Stratum I (Chapter 10, Figs. 10.1-2) are augmented by the ceramics from two stratified pits (PI. 65). Roman-Byzantine pottery (Stratum I) was discovered only in the wadi and surface loci and is therefore presented briefly in a typological format (Chapter 11, Fig. 11.1). Because of the complex stratigraphy at the site, there are a number of loci, some of which were rich in finds, whose stratigraphie assignment remains problematic. In addition to the difficulties caused by the sandy nature of the terrain, the small size of the excavated area and the limited time available, the nature of the ancient settlement itself limited the quantity of ceramics that were of value to this study. All of the architectural elements at Deir el-Balah were built of sun-dried mudbricks, which were often difficult to discern from the surrounding fill. Floors were unplastered and generally lacking in distinguishing features. One of the major architectural units at the site, the fortress of Stratum VII, lacked any associated floor levels. Furthermore, the site had suffered from various 4</page><page sequence="12">INTRODUCTION TO THE POTTERY OF DEIR EL-BALAH disturbances in antiquity prior to the accumulation of the sand dunes: severe erosion and the collapse of the mudbrick architectural elements, pit activity in all levels, and the wadi that flowed past the site in Byzantine times. Though the occupation of the site from the 14th to the 12th centuries BCE encompasses several building phases, its cultural identity is remarkably homogeneous. Changes in pottery forms during the Late Bronze Age are minor, particularly with regard to the assemblage of Egyptian-style vessels. Egyptian pottery itself is characterized by its continuity and endurance, some ceramic types undergoing only minimal changes over long periods. Only a small proportion of the pottery at Deir el-Balah derives from well-stratified floor levels and the ceramic repertoire derives to a great extent from pits, a condition that limits the value of the pottery in the construction of a relative chronology. Moreover, because of the unusual circumstances of the excavations, we were unable to carry out statistical analysis of the sherds. The value of the pottery thus lies not in its contribution to a relative chronology, but rather in its vivid testimony to the interplay between Egyptian and Canaanite traditions.

The archaeological evidence of the Egyptianizing of Canaanite culture, particularly in southern Canaan and along the main trade routes, has recently become a subject of interest. It is one of the aims of this study to present comprehensive documentation of Late Bronze Age Canaanite sites where Egyptian pottery has been discovered. In this way, we have attempted to represent the Egyptian- style ceramic assemblage from Deir el-Balah as one element in a broader spectrum. Egyptian-style pottery represents the principal ceramic group from Late Bronze Age II contexts at Deir el-Balah. Almost all the vessels in this category are utilitarian in nature and coarse in appearance. A few are painted, usually with simple bands, and occasionally with slightly more intricate patterns. Vessels treated with a thick white or cream-colored burnished slip (some storage jars, flasks and juglets) constitute a small special group. Because of the surface treatment and fabric of these vessels, we suspected that they were of Egyptian manufacture. However, the enormous quantities of coarse-ware vessels, as well as the results of Neutron Activation Analysis, suggest a local provenance (see Chapter 3). In general, the Egyptian-style pottery from Deir el-Balah is characterized by handleless, wheelmade shapes that were produced at the site. * This chapter has not been updated. The distinction between vessels of Egyptian and Canaanite style was not always clear. Occasionally, a combination of the two ceramic traditions produced a truly hybrid vessel. In other instances, a particular ceramic type appears contemporaneously in both Egypt and Canaan, a circumstance that obscures its original place of manufacture. However, many of the forms and wares encountered at Deir el-Balah display common technical and morphological features, regardless of their ethnic association. Certain problems encountered here are specific to the study of ancient Egyptian pottery. The prevailing interest in the monumental structures and royal tombs of the ancient Egyptians has resulted until recently in the infrequent excavation of sites of domestic nature. Simple graves, in contrast, have been excavated in large numbers but have rarely received proper publication. Although the pottery from burials may be consistent with that from domestic sites, there are certain differences between them. Consequently, the published pottery of Egyptian provenance that is comparable in context and date to that from Deir el-Balah is limited to only a few sites. At Deir el-Balah, while the ceramic assemblages from the cemetery and settlement are generally consistent, a few ceramic types that appear in the domestic quarters do not appear in the excavated tombs. Moreover, it is probable that certain vessels were intentionally produced for purposes of interment; these, while known in domestic contexts, appear in relatively greater quantities in the cemetery. Until recently, the classification of ancient Egyptian pottery was a neglected field of study. Apart from the major contribution to our understanding of Egypt's prehistoric pottery by Flinders Petrie 7</page><page sequence="14">CHAPTER TWO (1901), until recently little progress was made in the analysis of pottery from the Pharaonic periods (Holthoer 1977: 1-4). The establishment of an international team of experts in 1973, headed by Dorothea Arnold, and the subsequent publication by its participants have kindled new interest in the ceramics of ancient Egypt (La Groupe Internationale 1975; Buchmann et al. 1980; Arnold 198 1 ; Bourriau 198 1 ; Kemp 1984). Interest among Israeli archaeologists in Egypto-Canaanite relations, was, in part, the result of increased field activity in Sinai prior to its return to Egypt in 1981 . The uniformity that characterizes Egyptian pottery through the ages limits its value as a chronological indicator, particularly at Deir el-Balah, where the period of occupation is relatively short. Although modifications of certain vessel shapes and decorative motifs do occur in the Egyptian ceramic repertoire, these changes rarely influence our assemblage. For example, funnel-necked jars are limited to XVIIIth and XlXth Dynasty contexts in Egypt; at Deir el- Balah this is irrelevant, as the occupation spans only this period. Most of the Egyptian-style pottery from Deir el-Balah encompasses such enduring shapes as bowls and certain kinds of ovoid and globular jars, which display only minor alterations over long periods of time. TYPOLOGY Our approach to the typology of Egyptian-style pottery at Deir el-Balah conforms as much as possible to the conventional means of describing pottery employed among Israeli archaeologists today. This, however, differs significantly from the classification proposed by Holthoer (1977) and defined by La Groupe Internationale ( 1 975) , both of which have contributed greatly to our study. The individual features of the ceramic assemblage from Deir el-Balah, particularly the Egypto-Canaanite hybridization of certain ceramic types, have also influenced the method of classification employed here. Accordingly, the bowls are illustrated and discussed in the present chapter on Egyptian-style pottery, while the kraters are discussed in the chapter on Canaanite pottery (Chapter 4), although both ceramic families display hybrid or composite elements. The ceramic families of Egyptian-style pottery are presented in the following order: bowls, ovoid jars, globular jars, necked jars, funnel-necked jars, beerbottles, storage jars, spinning bowls, goblets, stands, flasks and juglets. TECHNIQUE The fabric that characterizes many of the utilitarian wares is a homogenous local clay invariably tempered with organic matter. This technique of clay preparation is considered to be of Egyptian stimulus and is not well documented at Late Bronze Age Canaanite sites. However, the kind of levigating material used in the preparation of clay depends upon the raw materials accessible in quantity. At Deir el-Balah stone is a rare commodity, as is all inorganic temper except for the finest sand. Organic material was the temper most abundantly available in the immediate vicinity. Other technical and morphological features that characterize the utilitarian wares suggest that the methods of pottery fabrication employed at Deir el- Balah were more akin to Egyptian than Canaanite conventions. These include such features as perforated bases, fingerprints, rope impressions and string-cut bases, which are common characteristics of New Kingdom pottery found in Egypt. We have mentioned above the special group of vessels treated with a thick white or cream-colored burnished slip. A different surface treatment, consisting of a red wash, red painted rim, and bands of red, blue and occasionally white, is also reminiscent of Egyptian modes. Red, blue, and yellow pigments were found during excavation of the settlement, indicating that these decorated wares may have been produced at the site, along with the decoration found on anthropomorphic coffin fragments and other finds of the material culture associated with the artisans' quarter. I. BOWLS (Fig. 2.1; Photos 2.1-5) Although only Bowl Types B , D and G have clearly been identified here as Egyptian in shape, the Late 8</page><page sequence="15">EGYPTIAN POTTERY Bronze Age II bowls from both the settlement and the cemetery of Deir el-Balah display features that are characteristic of Egyptian bowls of New Kingdom date. During the XVIIIth and XlXth Dynasties in Egypt, simple flat or rounded bases are dominant. In Canaan, simple bowls with ring or disc bases and incurved profiles are widespread during the Late Bronze Age II, while flat-based bowls are less frequently represented. Carinated bowls , reminiscent of Middle Bronze Age II types , appear occasionally in Canaan during the early part of the period; towards the end of the Late Bronze Age carinated bowls of a different style appear. At Deir el-Balah, as in Egypt, simple bowls with flat bases and incurved or flared contours dominate the ceramic repertoire of the Late Bronze Age II, though a few carinated bowls appear in the last phase of the Late Bronze Age (Stratum IV). The assemblage of bowls from Late Bronze Age II contexts at Deir el-Balah displays striking similarities in shape, ware and execution to Egyptian bowls of New Kingdom date. Nonetheless, the large collection of bowls from Deir el-Balah includes three provenance-related groups: types that are certainly Egyptian in style (Types B, D and G), others that exhibit Canaanite influence (Type F) and a third group that is represented in both regions (Types A, C and E). These distinctions, however, apply mainly to the shapes of the bowls; the clays and techniques of fabrication employed in the manufacture of the bowl types are constant. Thus, the entire collection of bowls from Late Bronze Age II contexts at Deir el-Balah is discussed here as a single unit. The most common ware found among the bowls of Late Bronze Age II date from Deir el-Balah is a fairly soft and porous material mixed with a large amount of organic temper (see the plate descriptions), characteristic of pottery of Egyptian manufacture. This ware varies according to the firing temperature and the addition of other kinds of tempering materials. A finer clay, better levigated and mixed with fine grits or sand, occasionally appears among the standard bowls from Deir el- Balah, particularly at the end of the Late Bronze Age (see e.g., PI. 42:1-2, 4). Also reminiscent of Egyptian ceramic traditions are certain technological features displayed by the bowls from Deir el-Balah. The flat bases of most of the bowls are typically marked with the fan-like impression of the cutting string (Holthoer 1977: 45-46). The careless formation of the bowls from Deir el-Balah on the whole, as among bowls of Egyptian provenance, is a result of the type of clay and temper, the speed with which the vessels were produced and the firing conditions. Most of the bowls from Deir el-Balah display marks left by an instrument or cloth used to trim away the lower walls of the bowl during the last stage of fabrication, when the vessel was turned onto its rim. This technique often left a slight thickening on the exterior wall of the bowl where the potter left off the trimming process; bowls of Egyptian provenance frequently display this characteristic (e.g., Nagel 1938: Pis. III:DM 22:21; VII:359.239; IX: 1922:86). The use of red paint on the rim or a red wash over the entire surface of the vessel are also traits associated with Egyptian bowls. At Deir el-Balah, bowls represent the most common ceramic family, outnumbering all other kinds of vessels. As is often the case when dealing with evidence from the excavation of settlement sites, the bulk of the material from Deir el-Balah consists of fragmentary vessels that usually do not provide enough information for the construction of an accurate typology. Consequently, the construction of the present classification depended initially on vessels with complete profiles. Fortunately, most of the fragmentary bowls could be identified with the various types thus defined. Although we have taken into account the terminology and methods of analysis suggested by Holthoer (1977: 109) and La Groupe Internationale (1975), we have not employed their division of bowls into the ceramic families of cups and bowls, denoting vessels with an incurved contour, and saucers and plates, including vessels with a flared profile. The presentation together of bowls with incurved, straight or flared profiles was felt to be the most effective method of presenting the various transitional forms that occur in our assemblage.

Three additional bowl types are characterized by primary function indicators and are discussed separately: these are krater bowls and spouted bowls (see Chapter 4) and spinning bowls (see below). Variations (subtypes) are apparent within each bowl type; these are often defined by the nat'îre and individual characteristics of the main bowl type. Variants within the subtype are defined by the use of color on the rim or body of the vessel. BOWL TYPE A (Fig. 2.1:1-3) Bowls of Type A are small and medium-sized vessels with a rounded base (sometimes pointed or flattened), non-composite contour, shallow to medium-deep shape and plain rim. Two subtypes (Al and! A2) are distinguished on the basis of differences in size and contour. A variation of these bowls, represented by only one example from Deir el-Balah, consists of a medium-sized bowl with a rounded base and a composite contour (PI. 27:15). Subtype Al (Fig. 2.1 : 1-2) ťefers to small bowls with a rounded or slightly pointed base, inflected contour, shallow to medium-deep shape and direct plain rim. The contour of these vessels varies from those with a slight, fairly high inflection (e.g., Fig. 2.1i:l) to less common bowls with a more pronouf&amp;ed inflection located lower down on the vessel wall (e.g., PI. 33:3). Variants with a rim painted red on the exterior, or both interior and exterior, are quite common (Fig. 2.1:2; Pis. 50:3; 54:2). Bowls of Subtype Al derive mainly from Stratum IX or possible Stratum IX loci (1006, 1009, 1392, 1913), although many fragmentary examples are found in pits of Strata VI-IV. Subtype A2 (Fig. 2.1:3) consists of medium- sized bowls with a rounded or flattened base, direct contour, medium-deep shape and simple rim. The resemblance of these bowls to vessels of Subtype C2, the most common bowl type at Deir el-Balah, suggests the possibility that Subtype A2 was a by-product of the mass-production of these simple, flat-based bowls. Nonetheless, the group of complete vessels with rounded bases is large enough to warrant its inclusion here. Examples of Subtype A2 derive from possible Stratum IX contexts (e.g., Loci 1009, 1913) as well as from a Stratum V kiln (Locus 540). Bowls with rounded bases are depicted in wall reliefs from New Kingdom tombs illustrating banqueting and offering scenes, functioning as containers of liquid for drinking or libation (Holthoer 1977: 115). Bowls of both Subtypes Al and A2 are known from Tell el- Amarna (Peet and Woolley 1923: Pis. XLVI-XLVII) and from Buhen (Randall-Maclver and Woolley 1911: Type SXX:1116) and Aniba (Steindorff 1937: Type 6a: 3-4) as well as from the Scandinavian Joint Expedition survey in Nubia (Holthoer 1977: PI. 12</page><page sequence="19">EGYPTIAN POTTERY Photo 2.1. Bowls. Photo 2.2. Bowl (Fig. 2.1:2). Photo 2.3. Bowls. Photo 2.4. Bowl (Fig. 2.1:9). Photo 2.5. Bowls and other vessels. 13</page><page sequence="20">CHAPTER TWO 25). They are generally dated to the New Kingdom, though Middle Kingdom examples are also known (Buhen Type II; Randall-Maclver and Woolley 1911: PI. 93). In Canaan, small bowls with rounded bases, often treated with red color on the rim, are well represented in Late Bronze Age II and Iron Age I contexts at Beth-Shean (Fitzgerald 1930: Pis. XLI:7; L:2). At Beth-Shean, as at Deir el-Balah, Subtype Al is more common than A2. BOWL TYPE B (Fig. 2.1:4) Type B consists of a small group of bowls characterized by a rounded or slightly pointed base, medium to small size, shallow or occasionally medium-deep shape and everted, often flanged rim. Most examples display a slight inflection on the lower wall of the vessel. Below this point, marks left by an instrument used to finish the base are visible. At Deir el-Balah, most complete examples of Type B derived from unclear Late Bronze Age II loci (see Pis. 50:1, 6; 51:2; 52:2-3; 54:10-11). PI. 50:6, characterized by a flat base, is unique in our collection and may be considered a subtype of Bowl Type B. Fragmentary examples of bowls of Type B were found in a Stratum VIII pit (PI. 18:2), in a Stratum VII pit (PI. 22: 1) and in the crater fill of Stratum VI (PI. 27:7). Bowls of Type B are common in Egypt during the New Kingdom, appearing at Tell el- Amarna (Peet and Woolley 1923: PI. XLVII:V/85, 103, 187, 1003-1004, 1052), Gurob (Brunton and Engelbach 1927: Pis. XXXIII:2K;XLII:2B, U, V) and Deir el-Medineh (Nagel 1938: Fig. 6) as well as in Nubia at Aniba (Steindorff 1937: Type 96:3) and Buhen (Randall-Maclver and Woolley 1911: Type SXXIII). Examples of Middle Kingdom and Second Intermediate Period dates are known from Harageh (Engelbach and Gunn 1923: PI. 34:2E), Gurob (Petrie 1890: PI. 13:98) and Qurneh (Petrie 1909: Pis. 13:7; 14 upper), attesting to the Egyptian derivation of these bowls. Indeed, bowls of this type are quite rare in Canaanite contexts of Late Bronze Age II date, appearing in the published material only at Beth-Shean (Fitzgerald 1930: PI. XLI:3; James 1966: Figs. 19:5; 49:9; Oren 1973a: Fig. 48a:2) and possibly at Megiddo (Shipton 1939: PI. 2:5). BOWL TYPE C (Fig. 2.1:5-8) Type C consists of medium-sized, occasionally small, bowls with a flat base, non-composite inflected contour, medium-deep or deep shape and plain rim. Included in this category are the most common bowls found at Deir el-Balah during the Late Bronze Age II period, Subtypes C2 (Fig. 2.1:6) and C3 (Fig. 2.1:7). Subtype CI (Fig. 2.1:5) is classified separately due to its high inflected contour. Subtypes C2 and C3 exhibit either a simple contour or a low inflection and are distinguished by differences in base width. Subtype C4 (Fig. 2.1:8) includes deep bowls with a direct or slightly inflected contour. A possible fifth subtype, represented only by fragmentary examples, encompasses a group of shallow bowls with a non-composite contour (Pis. 11:9, 11; 33:1,4; 37:1; 40:2; 44:3). Within each of these subtypes, we have noted a degree of variation as well as certain overlapping traits. Bowls of Subtype CI (Fig. 2.1:5) are characterized by a narrow flat base, inflected contour, medium-deep shape and simple rim. Some variation in size occurs: while medium-sized bowls are the most common (Fig. 2.1:5), smaller examples are known (PI. 5 1 : 1 ). Variants of Subtype CI include a fragmentary vessel with a red wash covering the entire body (PI. 24:2). Examples of Subtype CI were retrieved from Stratum IX and possibly IX contexts (Pis. 3:1; 4:8; 11:4; 51:1; 54:5), a pit of Stratum IV (PI. 38:4) and several undefined contexts. Subtypes C2 (Fig. 2.1:6) and C3 (Fig. 2.1:7) represent the most common bowls at Deir el- Balah during the Late Bronze Age II. Subtype C2 is defined by its fairly broad flat base, incurved direct or slightly inflected contour, medium-deep shape and simple rim. Medium-sized bowls of this category occur in quantity at Deir el-Balah, although small sizes are represented as well. Subtype C3 may be considered a variation of C2, the only difference being its narrow base. However, for convenience and clarity we have classified it separately in the present typology. There is so 14</page><page sequence="21">EGYPTIAN POTTERY much variation within the limits of the definition of Subtype C3 that a bowl with a narrow base, direct contour and medium-deep shape (e.g., PI. 11:15) looks very different from examples of the same subtype with a low inflected contour and broad base (e.g., Fig. 2.1:7) and, in fact, much more like vessels of Subtype C4 (Fig. 2.1:8). Moreover, there are examples of both Subtypes C3 and C4 (e.g., PI. 11:4-6, 7) that are closely related to examples of Subtype El (Fig. 2.1:11). Bowls of Subtypes C2 and C3 are usually characterized by a direct contour, although there are a number of examples that exhibit a slight inflection on the lower wall (PI. 3:5-6). On occasion, the inflection can be quite pronounced (e.g., PI. 4:8). Most often, though, the inflection appears only on the exterior wall of the bowl and does not affect the interior contour of the vessel. This phenomenon is most likely related to the final stage of the manufacturing process when the bowl was turned onto its rim and the base and lower walls were finished, sometimes with a hard instrument. The line of the exterior inflection may thus represent the point at which the potter terminated the finishing of the lower part of the vessel. This trait is illustrated by many of the bowls of various types from Deir el-Balah. Bowls of Subtypes C2 and C3 appear at our site throughout the Late Bronze Age II strata and continue in Iron Age pits. Characteristically for Deir el-Balah, the greatest number of complete vessels derive from Stratum IX loci including floors and pits (e.g., Loci 331, 1006, 1161; Pis. 5:2; 10:5; 15:10). These bowls continued in use during Stratum VIII, as witnessed by the discovery of a vessel in Locus 1 157 (PI. 17: 1). Pits of Stratum VI, V and IV yielded a considerable number of these bowls (e.g., Pis. 16:2; 24:3-5; 26:1; 27:4; 33:3; 34:1; 42:1). Subtype C4 (Fig. 2.1:8) represents a small group of medium-sized and small bowls with a narrow flat base, non-composite contour, deep shape and simple rim. The walls of these bowls are usually straight (direct contour), although incurved or slightly inflected contours are also represented (e.g., Pis. 11:10; 54:8). One fragmentary example (PI. 11:10) has a red wash on the exterior that continues onto the exterior of the rim. Examples derive from Stratum IX and possibly IX loci (e .g . , 1 0 1 3 , 1 9 1 3 ) , Stratum VIII (Locus 1029) and several unstratified contexts. Parallels for Type C bowls from Egyptian New Kingdom contexts are numerous, representing all of the subtypes discussed here. Most of the bowls, as at Deir el-Balah, belong to Subtypes C2 and C3 . The amount of comparative material is quite large and we therefore refer here only to select examples of Type C bowls from Egypt: Subtypes Cl , C2 and C3 are known at the workmen's village at Deir el- Medineh (Nagel 1938: Pl. X:22:61 K56). BOWL TYPE D (Fig. 2.1:9-10) Type D is defined as medium-sized, flared bowls with a flat, usually broad base, non-composite contour, shallow shape and everted or direct rim. At Deir el-Balah, such bowls comprise one of the most common types, second only to Type C. They range in date from Stratum IX to IV. Two subtypes of Type D are shown on the typology plate, classified according to the shape of the rim. A third possible subtype, represented by only a few fragments, consists of medium-large shallow bowls with an everted rim (e.g., Loci 1023, 1133; Pis. 13:6; 18:3, 15-16). Subtype D1 (Fig. 2.1 :9) represents the dominant shape in this group and is characterized by an everted rim and concave upper termination. Most examples are fairly shallow in shape; one extremely shallow vessel derived from Locus 1 9 1 3 (PI . 54: 1 2) . Some of the fragmentary vessels appear to have a slightly deeper shape and are considered to be transitional to Subtype El . One fragmentary bowl of this type from Locus 1348 is very small. Only a slight variation in execution and finish is noted within Subtype Dl. Most examples are coarsely made and sometimes asymmetrical (e.g., Locus 1392; PI. 51:3). The ware is often quite porous and soft and shows a large amount of organic temper. A few fragmentary examples dating from later phases of the Late Bronze Age are more carefully executed and of a better levigated clay lacking organic matter (e.g., Locus 402; PI. 42:4). One example from a surface locus (Locus 401) has very thick walls, 15</page><page sequence="22">CHAPTER TWO in contrast to most bowls of this type, which have rather thin or medium-thick walls. Subtype D2 (Fig. 2.1:10) consists of shallow, flat-based bowls with a direct or inflected contour and a direct rim that sometimes shows a slight flare. Some examples are slightly inflected about halfway up the wall of the vessel, while others have irregularly executed walls (see Locus 1913; PI. 54:12, 14-16). Related to this subtype are incurved shallow bowls of Subtype CI (Fig. 2.1 :5). Medium-deep bowls with a direct contour and rim are grouped together with the medium-deep bowls with everted rim of Subtype Fl (Fig. 2.1 : 14). Bowls of Subtype D2 from Deir el-Balah are a small group that, when they can be stratigraphically identified, appear in Stratum IX or possible Stratum IX loci. Bowls of Type D are common throughout the New Kingdom period in Egypt and Sudan, appearing at Tell el-Amarna (Peet and Woolley 1923: PI. XLVII:VII/1003), Deir el-Medineh (Nagel 1938: Fig. 66:40), Aniba (Steindorff 1937: Type 8b:l),SemnaFort (Reisner 1960: Fig. 2.11) and in the Scandinavian Joint Expedition survey (Holthoer 1977: Fig. 27). Shallow flared bowls with a disc or ring base are widespread during the Late Bronze Age II in Canaan, e.g., at Lachish (Tufnell et al. 1940: Pl. XXXVII:90). One example with a red painted rim is dated to Stratum VIII at Megiddo (Loud 1948: PI. 61:11). At Beth-Shean these bowls are not as common as might be expected in light of the site's pronounced Egyptian character (Fitzgerald 1930: Pis. XLI:2; XLIV:4). BOWL TYPE E (Fig. 2.1:11-13) Type E is characterized by a large and varied group of bowls with a flat base, usually medium- deep shape, concave upper termination and flared, modelled or unmodelled rim. Size ranges from small to medium-large. The shape, although usually medium-deep, is occasionally shallow (transitional to Type D) or deep (transitional to Type F). Although Type D bowls are considerably shallower than even the shallowest variation of Type E, they are nonetheless related to Type E. Moreover, certain affinities to Subtype C4 are discernible, although Type E bowls almost always show a concave upper termination. Some bowls of Subtype E2 are similar in contour to vessels of Subtype Fl, but have flat rather than ring bases. Subtype El (Fig. 2.1:11) consists of small and medium-sized bowls with flat, flared, modelled or unmodelled rim. Two fragmentary bowls have a red wash on the interior (Locus 1013, PI. 11:10; Locus 1139). Most of the bowls are of medium size, although two small fragmentary bowls derive from Locus 1377 (Pis. 2:11; 53:2). As noted above, some bowls exhibit characteristics transitional to Subtype C4, with an almost straight upper termination and only a hint of flare to the rim (e.g., Locus 598, PI. 39:11; Locus 1066, PI. 23:10). The greatest number of examples of Subtype El are, however, characterized by a flared, unmodelled rim and a medium-deep shape, as illustrated in Fig. 2.1:11. This kind of bowl is often referred to as "V-shaped." The dominant group of bowls of Subtype El displays two types of rim: a direct rim that continues the flare of the wall (Locus 1709, PI. 47:2) or a rim that is turned out from the body of the vessel (e.g., Locus 583; Locus 1133, PI. 18:15). A smaller group that includes only fragmentary examples has a modelled, everted rim and shows the beginning of an inflection on the upper wall of the vessel (e.g., Locus 1325, PI. 45:2; Locus 1348, PI. 52:3). Subtype El is a fairly large group, appearing in all the strata from IX to II. All varieties discussed above appear in Stratum IX contexts (e.g., Loci 1013, 1146, 1153, 1161). There is no evidence to suggest that a particular style of Subtype El was preferred during any part of this period. Subtype E2 (Fig. 2.1:12) consists of small and medium-sized bowls with a medium-deep stance, flared sides, flat base and everted rim. The everted rim relates this form to Bowl Types D1 and Fl. The form is most prevalent in Stratum IX, although fragmentary samples also come from Strata VI and VI-IV (e.g., Loci 402, 1023, 1063, 1161, 1392; Pis. 4:3; 13:6; 15:13; 24:10; 42:7). Subtype E3 (Fig . 2 . 1 : 1 3) is the largest variety of this type. Its rim is slightly everted and its stance is quite deep. The sides are somewhat more incurved 16</page><page sequence="23">EGYPTIAN POTTERY than those of Subtypes El and E2. While this form is less common than Subtypes El or E2, it is found in fragmentary form in a variety of loci ranging from Stratum IX through IV (e.g., Loci 592, 1153, 1209, 1317, 1913: Pis. 14:3; 27:11; 32:5; 39:2; 54:20). Numerous examples of all subtypes of Type E have been published from Canaanite sites that attest to Egyptian influence, such as Beth-Shean (Fitzgerald 1930: PI. XLI: 1-2; James 1966: Figs. 31:19; 33:5; 49:12; 55:3; 57:4-5). The form frequently appears with a red rim or red wash over the whole body. In Egypt, examples of these bowls are found at Deir el-Medineh (Nagel 1938: Fig. 6:25), Tell el- Amarna (Peet and Woolley 1923: PI. XLVII: VII/1003H) and in the Scandinavian Joint Expedition survey (Holthoer 1977: PI. 27:28), among others. BOWL TYPE F (Fig. 2.1:14-15) Type F consists of a small group of medium, medium-large and large bowls with a ring base, non-composite contour, medium and medium- deep shape, and modelled, everted rim. Only five complete examples are representative of this type at Deir el-Balah. Two subtypes are distinguished according to size. Subtype Fl (Fig. 2.1:14, Locus 1057, Stratum VIII) includes only one complete example of medium size and depth. A hole was perforated through the base of this bowl after firing. Subtype F2 (Fig. 2.1:15) is characterized by four complete examples ranging in size from medium-large (Locus 1392, PI. 4:2-3) to large (Fig . 2 . 1 : 1 5 and one unpublished example) . All four are of medium-deep shape. The large example in Fig. 2.1:15 derives from Locus 1112 (Stratum V), while the unpublished large example was found in a mixed/unstratified context. The two medium-large vessels were retrieved from Locus 1392, which is problematic in its dating. Bowls of Subtype Fl exhibit a strong resemblance to vessels of Subtype E2, except for the shape of the base. All fragmentary examples of bowls of this size and rim shape are therefore unclassified (either E2 or Fl) and have been discussed under Subtype E2 above. A large group of fragmentary bowl rims belonging to medium-large and large vessels (probably of Subtype F2), displaying a wide variation of rim angle, are consistent with the group of fragmentary bowl rims attributed to Subtypes E2/ Fl . They vary from almost direct rims cut away on the interior (e.g., Locus 1133, PI. 18:14), through rims rounded either on the interior (e.g., Locus 1063, PI. 24:3) or exterior (e.g., Locus 1317, PI. 32:5), to strongly everted rims where the interior section of the rim represents the deepest point of the bowl and the rim flares out either horizontally (e.g., Locus 1325, PI. 45:7) or vertically (e.g., Locus 1360, PI. 38:8). The contour also varies between examples with almost no inflection (e.g., Locus 1325, PI. 45:7) and those with either a low (Locus 1057, PI. 17:3) or high inflection (e.g., Fig. 2.1:15). Types F and Fl are related to Subtype E2, and appear in Egyptian sites such as Tell el-Amarna and Deir el-Medineh (Nagel 1938: Fig. 47: 12; Peet and Woolley 1923: PI. XLVII: VII/1003H), as well as in Canaanite sites that were heavily influenced by Egypt such as Beth-Shean (Fitzgerald 1930: PI. XLI:2). BOWL TYPE G (Fig. 2.1:16) Type G comprises very large bowls with a stepped rim and string impressions or incised lines/nicks below the rim. This type is well known in Egypt and appears with flat or ring base; for examples from Tell el-Amarna see Peet and Woolley 1 923 : PI . XLVII:VI/1007B (flat base) and PI. XLVII:IX/242 (ring base). For a possible parallel from Beth-Shean, see James and McGovern 1993: Fig. 8:13. II. OVOID JARS (Fig. 22; Photos 2.6-9) Ovoid jars are among the most common and longest-lived restricted vessels in the ancient Egyptian repertoire. As a result, they exhibit a wide variability in shape, size, decoration and quality. In Egypt plain and incised vessels are represented in greater numbers than the elaborately painted examples that are well known from New Kingdom tombs and reliefs. During the Middle Bronze Age II in Canaan, small faience ovoid jars appear at such 17</page><page sequence="24">CHAPTER TWO Fig. 2.2. Ovoid jars. No. Type Reg.

VI: 15; IX:39) and Tell Beit Mirsim (Albright 1932: PI. 44: 15). Ceramic ovoid jars occur in limited quantities in Late Bronze Age Canaanite contexts (see below) and continue into the Iron Age I. At Tell el-Far'ah (S), T. 562, such a vessel was found in an anthropoid coffin burial (T. Dothan 1982: Fig. 8:7, PI. 9). Isolated examples appear in Canaan in the Iron Age, the latest coming from Tell Qasile, Stratum X (Mazar 1980: 163). At Deir el-Balah, ovoid jars are represented by a small group from the settlement, consisting of about fifteen examples, almost all in fragmentary condition, and by an additional three complete vessels from the cemetery. Neutron Activation Analysis performed on some of these vessels indicates that they were locally produced (see Chapter 3). The ovoid jars from Deir el-Balah exhibit the diversity noted among vessels of Egyptian provenance. In general, however, the ovoid jars from Deir el-Balah are coarsely made of clay tempered with organic material. They are always smoothed above the point of maximum diameter (Md) and left unfinished below, a 18</page><page sequence="25">EGYPTIAN POTTERY Fig. 2.2. Ovoid jars. characteristic also associated with Late Bronze Age bowls at Deir el-Balah (see above). This trait has also been noted for Egyptian and Nubian ceramics (Holthoer 1977: 42, 157). Ovoid jars of both Egyptian and Canaanite provenance are characterized by a rounded base, medium-low Md, slender, occasionally medium- broad shape and steep or inconspicuous shoulder (Holthoer 1977: 157). Holthoer distinguishes between two subtypes of ovoid jars: ordinary and wide mouth. The latter does not appear at Deir el-Balah and is less widespread in Egypt than the ordinary subtype. Ordinary ovoid jars are characterized by a divergent upper termination, a concave neck of fixed height and a medium-wide aperture (Holthoer 1977: 157). A variant of ordinary ovoid jars includes vessels with a convergent upper termination (Holthoer 1977: 157; see Fig. 2.2:7). Other ceramic types from Deir el-Balah that are related to ovoid jars include globular jars (Fig. 2.3), necked jars (Fig. 2.4:1-3) and funnel-necked jars (Figs. 2.4:4-7, 2.5:1-3). 19</page><page sequence="26">CHAPTER TWO Photo 2.6. Ovoid and globular jars. Photo 2.7. Ovoid jar (Fig. 2.2:5). Ovoid jars from Deir el-Balah exhibit wide variation in body shape, ranging from a slender vessel with a medium-low Md (Fig. 2.2:5) to a rounded example with a medium-high Md (Fig. 2.2:1). One of the complete examples from the cemetery has a well-rounded shoulder (Fig. 2.2:3). Ovoid jars appear at Deir el-Balah in a variety of sizes ranging from small (Fig. 2.2: 1-2) to medium (Fig. 2.2:3-7) and medium-large (Fig. 2.2:8-9). Only one fragment (PI. 39:19) may represent an ovoid jar of large size (diameter 18 cm.). Most of the ovoid jars from Deir el-Balah have Photo 2.8. Ovoid jar (Fig. 2.2:6). Photo 2.9. Ovoid jar (Fig. 2.2:9). 20</page><page sequence="27">EGYPTIAN POTTERY unmodelled rims, though modelled rims, which are represented at Deir el-Balah by only two examples (Fig. 2.2:7, 10), seem to have been the preferred style in New Kingdom Egypt. Both plain and painted ovoid jars are known from Deir el-Balah, the latter in greater quantity. Incised vessels, which were popular in New Kingdom Egypt, are not represented at the site. Decoration of ovoid jars usually consists of red painted bands (Fig. 2.2:3, 5-7, 10). Two fragmentary vessels exhibit bichrome decoration; one example painted with red and blue (Fig. 2.2:9), the other with red and white (PI. 46:6). The large ovoid jar mentioned above (PI. 39:19) is covered with a thick white slip and burnished, a kind of treatment applied to other Egyptian-style vessels from Deir el-Balah. An additional fragmentary ovoid jar from Deir el- Balah is covered with a red slip (PI. 30: 1 ). Among the ovoid jars from Deir el-Balah , a few examples (Fig. 2.2:5, 8-9) are of a fairly graceful shape, relatively thin-walled, made of well-levigated clay and well fired. The other vessels, made of a similar ware possibly mixed with a greater proportion of organic temper, are often asymmetrical or very heavy-walled (Fig. 2.2:2-3), or unevenly fired (Fig. 2.2:1,4). Ovoid jars appear at Deir el-Balah in well- stratified loci of Stratum IX (Floor 331 , Pit 1 153) and are lacking from the excavated material of Strata VIII and VII. The largest number of ovoid jars from the settlement were retrieved from pits of Strata VI-IV (402, 1001, 1063, 1227, 1325) as well as from Kiln 1313 (Stratum IV). Fragmentary examples of ovoid jars were also discovered in Loci 1392 and 1913, in addition to unstratified contexts (Loci 407, 508, 1 160). Two of the vessels from the cemetery (Fig. 2.2:1, 4) were unfortunately derived from poorly stratified contexts, while the third example (Fig. 2.2:3) was found in Tomb 303 and is dated to the 1 3th century BCE. The ovoid jar in Egypt was an "eternal" shape, known from the earliest times until its disappearance during the Late Period. From the Middle Kingdom period until the end of the New Kingdom, the ovoid jar enjoyed great popularity. Unfortunately, the publications of pottery from many Egyptian sites are inadequate for use as comparative material. For this reason, we have not specified individual parallels of Egyptian provenance for each ovoid jar found at Deir el-Balah. The Deir el-Balah vessels are most similar to vessels of late XVIIIth and XlXth Dynasty date, particularly from Tell el- Amarna (Peet and Woolley 1923: PI. XLIX:XXV/26, 137, 1016B, 249) and Gurob (Brunton and Engelbach 1927: Pl. XXXIV:22B, 22H, 24A). Other ovoid jars of New Kingdom date similar to those from Deir el-Balah were found at Deir el-Medineh (Nagel 1938: Fig. 12:25), Saft (Petrie 1906: Pis. XXXIX:52; XXIXC:56) and Rifeh (Petrie 1907: Pl. XXV: 1 , 8, 15), as well as at several Nubian sites (Holthoer 1977: Pis. 35-38; see full references in Holthoer 1977: 156). The ovoid jars from Deir el- Balah, as we have noted, are distinguished from the vessels of Egyptian provenance by a preference for unmodelled rims and the lack of incisions around the neck. In Canaan, the largest number of ovoid jars is concentrated in the southern region, particularly at Tell el-'Ajjul (Petrie 1932: Pl. XXIX:31 H3; Petrie 1933: Pl. XXXII:31 Y71; Petrie 1934: Pis. XLVIII:31K; XLIX:32Y) and Tell el-Far'ah (S) (Starkey and Harding 1932: PI. LXXXVIII:75N). Although the ceramics from both sites are poorly published, lacking sections and ware descriptions, it appears that the vessels from Tell el-'Ajjul share a preference for modelled rims and incised necks with ovoid jars of Egyptian extraction, while the examples from Tell el-Far'ah (S) closely resemble certain vessels from Deir el-Balah (Fig. 2.2:6-7). Only one example of an ovoid jar has been published from Lachish (Tufnell et al. 1940: Pl. LIX:335), attributed to Fosse Temple I of Late Bronze Age I date. The vessel has a modelled rim and is incised around the neck. A single example of an ovoid jar, dated to the 13th century BCE, has been published to date from Tel Mor (M. Dothan 1960: 124). It is characterized by a coarse fabric tempered with organic material, smoothed on the upper body and left unfinished below. From Beth- Shean only one fragmentary ovoid jar has been 21</page><page sequence="28">CHAPTER TWO published (Fitzgerald 1930: PI. XLII:30), attributed by the excavator to Levels VIII-VII. The rarity of the ovoid jar at Beth-Shean is surprising in light of the quantity of other Egyptian-style vessels from the site. At Megiddo, the opposite trend is noteworthy. While other Egyptian-style pottery is lacking at the site, several examples of ovoid jars, most of the ordinary subtype with modelled rim, are documented (Guy 1938: PI. 57:9-10; Loud 1948: Pis. 60:7; 65:2). They derive from Late Bronze Age II contexts, including Strata VIII and VIIB as well as Tomb 26. The popularity enjoyed by the ovoid jar in New Kingdom Egypt was thus apparently not matched at Canaanite sites during the Late Bronze Age II. At Deir el-Balah, where other Egyptian-style ceramic types dominate the repertoire, the ovoid jar is represented by a proportionately small sample. Only at Tell el-'Ajjul were these vessels found in quantity. Lachish and Beth-Shean, two centers of known Egyptian influence, were not well acquainted with the ovoid jar. At Megiddo, the ovoid jar is one of the few Egyptian-style vessels known at the site. Unlike other Egyptianizing vessels found in Canaan, which sometimes continue to appear in early Iron Age contexts, the ovoid jar is limited in date to the Late Bronze Age II, except for the vessel from Lachish of Late Bronze Age I date. III. GLOBULAR JARS (Fig. 23) This ceramic family at Deir el-Balah consists of a small assemblage of vessels comprising two distinct groups. The first, Type A, includes small and medium-sized vessels with either globular or elongated body shape (Fig. 2.3:1-8); the second, Type B, is composed of medium-sized vessels with either globular or slightly carinated body shape (Fig. 2.3:9-10). Vessels belonging to the first category, which are often painted with clusters of red lines, are reminiscent of ovoid jars, particularly the elongated examples. Vessels of the second type are always unpainted and sometimes display chord impressions around the point of maximum diameter. These and other features suggest a domestic function. These two types of vessels have thus been classified together here only in terms of gross similarities of body contour as well as for the sake of the standardization of typology (Holthoer 1977: 150-55, Pis. 34-35). Certain vessels exhibit characteristics common to both subtypes. For example, the vessel illustrated in Fig. 2.3: 1 has a steep shoulder and medium-low Md, characteristic of Subtype A, although the rim is everted and the aperture narrow, traits consistent with Subtype B . The single globular jar from the cemetery (Fig. 2.3:7) belongs to Type A in terms of size but displays a rim and neck shape characteristic of Type B . The ware of the vessels of Type A ranges from clay tempered with a large amount of organic material (Fig. 2.3:7; PI. 51:12) to a better-quality fabric tempered with less organic material (Fig. 2.3:1,5). In Egypt variations of globular jars are known from Middle Kingdom (e.g., Petrie 1909: Pis. XVII-XIX) and Second Intermediate Period contexts (e.g., Brunton 1930: Pl. XVI:54C, 54H). They survive well into the XVIIIth Dynasty, as witnessed at Tell el-Amarna (Peet and Woolley 1923: Pis. XLVIII:XIX/120, 1050; XLIX:XXI/226, 1049). Subsequently, during the XlXth Dynasty, they appear only at Gurob (Petrie 1 890: PI. XXI:64). In Late Bronze Age II Canaanite contexts, globular jars are rare (see below). Among the globular jars found by the Scandinavian Joint Expedition survey in Nubia, Holthoer has distinguished between two main types: ordinary and wide-mouthed (Holthoer 1977: 150). Only his first group encompasses the two types known at Deir el-Balah. The ordinary globular jars from Nubia are characterized by a very short neck that may be broad, medium-broad or narrow, a divergent upper termination, a broad or sometimes medium-broad shape and a medium or high Md (Holthoer 1977; cf. Fig. 2.3:5-10). Other similar vessels with broad shape and convergent upper termination are included among the ordinary globular jars (cf. Fig. 2.3:1-4). Jars similar to both Types A and B are known from various XVIIIth Dynasty contexts in Egypt. The published material indicates a preference in 22</page><page sequence="29">EGYPTIAN POTTERY Egypt for unpainted, small and medium-sized vessels of our Type A2 rather than the elongated, painted vessels of Type Al . Close parallels for Type A vessels are known from Sedment (Petrie and Brunton 1924: PI. LXII:90) and Meydum (Petrie et al. 1912: Pl. XIX:83; cf. Fig. 2.3:2^1, Type Al); the latter derives from the XVIIIth Dynasty cemetery (Petrie et al. 1912: 27). Tell el-Amarna also provides close parallels (Peet and Woolley 1923: Pl. XLIII:XIX/1050; cf. Fig. 2.3:7). Globular jars of Type B were widespread in XVIIIth Dynasty Egypt, represented at such sites as Meydum (Petrie et al. 1912: Pl. XVIII: 59-62, from the XVIIIth Dynasty cemetery), and Tell el-Amarna (Peet and Woolley 1923: Pis. XLVIII:XIX/20; XLIX:XXI/226, XXI/ 1049), as well as in the XlXth Dynasty at Gurob (Petrie 1890: PI. XXI:64). Very few globular jars of either type are known from Late Bronze Age II contexts in Canaan. At Tell el-'Ajjul, located just five kilometers north of Deir el-Balah, a few examples of globular jars were discovered (Petrie 1933: PI. XXVI: 16, though unpainted and of unknown provenance, cf. Fig. 2.3:8; Pis. XXIX:6963; XLIII:77, cf. Fig. 2.3:4). It is unclear whether the latter two vessels from Tell el-'Ajjul are two different vessels or the same; one (PI. XLIII:77) is shown as intricately decorated and the other (PI. XXVI: 6963) as plain, but the vessel shape is the same, as is the context (see Petrie 1933: 13), which is undated. Note also Petrie 1931: PI. XLII:F981, which possibly derives from Tell el-Far' ah, Tomb 981 of the XlXth Dynasty. This vessel is longer and more slender than the group of globular jars from Deir el-Balah but different in contour from ovoid jars (compare Holthoer 1977: 169-70, PI. 40, Simple Jars) and paralleled at Megiddo (Guy 1938: PI. 57:10, Tomb 26 of the Late Bronze Age II). Also of interest is a small jar related in shape to carinated vessels that are not represented at Deir el-Balah but which are similar to some examples of globular jars (Petrie 193 1 : PI. XLIII:32A6/272). It is noteworthy that only Type A vessels are represented at Tell el-'Ajjul. At Tell el-Far'ah (S), two unpainted vessels of Type A are illustrated from the settlement (Starkey and Harding 1932: Pl. XXV:69, cf. Fig. 2.3:1; Pl. XXIX:25, cf. Fig. 2.3:7) and the 900 Cemetery yielded a series of vessels that resemble Type B vessels from Deir el-Balah (Duncan 1930: Type 41). At Beth-Shean, globular jars are lacking from the Late Bronze Age II levels; a group of fifteen jars of similar shape, however, were discovered in the Stelae Room of Level V of Iron Age I date (James 1966: 13-14, Fig. 4:5). These vessels differ from the XVIIth Dynasty globular jars (note that the references to similar vessels at Megiddo are incorrect). At Deir el-Balah, globular jars of both types are infrequent, though examples of Type A are more numerous than vessels of Type B. In Egypt, the opposite is true; there, Type B jars are far more common than the smaller, painted vessels of Type A. Furthermore, the Type A vessels from Deir el-Balah often diverge from the standard shapes represented in Egypt (comparable to the jars illustrated in Fig. 2.3:5-6). Most of the Type A globular jars from Deir el-Balah approach the appearance of ovoid jars (compare , e .g . , Fig . 2 .2 :7 to Fig . 2 .3 : 2-4) , a feature that may be characteristic of the ceramic traditions at Deir el-Balah and Tell el-'Ajjul. Globular jars of Type B are a distinct group, often found in close proximity to one another (as at Deir el-Balah and Beth-Shean), suggesting that they may have had a linked function. Type B includes only two complete vessels (Fig. 2.3:9-10) and one fragmentary example (PI. 25: 1 3). Although other neck and rim fragments may belong to this type, due to their similarity to neck and rim fragments of short-necked funnel-necked jars (Fig. 2.5:1-3) and beerbottles (Fig. 2.5:4-10) we were unable to assign them with certainty to any one of these ceramic families. The fragmentary example (PI. 25:13) and the complete vessel illustrated in Fig. 2.3:10 are almost identical in size, body contour and neck shape with a medium-high and conspicuous Md, narrow aperture and slightly convex neck. The other complete vessel (Fig. 2.3:9) is smaller and more globular in shape than the two previous examples, with a lower, less conspicuous Md, and an almost vertical neck. Cord impressions are visible around the Md and the lower part of the vessel, which displays signs of secondary exposure 23</page><page sequence="30">CHAPTER TWO Fig. 2.3. Globular jars. No. Type Reg.

These include two loci of Stratum VII (Locus 1017, one of the probes into the foundation trench of Wall 432; Pit 1090) and three vessels from loci in the crater fill of Stratum VI (Fig. 2.3:6, 8; PI. 30:2). One complete vessel (Fig. 2.3:7) was discovered among excavations in the cemetery in Tomb 304, a simple burial of 13th century BCE date. The two complete vessels of Type B (Fig. 2.3:9-10) were, however, found together on a floor of Stratum IX (Locus 1006) . This is one of the few loci at Deir el-Balah that yielded complete vessels associated with a well-stratified living surface. The third vessel of Type B derived from a pit of Stratum VI (Locus 1063). IV. NECKED JARS (Fig. 2.4:1-3; Photos 2.10-11) The three vessels that we have termed "necked jars" do not comprise a typological group per se but have been placed in a separate group because they are hybrid versions of related ceramic families. This group, in the classification developed by Holthoer (1977: 163), is regarded as an auxiliary group of convenience encompassing both vessels that are specific to it and types that could be regarded as rare irregular versions of other ceramic families. 24</page><page sequence="31">EGYPTIAN POTTERY Fig. 2.3.

For this reason, each vessel included in this section is described separately along with individual comparative examples, unlike the approach applied here to more unified ceramic families. Necked jars of Egyptian and Nubian provenance are characterized by a divergent upper termination, medium-high Md, not very short neck with concave contour, medium- wide aperture, medium-broad shape and conspicuous shoulder (Holthoer 1977: 163-64). Two subtypes, consisting of flat-based and round-based vessels, are noted among Egyptian and Nubian examples. Flat-based necked jars are usually characterized by a ring base and a tall or very broad neck. Rims are almost always modelled and decoration is rare. Among the vessels found by the Scandinavian Joint Expedition survey in Nubia, flat-based necked jars are known only in small and large sizes. The single flat-based necked jar from Deir el-Balah (Fig. 2.4:1) reproduces almost all these traits, diverging only in terms of its size, which is classified as medium, and its neck shape, which is slightly convex. Holthoer's suggestion that flat- based necked jars are perhaps to be regarded as handleless versions of jugs and juglets may hold true at Ďeir el-Balah (Holthoer 1977: 163). Our example is asymmetrical and coarsely made of clay tempered with organic material. The base is so poorly executed that the vessel could not have stood securely on a flat surface. As is common among the Egyptian-style vessels from Deir el-Balah, the lower body is left unsmoothed. The rim is modelled. Two additional sherds (Pis. 13:9; 40: 12) may belong to this type. Round-based necked jars of Egyptian and Nubian provenance are characterized by the same traits as the flat-based subtype except for the shape of the base and the range of sizes, which includes 26</page><page sequence="33">EGYPTIAN POTTERY Fig. 2.4. Necked and funnel-necked jars. small, medium-large and large vessels. The small vessel shown here (Fig. 2.4:2) diverges significantly from the definition of necked jars given above and displays strong affinities to both ovoid jars and globular jars. It is included in this family as a variant representing traits associated with all three ceramic 27</page><page sequence="34">CHAPTER TWO Photo 2.10. Necked jar (Fig. 2.4:1). Photo 2.11. Necked jar (Fig. 2.4:2). families. The vessel from Deir el-Balah is very small and is characterized by a rather squat shape with a medium-low Md, conspicuous transition to the neck, fairly tall divergent neck and unmodelled rim. It is white-slipped and painted with red rim tickings as well as three horizontal red bands, the lower two bands attached on the lower side to vertical red ticking. The published material lacks exact parallels from Egypt for this kind of design, although a slightly different exterior design consisting of groups of vertical lines radiating downwards from a horizontal band is common on late XVIIIth and XlXth Dynasty carinated vessels (Holthoer 1977: 56, Pis. 30-32). Due to the composite nature of the shape of this vessel, comparable vessels of Egyptian provenance are also lacking. Similar vessels of globular shape are known during the New Kingdom (Engelbach and Gunn 1923: PI. XXXV:38G; Holthoer 1977: PI. 34). The vessel from Deir el-Balah, of almost miniature proportions and relatively fine manufacture, is unusual among the repertoire of Egyptian-style vessels at our site and illustrates an intermingling of traits characteristic of various Egyptian ceramic types. Only one vessel from Deir el-Balah adheres closely to the definition of round-based necked jars (Fig. 2.4:3). The jar was found inside a tabun (Locus 505, Stratum VI) and is in a poor state of preservation. Most of the outer layer of clay has peeled off, especially from the lower part of the vessel, which is also burned. The jar is characterized by a pointed base, medium-high Md and medium- wide aperture. Comparable examples are well known from late XVIIIth and XlXth Dynasty New Kingdom sites in Egypt including Tell el- Amarna (Frankfort and Pendlebury 1933: PL LII:XIV/13), Gurob (Brunton and Engelbach 1927: Pl. XXXV:38T) and Meydum (Petrie et al. 1910: Pl. XXVI:64, 67). V. FUNNEL-NECKED JARS (Figs. 2.4:4-8, 2.5:1-5; Photos 2.12-15) Funnel-necked jars from Egypt may be classified into two distinct subtypes, tall-necked and short-necked (Holthoer 1977: 148). In addition to differences in neck height, these two subtypes possess other diverging characteristics that make them look quite dissimilar. Although the excavations at Deir el-Balah did not yield a complete example of a neck, the Egyptian prototypes enable us to classify 28</page><page sequence="35">EGYPTIAN POTTERY Photo 2.12. Funnel-necked jar (Fig. 2.4:5). Photo 2.13. Funnel-necked jar (Fig. 2.4:6). our samples into two typological categories. Tall- necked funnel-necked jars did not become popular in Egypt until the end of the XVIIIth Dynasty, Photo 2.14. Funnel-necked jar (Fig. 2.4:7). Photo 2.15. Funnel-necked jar (Fig. 2.5:2). when they appear in quantity at many sites. They continue to be widespread in Egypt and Nubia until the end of the XlXth Dynasty, after which they 29</page><page sequence="36">CHAPTER TWO gradually disappear. Short-necked funnel-necked jars appeared contemporaneously with the former subtype in Egypt but seem not to have enjoyed the same popularity. Very few funnel-necked jars are known from the excavations at Deir el-Balah. Fragmentary examples of the tall-necked subtype were discovered at the settlement (Fig. 2.4:4-8). The short-necked subtype is also represented by a small assemblage; four complete vessels are preserved, two of them from the cemetery (Fig. 2.5:1-3; Vol. I, Fig. 1.25:2). Among the funnel-necked jars from Deir el-Balah, the tall-necked variety clearly exhibits affinities to ovoid jars and necked jars, whereas the short-necked vessels are strongly reminiscent of beerbottles. The typology plates have been arranged in a manner that illustrates these similarities. Funnel-necked jars of Egyptian provenance are characterized by a convex neck contour, divergent upper termination, unmodelled rim and rounded base, and are known in medium-large and very large sizes (Holthoer 1977: 148). The tall-necked subtype has a tall broad neck, medium to medium-high Md, medium-broad shape with a steep or inconspicuous shoulder, and an angular transition to the neck often forming a ledge. Short-necked funnel-necked jars have a short broad neck, medium-high and sometimes high Md, and angular transition to the neck. The former subtype often appears with red or white painted bands or more elaborate polychrome decoration, including blue. The vessels belonging to the latter subtype are usually plain. At Deir el-Balah, five fragmentary tall-necked funnel-necked jars were discovered at the settlement. Four of these vessels consist of the body and part of the neck (Fig. 2.4:4-7), while the fifth fragment includes the neck and rim (Fig. 2.4:8). The latter is unusual in that the rim is modelled, an uncommon feature among funnel-necked jars of Egyptian provenance. The single example from Deir el-Balah of a tall- necked funnel-necked jar without a ridge around the neck (Fig. 2.4:4) also exhibits characteristics that diverge from those of Egyptian jars of this type. It is characterized by a conspicuously medium-low Md. The neck does not appear to be convex. Below the point of maximum diameter the vessel has been left unsmoothed. Although it is decorated with five red bands, the vessel is rather coarsely made of clay tempered with many grits and organic material, and a fingerprint marks the lower wall. The other examples of the tall-necked funnel- necked jars from Deir el-Balah (Fig. 2.4:5-7) are similar in body shape and all have a ridge around the neck. Two of these vessels are decorated: one has red bands and hatching around the neck, and the other is painted with blue bands and is white- slipped and burnished. None of the tall-necked funnel-necked jars from Deir el-Balah derives from a secure stratigraphie context. Two of the vessels are attributed to Stratum VI, one to the crater fill (Fig. 2.4:7) and the other to a pit (Fig. 2.4:8). Two other examples derive from unstratified contexts (Fig. 2.4:4-5), while the fifth vessel was found in Locus 1392 (PI. 51:15). In Egypt, the tall-necked subtype appears at many sites of late XVIIIth and XlXth Dynasty date (Saft, Petrie 1906: PI. XXIXC:63; Deir el- Medineh, Nagel 1938: Fig. 63:10; Sedment, Petrie and Brunton 1924: PI. XLV:43F; Tell el-Amarna, Peetand Woolley 1923: Pl.LIV:LXXX/252;Gurob, Brunton and Engelbach 1927: Pl. XXXVII:42L; Balabish, Wainwright 1920: PI. XXIII:7). These vessels are slightly different in shape from those found at Deir el-Balah, exhibiting a slender contour, often with a medium-low Md. Vessels similar to these are known from a few Late Bronze II Canaanite contexts (Tell el-'Ajjul, Petrie 1931: PI. XLII:F981?; Tell el-Far'ah (S), Starkey and Harding 1932: PI. LXXXVIII:75N; Megiddo, Loud 1948: PI. 65:1, 2?). Examples of tall-necked funnel-necked jars of the type found at Deir el-Balah are more limited in New Kingdom Egypt. Vessels similar to that shown on Fig. 2.4:4 have been noted at Tell el-Amarna (Peet and Woolley 1923: Pl.L:XXV/202),Meydum (Petrie et al. 1912: Pl. XIX:101) and Riqqeh (Engelbach et al. 1915: Pl. XXXVII:42h). Jars from Egypt that are comparable to two similar vessels from Deir el-Balah (Fig. 2.4:5-6) are known from Riqqeh (Engelbach et al. 1915: Pl. XXXVI:41d, 42f). A vessel resembling the blue-painted example 30</page><page sequence="37">EGYPTIAN POTTERY from Deir el-Balah (Fig. 2.4:7) comes from Gurob (Petrie 1890: PI. XXI:65). Jars with modelled rims like that from Deir el-Balah (Fig. 2.4:8) appear at Tell el- Amarna (Peet and Woolley 1923: PI. LIV:LXXVII/236). Short-necked funnel-necked jars are very similar in contour, neck shape and general finish to beerbottles (see below), but lack the fingerprints and perforated bases that characterize the latter ceramic family. At Deir el-Balah, four complete examples of short-necked funnel-necked jars have been discovered (Fig. 2.5: 1-3; Vol. I, Fig. 1 .25:2), in addition to five fragmentary examples that consist of the base and lower body (Pis. 15:5; 22:8; 30:9; 56:14; Locus 330, not illustrated). Because of the strong similarity between short-necked funnel- necked jars and beerbottles, it was impossible to classify the upper body and neck fragments of these types. Consequently, since beerbottles appear in far greater quantities at Deir el-Balah than funnel- necked jars, all such upper body fragments were arbitrarily assigned to the beerbottles. At Deir el-Balah, short-necked funnel-necked jars are characterized by a short broad neck, unmodelled rim, conspicuous transition to the neck, medium-high to high Md and rounded base. A variant of this subtype consists of jars with a small, flattened base (Fig. 2.5:3). Necks are either convergent or vertical. The vessels from Deir el-Balah were found in various stratigraphie contexts, including Stratum IX (Locus 1153), a foundation trench of Stratum VII (Locus 1 154), the Stratum VI crater fill, and the second phase of the water installation of Stratum V (Locus 520B). Two additional examples were found in Locus 1913, and one in an unstratified locus (Locus 330). In Egypt, short-necked funnel-necked jars appear in XVIIIth and XlXth Dynasty contexts (e.g., at Gurob, Brunton and Engelbach 1927: Pl. 36:39L; Lahun, Brunton 1914: PI. XVIII: 12). Vessels that strongly resemble those from Deir el-Balah derive from Tell el- Amarna (Peet and Woolley 1923: PI. LII:XLVIII/47, 194) and include a flat-based example (Peet and Woolley 1923: PI. XLIX:XXVIII/1017). Vessels of this type are entirely lacking from the Late Bronze Age II Canaanite ceramic repertoire. A vessel from Megiddo (Loud 1948: PI. 65:1) is similar but has a more slender body shape and lower Md than the short-necked funnel-necked jars from Deir el-Balah. VI. BEERBOTTLES (Fig. 2.5:4-10; Photos 2.16-19) The beerbottle is the most common Egyptian form found at Deir el-Balah. Most of these vessels are crudely finished, usually with a hole pierced through the base before firing, and always with finger indentations on the lower walls. In Egypt, beerbottles are often found in tombs, foundation deposits and settlement sites of XVIIIth and XlXth Dynasty date. The discovery in Egyptian tombs of beerbottles, together with related open ceramic forms called flower pots, led Holthoer ( 1 977 : 86) to suggest that these two kinds of vessels were symbolic of the beer and bread mentioned in a popular New Kingdom votive formula. Moreover, flower pots resemble certain bread molds portrayed in Old Kingdom wall reliefs (for a full discussion of flower pots, see Holthoer 1977: 83-86, PI. 18). Consequently, Holthoer proposed the term "beerbottle" to refer to the restricted vessels discussed here. Although the original function of this vessel remains uncertain, they may well have been used in the preparation of beer. The very large quantity of beerbottles discovered at the settlement of Deir el-Balah signifies that these vessels were in common use and probably served a utilitarian function. Excavations in the cemetery yielded only two examples (Vol. I, Figs. 1.17:2, 1.24:2), although several others originating in the cemetery are known from private collections. Neither of the two beerbottles found in the cemetery excavations was pierced through the base. At the settlement, the majority of beerbottles were perforated before firing, although a small number without a hole are represented (Fig. 2.5:10; Pis. 18:21; 25:15). It is noteworthy that not a single example of a flower pot, a form commonly associated with beerbottles at Egyptian sites, was found at Deir el-Balah. 31</page><page sequence="38">CHAPTER TWO Fig. 2.5.

This trait appears to us to be a reflection of the manufacturing process, resulting from the removal of the vessel from the turning wheel when the potter grasped the base with his fingers. In some cases, the base seems to have been pinched (PI. 58:6). A number of unperforated bases exhibit the fan-like impression left by the cutting string. The bases of the beerbottles do not show signs of reshaping and no attempt was made to smooth the indentations left by the potter's fingers. It has been suggested by Holthoer that these finger impressions may have been intended to facilitate the handling of the vessel during use (Holthoer 1977: 86). The irregular execution of the finger impressions and their haphazard placement on the vessel bases from Deir el-Balah make this suggestion somewhat unlikely. The beerbottles from Deir el-Balah are always plain, with the exception of one example (PI. 33: 16) that displays traces of a red slip on the exterior. Widely spaced, deep turning marks are always visible on the interior and exterior surfaces. This technique of manufacture was apparently deliberate and may have a functional significance associated with the easier handling of the vessel. On the other hand, it may simply be another feature related to the coarseness of manufacture, indicating that the vessel was left unsmoothed after fabrication. Among the other families of Egyptian-style pottery from Deir el-Balah, only short- necked funnel-necked jars exhibit the same trait (see Fig. 2.5: 1-3). The ware of the beerbottles from Deir el-Balah 32</page><page sequence="39">EGYPTIAN POTTERY Fig. 2.5. Funnel-necked jars and beerbottles. 33</page><page sequence="40">CHAPTER TWO Photo 2.16.

Beerbottle (Fig. 2.5:9). 34</page><page sequence="41">EGYPTIAN POTTERY consists of the usual material found among all the ceramic types at the site, consisting of a soft fabric tempered with grits and usually a large quantity of organic material. Several beerbottles were tested by Neutron Activation Analysis (see Chapter 3). Among the beerbottles of Egyptian and Nubian provenance, Holthoer has classified four subtypes: ordinary, transitional, simple and cylindrical (Holthoer 1977: 86-88). The ordinary subtype is the most common both in Egypt and at Deir el-Balah. Vessels belonging to this subtype are characterized by a divergent upper termination, a very short broad neck with a concave contour, a medium to medium- wide aperture, a high Md and a slender to medium-broad shape (Fig. 2. 5: 8-9). The transitional subtype, which Holthoer considered to be a kind of catch-all group consisting of irregular forms, encompasses certain vessels that closely resemble a number of beerbottles from Deir el-Balah (Holthoer 1977: PI. 18:185/601:4; see Fig. 2.5:7). They are distinguished by a convergent upper termination and a short, convex neck. Simple beerbottles, without neck, do not appear at Deir el-Balah. The cylindrical subtype is not represented by a complete Photo 2.19. Beerbottle (Fig. 2.5:10). example at our site, but a few fragmentary bases (e.g., PI. 25:16) suggest that it occurs. Among the ceramic assemblage from Deir el- Balah, certain basic traits are common to all the beerbottles: unmodelled direct rim, short neck, high Md and flat base. Beerbottles are always of medium size except for the rare occurrence of a medium- small example. However, variations in neck shape, aperture width and base diameter are representative of the mass-production of these vessels and indicate that these characteristics were not of primary importance. Nonetheless, the beerbottles from Deir el-Balah are classified into five groups denoting the varied combinations of these traits. Most of the vessels belong to the first and second categories, which share most of their traits: a wide aperture, vertical or convergent upper termination, short neck, high Md and either medium-broad (e.g., Pis. 49:15; 56:10) or narrow base (Fig. 2.5:4). The second group displays a variety of body shapes, which may be slender, broad (Fig. 2.5:5) or very broad at the Md and tapering steeply toward a narrow base (PI. 58:6). The third group consists of vessels with a narrow aperture, vertical or convergent (occasionally divergent) upper termination and medium-broad base (e.g., Fig. 2.5:6; Pis. 30:5; 49: 16). The fourth and fifth groups are both characterized by a very short neck and high Md; the fourth with a wide aperture (e.g., Fig. 2.5:7; PI. 15:4) and the fifth with a narrow aperture. In view of the large quantity of beerbottles from Deir el-Balah and their careless fabrication, in addition to the large numbers and wide distribution of this vessel in Egypt, we have not found it necessary to specify individual Egyptian parallels for each vessel from our site. It is noteworthy that comparable vessels from Tell el-Amarna are not published, although two jars of similar shape lack finger impressions and are unperforated (Peet and Woolley 1923: PI. XLIX:XXVIII/1017; Frankfort and Pendlebury 1933: PI. LII:XV/2). However, numerous other sites of XVIIIth and XlXth Dynasty date have yielded beerbottles similar to those discovered at Deir el-Balah, for example: from an XVIIIth Dynasty cemetery near el-Gerzeh (Petrie et al. 1912: Pl. XVIII:70, 72-74); from the 35</page><page sequence="42">CHAPTER TWO cemetery at Gurob (Brunton and Engelbach 1927: Pl. XXXVIII:52N, 53C); from the New Kingdom cemetery at Buhen (Randall-Maclver and Woolley 191 1 : PL 42:SXXX); and numerous examples from the cemetery and the cave near the workmen's village at Deir el-Medineh (Nagel 1938: Figs. 29:246; 51:5; 64:17; 86:7; 110:42,44,46,48). To date, the appearance of beerbottles at other sites in Canaan is limited to Hazor and Beth- Shean in the north and Tell el-Far' ah (S) in the south. At Hazor, one fragmentary beerbottle from a Late Bronze Age II context is published (Yadin et al. 1961: Pl. CLIX:15). Three additional sherds possibly belong to this ceramic type (Yadin et al. 1961: Pl. CLIX:16, 19-20); these three sherds derived from Loci 256b and 281 in Area A, from the debris above the floor level of the Late Bronze Age II orthostat building that lies beneath the Iron Age gate. The presence of the beerbottle at Hazor is unusual in light of the paucity of other Egyptian- style vessels at the site. At Beth-Shean, several beerbottles are known from Late Bronze Age II contexts. A complete vessel (Fitzgerald 1930: PI. XLII: 11) derived from Room 1085, two others from Room 1087 and one from Room 1089, loci attributed to Level VII. A fragmentary example (Fitzgerald 1930: PI. XLV:7) was found in "disturbed debris" of Level VII in Room 1052. The two beerbottles published by James (1966: Fig. 31:9) derived from Block E, Locus 33, which is unpublished but seems to belong to a Level VII context. The complete example is unperforated and displays turning marks on the interior and exterior. Characterized by a wide aperture and vertical upper termination, it is similar to vessels from Deir el-Balah except for a very high, conspicuous Md, a trait shared by many of the beerbottles from Beth-Shean. The recent excavations by Mazar brought to light other examples from Late Bronze/Iron Age I levels (Mazar 1993: 214). A larger number of beerbottles derives from Level VI of the Iron Age I at Beth- Shean (James 1966: Fig. 30:7 from Locus 1598, a mixed locus, containing material of Levels VI and V, within and under the gate structure; Fig. 49:6 from Locus 1585, which yielded four examples from under the level of a column base in the 1500 House, Level VI; Fig. 5 1 :6 from Locus 1 703, which yielded five examples from the area outside the main entrance to the 1500 House, Level VI; Fig. 54:1 from Locus 1732, a fragmentary example from one of the small houses north of the 1700 House, Level VI). Of the two complete vessels illustrated (James 1966: Figs. 30:7; 49:6), one is perforated. Both vessels display turning marks on the interior and exterior surfaces and finger impressions marking the lower walls. They are also characterized by a wide aperture and vertical upper termination, like the vessels from Deir el-Balah, but differ in having a high, conspicuous shoulder. It is noteworthy that flower pots are not attested at Beth-Shean, and neither beerbottles nor flower pots appear in the Northern Cemetery. Only one example of a beerbottle is published from Tell el-Far' ah (S) (Starkey and Harding 1932: PI. LXXXVIII:94), which was discovered in Tomb 939, a child's burial in the 900 Cemetery. This simple tomb is dated to the XlXth Dynasty. The beerbottle was found together with two Mycenaean vessels, a biconical jug, a Canaanite jug and several Egyptian-style bowls. The illustration does not indicate whether the vessel was perforated or marked by finger impressions, though turning marks are visible on the exterior surface. It is characterized by a very short, convergent neck, an inconspicuous Md, slender shape and narrow base, thus belonging to Holthoer's transitional subtype (1977: PI. VIII, BB:10, 7) which includes vessels of the fifth group at Deir el-Balah. The distribution of the beerbottle is not restricted to sites west of the Jordan River. At Tell es-Sa'idiyeh, one complete example derived from Tomb 104, a child's burial in the Iron Age cemetery (Pritchard 1980: Fig. 7:5). The vessel displays all the morphological details and physical traits associated with the Deir el-Balah jars: fingerprints marking the lower walls, turning marks visible on the interior and exterior surfaces, a wide aperture and a broad Md tapering towards a narrow, perforated base (compare our PI. 58:6). An additional six fragmentary bases were found scattered throughout the area of the cemetery. Two 36</page><page sequence="43">EGYPTIAN POTTERY of the fragmentary vessels were imperforated. Tomb 104 probably belongs to the earliest phase of the cemetery, possibly dated to the latter half of the 13th century BCE (Pritchard 1980: 28-29). At Tell es-Sa'idiyeh, then, the beerbottle clearly served a funerary function, possibly related to ritual libations for the dead, as Pritchard suggests (Pritchard 1980: 7-8), or as a reminder of the rites of beer- making associated with the Egyptian mortuary cult. At Deir 'Alia, several fragmentary examples of a cylindrical type of beerbottle were discovered (Franken 1969: Fig. 62:29). Beerbottles were found at Deir 'Alia in small numbers from Phase E on. The example illustrated in the report derives from Phase F, on the floor south of Wall S (Franken 1969: 48^9). All examples were apparently unperforated. Franken (1969: 107) suggests that these vessels may have been associated with an industry such as sugar making and possibly used for the coagulation of a liquid. A group of vessels that are striking in their similarity to flower pots and beerbottles comes from medieval Cyprus and is associated with a cane sugar industry of the 14th century CE (von Wartburg 1983: Fig. 3, Pl. XLIII:b). Although sugar production in the Mediterranean world is considered a result of the Muslim conquest, the striking similarity of the vessels supports Franken's suggestion. The vessel from Deir 'Alia is different in shape from those at Deir el-Balah but similar to examples published by Holthoer (1977: PI. 18: cylindrical subtype). The vessels from Deir 'Alia are characterized by finger impressions marking the lower walls as well as turning marks visible on the interior and exterior surfaces. Technically, they are very similar to the Late Bronze Age vessels from Canaanite sites and the XVIIIth and XlXth Dynasty types from Egypt and may belong to a period close to that of Level VI at Beth-Shean. Tell Mazar, located just north of Deir 'Alia, has also yielded examples of beerbottles (Yassine 1984: 112-13). Although illustrations of these vessels are not provided in the preliminary reports, they appear, like those from Deir 'Alia, to have been unperforated. Yassine (1984: 113) describes them only as having thick walls near the base and fingerprints marking the lower walls. The vessels were associated with what appears to have been the refuse from a cooking area of the Iron Age sanctuary (Yassine 1984: 112-13). Beerbottles, then, were abundant and widespread during the XVIIIth and XlXth dynasties in Egypt and have been discovered in tombs, often together with flower pots, as well as in non-mortuary contexts. At Deir el-Balah, large numbers have been found in the settlement, where they clearly served a utilitarian function. The two examples found during our excavations in the cemetery are testimony to the ritual use attested to in Egypt, although flower pots were not present. At Beth-Shean, Hazor, Deir 'Alia and Tell Mazar, beerbottles are represented at settlements, while at Tell el-Far' ah (S) and Tell es- Sa'idiyeh they are known from burials. At none of these locations are beerbottles found in conjunction with flower pots. Conversely, at Canaanite sites where flower pots have been discovered, e.g., Tell el-'Ajjul (Petrie 1932: PI. XXVII:9Q),Birel-'Abd (Oren 1973b) and Haruvit (Oren 1983), beerbottles do not appear. These observations indicate that beerbottles served a dual function in Egypt and elsewhere, being associated with mortuary customs as well as domestic or industrial activities. For the ancient Egyptians, it is unlikely that the two functions were differentiated; rather, ritual acts were directly related to daily activities and vice versa. The similarities of beerbottles and flower pots in terms of their physical structure and morphological traits, as well as their discovery together in Egyptian tombs, suggest that these two vessels had a related function. Outside Egypt, this function seems to have been fulfilled by only one of the two types at any given site. Apparently, the symbolic association of these two vessels was not significant outside Egypt, and either the beerbottle or the flower pot was employed for the prescribed mortuary or utilitarian function. The probability that these vessels were used in the preparation of beer was initially thought improbable by our staff, due to the obvious difficulty of containing a liquid in a vessel with a perforated base. Petrie's findings during his excavations at the cemetery at Rifeh (Petrie 1907: 23) provide evidence to the contrary. There he found an assemblage of 37</page><page sequence="44">CHAPTER TWO Egyptian-style bowls, often perforated through the base. One contained a pressed cake of barley mash and grains. Consequently, Petrie suggested that these bowls "were used to squeeze out the fermented beer from the grain, the cake being sufficiently tenacious not to break through at the hole" (Petrie 1907: 23). If perforated bowls could be used in this manner, perforated jars could serve this purpose as well. The unperforated vessels could then have been used to contain the fermented liquid. In light of the evidence from Egypt and elsewhere, this hypothesis no longer seems unlikely. VII. STORAGE JARS (Fig. 2.6) This category includes vessels of large and very large size that display features characteristic of Egyptian pottery. This collection from Deir el- Balah is small and the vessels are fragmentary, making their classification difficult, though two or three types seem to be represented: tall-necked storage jars, Type A (Fig. 2.6:1-2), possibly including two different subtypes (Al and A2), and holemouth storage jars, Type B (Fig. 2.6:3-8). Our classification diverges from that of Holthoer, who distinguishes between large and very large vessels with and without handles (Holthoer 1977: 97-101 , PI. 22, amphorae; 80-83, Pis. 16-17, storage jars). In our basic arrangement of the pottery at Deir el-Balah according to ethnicity, Egyptian-style storage jars with and without handles have been classified together as distinct from Canaanite storage jars. Neither tall-necked nor holemouth storage jars were discovered in quantity at Deir el-Balah, though the latter outnumbered the former. Among the tall- necked storage jars, four or possibly five examples of Type Al are known, while only one fragment of Type A2 was found. Despite the greater number of holemouth vessels, the study of Type B was difficult due to the fragmentary condition of all the examples from the settlement and the resemblance Fig. 2.6. Storage jars.

Storage jars. 39</page><page sequence="46">CHAPTER TWO of the upper body and rim of this type to certain kinds of kraters (see Chapter 4). The approach employed here differs from that of Holthoer not only as a consequence of dissimilarities in the primary classification, but also as a result of differences in the assemblages of storage jars. The two-handled, tall-necked amphorae included in Holthoer's study are broader than vessels of Type A 1 from our site and lack the convex neck and white burnished slip characteristic of the group from Deir el-Balah . Type A2 jars are altogether lacking among the ceramics from Nubia. The storage jars without handles discussed by Holthoer are dominated by ovoid shapes; only one vessel in this category bears a resemblance to vessels of Type B from Deir el- Balah (cf. Holthoer 1977; PI. 16: 185/544:6). Vessels included in Holthoer's "simple jars," however, more closely approximate the holemouth jars discussed here (Holthoer 1977: 169-71, PI. 40). Storage jars of Type Al are represented by the complete example from Tomb 114 discovered during the excavations in the cemetery conducted in 1972 (T. Dothan 1979: 10-11, Ills. 14, 16).Afew additional fragments were found in the settlement (e.g. Fig. 2.6:2). Almost all the Type Al fragments are characterized by a thick white or cream-colored slip that is vertically burnished, and a fabric levigated with a white, calcareous temper and fired to a red or brown hue. Only one sherd (Fig. 2.6:2) displays no signs of burnish on the white slip. As mentioned above, this ware and surface treatment are characteristic of Egyptian-style vessels of various ceramic types; all were therefore suspected of having been of Egyptian manufacture. The white burnished slip was probably intended as an imitation of alabaster. Only two of these jars are from secure stratigraphie contexts: the complete vessel was associated with an anthropoid coffin burial of late 13th century BCE date (Tomb 114; T. Dothan 1979: 5) and the other derived from the crater fill of Stratum VI (PI. 30:14). The remaining fragments were either surface finds or from unclear contexts. Storage jars of Type Al are well known in Egyptian New Kingdom contexts, although not always treated with a white burnished slip, e.g., at Thebes, dated to the reign of Amenophis II (Petrie 1897: PI. VII:3), at Tell el-Amarna (Peet and Woolley 1923: PI. LIII:LXIII/104; Frankfort and Pendlebury 1933: Pl.LIII:XVIII/6),atGurob,from the XVIIIth and XlXth Dynasty cemetery (Lout 1905: PI. 11:27) and in XXth Dynasty contexts at Deir el-Medineh (Nagel 1938: Fig. 82:2) and Tell el-Yehudiyeh (Naville and Griffith 1890: PI. XIV:3-7). Storage jars of Type Al occasionally appear with painted decoration (e.g., at Gurob and Kahun, Petrie 1890: PI. XXI:42). Jars of this shape are commonly represented in smaller sizes (e.g., at Riqqeh, Engelbach et al. 1915: Pl.XXXVII:466h). They are depicted in tomb paintings dating from the reign of Thutmose III, carried by Syrian princes bearing tribute (Davies 1943: Pis. 22, 23, 44, 45, 48,49). Vintage scenes from the tomb of an official who served under Amenophis III (Davies and Davies 1923: Pl. XXX), as well as the sealed jars from the tomb of Tutankhamun (Carter 1933: Vol. III, PI. L:A-B), witness the use of these vessels as wine jars, although this was probably not their sole function. In addition to wine, they are said to have contained resins, oils and honey (Holthoer 1977: 97) and possibly meat and spices (Grace 1956: 86, 98). At Deir el-Medineh, at least one vessel was found to contain the remains of grains (Nagel 1938: Fig. 8:1, Pl. 15). Alongside these vessels, two additional kinds of two-handled storage jars appear in Egyptian New Kingdom contexts. One is clearly an imitation of the "Canaanite jar" with a broad, conspicuous shoulder, tapering body and a small, thickened, truncated base (Tell el-Amarna, Peet and Woolley 1923: Pis. LII:XLIII/67; LIII:LX/82; Gurob and Kahun, Petrie 1890: Pi. XX:13). The other bears a resemblance to storage jars of Type Al but has a shorter, broader body contour. Vessels of this kind are sometimes treated with a white or yellow slip. At Gurob, one of these vessels is described as having a "polished, drab white surface, upon which is painted a lotus pattern" (Petrie 1890: PI. XXI:42). At Harageh, a vessel dated to the period following the reign of Thutmose III is recorded as 40</page><page sequence="47">EGYPTIAN POTTERY having a buff slip (Engelbach and Gunn 1923: PI. XLIV:460). At Deir el-Medineh, vessels of this kind, apparently without surface treatment, appear (Nagel 1938: Figs. 16-17). Individual Type Al storage jars of Egyptian provenance that closely resemble those from Deir el-Balah derive principally from Tell el-Amarna and Gurob. The vessel from Tell el-Amarna was published for the first time by Grace and is described as having a "buff slip" (Grace 1956: 103, PI. IX:7). At Deir el-Medineh, a large number of storage jars of Type Al derive from almost every published tomb as well as from the workmen's village. Many examples were found in Tomb 359, whose original use is dated to the 21st year of Ramesses III, and which was reused in year one of Ramesses VI (Nagel 1938: Figs. 8:1-3; 9:6-8; 10:11-13; 11:16-18; 12:21-23; 13:26-30; 14:31-32; 16:40^2; 17:43). None of these vessels is recorded as having a slip. From Tomb 1 1 37 , a storage jar with a "yellow slip" is dated by its inscription to the XVIIIth Dynasty (Nagel 1938: Fig. 37). A vessel from Tomb 1145 also had a yellow slip (Nagel 1938: Fig. 39:12). Tombs 1159, 1164, 1165 and 1169 also yielded storage jars of Type Al (Nagel 1938: Figs. 50:8; 56:1-5; 63:5; 64:12; 68), as did the excavations in the workmen's village (Nagel 1938: Fig. 109: 1-2). Most of these vessels are somewhat taller and more slender than those from Deir el-Balah. The rare occurrence of alabaster storage jars of Type Al in Egypt obscures the significance of the white, sometimes burnished, slip that characterizes these vessels. Alabaster vessels are known from the tomb of Tutankhamun (Carter 1933: Vol. Ill, PI. LXXVIII:A) and from a XXIst Dynasty tomb at Tanis where the vessel was apparently in secondary use (Montet 195 1 : PI. LXII). Undoubtedly, the great weight of the large alabaster vessels was the primary factor in limiting their fabrication. In Canaan, a few tall-necked storage jars of Egyptian style are represented in the Late Bronze Age II and early Iron Age. At Tell el-'Ajjul, two examples of tall-necked storage jars are represented in Late Bronze Age II contexts. One vessel approximates the complete example of Type Al jars from Deir el-Balah (Petrie 1932: Pl. XXXILH3, K5) while the other is smaller and more rounded (Petrie 1931: Pl.XLVIILWB). At Beth ShemeshandAphek they appear slightly later. The vessel from Beth Shemesh, from Tomb 1 of transitional Late Bronze Age II-Iron Age I date, is characterized by a tall, convex neck, inconspicuous shoulder and truncated base (Grant 1929: PI. 173:2). Excavation of the Egyptian residency at Aphek (13th century BCE) yielded a white-burnished vessel with a tall, convex neck and rounded, short body with a flattened base (Beck and Kochavi 1985: Fig. 2:5). At Tell el- Far'ah (S), two vessels, both characterized by a tall, convex neck and rounded body contour, were found associated with an anthropoid coffin burial of early Iron Age date, Tomb 552 (Petrie 1930: PI. XXIV:552). No surface treatment is recorded for the two vessels. Two additional vessels, decorated with line clusters, are similar (Starkey and Harding 1932: PI. LXXXVII:934, 935). As previously noted by Grace and Dothan, storage jars of Type Al were a product of the imitation and adaptation in Egypt of the two- handled Canaanite storage jars that were used commercially throughout the Mediterranean during the Late Bronze Age (Grace 1956: 86; T. Dothan 1979: 10). In Egypt, these vessels acquired such traits as a high, convex neck, characteristic of other Egyptian ceramic types, and long, slender body, reminiscent of the handleless, slender wine jars used in Egypt during the Old and Middle Kingdoms (Grace 1956: 88, 90). Moreover, the white burnished slip in imitation of alabaster, a material commonly employed in Egypt for the production of luxury items, may be an indication of the foreign nature of this ceramic type. Only one fragmentary example of what appears to be a different type of tall-necked storage jar (Type A2) was found at Deir el-Balah on Floor 1006 of Stratum IX (PI. 8:3). The rim and neck, which are the only parts preserved, are reminiscent of certain funnel-necked jars but represent a vessel of much larger size. Such vessels are commonly represented in New Kingdom Egyptian contexts, characterized by various body shapes including rounded, ovoid 41</page><page sequence="48">CHAPTER TWO and carinated. At Tell el-Amarna, vessels of this type are illustrated with a carinated contour (Peet and Woolley 1923: PI. XLIV:L016), ovoid (Peet and Woolley 1923: PI. LIV:LXXVIII/236) as well as rounded shaped (Frankfort and Pendlebury 1933: PI. LI:XII/1 , 2). At Gurob, these vessels are characterized by either a conspicuous Md (Lout 1905: PI. 11:32) or rounded shape (Brunton and Engelbach 1927: Pl. XXXVII:41A). At Deir el- Medineh, several examples are illustrated; one of these has a white painted exterior (Nagel 1938: Tomb 357, Fig. 5:11; Tomb 359, Figs. 20-22; Tomb 1161, Fig. 53:4-5; Tomb 1164, Fig. 56:24, 27, 29; Tomb 1165, Fig. 63:10; Tomb 1172, Fig. 86:15). They are, however, completely lacking in the published ceramics from Canaanite sites. Storage jars of Type B are represented here by the two complete vessels discovered during excavations in the cemetery at Deir el-Balah in 1972 (Fig. 2.6:3 in this chapter; Beit-Arieh 1985: Tomb 112, Fig. 6:7). Since fragmentary examples of these storage jars may easily be confused with kraters, we have limited this category to sherds that most closely reproduce the characteristics of the complete vessels. Nevertheless, it is possible that storage jars of Type B encompass more than one subtype, since they include vessels displaying an assortment of rim shapes and varying aperture width. The two complete vessels discovered in the cemetery share many common morphological features: both are characterized by a convergent upper termination, wide aperture, modelled, usually rolled rim, broad but elongated body contour and medium-low, inconspicuous Md. The bases of these two vessels differ, however, in that the jar from Tomb 1 12 has a pointed base (Beit-Arieh 1985: Fig. 6:7), while the vessel illustrated here (Fig. 2.6:3) has a truncated base of the kind often associated with two-handled Canaanite storage jars. This example may thus represent one of the truly hybrid vessels found at Deir el-Balah. Storage jars of Type B appear initially in a secure Stratum VII context (Locus 1028) and continue thereafter, albeit mostly in pits, until Stratum IV. The jar published by Beit-Arieh (1985: 52, Fig. 6:7) was found in Tomb 1 12, of 13th century BCE date. In Egypt, storage jars that are similar to those of Type B at Deir el-Balah derive from various New Kingdom sites including Tell el-Amarna (Peet and Woolley 1923: Pis. XLIV:XX/234; XLVIII:XX/14; L:XXV/230), Meydum (Petrie et al. 1912: Pl. XIX:97), Gurob (Lout 1905: PI. 11:33) and Deir el-Medineh (Nagel 1938: Fig. 109:14, workmen's village; Tomb 359, Fig. 132; Tomb 1161, Fig. 53:6). All have either rounded or pointed bases and none displays the truncated base of the vessel from Deir el-Balah. The vessels of Egyptian provenance indicate a tendency toward more rounded, shorter shapes than those found at Deir el-Balah. At Tell el-Amarna, the relationship between holemouth storage jars and certain handleless kraters is particularly clear: note the relationship between Peet and Woolley 1923: PI. XLIX:XX/234 Oar) and in PI. LII:LI/60 (krater), and PI. XLVIII:XX/14 (jar) and PI. XLVIII:XX/15, 1048 (krater). The total lack of these vessels in other Canaanite Late Bronze Age contexts suggests either that their function was not relevant to Canaan, or that different local Canaanite vessels were employed in their stead. Unlike those of Type Al , the use of storage jars of Type B is not documented in Egyptian wall paintings. Holthoer (1977: 80) suggests that, since representations of pottery vessels in Egyptian wall paintings are schematic, the vessels included in his category of storage jars could be confused with the smaller ovoid jars that are often depicted. Holthoer (1977: 80) proposes that they served a similar function to the modern Egyptian zir, which is used to contain water. VIII. SPINNING BOWLS (Fig. 2.7:1-10; Photos 2.20-22) Spinning bowls, a medium-deep bowl form with interior handles made of utilitarian ware, are the only Egyptian ceramic type that commonly appears in Canaan. They appear initially in Late Bronze Age II contexts and increase in quantity during the Iron Age I. The distribution of these vessels in Canaan and Egypt, as well as their function and 42</page><page sequence="49">EGYPTIAN POTTERY depiction in Egyptian tomb paintings and models, have been discussed by T. Dothan (1963: 97-112). Consequently we have limited our main comments here to a description of the vessels from Deir el- Balah and their specific Canaanite and Egyptian parallels. Spinning bowls appear in Canaan in the Late Bronze Age II at Tell el-'Ajjul (Petrie 1932: PI. XXVII: 15W3), Beth-Shean (Fitzgerald 1930: 5, 20, Pl. XLI:29; T. Dothan 1963: 99, Fig. 1:2) and Tell Jerishe (T. Dothan 1963: 99, Fig. 1:8). A few spinning bowls excavated by Macalister at Gezer derive from contexts that are stratigraphically unclear (Macalister 1912: Vol. II, 146, 169, Fig. 329; Vol. Ill, PI. CXLVI1:18). Spinning bowls dating from the early Iron Age include isolated examples from Megiddo (Loud 1948: PI. 70:3), Tell Jerishe (T. Dothan 1963: 100) and Beth Shemesh (Grant 1932: 27, PI. XXXI:28), as well as two relatively large collections from Tell Qasile (T. Dothan 1963: 100, Fig. 2:1-4) and Beth-Shean (Fitzgerald 1930: 26, PI. XLIV: 1 1 ; T. Dothan 1963: 99, Fig. 1:3-4, 12; James 1966: Figs. 31:21; 50:10; Yadin andGeva 1986: 84, Fig. 35:2). An additional example derives from the vicinity of Beth-Shean (Zori 1977: 55, PI. 17:2, Site 86). One example of a spinning bowl of Iron Age II date has been discovered in a 7th century BCE context at Tell Jemmeh (T. Dothan 1963: 100-101, Fig. 1:7). In Egypt, a few examples of spinning bowls of Xllth Dynasty date are known, e.g., from Abu Ghalib (Larsen 1941: 30-31, Pl. 21b) and Kahun (Petrie 1890: 25, PI. XIII:58). At Kahun stone vessels of this type are also represented. Thereafter, they appear in XVIIIth to XXIst Dynasty contexts: bowls of both stone and pottery are documented at Tell el- Amarna (Peet and Woolley 1923: 61, 137, PI. XLVIII :Type CIII; Kemp 1984: Fig. 10:1-26) and at Deir el-Medineh (Nagel 1938: 183-88, Figs. 152-55, Pl. XI:Type XVI). Two stone spinning bowls from Lisht are dated to the XXth and XXIst dynasties (T. Dothan 1963: 103, PI. 15:A-B). At Deir el-Balah, ten examples of spinning bowls were found during excavations at the settlement. These vessels display certain morphological features that corroborate the suggestion, proposed by Dothan, that spinning bowls were adopted into the Canaanite ceramic repertoire and produced locally according to the styles prevalent at each particular site. These traits reinforce the proposition that such vessels served an industrial function related to the craft of spinning (T. Dothan 1963: 104). For a discussion of the function of the spinning bowl and its representation in Egyptian wall paintings and models, see T. Dothan 1963: 104-12. Of the ten examples of spinning bowls found at Deir el-Balah, only one is preserved with a complete profile (Fig. 2.7:1). Many of the other vessels are very fragmentary, though certain features specific to these vessels are apparent. For example, the base membrane and lower walls are much thicker than those of the regular bowls at Deir el-Balah. This technical feature presumably served to support the extra weight of the interior handles, as well as adding to the weight of the vessel itself, increasing its stability during use. Nevertheless, a simple experiment conducted in our offices indicated that pulling yarn through the interior handles caused the bowl to move about. In order to function effectively, these bowls must have been weighed down by some other means, possibly by filling them with water (Nagel 1938: 188). Ring bases, which are low and crudely made, are the most common type (Type C, Fig. 2.7:5-10), although flat and disc bases are also represented (Types A and B, Fig. 2.7: 1 - 4). Neutron Activation Analysis performed on one of the spinning bowls from Deir el-Balah indicates local manufacture (Fig. 2.7:2; see Chapter 3). Among the group of spinning bowls from our site, two types of ware have been distinguished: the first is the common fabric found at the site, a soft ware mixed with a large amount of organic temper (Fig. 2.7:4-6, 9), and the second a harder material containing both grits and organic matter (Fig. 2.7:1-3,7-8, 10). At Deir el-Balah, only spinning bowls of the kind with two interior handles are represented. Elsewhere in Canaan and in Egypt, bowls with one, three or four interior handles have occasionally been found. Bowls with a single interior handle are known in Canaan at Tell Jerishe (T.

XIII:58). Spinning bowls with three interior handles, of both stone and pottery, are represented only at Deir el-Medineh (Nagel 1938: 185, Fig. 154, Pl. XI:Type XVI: 1922 M8, M7). A vessel with four interior handles, two rows of two handles each, was discovered at Beth-Shean in an early Iron Age context (James 1966: Fig. 50:2). The interior handles were attached to the bowl by pressing and molding the ends onto the interior surfaces, roughly aligned with the center of the bowl. The interior handles are sometimes joined in the center (Fig. 2.7: 1 , 3-6, 8), apparently to provide extra strength 44</page><page sequence="51">EGYPTIAN POTTERY Fig. 2.7. Spinning bowls and goblets. 45</page><page sequence="52">CHAPTER TWO Photo 2.20. Spinning bowls. Photo 2.21 . Spinning bowls. Photo 2.22. Spinning bowl (Fig. 2.7:10). (T. Dothan 1963: 104); other bowls have separate handles, not joined together (Fig. 2.7:2, 7, 10). All of the handles are marked by grooves on their undersides; vessels that are made of a softer fabric display deeper incisions (Fig. 2.7:5-6). The concentration of vessels in our assemblage deriving from the crater fill and its associated loci is significant, although most are from unclear contexts. They are absent from the loci of Strata IX-VII. A wide variety of structural features is characteristic of the spinning bowls from Deir el- Balah. Three main types have been classified here according to the shape of the base, the only element consistently preserved. Type A spinning bowls are characterized by a flat base. Type Al (Fig. 2.7:1), our only complete example, displays a flat base, two attached interior handles, a medium-deep shape with rounded, incurved sides and a modelled, everted rim. The shape of this bowl is highly reminiscent of Bowl Type E, particularly the example with a flat base (Fig. 2.1:12, Type E2). A variant of the flat-based spinning bowl (Type A2) is represented by a fragmentary vessel (Fig. 2.7:2) which, however, is smaller and incorporates two separate handles. Flat-based spinning bowls of similar contour and proportions are known in Egypt from Tell el-Amarna and Deir el-Medineh as well as in Canaan at Beth-Shean. Although numerous spinning bowls characterized by a flat base are represented at these sites, not one example parallels the complete vessel from Deir el-Balah. At Tell el-Amarna, flat-based spinning bowls are, in general, characterized by an inflected contour and inturned rim thickened on the exterior (Peet and Woolley 1923: Pl.XLVIII:XIII/4,20,79, 198; Kemp 1984: Fig. 10:1, 26). The spinning bowls from Deir el-Medineh are mostly fragmentary (Nagel 1938: Pl. XI: 1922 M7) and thus do not provide adequate data for a detailed comparison. At Beth-Shean, spinning bowls preserved with a complete profile are quite different from our example, one displaying an inturned rim thickened on the interior (Fitzgerald 1930: PI. XLIV: 11), while a second is characterized by an unmodelled direct rim (James 1966: Fig. 49:21). Two examples of spinning bowls of Type B, characterized by a disc base, are very fragmentary (Fig. 2.7:3-4). One has two joined interior handles while the other lacks both handles, though they appear to have been joined just above the interior surface of the bowl. Spinning bowls with a disc 46</page><page sequence="53">EGYPTIAN POTTERY base are known only among vessels of Canaanite provenance, represented at Tell el-'Ajjul (Petrie 1932: PI. XXVII: 15W3), Gezer (Macalister 1912: Vol. III, PI. CXLVI:19) and Beth-Shean (James 1966: Fig. 31:21). Spinning bowls of Type C, represented by six fragmentary vessels, are the most common type in our collection (Fig. 2.7:5-10). These feature a ring base that is always very low and crudely fabricated. Three of the vessels of Type C have two attached interior handles, two have separate handles and the sixth is too fragmentary to provide information on the handles. A variant of Type C spinning bowls consists of a vessel in which the base membrane protrudes below the ring base (Fig. 2.7:10), a feature noted among the spinning bowls from Deir el-Medineh (Nagel 1938: Pl. XLType XVI: 1922 M9). Spinning bowls with a ring base are known in Egypt only at Deir el-Medineh, while in Canaan they are more common, appearing at Beth-Shean, Gezer and Tell Jerishe. From Deir el-Medineh, in addition to the variant discussed above, a spinning bowl with a ring base and three interior handles is published (Nagel 1938: Pl. XI:Type 16:1922 M8). At Beth-Shean, one of the vessels of Late Bronze Age II date has a ring base and two joined interior handles (Fitzgerald 1930: PI. XLI: 29). The vessel from Gezer is unusual, displaying a conspicuous shoulder (Macalister 1912: Vol. II, Fig. 329). From Tell Jerishe, four vessels with ring base are published by Dothan, two of which have single interior handles (T. Dothan 1963: Fig. 1:5, 8,10-11). Results of Neutron Activation Analysis performed on one of the spinning bowls from Deir el-Balah, as well as the similarity of the complete vessel to bowls of Type E, testify to their local manufacture. The execution and ware of the assemblage of spinning bowls warrant their inclusion in the central repertoire of utilitarian wares from our site, and are indicative of the incorporation of Egyptian craft into Canaan. The absence of spinning bowls in well-stratified contexts of Strata IX-VII suggests that they were introduced at Deir el-Balah subsequent to the initial occupation of the site. Their concentration in the fill of the crater and associated loci, located in an industrial area associated with the production of goods for funerary rites, enables us to make an association between the functions of these vessels in spinning and cloth manufacture and the use of such cloth in the cemetery. Many bronze objects from the cemetery display traces of cloth (T. Dothan 1979: Figs. 43, 151,111s. 154- 55), which may have been produced in this industrial quarter. IX. GOBLETS (Fig. 2.7:11-12; Photo 2.23) Vessels characterized by a deep, carinated body supported by a raised, trumpet-shaped base are known from Egyptian and Canaanite contexts of 14th and 13th century BCE date. In Egypt, few ceramic vessels of this kind are known, though lotus-shaped goblets were produced in a variety of other materials during the New Kingdom and are similar in shape to the vessels discussed here. Pottery vessels of this kind are also relatively uncommon in Canaanite contexts of Late Bronze Age II date, but are represented by two examples from the settlement at Deir el-Balah. Although the two goblets from Deir el-Balah differ in size and surface treatment, their shapes are alike, characterized by a conspicuous, low Md, concave wall contour and splayed, high base. The smaller goblet (Fig. 2.7: 1 1) displays traces of a red slip on the exterior surface and an interior band on the inner lip, reminiscent of the decoration of other goblets of Canaanite provenance, e.g., from Lachish (see below). The exceptional size of this vessel and its elongated shape suggest that it served a specialized function. The larger goblet (Fig. 2.7: 12) was discovered in Locus 1006 (a floor of Stratum IX), together with a number of other restorable vessels, some of which display Egyptianizing features. During the Late Bronze Age II in Canaan, chalices appear to have been the preferred ceramic type, while the use of goblets seems to have been limited. However, goblets characterized by a carinated body shape and a low or medium- high stemmed base are represented in Canaanite contexts of Middle Bronze Age II date and are 47</page><page sequence="54">CHAPTER TWO closely affiliated to the carinated bowls so popular at that time (Amiran 1969: 95, PI. 28). Similar goblets appear occasionally in Late Bronze Age I contexts (Amiran 1969: 129, 134, PI. 40:1-2); they are not entirely unrelated to the vessels discussed here. From the Fosse Temple at Lachish, several goblets are published (Tufnell et al. 1940: Pl. XLVII). Three of them (Tufnell et al. 1940: Pl. XLVII:225, 227, 236), similar in style to those from Deir el-Balah, derived from Structure III of the Fosse Temple. One of these vessels (Tufnell et al. 1940: Pl. XLVII:227) displays traces of a painted decoration on the exterior surface that is markedly similar to the vessel from Tel Mor described below, although the pattern is incomplete due to the poor state of preservation of the vessel. Another goblet (Tufnell et al. 1940: Pl. XLVII:225) exhibits a decoration consisting of horizontal lines painted in black and red, possibly similar to the decoration on the large vessel from Deir el-Balah. An additional goblet associated with Structure I of the Fosse Temple is decorated with a linear pattern (Tufnell et al. 1940: Pl. XLVII:223), which may have been the kind of motif depicted on the fragmentary vessel described above. At Tel Mor, a goblet of similar style to those from Deir el-Balah and Lachish was discovered in a Late Bronze Age I context (M . Dothan 1 973 : 3-5 , Fig. 4:3). The decoration of this goblet is unique among the vessels discussed here, portraying a stylized floral motif clearly suggestive of the modelled lotus patterns seen on faience goblets of Egyptian origin (Davies 1982: Figs. 145^48). The goblet from Tel Mor thus represents a hybrid or composite vessel displaying traits of both the Canaanite and the Egyptian ceramic traditions. Goblets found in Canaanite contexts display a clear link to cultic installations. Examples similar to the smaller vessel from Deir el-Balah appear in the Area H temples at Hazor (Yadin et al. 1961 : Pl. CCCXXIII:20), the Lachish Fosse Temple (Tufnell et al. 1940: Pl. XLVIL236) and the Deir 'Alia sacred precinct (Franken 1992: Pl. 12:a). Ceramic goblets have rarely been found in New Kingdom contexts in Egypt, appearing in the Photo 2.23. Goblet (Fig. 2.7: 12). published material only at Tell el-Amarna (Peet and Woolley 1923: PI. LII:XLV/1037) and at Deir el-Medineh (Nagel 1938: Pl. XVILType XXV). The goblets from both sites are undecorated but are similar in shape to the goblets of Canaanite provenance. In Egypt, goblets first appear early in the New Kingdom, made of faience and adorned with modelled lotus flower motifs (Davies 1982: 146-47, Figs. 145-48). Although the origins of the goblet in Egypt are obscure, and the shape may indeed have been influenced by Canaanite and other foreign ceramic styles, it was quickly adapted to suit Egyptian tastes and was produced in alabaster, glass and metal, in addition to faience (Davies 1982: 129, 163, Figs. 119; 173-74). Goblets used in ceremonial royal banqueting scenes are often depicted in wall paintings of New Kingdom date. The interchange between the ceramic traditions of Canaan and ancient Egypt is once again illustrated among the vessels discussed here. The shape of the goblet seems to have been foreign to Egypt and may have had its antecedents in the typical carinated bowls and goblets produced during the Middle Bronze Age II period in Canaan. In 48</page><page sequence="55">EGYPTIAN POTTERY Egypt, goblets were rarely manufactured of clay but rather from more expensive materials. This observation, considered together with the common illustration of goblets in wall paintings depicting royal banqueting scenes, suggests that those vessels served a primarily ceremonial function in Egypt. The goblets of Canaanite provenance, particularly the vessel from Tel Mor, seem to constitute a Canaanite rendering of the Egyptian-style goblet, which itself may have been adopted from earlier Canaanite ceramic styles. X. STANDS (Fig. 2.8:1-4; Photo 2.24) Four complete or nearly complete stands, and many fragmentary examples, were uncovered in Late Bronze Age strata in the settlement of Deir el-Balah. Stands are a well-established form in both Egyptian and Canaanite contexts during the Late Bronze Age, although the form continues remarkably unchanged through the Iron Age II . We have included the stands in this chapter, although the form cannot be considered strictly Egyptian or Canaanite in origin. Fig. 2.8:1 is an incomplete large stand with a modelled rim and holes pierced through its sides before firing. Body sherds from three other stands pierced with holes before firing were found in Loci 502, 512 and 1209. Parallels come from the Photo 2.24. Stands. Lachish Fosse Temple (Tufnell et al. 1940: Pl. LIIIB:328) and from Hazor (Yadin et al. 1961: Pl. CCLXXVI:9). Fig. 2.8:2 is an incomplete medium-sized stand with thick ridged walls. Parallels come from Hazor (Yadin et al. 1961 : Pis. CCXXXII: 18; CCLXXVI:5). Fig. 2.8:3 is a complete medium-sized stand with smooth sides and modelled rim. It is paralleled at Lachish (Tufnell et al. 1940: Pl. LIIIB:326; Tufnell 1958: Pl. 49:8), Hazor (Yadin et al. 1961: Pl. CCLX:14) and Gezer (Seger 1988: PI. 9:1). Fig. 2.8:4 is a small complete stand with smooth sides and modelled rim. Parallels were found at Hazor (Yadin et al. 1961: Pl. CXXXIL16) and Lachish (Tufnell et al. 1940: Pl. LIIIB:333; see also Holthoer 1977: TU 4, PI. 15:185/511:25). XI. LENTOID FLASKS (Fig. 2.8:5-7) In Egypt, the earliest documented occurrence of a lentoid flask is in a funerary deposit dated to the reign of Tuthmosis III (Bourriau 1981: 75-76, Fig. 142). This flask derives from Grave E10 at Abydos and is described as fabricated from Nile silt and treated with a yellowish-red, vertically burnished slip. Lentoid flasks that appear in Egypt in mid-XVIIIth Dynasty contexts closely resemble contemporary vessels of Canaanite provenance. The earliest examples are decorated with concentric circles, as were Canaanite flasks, and are characterized by similar shapes and techniques of manufacture (Davies 1982: 83; Bourriau 1981: 76). By the end of the XVIIIth Dynasty, lentoid flasks were widespread in Egypt and appear in a variety of styles, all of which were locally made. They include small flasks that are one component of a double vessel, high-necked flasks, and flasks made of alabaster, faience and glass. Thereafter, flasks of Egyptian provenance become varied in style and appear, sometimes sporadically, until Coptic and Byzantine times, when they evolve into the true pilgrim flasks (Holthoer 1977: 99; Bourriau 1981: 75).

XXXIX:93E; Petrie 1891: 17, PI. XVII) , Saft (Petrie 1 906: PI . XXXIXD: 112), Umm el-Ga'ab (Bourriau 1981: 78, Fig. 148)andatRifeh (Petrie 1907: Pl. CCVII). For further discussion of double vessels, see below under Egyptian-style juglets. Examples of high-necked flasks come from Abydos (Randall-Maclver and Mace 1902: PI. LV: 13), Sedment (Petrie and Brunton 1924: PI. LX:25) and Gurob (Lout 1905: PI. 111:98). Alabaster lentoid flasks are represented at Gurob (Petrie 1891 : PI. XVII:42; Brunton and Engelbach 1927: Pl. LIII) and Sedment (Petrie and Brunton 1924: 33, PI. LXVI:8). At Gurob a faience flask is dated to the reign of Amenophis III (Petrie 1 89 1 : PI. XVIII:9). For an example of a glass vessel, see Nolte (1968: 172). The type of flask described here usually appears with a white burnished slip but is also known without surface treatment or with a red slip, for example at Gurob (Lout 1905: PI. 111:99, plain) and Deir el-Medineh (Nagel 1938: Fig. 35:6, with red slip). Among the relatively large group of lentoid flasks from Deir el-Balah, three fragmentary vessels 50</page><page sequence="57">EGYPTIAN POTTERY Fig. 2.8. Stands, lentoid flasks and juglets. 51</page><page sequence="58">CHAPTER TWO are identified as Egyptian in style, primarily due to their characteristic surface treatment consisting of a thick white burnished slip. Furthermore, two of the three sherds (Fig. 2.8:5-6) display the kind of fabric usually associated with white-burnished vessels at Deir el-Balah: a hard red material mixed with numerous small, white grits. The third fragment (Fig. 2.8:7) differs from these, having been fabricated from a soft material combined with organic matter, the kind of paste most commonly distinguished among the ceramics from our site. In the case of this vessel, a few medium-sized white grits were added to the body mass. For Canaanite flasks, see Chapter 4. Additional features of these sherds suggest that the two white-burnished flasks of hard, red material are distinct from the flask made of seemingly local clay. The former are very similar in style and shape, although not identical; slight differences in dimensions, rim shapes and techniques of handle attachment are apparent. The third fragment, in contrast, represents a vessel of large size decorated with concentric circles. All three sherds display the strokes left by the hard instrument used for burnishing; one example is vertically burnished only on the body (Fig. 2.8:5); the second is vertically burnished on the rim, neck and handles, as well as on the body (Fig. 2.8:6); while the third fragment shows signs of both vertical and horizontal burnishing on the body (Fig. 2.8:7). At Hazor, white-slipped lentoid flasks are attributed to both Late Bronze Age II and Iron Age I contexts. Several examples of white-slipped lentoid flasks from Tomb 8144 and from a contemporary context on the mound (Yadin et al. 1960: Pis. CXXX:8-11; CLVIII:1^) are dated to the Late Bronze Age II. One white-burnished flask was discovered in an Iron Age I context (Yadin et al. 1960: Pl. LXXXVIII:7). Because of the lack of published information regarding the fabric and surface treatment of the majority of white-slipped lentoid flasks of Canaanite provenance, we cannot be certain that they were influenced by Egyptian ceramic styles. Moreover, due to the inadequacy of pottery descriptions in early excavation reports , our knowledge of the fabric of lentoid flasks from Egypt is limited. Bourriau states that the most common fabric among Egyptian lentoid flasks, presumably the white-slipped variety, is a hard, dense material combined with quantities of limestone grits (Davies 1982: 83). However, the earliest example of a lentoid flask from Egypt, from Abydos, is described as being fabricated from Nile Silt A and treated with a yellowish-red slip (Bourriau 1981: 76). Holthoer documents a hard, pink ware among the lentoid flasks from Nubia (Holthoer 1 977 : 100); these, however, differ significantly from the vessels discussed here. In Egypt, the application of a white slip to flasks made of Nile silt seems to indicate imitation of the light-firing surface color of desert marls, which in itself was possibly a reproduction of the pale surface color of some fine wares of foreign manufacture. XII. JUGLETS (Fig. 2.8:8-9) Juglets with a small loop handle, tall neck, wide opening and rounded bulging body belong to the category of white-burnished vessels, found both in Egypt and in Canaan. At Deir el-Balah, two fragmentary juglets of this type , treated with a white burnished slip, were found; a complete vessel was discovered in an anthropoid coffin burial of XlXth Dynasty date (Fig. 2.8:8; T. Dothan 1979: 16, 111. 24; 17, 111. 29). In Egypt, white-burnished juglets enjoyed a small degree of popularity during the New Kingdom. In Canaan they are represented rather sporadically during the Late Bronze Age II and Iron Age I. As previously noted, such juglets have been found as one component of a double vessel. In Egypt double vessels consisting of a juglet and a lentoid flask occur at Gurob (Brunton and Engelbach 1927: Pl. XXXIX:93E), at Saft in Tomb 55 of XVIIIth to early XlXth Dynasty date (Petrie 1906: PI. XXXIXD:112; see also Bourriau 1981: 78, Fig. 148), at Rifeh from Tomb 20 of XVIIIth Dynasty date (Petrie 1907: PI. XXVII) and in the Boston Museum collection (Davies 1982: 83-84, Fig. 64). They are known in Nubia at Aniba (Steindorff 1937: Taf. 85:44a) and in the Scandinavian Joint Expedition material (Holthoer 1 977 : PI . 23 : 1 85/402: 1 ) . In Canaan , only one double 52</page><page sequence="59">EGYPTIAN POTTERY vessel of this kind is known; it was discovered in a tomb of 14th century BCE date near 'Akko (Ben- Arieh and Edelstein 1977: Fig. 10:10). The single complete example of a white- burnished juglet from Deir el-Balah (Fig. 2.8:8) was discovered in Tomb 1 14 with a silver ring inscribed with the name of Ramesses II (T. Dothan 1979: 5). This juglet is characterized by a tall, convex neck, a conspicuous Md and a button base. A thick white slip was applied to the exterior surface of the vessel and burnished with a hard instrument; the fabric of this juglet is similar to that described previously among the white-burnished vessels from Deir el-Balah, a hard red ware mixed with a white gritty temper. A fragmentary example (Fig. 2.8:9) corresponds to the complete vessel in terms of ware and surface treatment as well as displaying a button base and tapering lower body. This sherd derived from a Stratum VI context associated with the fill of the crater. An additional complete juglet (Beit-Arieh 1985: 50, Fig. 6:1), a surface find from the area of the cemetery, is very coarsely fashioned and lacks a white slip but nonetheless may represent an attempt at imitating the Egyptianizing version. When found in Canaan, white-burnished juglets are usually considered to be Egyptian in style and possibly manufacture. At Tell el-'Ajjul, four examples were discovered in XVIIIth and XlXth Dynasty contexts (Petrie 1931: PI. XLIV:34C/2, E/2; Petrie 1933: PI. XI:67; Petrie 1934: PI. XLIX:34E/2). At Lachish, two faience vessels that are similar in shape to the ceramic vessels described here are associated with Fosse Temple Structure III (Tufnell et al. 1940: Pis. XXI:55; XXIII:61). At Tell esh-Shari'a, one example was discovered in a context of the 13th century BCE (Oren 1972: 13, Fig. 6). Several examples of similar style, although not all displaying a white slip, were found at Beth-Shean. One fragmentary juglet was discovered in a context associated with the Temple of Seti I (Fitzgerald 1930: PI. XLV:6). From coffin burials in the Northern Cemetery, two white-slipped juglets are known (Oren 1973a: Fig. 46: 19, PI. 74: 1 1 , Tomb 227, Iron Age I; Fig. 48c:26, PI. 74: 12, Tomb 219A-B, mixed Late Bronze Age II/Iron Age I), while two other very similar vessels are unslipped (Oren 1973a: Fig. 476:21-22, Tomb 221A-B, mixed Late Bronze Age II/Iron Age I). At Megiddo, a fragmentary white-burnished juglet, as well as a calcite vessel of similar style, are both dated to Stratum VII A of the Iron Age I (Loud 1 948 : PI. 67:15, ceramic; PI. 259:23, calcite). The appearance of handled jugs and juglets in Egypt at the beginning of the New Kingdom seems to have been inspired by foreign ceramic traditions; previously, handled vessels were rarely represented in the Egyptian ceramic repertoire (Äström in Holthoer 1977: 92). During the XVIIIth and XlXth dynasties, white-burnished juglets make their appearance at such sites as Tell el-Amarna, Gurob and Kahun. At Gurob, two white-burnished juglets are published from XVIIIth and XlXth Dynasty contexts (Brunton and Engelbach 1927: Pl. XXIX:46h; Petrie 1890: PI. XVIII:5). Three examples are known from Tell el-Amarna (Peet and Woolley 1923: Pl. LX:XLII/1009, 1009A-B) and one from Kahun (Petrie 1890: PI. XIII:60). At Gurob and Tell el-Yehudiyeh, they continue in use during the XXth Dynasty. From XXth Dynasty contexts at Gurob, two juglets with a "very light red slip" are published, as well as a calcite vessel of similar style (Brunton and Engelbach 1927: Pis. XXX:37; XXXVIII:61H, ceramic; Petrie 1890: PI. XVIII:22, calcite). At Tell el-Yehudiyeh, three juglets of XXth Dynasty date are known (Naville and Griffith 1890: PI. XV:10). Among the white-burnished juglets of Canaanite and Egyptian provenance, two subtypes have emerged from our study. Subtype A refers to vessels with a globular body shape characterized by an inconspicuous Md, a tall, usually concave, neck, and a small or medium-sized disc base. In Canaan, Tell el-'Ajjul is the only site that has produced vessels of Subtype A (Petrie 1931: PI. XLIV:34C/2, E/2; Petrie 1933: PI. XI:67; Petrie 1934: PI. XLIX:34E/2). In Egypt, this version is known at Gurob during the XVIIIth and XlXth dynasties (Petrie 1890: PI. XVIII:5) and at Kahun (Petrie 1890: PI. XIII:6). All the juglets included among the double vessels of Canaanite provenance correspond to Subtype A. Subtype B, to which the vessels from Deir el- 53</page><page sequence="60">CHAPTER TWO Balah correspond, consists of juglets displaying a tapered body shape and a conspicuous Md, a high, usually convex, neck, and a small disc or button base. All of the juglets from Beth-Shean belong to this category (Fitzgerald 1930: PI. XLV:6; Oren 1973a: Fig. 46:19=Fig. 74:11; Fig. 47b:21=Fig. 74:13; Fig. 47b:22; Fig. 48c:26=Fig. 74:12), as do the vessels from Megiddo (Loud 1948: PI. 67:15) and Tell esh-Shari'a (Oren 1972: Fig. 6). In Egypt, the juglets from XXth Dynasty contexts at Gurob (Brunton and Engelbach 1927: Pis. XXX:37; XXXVIII:61) and at Tell el-Yehudiyeh (Naville and Griffith 1890: Pl. XV: 10) conform to Subtype B. The three white-burnished juglets from Tell el- Amarna are transitional in shape, illustrating features characteristic of both subtypes (Peet and Woolley 1923: PI. LI:XLII/1009, 1009A-B). Although the evidence is fragmentary, there seems to be a chronological distinction between the two subtypes of white-burnished juglets found in Egypt and Canaan. Subtype A appears to be limited to XVIIIth and XlXth Dynasty contexts in Egypt, while in Canaan it is rarely found, appearing only at Tell el-' Ajjul. Conversely, Subtype B is confined to XlXth and XXth Dynasty contexts in Egypt and is not represented earlier than the 1 3th century BCE in Canaan. Such a chronological distinction is unique in our study of Egyptian New Kingdom ceramics. White-burnished juglets thus represent an additional ceramic shape that was admired and imitated by the Egyptian potter, who altered its original form according to the standards present in the Egyptian ceramic milieu. Subtype A most likely represents a juglet whose features approach those of the original vessel that had been imitated; Subtype B displays characteristics that are distinctly Egyptian in style, such as the tall, convex neck shapes. As previously noted, the distinctive white burnished slip was employed to enhance the beauty of the vessel, perhaps distinguishing it as a shape of non-Egyptian origin as well as possibly serving a technical function in reducing the porosity of the fired clay. Although compositional analysis of the clays used in the manufacture of the white- burnished juglets of Canaanite provenance is lacking, the sporadic appearance of these juglets at Canaanite sites suggests that they were imported from Egypt. This may not be true, however, of the coarse unslipped juglet from Deir el-Balah and the untreated vessels from Beth-Shean. REFERENCES Albright, W.F. 1932.

Killebrew 3 INTRODUCTION Two studies (pre-1979 and post-1979) were undertaken to determine by means of chemical analysis the provenience of a selection of ceramic artifacts from Deir el-Balah (Goldberg et al. 1986; Yellin et al. 1986, 1990). These studies followed an earlier analysis of anthropoid clay coffins (Perlman et al. 1973; Dothan 1973, 1979). At the time that this chemical analysis of ceramics was undertaken, the excavations of the settlement were just beginning and well-stratified material was scarce. The chemical survey was of a preliminary nature, and planning of further work was dependent on the outcome. What this set of analyses revealed was that all the Egyptian-style pottery examined was in fact of local origin. In subsequent seasons, other pottery forms that, from the viewpoints of their workmanship and style, appeared more likely to be of Egyptian origin 1 This work was initially prepared in 1984 as a contribution to the final report of the excavation. Delays in the completion of this volume led to a number of revisions owing to a growing bibliography on the subject. The analytical work reported here was done in the late 1970s and 1980s. Results not available in 1984 are included. The pottery discussion has been slightly updated from the original 1984 report. 2 The Hebrew University of Jerusalem. 3 The Pennsylvania State University, University Park, PA. were excavated. Additional chemical analysis was therefore undertaken and some of these proved to be Egyptian (Yellin et al. 1990). The results of all the analyses are presented below, including a summary of the previous findings. In 1973, Perlman, Asaro and Dothan published their findings from the chemical analysis of 16 anthropoid clay coffin lids from the Deir el-Balah cemetery (Perlman et al. 1973). The problem that they addressed was the provenience of the coffins: were the coffins made in the vicinity of the cemetery or were they imported? Although the coffins are large and brittle and therefore not likely to have been transported over large distances, this question could not be settled except by chemical analysis, particularly as the settlement and possible manufacturing site had not yet been discovered. The question of where the coffins came from was especially intriguihg since the practice of anthropoid coffin burial originated in Egypt and first came into use during the Middle Kingdom (Xllth Dynasty). The coffins at Deir èl-Balah were modeled on New Kingdom Egyptian clay anthropoid coffins found in the Delta, Fayum and Nubia. They are similar to other 13th and early 12th century BCE anthropoid coffins excavated at several additional sites in Canaan that exhibit a clear Egyptian presence such as Tell el-Far4 ah (S) and Tel Beth-Shean (see e.g. Dothan 1979: 99-104). At the time when the study of the coffins was undertaken (Perlman et al. 1973), only the cemetery had been excavated and reference material available for chemical analysis consisted of Canaanite-style pottery of the 1 3th century BCE recovered from the 57</page><page sequence="64">CHAPTER THREE cemetery and tombs. This pottery was presumed to be local and 11 examples of the pottery were sampled. The conclusion reached in the study was that the composition of the Canaanite pottery was statistically indistinguishable from that of the coffin lids; that is, the coffins and pottery shared a common origin. Since no contemporaneous habitation site with evidence of pottery manufacture was known at the time, the possibility that both coffins and pottery were imported could not entirely be ruled out. It was stated, however, that pottery from sites on the coastal plain north of Deir el-Balah (Tell el-'Ajjul, Ashkelon and Ashdod) show similar patterns of composition and, as the geology of the region is uniform, thus it was not possible to pinpoint a specific location for the production of the anthropoid clay coffins and locally produced pottery assemblages. During the subsequent seasons at Deir el-Balah, a potters' workshop including four kilns, rooms for the preparation of clay and other raw materials, and a clay quarry were excavated at the site (see e.g. Killebrew, Vol. I, Chapter 7; Killebrew 1996; Killebrew et al. 2006). Considering the results from the previously published INAA analyses and the second study that is presented here, together with the discovery of a potters' workshop and clay quarry, it can be stated with certainty that the coffins and local ceramics (both Canaanite- and Egyptian-style) from the settlement were produced at Deir el-Balalļ . Although the work on the coffins of the Deir el- Balah cemetery was conducted in Berkeley and the subsequent work in Jerusalem, we were able to make direct comparisons of the analytical results as the two laboratories were intercalibrated and employed the same chemical standards (Yellin et al. 1978). It is for this reason, namely, the availability of reference groups of pottery relevant to the present undertakings and the discovery of a potters' workshop at Deir el-Balah, that this last study could be concluded with relatively few analyses. THE CERAMIC ASSEMBLAGE The first set of analyses focused on undecorated Egyptian-style wares (Goldberg et al. 1986). This distinctive ceramic assemblage comprised approximately 50% of the entire ceramic assemblage (see Gould, Chapter 2, this volume and Killebrew 2004). The shapes selected for sampling included beerbottles, ovoid jars, kraters, a bowl, a goblet, a spinning bowl, a figurine, a biconical jar and a stand. Other artifacts sampled in the pre- 1979 analyses included a clay specimen from a pit, a coffin fragment found in a kiln and a kiln brick to see if these correlate with the pottery. No kiln wasters were found. Table 3.1a summarizes the initial sampling of the pottery analyzed in the first chemical survey of the settlement. The most ubiquitous form found in the Deir el-Balah settlement is the beerbottle. This vessel was found in huge quantities and is the most characteristic vessel found at the Deir el-Balah settlement (Lab Nos. 37, 38 and 39). The beerbottle is a piriform- to oval- shaped handleless bottle with a flat base. It is a crudely made vessel, often with a hole pierced through the base before firing and usually with fingerprints marking the lower side walls. In Canaan beerbottles appear during the Late Bronze II and Iron IA at sites with an Egyptian presence or influence in Canaan and in the Jordan Valley, such as Tel Beth Shean, Tell es- Sa'idiyeh, and Tel Sera' (for bibliography see Killebrew 2004: 331-33; Martin and Barako 2007: 147-49). In Egypt, the beerbottle is a common ceramic form that already appears in Old Kingdom contexts and continues to be well known during the Middle Kingdom and Second Intermediate Period. Beerbottles were especially abundant and widespread during the XVIIIth-XXth Dynasties in Egypt, where they have been discovered in tombs, foundation deposits and settlement sites (see Holthoer 1977: 86-88; Killebrew 2004: 331-33; Gould, Chapter 2, this volume). The function of the beerbottle is a matter of speculation (for a recent discussion of its use in the production of beer see Martin and Barako 2007: 149). The sheer quantity and coarse quality of the beerbottles recovered at the settlement, together with both pétrographie and INAA analyses, conclusively show that these 58</page><page sequence="65">THE ORIGIN OF EGYPTIAN-STYLE CERAMICS FROM DEIR EL-BALAH: CONCLUSIONS FROM NEUTRON ACTIVATION ANALYSIS vessels were locally produced (see Goldberg et al. 1986; Yellin et al. 1986; Killebrew 2004). Ovoid jars comprise a second distinctive Egyptian-style shape in the Deir el-Balah pottery repertoire. The pre-1979 analysis included undecorated ovoid jars (Lab Nos. 35 and 40). This jar is characterized by its elongated ovoid-shaped body profile and is one of the most ubiquitous vessels in the ancient Egyptian repertoire. Its use spans the entire history of ancient Egypt, until its eventual disappearance in the Late Period. Over time, the ovoid jar displays a wide variety of shapes, sizes, decoration and quality. During the Late Bronze Age, the widest part of the vessel is near the base. In Canaan these vessels appear at sites with an Egyptian presence, such as Beth-Shean, Tell el-Far' ah (S) and Tel Mor (Killebrew 2004: 321 ; Martin and Barako 2007: 142; Gould, Chapter 2, this volume). Pottery analyzed in the second set of analyses (from the post- 1979 seasons of excavations in the settlement) is summarized in Table 3.1b. Most of these samples were selected because of their Egyptian-style decorative techniques- white slip and burnished or painted blue bands. Burnished white-slipped pottery from Deir el-Balah appears on handled storage jars and flasks (Fig. 3.1:1-5). Blue painted bands adorn ovoid jars (Figs. 3.1:7, 8, and 10), ajar (Fig. 3.1:9), a funnel-necked jar (Fig. 3.1.6) and several sherds (Fig. 3.1:11 and 12). Several samples of blue painted sherds from Tell el-Amarna (private collection) serve as an Egyptian reference group. At Deir el-Balah burnished white slip appears on two pottery shapes that comprise handled storage jars (Lab Nos. 60 and 61) and white- slipped lentoid flasks (Lab Nos. 62 and 63). Two sherds identified as a stand may be a jar rim (Lab Nos. 64 and 68). The flask is a well-known shape in Canaan, Cyprus and Greece but also appears, often with a white slip, in small quantities in Egypt (see Killebrew, Chapter 4, this volume for a detailed discussion of flasks and Gould, Chapter 2, this volume). The burnished white-slipped storage jar is characterized by its long slender shape, tall neck and white slip. These jars were found in both the cemetery and settlement at Deir el-Balah. It is rare in Canaan but is well known in Egyptian New Kingdom contexts where they have been excavated in both tomb and settlement contexts. Handled vessels in general are rare in Egypt. These jars appear to be an Egyptian imitation and adaptation of the two-handled Canaanite storage jar that was used as a shipping container throughout the Mediterranean during the Late Bronze Age (see Killebrew 2004: 327-28 for comparisons; also Gould, Chapter 2, this volume). Four ovoid jars (Lab Nos. 72, 73, 76 and 77) decorated with the blue bands so typical of pottery produced in Egypt are also included in the second, post- 1979, set of pottery samples. METHOD OF ANALYSIS The method of chemical analysis employed is that of neutron activation. The system of analysis employed is that previously described (Perlman and Asaro 1969; Yellin et al. 1978; Gunneweg et al. 1984; Yellin 1984). The Perlman-Asaro Standard Pottery (Perlman and Asaro 1969) was employed with the values known at the time that the measurements reported here were made.4 We cannot go into the details of the methodology and techniques employed here but will comment in a general way on the nature of the method and how the results of analysis are employed to determine the origin of pottery. INAA The method of chemical analysis is instrumental neutron activation analysis or INAA. This method is often referred to simply as neutron activation analysis or NAA. However, this more general term includes procedures requiring elaborate chemical sample preparations that would make them useless for archaeology. For this reason the qualifier 4 The same values were used for the results reported here as for the results previously reported by Perlman et al. 1973. 59</page><page sequence="66">CHAPTER THREE Table 3.1.

More specifically, it is gamma- ray spectrometry following neutron activation. The salient features of INAA that make it especially useful for ceramic analysis are: 1) sensitivity to a large number of elements with different chemical properties; 2) multi-element capability, meaning that many elements are simultaneously measured; 3) the method is purely instrumental, requiring no chemical treatment of the ceramics; 4) the method is, practically speaking in most instances, nearly non-destructive, as only 0.1 g of material is needed for analysis; 5) the sources of error can be precisely controlled and assessed; 6) high precision and accuracy is attainable for a large number of elements with different chemical behaviorism; and 7) the method lends itself to automation. The importance and power of the analytical techniques of INAA are well documented by many applications in science and technology expressed in hundreds of publications over the last several decades. The application of INAA to archaeology has been made possible on a practical basis since the 1960s as a result of advances in instrumentation, computers and computer techniques in spectroscopy, and automation. A rudimentary start was already made half a century ago (Sayre and Dodson 1957; Emeleus 1958; Kraay 1958) and there is a growing body of literature on the methodology and application of INAA to archaeology (see for example Sayre and Dodson 1957; Sayre 1966; Perlman and Asaro 1969; Yellin 1984; Glascock 1992; Harbottle and Weigand 1992; Neff and Glascock 1995; Glascock 2000; Speakman and Glascock5 2007; Yellin 2007; Yellin and Maeir 2007). Some references relevant to the present study are Artzy et al. 1972; Artzy and Asaro 1977; Kaplan 1978; Perlman and Asaro 1982; Goldberg et al. 1986; Yellin et al. 1986; Yellin et al. 1990). 5 See also other articles following that of Speakman and Glascock. METHOD OF PROVENIENCE DETERMINATION The method employed to determine origin is based on the chemical analysis of potsherds and the relation of the potsherd composition to the compositions of reference groups of pottery. The potsherd is analyzed for 25 chemical elements, most of which serve as diagnostic parameters. The majority of these are trace elements with concentrations in the parts-per-million range (micrograms per gram). The array of element concentrations constitutes a chemical fingerprint. Origin is established when the chemical fingerprint of a potsherd is found to match the composition of a reference group. The reference group is formed by averaging the concentrations (element by element) of many potsherds that analyze similarly and are known to be representative of pottery manufactured at a given place.6 The question of whether a group of pottery is local to a given place can usually be settled by one or more criteria: 1) kiln wasters are found and analyze similarly to the pottery; 2) a clay source is found with a composition that can be related to the pottery; 3) the pottery is coarsely made and is found in large quantities (such pottery is not likely to have been imported); 4) pottery compositions that turn up most frequently and in relatively large numbers in a random sampling of a site are likely to have been made locally if there is evidence of pottery manufacture, or regionally if there is no 6 The INAA results were treated by univariate statistics. As we are dealing with small groups or individual pieces, multivariate statistical methods are not useful. For multivariate statistical analysis to be useful the number of samples must exceed by at least one the number of parameters (elements) that are used in the analysis. An added complication is that we are dealing with group averages that come from a variety of sources and we do not have the individual analyses from which the group averages are calculated. Furthermore, the elements measured in other laboratories do not fully overlap those measured by us. 61</page><page sequence="68">CHAPTER THREE Fig. 3.1 .

If there is no direct evidence for pottery manufacture, i.e., kilns are not found, then origin is assigned to a region rather than a specific location. Sometimes it is not possible to state with certainty that a given group of pottery is local, but in such a case one may still be able to make a statement that a given pot shares a common origin with a given group of pottery. That is, relative origin is in any case established, but the question of absolute origin must be deferred until further evidence is at hand, namely, when appropriate reference groups are available. The chemical group representing the pottery group is characterized by a mean value and a measure of dispersion (M and a in the tables). The dispersion must reflect the actual variation in composition and not the apparent variation due to errors of measurement. The measuring process employed must be capable of great precision so that the random errors of measurement will not dominate the dispersion. The graphic figures below are intended to help interpret the data but are no substitute for the numerical data that are given in the tables.

Six of the specimens analyzed form a chemical group that is shown in Column 2 of Table 3.2. The group is compared with reference groups previously reported (Perlman et al. 1973). Column 3 is a closely matching group of Canaanite-style pottery recovered from the cemetery at Deir el-Balah and Column 4 is a closely matching group of clay anthropoid coffins from the cemetery. The composition of the last group of ten coffin lids, Column 5, is a variant of the composition of the five coffin lids shown in Column 4 and has been shown to be related to the composition of the five coffin lids by a dilution factor. That is to say, the groups differ in the amount of some major constituents, such as quartz and calcite, as a consequence of which the amount of clay per unit weight of pottery is different in the two groups; hence the element concentrations in the two groups differ by a constant factor. The same variation in composition due to dilution previously reported (Perlman et al. 1973) is also observed in the current study. The last column (6) of Table 3.2 is the composition of a clay coffin fragment (Lab No. 56) recovered from a kiln discovered in 1979. The composition matches the group of ten coffin lids and, when corrected for dilution, the other groups. Table 3.2 and succeeding tables shows only those element concentrations that are common to all the pottery compositions under discussion. We shall use the group of six pots from the settlement as representative of pottery local to Deir el-Balah and refer to this group simply as Local. Fig. 3.2 summarizes this and shows the close relationship between Local and other pottery compositions previously reported for Deir el-Balah. In particular we note that Local is indistinguishable from the group of pottery from the cemetery reported by Perlman et al. 1973. During the 1979 field season a lump of clay was recovered from a probe into a crater fill. The chemical fingerprint of the specimen, Lab No. 54, is shown in Table 3.3 along with the analysis of the clay coffin recovered from the kiln (Lab No. 56). Also shown are the chemical profiles of a beerbottle (Lab No. 40), which is not included in 64</page><page sequence="71">THE ORIGIN OF EGYPTIAN-STYLE CERAMICS FROM DEIR EL-BALAH: CONCLUSIONS FROM NEUTRON ACTIVATION ANALYSIS Fig. 3.2. Data given in Table 3.2. the group of Table 3 .2 (it is a dilutant of the group), a bowl (Lab No. 48), the zoomorphic figurine (Lab No. 49) and an ovoid jar (Lab No. 36). Finally, the composition of the spinning bowl (Lab No. 52) is given in the last column. These specimens exhibit similar compositions. The remaining beerbottle (Lab No. 38) and the miscellaneous potsherds also show a similar composition. The kiln brick (Lab No. 55, not shown) has a distinctively different composition. Most of the element concentrations are lower by a factor of 2 than the corresponding concentrations of the group in Table 3.2. A few elements do not show this relationship, so that we do not have a simple dilution effect of the kiln clay. A plausible explanation, particularly as kiln clay is not likely to have been transported over great distances, is that the kiln is made of the same clay source as the pottery but that a dilutant carried some trace impurities. For brevity's sake, the measuring errors of the pottery compositions in Table 3.3 are not shown; these errors are much smaller than the group dispersions (a) shown in Table 3.2. Fig. 3.3 summarizes the results shown in Table 3.3. In Table 3.4, Columns 2 and 3 give the compositions of the coffin from the kiln (Lab No. 56) and zoomorphic figurine (Lab No. 49) respectively. In Columns 4 and 5 respectively, we show the deviations for the coffin found in the kiln and the zoomorphic figurine from the Local composition given in Table 3.2. For each element the deviation is the number of standard deviations by which the coffin or figurine differs from Local. These differences should be on the order of 1 if the composition match, and this is clearly the case for the coffin. It is less so for the zoomorphic figurine, which shows significant deviations for Lu, Co, Ce and Cr, but the composition of the figurine is within the range of compositions observed in coastal pottery shown in Table 3.5 and Fig. 3.5. We show only those elements which are measured with good precision. In view of the above and the results of the pre- 1979 set of samples shown in Tables 3.2-3.5 and the corresponding Figs. 3.2-3.5 we may draw the following conclusions. 1) The beerbottles, and all the Egyptian-style pottery analyzed in the initial survey of pottery from the settlement, have a common clay source that is in the vicinity of Deir el-Balah. 2) All pottery analyzed comes from the same clay source. 3) The anthropoid clay coffins and associated Canaanite pottery from the cemetery previously shown to have a composition representative of the coastal plain of Israel share a common clay source with pottery from the settlement. 4) The chemical and archaeological as well as pétrographie evidence (Goldberg et al. 1986) point strongly to the vicinity of Deir el-Balah as the location of the clay source. It is instructive to examine the composition of the Deir el-Balah chemical group in light of chemical groups from other coastal sites north of the settlement as well as Egyptian pottery from the Nile.

This group was reported by Artzy and Asaro (1977) in connection with their study of Tell el-Yehudiyeh ware from Cyprus. Another group of Egyptian ceramics from Tell ed-Daba exhibiting a closely related composition was reported in the same study. In her study on the distribution of Tell el- Yehudiyeh ware, Kaplan (1978) reported "Nile Mud" compositions. These were analyzed at Brookhaven National Laboratory and have been shown by Harbottle (1982) to correlate reasonably well with Nile Mud compositions reported from Berkeley. The Nile Mud compositions reported by Kaplan are from different sites than those reported by Artzy and Asaro. The Deir el-Balah group shown in Column 3 is greatly different in composition from the Nile Mud shown in Column 2 as evidenced by the values for the elements Fe, Cr, Sc, Co, Cs and Ti. Even though the variability of Nile Mud has not been extensively explored, it can be fairly certainly ruled out as the source of Fig. 3.3.

Data given in Table 3.4 (expanded view of Fig. 3.4). the Deir el-Balah ceramics, even in the absence of other evidence. To the right of the Deir el- Balah group, in Columns 4-6, are compositions of three pottery groups from sites north of Deir el-Balah. Each of the groups is judged to be local on both stylistic grounds and chemical similarity to pottery from other coastal sites in addition to those shown here. The group from Tell el-' Ajjul consists of plain ware of Middle/Late Bronze Age style reported by Artzy, Asaro and Perlman in their study of the Palestinian bichrome ware (Artzy et al. 1972). The Ashkelon group is reported in the same study. The Tel Ashdod group from Strata 10 and 11 was reported by Perlman and Asaro and judged on stylistic and chemical evidence to be local (Perlman and Asaro 1982: 70-90). The coastal groups are quite similar in composition and it would be reasonable for the purpose of regional provenience to average these to obtain a regional fingerprint for coastal pottery. Such a group is easily distinguished from Nile Mud. Indeed, it is hardly possible to discriminate between the coastal sites on the basis of the data presented in Table 3.5 alone. Fig. 3.5 compares the composition of the Nile Mud with the coastal compositions. With the discovery at Deir el-Balah of the potters' workshop, which included kilns and a room where clay was in the process of levigation, we can conclude with certainty that most, if not all, of these vessels were produced at the site. However it cannot be ruled out conclusively that some of the vessels originated from other potters' workshops located in the southern coastal plain. RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS FROM THE POST-1979 POTTERY ANALYSES The pottery samples analyzed most recently are listed in Table 3.1b. This complement of 18 specimens was selected from among finds from the post- 1979 excavations. Owing to the fact that much time had elapsed between the earlier and later batches of samples shown in Table 3.1 and that during this time instrumental changes had occurred, various tests were conducted to ascertain that the analytical results could be merged. The tests included reanalysis of potsherds previously analyzed. This is a common situation that occurs when projects extend over a long period of time during which instruments are upgraded or experimental procedures are modified (see for 68</page><page sequence="75">THE ORIGIN OF EGYPTIAN-STYLE CERAMICS FROM DEIR EL-BALAH: CONCLUSIONS FROM NEUTRON ACTIVATION ANALYSIS Table 3.5.

In Column 3 we give the composition of the local Canaanite group of six pieces of pottery and in Column 4 that of a white-slipped burnished piece from Deir el-Balah, Lab No. 63. Column 5 gives the deviation of the white-slipped burnished ware from the TEA group and Column 5 gives the deviations of the same white-slipped piece from the Local group. The white-slipped piece is a good match for the TEA group and no match for the local Canaanite group. These results apply as well to the other white slipped vessels shown in Table 3.1 . The results given in Table 3.6 are summarized in Figs. 3.6 and 3.6a. We stress the fact, however, that it should not be concluded that the white-slipped piece has its origin in TEA on the basis of the evidence presented. Since the TEA group is undocumented and consists of surface finds, the chemical composition of this group should best be taken as representative of the region of Tell el-Amarna. We are able to compare the composition of Lab No. 63, the white-slipped burnished piece, with Nile Mud composition reported by Artzy and Asaro (1977) and this is done in Table 3.7 and Figs. 3.7 and 3.7a. The composition of the white- slipped burnished piece is seen to be significantly different from the Nile Mud. For seven of the 12 elements shown (Co, Cr, Fe, Hf, La, Na and Sc), the difference between the Nile Mud composition and Lab No. 63 composition exceeds 2 standard deviations. Such differences for so many of the elements are extremely unlikely to be due to chance. Several Egyptian-style vessels with painted blue bands found at Deir el-Balah (Lab Nos. 70, 72, 73, Table 3.6.

The composition of these vessels is similar to the local composition but with some variation. CONCLUSIONS As described above, most of the Egyptian-style sherds excavated at Deir el-Balah were locally produced. This includes the vessels decorated with blue bands, an Egyptian technique that is sometimes referred to as "Amarna Blue." Exceptions are handled storage jars and flasks with a burnished white slip, which as indicated by INAA analyses originated in Egypt. Thus we can conclude that most of the Egyptian-style pottery recovered from the Deir el-Balah excavations was manufactured at the site or in the vicinity. These conclusions are corroborated by the discovery of a Late Bronze II potters' workshop, complete with clay in the process of levigation, pigments used to decorate pottery and four contemporary kilns. Considered in its broader context, the results of this study lend support to the view of a strong XlXth and XXth Dynasty Egyptian presence at Deir el-Balah and several other sites in Canaan such as Tell el-Far'ah (S) and Tel Beth Shean. Egyptian occupation of these sites is characterized by the appearance of noteworthy quantities of locally produced Egyptian-style material culture. Thus one can speak of a clearly targeted and organized Egyptian administrative and military presence at specific sites during the 13th and early 12th centuries BCE. Both the distinctly Egyptian shape of these locally produced ceramics and the Egyptian-style technology used to produce them suggest that Egyptian potters accompanied military personnel and envoys sent to administer Canaan during the Late Bronze IIB and early Iron I (see e.g. Killebrew 2004; 2005: 51-92 and Killebrew et al. 2006 for more detailed discussion).

Killebrew Canaanite pottery is defined as those utilitarian vessels that commonly appear in Late Bronze Age Canaan, in the southern Levant or within the boundaries of modern-day Israel, Lebanon and Jordan. They include bowls, kraters, cooking pots, chalices, jugs, juglets, flasks, jars, storage jars and lamps. These vessels, like utilitarian Egyptian pottery, reflect the homogeneity and chronological continuity of the material culture of ancient Canaan. A characteristic feature of functional vessels is their resistance to innovation or change; this is especially apparent in cooking and storage vessels (Nicklin 1971-72: 20-21; Reina and Hill 1978: 238-43; Rye 1981: 27; Bankes 1985, who outline several reasons for resistance to change). Decorated or non- utilitarian pottery, which during this period consists largely of imported Mycenaean and Cypriot vessels, is more susceptible to change. This situation contrasts with the following archaeological period, the Iron Age, which is characterized by regionally diverse repertoires which may correspond to ethnic or social groups (see London 1989 and Killebrew 2005 for a summary of this problem). This chapter was originally submitted for publication in 1987 and updated in 1993. Since then, detailed and updated discussions of the Deir el-Balah Late Bronze pottery repertoire have appeared (see e.g. Killebrew 1999a: 81-140; 1999b; 2004; 2005: 1 10-36; 2007; Killebrew et al. 2006: 110-15). This chapter has been moderately updated to include the main observations of these subsequent publications. For a more detailed description of this pottery assemblage, the reader is referred to these later treatments. Due to the continuity observable in the Canaanite repertoire, the pottery will be presented typologically; when relevant, the typological development of a class of pottery will be referred to in the discussion.** Provenience analyses and ware descriptions of this assemblage are discussed in Chapter 3 (see also Goldberg et al. 1986; Killebrew et al. 2006). Comparable Late Bronze Age material will focus on the sites that are most relevant to Deir el-Balah (Lachish, Gezer, Tell el-Far'ah [S], and Beth-Shean) for which well- dated and stratified material has been published. Other contemporary sites (e.g. Megiddo and Hazor) are referred to for comparable material. It should be noted that the Deir el-Balah pottery repertoire presented here is typical of Canaanite- style pottery assemblages of the 13th and early 12th centuries BCE manufactured in the southern Levant. Ceramic types are arranged in general in the following order: open unrestricted vessels (kraters and cooking pots); closed restricted vessels from small to large (juglets, jugs, flasks and jars); and lastly miscellaneous shapes (lamps, cups-and- saucers, mugs and local imitations of imported vessels). This typological discussion begins with kraters, since all the bowls found at Deir el- Balah have been discussed above in the chapter on Egyptian-style pottery (Chapter 2), though it should be stressed that most of these bowl types are It should be noted that the author of this chapter does not agree with the stratigraphie interpretation presented in this final report; see e.g. Killebrew et al. 2006 for an alternative interpretation. 75</page><page sequence="82">CHAPTER FOUR common at Late Bronze Age IIB sites throughout Canaan. All the kraters are discussed in the present chapter; however, it should be noted that they display some Egyptianizing features, such as rope pattern designs on the bodies of the vessels. I. KRATERS (Figs. 4.1, 4.2:1-7; Photos 4.1-45) Two different types of vessels are referred to as kraters in the archaeological literature. The more common type at Deir el-Balah is a slightly restricted vessel, termed here a krater bowl (Type A), in which the widest part of the vessel is the top third of the krater. This vessel is sometimes referred to as a bowl in published reports (e.g.Tufnell et al. 1940: Pis. XXXIX:63, 70, XLII: 148-49; Loud 1948: Pis. 45:24, 46: 1-2, 61:23). This vessel often has two handles that are attached from the rim to the shoulder, above the widest part of the vessel. The krater bowl is usually undecorated. Fig. 4.1. Kraters. No. Type Reg.

Kraters and cooking pots. 79</page><page sequence="86">CHAPTER FOUR A second type of vessel, referred to here as a krater jar (Type B), has a more restricted and longer neck or opening, often with a well- defined carination. The widest part of the vessel is approximately halfway down the body. The handles are attached either from the rim to the shoulder or on the shoulder, above the widest part of the krater. The published examples are often decorated (e.g. Tufnell et al. 1940: Pl. XLVIII). In contrast to the bowl or jar, the krater was probably used in preparing, mixing or serving multiple portions of food. The two basic krater forms were probably used for different activities connected with food preparation. None of the kraters from Deir el-Balah is decorated with painted motifs, though several have a rope pattern design across the widest section of the krater; the latter surface feature may be decorative or technological. Most of the kraters from Deir el-Balah belong to Type A , the krater bowl , and only one partial vessel of Type B , the krater jar, is presented. Type A krater bowls are subdivided into three major groups based on vessel and rim profile. Krater Bowl Type A:1 (Fig. 4.1:1-3) Type A: 1 is characterized by a rounded to slightly carinated body with a neckless, incurved and thickened rim. At Deir el-Balah Krater Type A:1 appears with or without handles, although at most sites this krater is usually handleless. A similarly shaped krater appears at Hazor in Area C, Stratum 1A (Late Bronze Age IIB) (Yadin et al. 1960: Pl. CXXIV:9). Handleless versions of this krater bowl type appear at Tel Aphek in the 1 3th century BCE Egyptian residency (Beck and Kochavi 1985: Fig. 4.3:6), at Beth Shemesh in the Late Bronze Age II (Grant and Wright 1938: PI. LVI:11, Room 530), and at Megiddo, Strata VIIA-VI (Loud 1948: Bowl Type 317: Pis. 69: 12, 84:22) and Tomb 1090 (Guy 1938: PI. 73:1), dated to the Early Iron Age. Krater Bowl Type A:2 (Fig. 4.1:4-6; Photos 4.1-42) Type A:2 has a rounded to carinated body with a short, vertical rim that is folded outward. The two handles are attached at the rim and shoulder. This krater too rarely occurs with handles at Late Bronze Age sites. Two examples were recovered from Hazor, Area G, Strata 1 A-1B (Yadin et al. 1958: Pis. LXXXIX:2, XC:8) and Field INE at Tel Miqne- Ekron, Phase 10 (Killebrew 1996: PI. 8:7). Similar, handleless kraters are more common, for example, at Megiddo in Strata VIII-VIA (Loud 1948: Bowl Type 276: Pis. 61:23, 66:1, 69:11, 78:14, 84:20) and the Early Iron Age I Tomb 221B (Guy 1938: PI. 71:8-14) and at Beth-Shean in Levels VII-VI (Yadin and Geva 1986: 56, Fig. 23:3-5; James and McGovern 1993: 43:4).

Krater Bowl Type A:3 (Fig. 4.1:7-10; Photos 43-4.4) Type A: 3 is a deep bowl with a high carinated body and simple everted rim. This is the most prevalent krater bowl type at Late Bronze Age sites . The carinated krater bowl has a long history, first appearing in the Middle Bronze Age II (see e.g. at Gezer: Yadin et al. 1958: Pl. CXV:5; Megiddo: Loud 1948: Bowl Type 234: PI. 45:24) and continuing, though in small numbers, into the Late Bronze Age I and IIA (Hazor: Yadin et al. 1958: Pl. CXXXVII:3-4; Gezer: Dever 1986: Pl. 9:6; Tel Miqne-Ekron: Killebrew 1996: Pl. 4:12-13). However, krater bowl Type A: 3 appears to reach its peak in popularity during the Late Bronze Age IIB and early Iron Age I (e.g. Gezer: Dever 1986: 56- 58, Pl. 14:15; Megiddo: Guy 1938: PI. 69:6). The Late Bronze Age IIB krater bowls tend to be less restricted, deeper vessels with a higher carination than the earlier Middle Bronze Age II-Late Bronze Age IIA examples. Miscellaneous Small Krater Bowls Type A:4 (Fig. 4.2:1-6) These partially complete vessels represent various bowl profiles not classified in the major krater bowl types. Due to their slightly restricted profiles, they have been classified as "small krater bowls." Krater Jar Type B (Fig. 4.2:7; Photo 4.5) Krater jar Type B is an unusual example of a restricted vessel with two handles placed on the shoulders above the widest section of the jar. It has an unusual shape and has been classified as generally relating to the second class of more restricted kraters, Type A: 3, described above. No exact parallels to this vessel are published. Summary Krater bowl Type A is a relatively common vessel type throughout Canaan. All subtypes are ubiquitous during the 13th and 12th centuries BCE (especially the handleless versions). Krater bowl Type A: 3 develops out of the large carinated krater Photo 4.5. Krater jar (Fig. 4.2:7). 81</page><page sequence="88">CHAPTER FOUR bowl of the Middle Bronze Age II, but appears most frequently during the Late Bronze Age IIB and Early Iron Age I. A noteworthy feature at Deir el-Balah is the scarcity of the decorated kraters with a low carination that are so typical at sites such as Lachish, Megiddo and Hazor. II. COOKING POTS (Figs. 4.2:8-17, 43; Photo 4.6) Cooking pots are usually one of the most easily identified groups in any ceramic assemblage, due to the physical properties of the wares used to make such vessels. Fabric is particularly important for cooking pots, since resistance to thermal stress is the primary requirement for this type of vessel (Rye 1976: 119). Inclusions which are especially suitable for vessels which undergo thermal stress are grog (crushed sherds), calcite, crushed burned shell, zircon, rutile, feldspar, augite and hornblende (Rye 1976: 116-17; Rice 1987: 229-40). Cooking pots recovered from Deir el-Balah belong to the Canaanite pottery tradition. In contrast to the Egyptian-style assemblage, in which it is not clear what types of ceramic vessels were used for cooking, the Late Bronze Age cooking pot is a distinct and well-known type, evolving from the Middle Bronze Age cooking pot. Typologically, Late Bronze Age handleless cooking pots continue the general shape and everted rim profile of the Middle Bronze Age IIB-C restricted cooking pots, except that the vessel proportions vary and the shape becomes increasingly more carinated. During the Late Bronze Age II the most common form has a folded-over everted rim with a triangular flange (for a detailed description see Killebrew 1999b: 84-93). Fig. 4.3. Cooking pots.

Cooking pots. 83</page><page sequence="90">CHAPTER FOUR The cooking pots have been divided into five types (A-E) based on rim profile, rim stance and general shape. At Deir el-Balah, most of the cooking pots belong to the typical everted and flanged rim type. Two noteworthy exceptions to the everted Late Bronze Age II type are cooking pots Types A and E. Cooking Pot Type A (Fig. 4.2:8) Type A has a flaring and rounded rim. The body is deep, with a rounded profile. The single example at Deir el-Balah has a groove on the inner face of the rim that may be for a lid. Type A is reminiscent of earlier Middle Bronze Age II-Late Bronze Age I cooking pots (see e.g. Tufnell et al. 1940: Pl. LVB:358: Fosse Temple I; Yadin et al. 1958: 129, Pis. CXVI: esp. 3, 6-7,9; CXXXIX:10; Dever 1986: Pl. 13:10). Cooking Pot Type B (Fig. 4.2:9-17) Type B is the classic Late Bronze Age II cooking pot with an everted rim and pronounced triangular- profiled flange. The triangular flange can be pointed or trimmed flat, short or long. There is a great variety of rim profiles. Type B tends to be slightly restricted, with the rim diameter being narrower than the maximum width of the vessel. The body often has a more pronounced carination and a deeper body than cooking pot Type C. Numerous complete examples of Type B cooking pots are known from all of the Late Bronze Age II strata at Hazor (Yadin et al. 1 958: 1 20, Pis. LXXXV:23 , CVII: 1-7 , CXXVII: 1-9, CXXX:5-6, CXLV:6-9) and from the soundings at Khirbet Rabud (Kochavi 1974: Fig. 4:6-7, 9). It appears in Fosse Temples II and III at Lachish (Tufnell et al. 1940: Pl. LVIB:368, 370, 371) and in 13th century contexts at Gezer (e.g. Dever et al. 1974: Pis. 23:7, 25:5). Type B is the most popular cooking pot at Tel Miqne-Ekron, spanning the 15th- 13th centuries BCE in Field INE (Killebrew 1996: Pis. 6:6-9, 8:4; 1999b: 84-85). Cooking Pot Type C (Fig. 43:1-5) Type C is defined by its everted to flaring rim with a much less pronounced triangular-profiled flange. The folded-over rim has been pressed down against the exterior body of the vessel, creating a more flattened triangular profile. The rim diameter is usually the widest part of the vessel and the body tends to be shallower than Type B . The folded-over rim may be short or long. A complete example, similar to Fig. 4.3: 1 , appears in Stratum XIV (late 13th century BCE) of Area G at Ashdod (Dothan and Porath 1993: Fig. 12:10; see also Fig. 9:15: Stratum XVI). Type C cooking pots were also found at Gezer in the late 13th-early 12th centuries BCE (Dever 1986: Pl. 33:2) and Khirbet Rabud (Kochavi 1974: Figs. 4:13, 5:6). A few examples of cooking pot Type C were recovered from Tel Miqne-Ekron, dating to the 14th- 13th centuries BCE (Killebrew 1996: pl. 4; 1999b: 85-90). Cooking Pot Type D (Fig. 43:6-7) Type D is defined by its nearly upright rim stance. The rim is still folded over and retains a slightly triangular profile. The rim diameter is more restricted than Type C, and in the Deir el-Balah examples the carination of the body is more pronounced. A similar cooking pot was recovered from the Late Bronze Age II Stratum XVI in Area G at Ashdod (Dothan and Porath 1993: Fig. 9: 1 1) and from Fosse Temples II and III at Lachish (Tufnell et al. 1940: 369). Cooking Pot Type E (Fig. 43:8-9; Photo 4.6) Type E has a vertical rim stance. The inside of the rim is slightly concave (Fig. 4.3:8) and the rim is folded over on the outside of the vessel. In both examples from Deir el-Balah, the bottom of the folded-over lip is turned up, forming a low ridge on the outer part Photo 4.6. Cooking pot rims, Type E. 84</page><page sequence="91">CANAANITE POTTERY of the rim. Fig. 4.3:9 is noteworthy because of the vertical handles attached below the rim. The shape and rim profile are typical of Iron Age I cooking pots (see e.g. at Gezer: Dever 1986: Pl. 39:7). Summary The majority of the cooking pots at Deir el-Balah belong to Types B and C, the most common forms of the Late Bronze Age II; Type B is the dominant cooking pot at most sites. Though several scholars have attempted to trace a chronological development for cooking pot rim profiles (see e.g. Amiran 1969: 1 35 - 40; Wood 1985: 388-96), there is no clear stratigraphie evidence in published reports for a development of cooking pots during the Late Bronze Age II (see Killebrew 1999b). Statistical analysis of Late Bronze Age II cooking pots at Tel Miqne-Ekron has not indicated any discernible evolution of this form until the Iron Age I. At Deir el-Balah, Types B and C appear together with a great variety of rim profiles. I would suggest here that we are dealing with typological variations due to individual potters or different workshops. Type A, clearly the earliest cooking pot profile, retains features of Middle Bronze Age II-Late Bronze Age I cooking pots. Type D is closely related to later Iron Age I cooking pots and may foreshadow the appearance of the classic Iron Age I cooking pot, represented here by our Type E. III. JUGLETS (Fig. 4.4:1-8; Photo 4.7) The dipper juglets (Fig. 4.4: 1-8) from Deir el-Balah all belong to the same general type, an ovoid to piriform juglet with a pointed base and handle rising slightly above the rim. Late Bronze Age dipper juglets continue the Middle Bronze Age tradition of dipper juglets; however, the earlier elongated and elliptical juglets are larger and better made than their Late Bronze Age descendants (see e.g. Tufnell 1958: 192-93). The Deir el-Balah juglets are similar in shape to White Shaved Cypriot juglets, though there is some debate whether these are actual imitations of the Cypriot vessel. Amiran (1969: 146) states that these juglets imitate Cypriot knife-pared juglets which are themselves imitations Photo 4.7. Juglets. of the Canaanite dipper juglet, while Tufnell (1958: 194) states that these juglets are local products of the time rather than deliberate imitations (cf. Balensi 1980: 353). Each of the Deir el-Balah juglets differs slightly in shape, size and proportions. The opening of the vessel varies from oval (Fig. 4.4:2, 6-7) to circular (Fig. 4.4:3) to trefoil (Fig. 4.4:8) in shape. There does not appear to be any typological or chronological significance to these minor variations (see however Wood 1985: 412, who claims that the trefoil mouth is heavily pinched in the 14th-mid- 13th centuries BCE but disappears by the end of the Late Bronze Age II). Similar dipper juglets are known throughout Canaan during the Late Bronze Age II (see e.g. Hazor: Yadin et al. 1958: 120, Pis. CVIII: 10-11, CXXXIV:2-3; Yadin et al. 1961: P1.CCLXXXL4-8; Yadin et al. 1989: 270; Megiddo: Loud 1948: Pl. 58:10; Tell Abu Hawam: Balensi 1980: 353, Pl. 14:4-6; Lachish: Tufnell 1958: 194, Class B juglets: Pl. 78: Types 784-86). Several nearly identical dipper juglets were recovered from coffin burials in the Deir el-Balah cemetery, where they were dated to the 13th century BCE (T. Dothan 1979: 13). Tufnell (1958: 194) dates this type to the mid- 14th century through 13th centuries BCE, with the majority appearing in the 13th century. 85</page><page sequence="92">CHAPTER FOUR IV. JUGS (Fig. 4.4:9-11; Photo 4.8) Jugs seldom appear in the excavated assemblage at Deir el-Balah. This may be explained by the functional replacement of this Canaanite form by Egyptian forms such as the ovoid, globular, necked and funnel-necked jars, which are common in the Deir el-Balah ceramic repertoire. The three jugs shown in Fig. 4.4:9-1 1 are globular (Fig. 4.4: 10- 1 1) to slightly piriform (Fig. 4.4:9) in shape, each with a handle that extends from the top of the rim to the shoulder. The base is flat (Fig. 4.4:9), slightly convex (Fig. 4.4: 10) or a thickened button base (Fig. 4.4: 1 1), the latter similar to storage jar bases. Rounded bases, which are common during the Late Bronze Age II at other sites (e.g. Hazor; see below), do not appear at Deir el-Balah. Two of the jugs (Fig. 4.4:9-10) have a stepped rim and one jug (Fig. 4.4:11) has a simple, slightly Photo 4.8. Jug (Fig. 4.4:9). Fig. 4.4. Juglets and jugs. No. Type Reg.

These three jugs are typical of the Late Bronze Age II, with their piriform to globular bodies, trefoil mouth openings, handles attached from rim to shoulder and flat or button bases. This shape is a development of the Middle Bronze Age II piriform to ovoid jugs with handles attached either on the shoulder or from the neck to the shoulder (see e.g. Hazor: Yadin et al. 1960: Pis. CXII: 1-2, CXII:6-9, CXX: 12-14). During the latter part of the Late Bronze Age II, these jugs are more globular in shape, with the handle extending from the rim, or just below the rim, to the shoulder. Jugs with the handle attached directly to the rim are rare before the Late Bronze Age II (see e.g. Lachish: Tufnell 1958: 188, PI. 76:713; Hazor: Yadin et al. 1960: Pis. CXXXII: 1-14, CXXXIII: 1-10, CXXXIX: 14). A button base similar to the Deir el-Balah example in Fig. 4.4: 1 1 appears at Megiddo in Stratum VIII (Loud 1948: PI. 59:4). Asimple trefoil-rimmed jug with a globular body, also similar to the jug in Fig. 4.4: 1 1 , is dated to the late 13th century BCE at Tel Miqne-Ekron (Killebrew 1996: PI. 6:10). Slightly stepped rims, similar to the Deir el-Balah jugs in Fig. 4.4:9-10, were excavated at Ashdod, dating from the Late Bronze Age IIB and Iron Age I (M. Dothan 1971 : Figs. 8 1 : 1 1 , 82:8). Noteworthy is the almost complete absence of the biconical jug (see below), which is typically found at Late Bronze Age II sites in Canaan. V. STORAGE JARS (Figs. 4.5-4.7; Photo 4.9) Late Bronze Age storage jars developed from the Middle Bronze Age II ovoid two-handled storage container. Two major types of storage jars were excavated at Deir el-Balah: the piriform Canaanite jar (Type A) and the ovoid domestic jar (Type B). The former appears in far greater numbers at Deir el-Balah. Type A, usually referred to in the literature as the "Canaanite" or commercial jar, is piriform in shape with broad rounded to angular shoulders, tapering to a narrow button base (see Grace 1956; Amiran 1969: 140-42; Parr 1973; Zemer 1977: 4-7; Raban 1980: 5*; Bourriau 1990). These storage jars appear throughout Canaan and the Eastern Mediterranean, including Egypt (Bourriau 1990) and the Aegean (Grace 1956; Raban 1980: 5*-6*), reflecting the international trade relations of the 14th and 13th centuries BCE. The shape of the Late Bronze Age Canaanite jar was well-suited to maritime commercial trade (Raban 1980: 5*). The Type A assemblage at Deir el-Balah is divided into three subtypes based on general shape and number of handles. A more detailed discussion of the rims and bases follows the general description (see Tufnell 1958: 224 for a discussion of the Canaanite jar, classified there as Class D; see also Grace 1956; Raban 1980: 5*-7* and Killebrew 2007 for typological discussions of the commercial jar).

However, judging from the published examples , Type A: 1 is rare at northern inland sites such as Hazor (Yadin et al. 1960: Pl. CXXI:1). Type A:1 appears in Egypt and Nubia (e.g. Tell el- Amarna: Peet and Woolley 1913: PI. LII: Type XLIII/67; Rose 1987a: 125-26, Fig. 9.7: Group 20; Rose 1987b: 133, Fig. 10.5: Group 20; Serpico 1999: 270-71, Fig. 3), mainland Greece and Cyprus (see Raban 1980: 5*, where he refers to it as Type II, "biconical storage jar," and Cline 1994: 168 [Nos. 294-295], 169 [No. 296, 297, 301], 170 [No. 309] for summaries of the parallels from Greece). Type A:1 also appears at Kommos in Crete (Watrous 1992: 160, Fig. 72, Reg. No. 1951, "southern fabric"). Neutron Activation and pétrographie analyses indicates no one regional provenience in Canaan; these jars were produced along the coast from the southern coastal plain to Byblos (Raban 1980: 5*; Sugerman 2000; and Killebrew 2007: 171-83 for a description of the Deir el-Balah Canaanite jar wares).

Storage Jar Type A:2 (Fig. 4.6:1) Type A: 2 is a four-handled container, similar in shape to Type A: 1 except for the additional two handles. This type of storage jar is especially characteristic of the early 12th century BCE but already appears during the late 13th century BCE, mainly in the southern region of Canaan (Beck and Kochavi 1985: 34, where it is noted that our Type A:2 is attributed to Level VI at Lachish; Wood 1985: 402^-07 for a summary of the published and unpublished evidence). Four-handled storage jars are known from the cemetery at Deir el-Balah (T. Dothan 1979: Ills. 22, 8 1,89, 124, 130: Tombs 114, 1 16 and 118), Lachish (Tufnell 1958: PI. 87: 1020; Aharoni 1975: PI. 40:12: Level VI), Gezer (Dever 1986: Pis. 26:3, 27:1-2, 28:1-2, 30:3), Tell el- Far' ah (S) (e.g. Petrie 1930: Pl. XIX: Tomb 552, No. 43 P5; Starkey and Harding 1932: PI. LXXXVI :43 P6), 'Izbet Sartah (Finkelstein 1986: 76-77, Type 20, Fig. 7:20) and in the early Iron Age I levels at Ashdod (M. Dothan 1971: Pis. 82:9, 83:1-3) and Tell 'Aitun (Edelstein and Glass 1973: Fig. 1; Edelstein and Aurant 1992: Fig. 10:1). Storage Jar Type A:3 (Fig. 4.6:2) Type A:3 is a two-handled, tapered storage jar with a carinated or angular shoulder. The tops of the two vertical handles are attached to the widest part of the jar, at the carination. This jar has been referred to by Raban (1980: 6*) as the commercial jar par excellence, and is the commercial jar most commonly found in the eastern Mediterranean region (Egypt: Peet and Woolley 1913: PI. LII: Type XLIII/260; Grace 1956; Rose 1984: 135, 137, Group 20; Bourriau 1990; Smith et al. 2000: Fig. 1; Serpico et al. 2003: Fig. 1; Ugarit: Schaeffer 1949: Pl. XXXI: 1 ; Cyprus, Cilicia and Greece: Raban 1980: 6* where he refers to it as Type III, "angular storage jar"; Cline 1994: 169 [Nos. 298-300], 170 [Nos. 303-306], 172 [No. 323] for examples from Greece; Crete: Watrous 1992: 161, Fig. 71, Reg. No. 946, "northern fabric"; see also the Ulu Burun shipwreck: Bass 1986: 277-79, where large numbers of these storage jars and their contents were recovered). Neutron Activation and pétrographie analyses indicate that these jars were made at numerous production centers, mainly along the northern Levantine coast between Cilicia and the Akko Plain (Raban 1980: 6*; Smith et al. 2000; Serpico et al. 2003; Smith et al. 2004; Killebrew 2007: 173-83). Type A:3 is found at most Late Bronze Age II sites from the 14th-early 12th centuries BCE, particularly at settlements close to the coast (e.g. the Deir el-Balah cemetery: T. Dothan 1979: 11, Ills. 17, 18; Lachish: Tufnell 1958: PI. 87:1019; Palmahim: Singer-Avitz and Levi 1992: Fig. 4:1-2; Tell Abu Hawam: Anati 1959: Fig. 7: 1-2; Beth-Shean: Oren 94</page><page sequence="101">CANAANITE POTTERY 1973: Fig. 50: 1 1 ; Megiddo: Loud 1948: Pis. 59: 1 1 , 64: 1 ) . It is rare at northern inland sites such as Hazor (Yadin et al. 1960: Pl. CXXI:3). Storage Jar Type B (Fig. 4.6:3-4) Type B is more squat, with a broad ovoid to slightly piriform body. The two handles are attached to the widest section of the jar, either at the belly or shoulders of the vessel. The base is flattened and wider than the thickened button base of Type A. This jar, often referred to as the "domestic" storage jar, is usually decorated. This type is rare at Deir el-Balah and appears much more frequently at northern sites during the Late Bronze Age II (see e.g. Megiddo: Loud 1948: Pis. 60:1-2, 4, 68:2, 73:10; Tell Abu Hawam: Anati 1959: Fig. 7:5; Hazor: Yadin et al. 1958: Pis. LXXXVI: 8-9, CIX:4-5, CXXIX:l-6, CXXXI:4; Yadin et al. 1960: Pis. CXXXVIII:7-8, CXXXIX: 16, CXXI:6-7). Storage Jar Rims (Fig. 4.7:1-16) A selection of storage jar rims is presented here. These include simple rims with straight, slightly everted or slightly inverted profiles (Fig. 4.7: 1 - 4), ridged and slightly everted rims (Fig. 4.7:5-8), short folded-over rims (Fig. 4.7:9-12), long folded-over and everted rims (Fig. 4.7: 13) and everted to flaring rims (Fig. 4.7: 14-16). Storage Jar Bases (Fig. 4.7:17-22) Type A storage jar bases vary in section and profile from button bases (Fig. 4.7:17-20) to thickened button bases (Fig . 4 .7 : 1 8- 1 9) and stump bases (Fig . 4.7:21-22). Fig. 4.7:21 is noteworthy for its cup- like base, which is noticeably heavier and thicker in section than the body of the storage jar. This may be a result of the separate formation of the base, which was then attached to the body of the vessel. VI. FLASKS (Figs. 4.8, 4.9:1-3; Photos 4.KM.15) Flasks are restricted vessels with a narrow neck inserted into a globular or lentoid body. One or two handles extend from the neck to the vessel's shoulder. Two major types of flasks can be defined. A baseless flask with a lentoid body appears in the local ceramic assemblages of Canaan, Cyprus, Mycenaean Greece and Egypt (see Furumark 1941 : 32, 67, 102, 103, 616: Form 47, for a description of the two-handled Mycenaean version; a single- handled lentoid shaped flask appears in Cypriot, Greek and Canaanite assemblages). A globular flask with a base is present in the Mycenaean ceramic repertoire (vertical and horizontal types: see Furumark 1941: 32,33,67,82,92,93,99, 101, 102, 616: Forms 48 and 49). Only the lentoid flask, often referred to as a pilgrim flask, was produced locally in Canaan (for imported Mycenaean lentoid flasks in Canaan, see most recently Leonard 1985: 81-83). Lentoid flasks manufactured in Canaan differ technically from other locally produced restricted vessels in the Late Bronze Age in that first the lentoid body was formed on the wheel on its side as one unit, next the neck was inserted into the narrow side of the flask, and lastly the handle or handles were attached to the neck and body. A similar technique was used to produce Cypriot Red Lustrous Wheelmade flasks (Eriksson 1988), while single-handled Base Ring lentoid flasks were moldmade in a single piece with a "plug" or additional piece attached to the center of the flask to close the opening. The origin of the flask is a subject of some debate. The earliest flasks originate in the Aegean world: globular flasks appear in small numbers in Crete during the Middle Minoan II/IIIA periods (Evans 1928: 178T79, 215, 222-23, 508-ll).By the Late Minoan period, flasks became more numerous and were evidently intended to be presented as gifts containing perfumed oils, wines or other precious liquids (Tzedakis 1971). According to Tzedakis, this type of globular flask was formed by two semi-hemispherical parts which were produced separately and later joined. Tzedakis (1971: 368) suggests that most of the Late Minoan flasks were produced at Knossos and may be one of the last manifestations of palatial pottery. During the 15th and 14th centuries, the single- handled lentoid flask appears in Base Ring I ware on Cyprus (Äström 1972: 167-68; see Merrillees 95</page><page sequence="102">CHAPTER FOUR 1968: 165-66 on Base Ring I flasks in Egypt) and continues to be manufactured in greater numbers in Base Ring II ware (Äström 1972: 189-90). A similar shaped wheelmade lentoid flask was produced in Red Lustrous Wheelmade ware (Äström 1972: 203-205). The lentoid and globular flasks make their debut on mainland Greece during Mycenaean IIIA. Furumark ( 194 1 : 32) remarks that the globular flask is the only globular form directly adapted by the Mycenaeans from the Minoan repertoire in the Mycenaean IIIA: 1 period. The lentoid flask first appears in Canaan and Egypt during the 14th century (see however Sailer 1964: Fig. 55:1 for one possibly earlier flask in a tomb from Dominus Flevit). In Canaan, it is most commonly found in tomb contexts (see e.g. the Deir el-Balah cemetery: T. Dothan 1979: Ills. 85, 92, 129, 135, 137, 140: Tombs 116, 118; Tell el-Far'ah [S]: Duncan 1930: PI. 85; the Gibeon cemetery: Pritchard 1963: 15, Figs. 8:25, 12:70; the Beth-Shean Northern Cemetery: Oren 1973: 113-14, where it is the second most common shape; Tell Abu Hawam: Anati 1959: Fig. 9:11; 'Akko, Persian Garden: Ben-Arieh and Edelstein 1977: 17, Fig. 11:1-6; Hazor: Yadin et al. 1960: 117, Pl. CXXX:8-14: Tomb 8144-45; the Madeba tomb: Harding 1953: 27^17, Figs. 15-16: Nos. 77-93). In Egypt, the lentoid flask was produced locally as well as being imported from Canaan (see e.g. Peet and Woolley 1913: PI. LI: Types XXXVIII/91 , Type XXXVIII/1014; Brunton and Engelbach 1927: Pl. XXXIX: 93B, 93D, 93U, from XVIIIth-XIXth Dynasty tombs; Rose 1984: 135, 137, Group 24; for a summary of the appearance of the flask in Egypt and Nubia during the New Kingdom, see Holthoer 1977: 99-100). Several unusual types of flasks were also produced in Egypt or at Egypto-Canaanite sites. Flasks made of tin appear in an XVIIIth Dynasty grave at Aby dos (Evans 1 928 : Fig . 9 1 ) and in the Ulu Burun shipwreck (Bass et al. 1989: Fig. 22).

LXVI:8), faience (Gurob: Petrie 1891: PI. XVII:9) and glass (Nolte 1968: 172) are also known from Egypt. Double vessels consisting of two lentoid flasks or a flask joined to a juglet or small jar are common in Egypt (Petrie 1907: PI. XXVII; Brunton and Engelbach 1927: Pl. XXXIX:93E; Steindorff 1937: Pl. 85:44a; Hayes 1959: 277; Fig. 169; and see Holthoer 1977: 103-104 for a summary of the Egyptian and Nubian examples), and occasionally appear in Canaan (for an imported Egyptian composite flask found in Canaan, see Ben-Arieh and Edelstein 1977: 19, Fig. 10: 10, PI. XIII:7; for locally made double vessels at Egypto-Canaanite sites see Beth-Shean: Oren 1973: 114, Fig. 48b: 16; James and McGovern 1993: Fig. 26:1). These Egyptian flasks presumably served special functions. The importance of the flask and its contents is also indicated by the appearance of Canaanite lentoid flasks as part of the trade cargo of the Ulu Burun shipwreck (Bass 1 986: 284-85 , 111 . 2 1 ) and in an Egyptian tomb relief depicting a Syrian trading venture into Egypt (Davies and Faulkner 1947). In conclusion, we may trace the earliest appearance of the flask to Middle Minoan Crete. The form was then adopted on Cyprus as a single- handled lentoid shaped flask in the 16th or 15th century BCE and later on mainland Greece. From the Aegean, the shape was integrated into the local ceramic repertoire of Canaan and Egypt during the 14th century BCE. It is also suggested here that the function and contents of flasks may be closely connected with funerary rites, burial customs or cult (see also Holthoer 1977: 99-100, who also notes a close connection between flasks and tombs in Nubia). At Deir el-Balah, five main types of flasks appear in the settlement and cemetery, most of them in the potters' workshop area (see also Chapter 2 for Egyptian-style white slipped lentoid flasks). Flask Type A (Fig. 4.8:1-3; Photos 4.10-4.11) Flask Type A is a lentoid flask with two arched handles that rise vertically from the upper shoulder and join at the center of the neck. The most characteristic feature of these flasks is the technique of spreading the clay of the handles over the neck to form two petals at the juncture between the neck and body of the flask. This type of handle is also a feature of some of the Mycenaean lentoid flasks 98</page><page sequence="105">CANAANITE POTTERY Fig. 4.9. Flasks and lamps. (see e.g. a Levanto-Mycenaean IIIA:2 flask from Tomb 8144-45 at Hazor: Yadin et al. 1960: Pl. CXXXVII:3). These flasks may be undecorated (Type A:l, Fig. 4.8:1-2) or decorated (Type A:2, Fig. 4.8:3) and range in size from ca. 15-20 cm. to very large versions measuring up to 30-40 cm. in height. The latter, larger versions are often richly decorated in a Canaanite style and usually date from the end of the Late Bronze Age II (see e.g. Lachish: Tufnell et al. 1940: Pl. LIV:349; Aphek: Beck and Kochavi 1985: Fig. 4:3). Type A flasks are well known in the ceramic repertoire of Canaan, appearing as early as the 14th century BCE and continuing through the 13th century BCE. At Hazor, our Types A: 1 and A:2 were 99</page><page sequence="106">CHAPTER FOUR Photo 4.10. Flask (Fig. 4.8:2). Photo 4.11. Flask (Fig. 4.8:3). designated Groups A: 1 and A:2, respectively (Yadin et al. 1960: 146-47, Group A:l: Pis. CXXX:8-9, CXLIII:l-2; Group A:2: Pis. CXXX: 10-13, CXL:5, CXLIII:4). At Beth-Shean, Oren (1973: 113) refers to this type, which appears in large numbers in the Northern Cemetery, as Type B . This flask appears at most Late Bronze Age IIA-B sites in Canaan (e.g. 'Akko, Persian Garden: Ben-Arieh and Edelstein 1977: Fig. 11:1-2; Tell Abu Hawam: Anati 1959: Fig. 9:11; Balensi 1980: PI. 18:1-2; Gibeon: Pritchard 1963: 15, Figs. 8:25, 12:70; Lachish: Tufnell et al. 1940: Pl. LIVA, B:349; Tufnell 1958: PI. 84:954; Ashdod: M. Dothan 1971 : Fig. 82: 1 ; the Lachish and Ashdod flasks date from the late 13th-early 12th centuries BCE). This flask, evidently imported from Canaan, appears in smaller quantities in New Kingdom Egypt (e.g. Aniba: Steindorff 1937: Pl. 85:44b). Flask Type B (Fig. 4.8:4-8; Photos 4.12-4.13) Type B is a lentoid flask with two handles that extend from the sides of the neck, below the rim, to the shoulder. While it is similar in shape to Type A, it differs in the technique used to attach the handles and lacks the petals so characteristic of Type A. This flask is the most common type at Deir el-Balah, where it is undecorated (Type B:l, Fig. 4.8:4-6) or has painted decoration, usually concentric circles (Type B: 2, Fig. 4.8:7-8). It was also produced in a larger size (e.g. at Lachish: Tufnell 1958: PI. 84:956), though this larger version does not appear in the Deir el-Balah assemblage. Decorated examples far outnumber the undecorated flasks. One undecorated flask from Ashdod, Stratum XIV/XIIIb (Dothan and Porath 1993: Fig. 12:12) is identical in shape to the Type B:1 flasks at Deir el-Balah. Several decorated Type B:2 flasks, dated to the end of the 13th century BCE, were recovered from the Deir el-Balah cemetery (T. Dothan 1979: 59, Ills. 137, 138, 140, 141: Tomb 118; Beit-Arieh 1985: Fig. 6:5). Similar decorated flasks appear at Tell el-Far' ah (S) (Starkey and Harding 1932: PI. LXXXVIII:85G1), Lachish (Tufnell 1958: PI. 84:955, 957-58), Megiddo (Guy 1938: PI. 34:13) and Hazor (Yadin et al. 1960: Pl. CXXX: 14). Several examples of Type B:2 are published from Egypt (e.g. Petrie 1891: PI. XVIII:2; Brunton 1930: PI. XXX:256; Steindorff 1937: Pl. 85:44b). Flask Type C (Fig. 4.9:1-2; Photos 4.14-4.15) Type C is lentoid in shape, similar to Types A and B but differing in the placement of the two handles, which are attached at the flask's rim and extend to the upper shoulder. Both examples are decorated with a painted spiral design at the center of the body and framed by a series of three concentric circles. The handles are decorated with painted bands and an "x" at the base of the handle where it joins the upper shoulder. The two vessels are unique and may be the product of a particular, perhaps local, workshop. 100</page><page sequence="107">CANAANITE POTTERY Photo 4.12. Flask (Fig. 4.8:7). Photo 4.13.

Flask Type D (Fig. 4.9:3) Flask Type D is a lentoid flask with a single handle attached to the neck and the back of the flask. This is a locally produced imitation of imported Base Ring and Red Lustrous Ware Cypriot flasks. Similar flasks were found in Tombs 116 and 118 at Deir el-Balah (T. Dothan 1979: 39, 56, Ills. 85, 92, 129, 135) where they are dated to the end of the 13th 101</page><page sequence="108">CHAPTER FOUR century BCE. Other samples appear at Lachish (Tufnell 1958: 211, PI. 82:908), the Beth-Shean Northern Cemetery (Oren 1973: 114, Figs. 47b: 19, 48b: 14, 75:3) and the Gibeon cemetery (Pritchard 1963: Fig. 12:69). Occasionally these flasks are decorated with the painted concentric circles typical of Canaanite flasks (see e.g. the flasks from the Beth-Shean cemetery). VII. LAMPS (Fig. 4.9:4-7; Photos 4.16-4.18) The saucer lamp, with a shallow, slightly rounded bowl and a pinched spout, is the typical lamp of the Middle-Late Bronze Ages in Canaan. The spout becomes increasingly pinched during the Late Bronze Age IIA-B. The Late Bronze Age II saucer lamp continues the tradition of the Middle Bronze Age lamps. However, Amiran (1969: 190) notes that there is little, if any, distinction between Late Bronze Age IIA and IIB lamps . Tufnell (1958: 1 85-87) classifies three types of saucer lamps which appear during the 14th- 1 3th centuries BCE (Classes D, E and F) and correspond to the three types of lamps from Deir el-Balah. Fig. 4.9:4, typologically the earliest lamp, belongs to Class D lamps at Lachish. Fig. 4.9:5, with a slightly more pinched but still open spout, is similar to Tufnell's Class E lamps, and Fig. 4.9:6-7, with a well-pinched and slightly flanged spout, are similar to Class F at Lachish, spanning the use of Fosse Temples II and III (14th- 13th centuries BCE) and similar lamps from the Gibeon cemetery (Pritchard 1963: 16; Figs. 7:10, 11:43^5). Saucer lamps appear at all Late Bronze Age II sites in Canaan. VULVARIA (Fig. 4.10:1-6; Photos 4.19-4.20) Varia represents pottery vessels that are rare or unique at Deir el-Balah. They include a cup-and- saucer, a pyxis, an unusual spouted bowl and a few vessels that are classified as biconical jugs. A.

Lamp (Fig. 4.9:6). 102</page><page sequence="109">CANAANITE POTTERY and is often found in cultic contexts (Amiran 1969: 303). Though not appearing in large numbers, the cup-and-saucer occurs at most Late Bronze Age IIB-Iron Age I sites (e.g. Lachish [Fosse Temple II and III]: Tufnell et al. 1940: Pl. 44:182-83; Beth-Shean [Late Bronze Age IIB-Iron Age I]: James and McGovern 1993: 76; Figs. 18.14-16; 26.7; 45.4 and see additional references cited on p. 76). One incomplete example was excavated at Deir el-Balah. B. Pyxis (Fig. 4.10:2) The pyxis, a shape originating in the Mycenaean world, has two horizontal loop handles placed just above the carination of the shoulder. Locally produced pyxides are known from Fosse Temple III at Lachish (Tufnell 1958: 216, PI. 82) and the Gibeon cemetery (Pritchard 1963: 13-14, Fig. 8:23). The locally produced pyxis begins to appear in significant numbers in Canaan only in the 1 3th century BCE and increases in popularity during the Iron Age I (Pritchard 1963: 14). An almost complete example was excavated at Deir el-Balah and is similar to pyxides from 13th and early 12th century contexts. C. Spouted bowl (Fig. 4.10:3; Photo 4.19) This complete carinated bowl with a strainer spout and single vertical handle is unique at Deir el-Balah and lacks exact parallels. D. Biconical jugs (Fig. 4.10:4-6; Photo 4.20) The biconical jug, though common at most Late Bronze Age sites throughout Canaan (e.g. Amiran 1969: 147), is very rare at Deir el-Balah. Only a few biconical vessels, including a small "mug" (Fig. 4.10:4), a partially complete decorated jug with a flat disc base (Fig. 4.10:5) and a painted sherd (Fig. 4.10.6) were recovered at Deir el- Balah. Figs. 4.10:5-6 are decorated with a simple painted net pattern motif on the shoulder of the vessel. IX. IMITATION IMPORTS (Fig. 4.10:7-9; Photo 4.21) A. Imitation Cypriot Base Ring II Jugs (Fig. 4.10:7-8; Photo 4.21) Locally produced imitation Base Ring II jugs ("bilbils") are distinguished from the original by the use of local clays, different production techniques with clearly visible wheel marks (probably a result of finishing on a slow wheel), the use of red or dark painted decoration as opposed to the white painted decoration used on Cypriot Base Ring II vessels, painted motifs in the Canaanite tradition and the Photo 4.19.

In the local imitations of this Cypriot type, the Canaanite potters adopted only those features that could readily be reproduced using Canaanite potting traditions (Prag 1985: 161-63). Two nearly complete imitation Base Ring vessels were excavated at Deir el-Balah (Fig. 4.10:7-8). Fig. 4.10:7 is irregularly shaped with a slightly bulging neck and a globular body resting on a ring base. Reddish brown painted diagonal lines decorate the body of the vessel. Fig. 4.10:8 has a longer, narrower neck with a regularly shaped piriform body resting on a low ring base. This vessel is undecorated. Though it has been suggested by Tufnell (1958: 210-11) that local imitations of Cypriot imports become significant only after the cessation of imports, the evidence does not support this claim. Imitations and imported Base Ring II vessels appear side by side at numerous sites, including Deir el-Balah (see also Prag 1985: 162). Local imitation Base Ring II jugs are widespread throughout Canaan, especially during the 13th century BCE (see e.g. Aphek: Beck and Kochavi 1985: Fig. 4:2; Hazor: Yadin et al. 1960: 148, Pl. CXXXIV:2) and are prevalent in tombs (see e.g. the Gibeon cemetery: Pritchard 1963: 13, Figs. 8:20-23, 12:62-65). Prag (1985: 163) suggests that this vessel was produced as a container for precious substances. Fig. 4.10. Varia and local imitations of imports. No. Type Reg.

Imitation Mycenaean Vessels (Fig. 4.10:9) An imitation Mycenaean HIB piriform jar with three handles on a raised ring base was recovered from Deir el-Balah. This jar has a red painted band on the long neck just above the handles, three painted bands on the body and a broad band of red paint on the base continuing up to the lower part of the body. A similar imitation Mycenaean piriform jar with a slightly different neck was part of the assemblage of vessels from Tomb 116 in the Deir el-Balah cemetery (T. Dothan 1979: 39, Ills. 84, 91). Imitation piriform jars are also known from Tell Jemmeh (Duncan 1930: PL 55 V2), the Gibeon cemetery (Pritchard 1963: Fig. 12:76) and Lachish (Tufnell 1958: 216, PL 82:940-44); however, the imitation jars are more piriform in shape and the necks are wider and shorter.

The lamp and bowls are of the coarse ware with organic inclusions typical of the Egyptian-style pottery found at Deir el-Balah. The lamp is the typical saucer lamp of Late Bronze Age II Canaan. The bowls (Types Al and A2 in our classification of Egyptian pottery) are plain with flattened bases, and are typical of the repertoire of rather crude Late Bronze Age bowls. Both bowls are warped and are clearly kiln wasters: the bases of both are cracked, and No. 2 still has a lump of clay stuck on the inside. Although the bowls were undoubtedly discards, the lamp is well made and fired. None of the three vessels shows any sign of use and there are no traces of soot. The reddish yellow color of the clay of bowl No. 1 is identical to that of the lamp, while bowl No. 2 is pale brown. Lamp and bowl deposits dated to the Late Bronze Age through Iron Age I are a well-known feature in Canaan. One of the earliest published references is to foundation deposits at Tell el-Hesi, in layers of Sub-City IV and City IV, dating from the Late Bronze Age II (Bliss 1894: 84-87). Bliss notes that in numerous cases a lamp had been placed in a bowl near the foundations of walls (in one case under the wall). Bliss relates these deposits to a ceremony connected with the construction of a new building. Similar deposits dating to the Late Bronze * This chapter has not been updated. Age were found at Tell es-Safi in the Shephelah, and were interpreted as connected with house dedication (Bliss and Macalister 1902: 151-52). The largest group of this type of deposit was found at Gezer, during both Macalister 's early excavations and the renewed excavations led by Dever. Macalister's excavations yielded lamp and bowl deposits, most dated to the Fourth Semitic Period and some to the late Third Semitic Period, equivalent to our Late Bronze Age II and Iron Age I (Macalister 1912: 434-37). The deposits were placed in corners of rooms or under the thresholds of doorways, not under the foundations but beside the lowest stone of the wall and against the inner face. Macalister notes that though this rite seemed common, many houses showed no traces of it. On the other hand, several such deposits were sometimes found within a single building, in one case as many as seven. According to Macalister ( 1 9 1 2: 435) , these deposits are a valuable aid to the understanding of house plans, since they indicate the probable position of doorways. Most of the deposits consisted of a bowl containing a lamp with another bowl inverted over it, though variations occurred. As a rule, the bowls, some of which were painted with the "palm-tree panel" pattern, were unused when deposited, though some of the lamps showed traces of soot. In several cases the vessels were unbaked. Some of the bowls contained ashes, some sand. Additional lamp and bowl deposits were found in Layers 5C-A and 6C-B during the renewed excavations at Gezer led by Dever (Dever 1986: 76, 81, 106, 111-15, Pis. 22, 36, 38, 95b, 109; Dever et al. 1970: 23, Pis. 9, 28).

The renewed excavations give us a chronological and typological framework for these deposits, which date predominantly from the late 13th and early 12th centuries BCE. 112</page><page sequence="118">A LAMP AND BOWL DEPOSIT An extension into the late 12th century and the first half of the 11th century BCE is shown by the find of such a deposit at Tel Mikne-Ekron, Field IV, Stratum Vc, Locus 23026, near the southeastern corner of the large hall of the monumental building with cultic connotations, and adjacent to the stone foundations (Dothan 1990: 30). This deposit consists of two rounded bowls, one upturned on top of the other, with a lamp nesting in an upright position. The bowls were decorated with red concentric circles typical of the period. The lamp shows no traces of use. The chronological range of this type of foundation deposit in Israel is from the Late Bronze Age II to Iron Age I. The geographical distribution, according to current evidence, is from Gezer and the Shephelah in the north to Philistia and the coastal area in the south. REFERENCES Bliss, F.J. 1894.

The bowls are wheelmade with string-cut bases and are similar to other examples generally found in connection with temples and cultic installations. The closest parallels to these seven bowls come from the temple of Area H at Hazor, dated to Stratum 2 (15th century BCE). Two were found on the floor of the temple (Yadin et al. 1961: Pl. CCLXIX: 16-17), while a third was found in a brick-built pottery kiln (2160) (Yadin et al. 1961: Pl. CCLXIX: 14; Yadin 1972: 82, n. 1). Other similar miniature string-cut vessels have been uncovered, most notably a large assemblage of the 13 th century BCE from Athienou in Cyprus (Dothan and Ben-Tor 1983: 95-1 10, Fig. 49: 16, 18) and a bowl from the "Sanctuaire" at Ugarit (Schaeffer 1949: 259, Fig. 106:9). While the assemblage from Hazor certainly predates that from Deir el-Balah, Schaeffer's dating of the assemblage from Ugarit to Ugarit Moyen 2 (1900-1750 BCE) has been disputed on the basis of two bronze cultic figurines found with the assemblage, indicating a Late Bronze Age date, possibly as late as the 14th- 13th centuries BCE (for a summary of the controversy, see Negbi 1976: 92, n. 30).

Other Mycenaean vessels from the cemetery have been published previously (T. Dothan 1979). The cemetery of Deir el-Balah yielded one of the largest and richest assemblages of Mycenaean pottery ever found in Israel. Unfortunately, the most impressive group comes from the illicit digging (T. Dothan 1973, 2008; Perlman et al. 1973). This group has broadened our knowledge of the Mycenaean pottery of Deir el-Balah both in its chronological range (second half of the 14th to 13th centuries BCE) and in its typological variety; in some instances the later group of Mycenaean pottery from the cemetery and settlement could be related to it. The pottery from the cemetery derives from sealed burial contexts (see Vol. I, Chapter 1), while the pottery from the settlement comes both from well-stratified loci and from unstratified contexts. All these vessels and fragments are discussed here. They all date from Strata IX-IV and give us an indication of the pottery repertoire imported to Deir el-Balah. In our discussion we will follow Mountjoy's terminology (1986), which is a revised version of Furumark's work (1941). For shapes and motifs we use the terms "FS" and "FM," and the chronological terms are according to Mountjoy (1986: 8). A rough draft of this chapter was reviewed by the late Professor Vronwy Hankey, and her comments have been incorporated into the text. * This chapter has not been updated. STIRRUP JARS (Fig. 7.1) Fig. 7.1:1 (Photo 7.1) is a globular stirrup jar (FS 171) from Tomb 1405, made of well-levigated pinkish clay. It has a concave false neck and a broad, slightly domed top disc. The handles are perpendicular, bending inward. The spout is concave with a rounded lip. The belly zone is slightly wider, narrowing towards the concave base. The shoulder zone is decorated with attached concentric arcs (FM 44). Concentric arcs are common as a filling motif for shoulder zones, but mostly appear unattached (Schaeffer 1949; Courtois 1981). A red loop is painted round the base of the false neck and rim of the spout. The top disc is decorated with concentric circles. The handles are monochrome. The bands are extremely regular and well-executed. There is great variation in the coloring of the decoration, primarily due to the exposure of the vessel. The base is decorated with fine concentric lines in red, a common feature in the LH HIB style (Mountjoy 1986: 108). In shape and decoration, this vessel belongs to the LH HIB 1 assemblages. A similar stirrup jar was found in Tomb 1 16 (T. Dothan 1979: 111. 87:94). Fig. 7.1:2 (Photo 7.2) is a globular stirrup jar (FS 171) from Locus 1392 Upper, made of fine, well-levigated pinkish clay. The height of this vessel equals the diameter, with slightly sloping shoulders. The false neck is concave. The disc is flat with a small central cone. The handles are arched, rising above the disc and curving inward to the shoulder. The vessel has a ring base. The handles are carelessly painted in red, with a rough triangle in reserve at the join with the disc. The disc is decorated with a solid red circle, and a 117</page><page sequence="122">CHAPTER SEVEN Fig. 7.1. Stirrup jars. No. T^pe Reg.

The shoulder zone is empty. Zones of broad and fine bands decorate the body at the greatest diameter and above the base. The color of the paint varies from red to black. The globular shape was a very popular form of Mycenaean stirrup jar throughout its long use; however, the empty shoulder zone suggests a date in the LH HIB 1 rather than the LH IIIA2 (Mountjoy 1986: 79). Fig. 7.1:3 (Photo 7.3) is a squat stirrup jar (FS 180) from Tomb 613, made of well-levigated clay and delicately decorated. Its diameter is greater than its height. The false neck has slightly concave sides and a broad, coned top disc. The handles are perpendicular, bending inward to the flattish shoulders. The spout is narrow and slightly concave with an angular lip. The base is raised and concave. The shoulder zone is decorated with the "unvoluted flower" motif (FM 18:115). In the LH HIB style, this flower has extremely characteristic forms, and later forms can be distinguished from earlier ones by their more abstract geometric nature. The more open character of the designs, and the simple geometric features of the outline, are traits typical of the LH HIB style (Furumark 1941: 292).

Fig. 7.1:4 (Photo 7.4) is a globular stirrup jar (FS 173) from Locus 1222; the handles, spout and false neck are missing. The shoulder zone is rather flat and the belly zone is slightly wider. The base is raised and concave. A red loop decorated the base of the spout and false neck; remains of paint are seen at the base of one of the handles. The shoulder zone is empty. The body is decorated with two sets of wide, red bands with fine lines between them. The ring of the base is painted in red. Fig. 7.1:5 is the spout and part of the body of a stirrup jar from Locus 1227. The spout has slightly concave sides and is lipped. The body is decorated with broad red bands, and there are traces of paint on the lip. The shape appears similar to Fig. 7.1:6 (FS 173). Fig. 7.1 :6 is a fragment of a false neck and disc, with part of the stirrup, from Locus 1227. The neck has concave sides and is not decorated. The disc is decorated with a broad red circle and a dot at the center. Fig . 7 . 1 êJ is a body fragment of a squat, biconical stirrup jar (FS 1 80) from Locus 1325. The diameter is greater than the height. The shoulders are flat and angled, the belly zone wider and decorated with fine, light brown lines flanked by broad, black bands. On the basis of its shape, it should be dated to LH HIB 1 (Mountjoy 1986: 107). Fig. 7.1:8 is the spout of a stirrup jar, lipped, with slightly concave sides, from Locus 1029. A red loop is painted round the base and lip. Fig. 7.1:9 is a fragmentary spout of a stirrup jar from Locus 591 , decorated with a red painted loop at the base. Photo 7.4.

Traces of black loops are painted around the base of the false neck and spout. Faint traces of the unvoluted flower motif (FM 1 8 : 1 1 3- 1 4) can be seen on the shoulder zone , dating the vessel to LH IIIB1. Fig. 7.1: 1 1 is a sherd of fine ware and lustrous paint from Locus 1049, decorated with the "lozenge" motif (FM 73). This motif, in narrow horizontal bands containing lozenges arranged in a chain, occurs in the central zones of stirrup jars, on lips, and inside cups and shallow bowls, and is also used as the sole decoration of smaller vessels. It is extensively found in LH HIB decoration, owing to the symmetrical design characteristics of this motif (Furumark 1941: 410-12). Fig. 7.1:12 is a sherd from the shoulder zone of a stirrup jar from Locus 1153, decorated with the "multiple stem and tongue" motif (FM 19:28-31) of the semicircular or quadrantal type characteristic of the LH HIB style. The "multiple stem" motif was also found on stirrup jars at Beth- Shean (Oren 1973: Figs. 74:1, 43:6: Tomb 107) and Hazor (Yadin et al. 1960: Pis. CXXXVII:13, CLXXXVIII:9). Similar Mycenaean stirrup jars have been found in Late Bronze Age contexts at other sites in Israel, e.g. Beth Shemesh, Tomb 1 , first cemetery (Grant 1929: 163); Lachish, the Fosse Temple (Tufnell et al. 1940: Pl. CXXXVIII:9); Tell el-'Ajjul, the top burial level in the Governor's Tomb (Petrie 1933: Pis. X, XI); Tell el-Far'ah (S), Tomb 939 (XlXth-XXth Dynasties), Tomb 905 and Tomb 936 (Starkey and Harding 1932: PI. LXXXVII: Tombs 905 , 936); Megiddo, from Stratum VII in the settlement (Loud 1948: PI. 72:16) and from tombs (Guy 1938: Pis. 14:7, 17:9-10, 35:22, 62:20-21, 158:5); Hazor, Area F, Tomb 8144-8145, Stratum lb (LB II) (Yadin et al. 1960: Pl. CXXXVIL9-13); and in the Northern Cemetery of Beth-Shean (Oren 1973: Figs. 43: Tomb 107; 44b: Tomb 90; 47a-b: Tomb 221A-C; 48b: Tomb 219A-B: 50: Tomb 241). Other sites in Canaan and Syria have been discussed thoroughly by Stubbings (1951) and Hankey (1967). LARGE STIRRUP JARS (Fig. 12) Fig. 7.2:1 is a fragment of the lower part of a relatively large, thick handle and its attachment to the shoulder, from Locus 1188. It has a red loop painted at the base and a stripe at each side. A small hole was perforated in the base. Traces of paint can be seen on the shoulder. The fabric is very coarse Minoan HIB ware. Fig. 7.2:2 is a body sherd from Locus 1160, of very coarse Minoan ware, decorated with a dark brown semicircle, which can be assumed to be part of a deep, wavy-line decoration (Bell 1982: 145-63, esp. 151-53). Fig. 7.2:3 (Photo 7.5) is an outsized (5.4 cm wide, 7.4 cm high) hollow, false neck with a slightly coned disc , from Locus 1 3 1 9 . A black loop decorates the base of the neck, and fine, black circles decorate the disc. Blobs of clay can be seen on the inside, at the join of the disc to the hollow false neck. This belongs to an unusually large stirrup jar. It is certainly not of the "coarse ware" type usually associated with the storage and transportation of olive oil; its clay is well levigated and it has the typical lustrous black paint of Mycenaean pottery. Stirrup jars on such a large scale are extremely rare in fine ware, although a fragment of a handle and disc was found at Beth-Shean (Fitzgerald 1930: PI. XLIII:37; Hankey 1967: 127; Haskell 1981: 225-38). Photo 7.5. False neck of very large stirrup jar (Fig. 7.2:3). 122</page><page sequence="127">MYCENAEAN AND MINOAN POTTERY Fig. 7.2.

They are characterized by their special fabric, named "oatmeal ware" in reference to its distinctive composition (Biegen et al. 1953: 305). In many cases they were inscribed with the Linear B script, 123</page><page sequence="128">CHAPTER SEVEN indicating place-names of different workshops exporting oil (Hallager 1987). The end of the Late Bronze Age in the eastern Mediterranean witnessed a revival of Minoan influence. During the late 14th and especially 13th centuries BCE, large stirrup jars appear throughout the Aegean and eastern Mediterranean, in Crete, Cyprus, the Greek mainland and Ugarit (Benson 1961: PI. 40). In Crete, parallels in ware and decoration come from the Room of the Vases in Knossos, dated to LM HIB (Popham 1964). On the Greek mainland jars of similar ware with deep wavy lines come from the House of the Oil Merchant at Mycenae (Wace 1953: PI. 7b). Two "oatmeal ware" stirrup jars were found side by side at Athienou in Cyprus, in Pits 552 and 637 of Stratum III, dated to the second half of the 13th century BCE (Dothan and Ben-Tor 1983: Fig. 15). Other Cypriot examples appeared at Enkomi (Dikaios 1969: Pis. 67:28: end of Level IIB; 87:48: end of Level IIB; 98:22: Level IIB; 196:16: Tomb 2) and at Kourion (Benson 1961: 40; Dothan and Ben-Tor 1983: 52-53). One example was found at Ugarit, dated to Ugarit Récent 3 ( 1 365-1 299 BCE) (Schaeffer 1949: Fig. 58.15). Additional parallels come from Troy Level VI, where fragments of at least five "oatmeal ware" stirrup jars were found inside House VIF (Biegen et al. 1953: Pl. 330). A stirrup jar from Tomb 59 in Cemetery B at Sidmant in Egypt belongs in shape and decoration, although not in size and fabric, to this class of Late Minoan/ Mycenaean HIB jars (Kemp and Merrillees 1980: 246). Of great importance is the large stirrup jar published from the shipwreck of Ulu Burun, off southern Anatolia, which was undoubtedly an oil container (Bass 1986: 291, 111. 29; Bass 1987: 7 14-15). Other examples were found in the Kharji cemetery in Beirut and at Minet el-Beidha, all dated to LM III (Hankey 1978: 149). From the published material in Israel, such vessels have been recognized at Deir el-Balah (Hankey 1978) and Tell Abu Hawam. Fragments of at least seventeen vessels, described as being of coarse buff ware with grits and having red paint on brown buff-cream slip, were found at Tell Abu Hawam. More of these sherds have been found recently on the same site in a Myc. IIIB context. These jars, generally made of gray-pink, gritty clay and in some cases covered with a buff slip, are usually between 30 and 60 cm. high, of piriform shape (FS 164), often with a main decorative element of a deep, continuous wavy line, derived from the octopus design (Benson 1961: PI. 17). In his study of coarse ware stirrup jars, Benson concluded that they were imported from the Greek mainland, a fact that fits into the flourishing LH III oil trade centered at Mycenae (Benson 1961: 42). Observing that these stirrup jars have no uniform consistency, quality or color of clay, and that the paint, design and shape are also without specific peculiarities, he concludes that there can be no one place of origin, and that each vessel is to be examined separately (Benson 1961: 41). Catling and Millet, however, have challenged Benson's claim and argue for a Cretan origin on the basis of spectrographic analysis of the clay and the Minoan personal and place names inscribed on several incised vessels. The distribution of the vessels also suggests that Crete at this time exported jars containing oil or unguents manufactured and "bottled" there (Catling and Millet 1965: 32-37). Hallager, in his recent study of inscribed stirrup jars from Khania in Crete, concludes that these oil containers were one more element showing Mycenaean influence and presence in Crete, thus placing Crete of the LM IIIB in the context of international trade, both to the mainland as well as outside the Aegean (Hallager 1987: 171-90). A complete "oatmeal ware" stirrup jar originates from the cemetery of Deir el-Balah (Ornan 1986: 92, IM 82.2.606). It has a tall, piriform shape and is made of light buff ware with traces of self slip on the body. The dark brown paint of the decoration has almost entirely peeled off, leaving the light background or "negative" of the decoration. Traces of spilled contents are visible just below the mouth of the spout. The decoration is divided into horizontal registers. The space between the handles is decorated with a thick wavy line. Traces of lines are visible on the upper part of the disc and around the spout. The body is divided by horizontal bands from below the handles to the base. The central register has a recurring motif of two antithetical 124</page><page sequence="129">MYCENAEAN AND MINOAN POTTERY stemmed spirals. The stemmed spirals, which became a proper motif only in the LH HIB and UIC styles, have not been encountered on the published large Late Minoan III stirrup jars, which as a rule are decorated with plain horizontal lines or deep wavy lines. A parallel to this jar is a fragment of Late Minoan III ware from the South Front at Knossos (Popham 1964: PI. 3:d-f). The similarity lies both in the flaking of the paint and mainly in the decoration, which is an elaborate depiction of a continuous palm tree motif (Popham 1970: PI. 50:15). Compared with the exquisite Mycenaean vessels from the cemetery and settlement of Deir el-Balah, this stirrup jar is distinctly utilitarian, despite its decoration. Its crude ware and finish, closed shape and traces of spillage mark it as a container, most probably of oil, shipped from an Aegean (probably Cretan) center of manufacture (Haskell 1984: 105-106; Hallager 1987). The finds from Deir el-Balah fit well into a picture of international trade with Cretan- Mycenaean involvement. Though our stirrup jars are unfortunately uninscribed, they fit typologically with the inscribed stirrup jars, which were no doubt oil containers. This is exemplified in the traces of liquid spill found on the complete stirrup jar from the Deir el-Balah cemetery. This enables us to make the assumption that we have here an indication of oil trade between the Aegean and the Levant. PIRIFORM JARS (Fig. 73) Fig. 7.3:1 (Photo 7.6) is a medium-sized piriform jar (FS 35) from Tomb 1405, piriform-ovoid in shape, with a tall, concave splaying neck and a short splaying lip. The three loop handles are flat and vertical. The base is a torus disc. On the shoulder and between the handles, painted in dark gray, is a scale pattern (FM 70) or space-filling net (FM 42: 19-20), a motif characteristic chiefly of LH HIB on this type of vessel: "One of the most common and characteristic abstract motives of the HIB style is a row of small joining semicircles, attached to a line and frequently reduplicated in various ways" (Furumark 1941: 337). This pattern is confined to a narrow zone, comprising a mere surface filling. This narrow zone is framed with a border of three broad bands. The rim is decorated with bars. The neck, handles and base are shaded red. The body is decorated with two groups of broad bands. The handles are enclosed by three painted loops. Potters' marks in Cypro-Minoan script were incised before firing on all three handles (Ventris and Chadwick 1959: 62, Fig. 11; Masson 1976: 131-32). Similar signs are known on piriform jars in Israel from Tell Abu Hawam and Deir el-Balah (Stubbings 1951: 47-49; T. Dothan 1979). Hankey notes that these and other such marks may not be potters' marks, but may have been ordered by the customer with a particular destination or purpose in mind. This type of jar originated in the Argolid region of Mainland Greece, e.g., at Mycenae (French 1967: 159, Fig. 9:58, 85-86), but its widest diffusion is in the Eastern Mediterranean; in Rhodes (Desborough 1964: PI. 3:b), Cyprus (Karageorghis 1974: 20, 21 , 36, 41 , Pl. XV. 105, 107) and Ugarit (Schaeffer 1949: Figs. 55:9: Tomb II; 60:20: Tomb VI; 125:6, 8). In Canaan this type is rare, and the largest known group comes from the Deir el-Balah cemetery (T. Dothan 1973: 135, Pl. 44:C; T. Dothan 1979: 111. 15:19-20). Other examples are known from Tell Abu Hawam, Stratum V (Hamilton 1935: 46, 28 1-82), and a similar jar handle with an inscribed mark was found by Petrie at Gurob (Petrie 1 890: PI. 28). Hankey notes that at least one handle of the FS 35 type comes from Tell el-Amarna; it is illustrated in Petrie's notebook in the British School of Archaeology. Another from Luxor is located in the Museum of Classical Archaeology in Cambridge. Neither of these handles has inscribed marks. Fig. 7.3:2 is a fragment of an incised handle from a piriform jar with part of the shoulder from Locus 1111. The handle was incised before firing with a potter's mark in Cypro-Minoan script and is decorated with black paint, as is the shoulder. Fig. 7.3:3 is a fragment of an incised handle of a piriform jar from Locus 1111.

The base is painted red, with a broad band painted just above it. Fig. 7.3:5 is the upper part of a concave neck with a splaying lip from Locus 1711. This rim sherd may have come from either a piriform jar or a rhyton. It is painted on the exterior in reddish-brown and on the interior in red. The interior paint extends further than one would expect of a piriform jar, though its profile and circumference are compatible with this form. Fig. 7.3:6 is the concave neck of a piriform jar with a splaying lip from Locus 520A Middle. The neck is painted dark gray. The rim is decorated with bars. Fig. 7.3:7 comprises two matching fragments of a piriform jar neck, with concave sides and a splaying, rounded lip, covered with dark gray paint, from Loci 521 and 541 . Fig. 7.3:8 is a sherd decorated with the space- filling net motif (FM 42:19), bordered by a broad band, from Locus 1 376. This decoration is common on piriform jars (see above). Fig. 7.3:9 is a body fragment from Locus 402. There are traces of a black painted band on the upper part of the sherd. All of these fragments, with the possible exception of Fig. 7.3:5, are of the same type of piriform jars and relate closely to those found in the cemetery. PICTORIAL KRATERS (Fig. 7.4) Fig. 7.4:1 (Photo 7.7) is a sherd from a chariot krater from Locus 407. The fragment depicts three figures in a chariot, of which only the upper part is preserved. The figures are, as always, painted in profile. The heads (FM l:ac), in the typical LH 126</page><page sequence="131">MYCENAEAN AND MINOAN POTTERY Fig. 7.3. Piriform jars. HIB style, have a crude, chicken-like appearance. The eyes are circular with a dot at the center; the noses are distinctly marked, pointing slightly downwards; the mouth and chin are not shown. The headgear is the "Minoan plumed crown."

The chariot (FM 39) is divided into two parts (as far as can be determined from the sherd), the box being placed well above 129</page><page sequence="134">CHAPTER SEVEN Photo 7.7. Sherd from chariot krater (Fig. 7.4:1). the wheel; the evolution of this feature is a quite reliable chronological criterion, placing this chariot in the LH HIB style (Furumark 1941: 334). It is comparatively rare for three figures to appear within the box (Vermeule and Karageorghis 1982: 36-42, Ills. IV: 12, V:17, V:20); two are far more common. Fig . 7 .4:2 (Photo 7 .8) is a krater handle fragment from Locus 464. This locus adjoins Locus 407, where the chariot krater was found, and they probably both come from the same vessel. The flat strap handle has two red stripes painted at the sides and a diagonal stripe between them, with a red spiral at the top. Fig. 7.4:3 comprises two matching sherds, from Loci 1067 and 1051, decorated with a "fill ornament" of a bull or a deer (FM 3), painted in dark brown (a proposed reconstruction is shown in Fig. 7.5). A similar depiction was found at Tell Abu Hawam (Hamilton 1935: PI. XX.307u). Other such bowls and kraters and various fragments with bulls and deer of the "Ripe Style" are known from Enkomi in Cyprus (Karageorghis 1963: Pis. 6-7; Karageorghis 1965: Pl. 1; Vermeule and Karageorghis 1982: 46-49, Pis. V.46, V.48, V.51, V.53, V.101) and from Tiryns and Mycenae on the Greek mainland (Vermeule and Karageorghis 1982: 46-49, Pis. IX .31, IX .48; Kilian 1982: 205-206, Pis. XXVI, XXVII). These fragments are from an open vessel, most likely a krater, with a wide band on the inside, broken at the edge. It is hard Photo 7.8. Handle fragment from chariot krater (Fig. 7.4:2). to define the direction of the vessel, but the thicker part of the vessel wall, where the band is situated, is probably closer to the base. We have not been able to identify the animal depicted here, though the decorative details and fill pattern are clearly LH HIB, belonging to the "Ripe Style" of pictorial kraters.

Proposed reconstruction of the motif on Fig. 7.4:3. 130</page><page sequence="135">MYCENAEAN AND M1NOAN POTTERY loop at the base, probably belonging to a chariot krater. Pictorial kraters are dated to the period between the 14th and 12th centuries BCE, their distribution covering mainland Greece, the Aegean islands, Rhodes and the Levant (Vermeule and Karageorghis 1982). Hankey notes that C. Morris Peatfield's Ph.D. thesis of 1988 shows conclusively that the dating of Vermeule and Karageorghis for the Early and Middle periods needs adjustment. Peatfield concludes that their Early 1 is equivalent to LH IIIA2 Early, while their Early II- III corresponds to LH IIIA2 Late. Their Middle I- III is equivalent to LH HIB 1 , and the Ripe Style requires no change. Chariot scenes appear as one of the pictorial motifs of the Late Bronze Age , occurring usually on amphoroid kraters and more rarely on open kraters with vertical handles and deep bowls with horizontal handles. The origin of the chariot scene seems to be in ancient frescoes, influenced by processional frescoes and inspired from the Cretan Palace style (Furumark 1941 : 437; Vermeule and Karageorghis 1982: 11). The scene, varying in composition and style, generally consists of a chariot with two charioteers drawn by two horses. In exceptional cases there are one or three charioteers, or the chariot may be drawn by only one horse. The chariot consists of a box divided into two, sometimes three, parts, and a four-spoked wheel drawn in profile and most often directed to the right. Most of these kraters were found in tombs (Sjöqvist 1940: 27; Karageorghis 1960: 136; Mylonas 1966: 27; Biran 1970). The chariot scene was depicted in connection with burial as early as the 16th century BCE, as in the case of the stelae from Mycenae (Marinatos 1960: 59), the sarcophagus of Hagia Triada in Crete (Levi 1956: 192-93), and the sarcophagi from Tanagra near Thebes (Spyropoulos 1970: 185-97). In the Levant, Myc. HIB chariot kraters have been found at Tell Abu Hawam (Hamilton 1935: Pis. XX :307k, p, t; XXI:308u, LH III), Beth Shemesh (Grant and Wright 1938: PI. XLIX: 1-2, undated) and Ashdod (M . Dothan 1 967 : 1 8 1 , Area B , LB II) . Additional examples are published by Vermeule and Karageorghis 1982: 169, Pis. V.8, V.20, V.21 (Ugarit), V.79 (Tell Abu Hawam), VI.23 (Byblos); for further information on Canaan see Stubbings 1951: 78-86; Hankey 1978. The best-preserved krater in Israel, from a tomb at Tel Dan, belongs to the Myc. IIIA style (Biran 1970). Hankey notes that the Tel Dan krater is dated to the LH IIIA2 Late period. She also notes that the Deir el-Balah krater sherds add to the list of amphoroid kraters found in settlement contexts rather than in tombs, a feature contrasting notably with finds in Cyprus and illustrating the different treatment and usage of the amphoroid krater by the inhabitants of the Levant and Canaan. VARIA (Fig. 7.6) PYXIS Fig. 7.6:1 (Photo 7.9) is a complete pyxis (FS 95) from Tomb 613. The body is cylindrical with a slightly concave lower part. The neck is short and slightly splayed with a rounded lip. The two horizontal, round handles are slightly pointed and opposite one another. The base is convex and decorated with concentric circles. The body and neck are decorated with fine red and gray lines. The rounded base, two handles and empty shoulder zone suggests an LH HIB date. Other examples in Canaan come, among others, from Beth-Shean (Oren 1973: Fig. 42:7: Tomb 107, LB I; Fig. 48c:25: Tomb 219A-B, LB I); Lachish (Tufnell et al. 1940: Pl.

From Cyprus , Furumark ( 1 94 1 : 599-600) lists three pyxides with two handles. Hankey believes that there are many more.

There is no other decoration, apart from an occasional filling motif (dot, rosette) in the area of the main motif, and the number of motifs used is limited (Mountjoy 1986: 115). This motif is extremely common in LH III A .2 and HIB styles, the latter having a more elongated upper extremity and a rather fixed 133</page><page sequence="138">CHAPTER SEVEN ornamental character. The vertical application of the motif points to a date in LH IIIB1. This motif also decorates mugs (FS 226) and cups with two horizontal handles (FS 245), though these are rare. In Canaan this motif was found at Abu Hawam (Hamilton 1935: Pis. XIX:306d, n; XX:307f, j; XXI:3081; XXII:309f; Stratum IV, LH III; see also Leonard 1994: 107-109), Lachish (Tufnell 1940: 84-85,Pl.XLVI:B219,LH IIIA:2), Megiddo (Lambert et al. 1978: 122, Pl. 1:12, LH HIB) and Minet el-Beidha (Schaeffer 1949: Fig. 95:17), among others (for further examples from Canaan, see Stubbings 1951: 78-86; Hankey 1967: 1 23 - 47). Fig. 7.6:8 is a bowl rim, with a broad, dark brown band on the exterior and painted grayish- brown in the interior, from Locus 543. Hankey believes that this may be a dipper (FM 236).

The chronological horizon of the Cypriot sherds from Stratum IX can be clearly established. The neck of the Base Ring II jug (Fig. 8.1:1) is crudely made (Äström 1972: 183 ff., esp. 186, Jug Type IXB 1 , probably e). It has a thin, matt friable orange- brown slip with matt white painted decoration in the mature style. This somewhat smaller version of the typical Base Ring II jug is not attested before the latter part of LC IIA, that is before ca. 1400 BCE. While the two Base Ring II bowl fragments (Fig. 8.1:2-3) (Äström 1972: 175ff., Bowl Type I, probably F) are not sufficiently diagnostic for dating purposes, the body sherd of a Bucchero jug (Fig. 8.1:4) is an early representative of the ware (Äström 1972: 425ff., Jug Type I). Its fabric is extremely hard and fired gray with a thin, friable, matt black slip (cf. Äström 1972: 425). Bucchero ware first makes its appearance in the LC IIA, probably the later part (Äström 1972: 425, n. 1; Äström and Äström 1972: 701, 770), and occurs most frequently in LC III. The two White Slip IIA bowl sherds (Fig. 8.1:5-6) belong to a regional style of the more common White Slip II ware. This variety occurs most frequently in the second half of LC IIA,ca. 1400 through 1375 BCE (Äström 1972: 464, Bowl Type I; Äström and Äström 1972: 700). Other fragmentary White Slip II milk bowls (not illustrated in the figure) are typical of their kind and cannot be more closely dated than LC II (Äström 1972: 464f., Bowl Type I). The White Shaved ware * This chapter has not been updated. juglet base (Fig. 8.1 :7) has a possible chronological range of LC IB to IIB (Äström 1972: 222f., Jug Type la; Äström and Äström 1972: 700). It can therefore be deduced that the Cypriot pottery from Stratum IX does not antedate the latter part of the LC IIA, and would be at home in the island during the final phase of this period, ca. 1400 through 1375 BCE. The Cypriot pottery from Stratum VIII consists of a fragmentary Base Ring II closed vessel, probably a jug (Fig. 8.1:8) and the sherds of two White Slip II milk bowls (Fig. 8.1:9-10), none of which is chronologically diagnostic. The same can be said for the rim of a White Slip II milk bowl (Fig. 8.1:11) from Stratum VII. From a post-Stratum VII level, but presumably out of context there, came the rim sherd of a White Slip IIA milk bowl Photo 8.1 .

Stratum VI yielded a number of Cypriot sherds, mostly of White Slip II milk bowls, but also of Base Ring II bowls (Fig. 8.1:13-15), none of which can be closely dated within the LC II. The fragmentary Base Ring II jugs (Fig. 8.1:16-20) all appear to belong to the medium-sized variety of the kind encountered in Stratum IX (Äström 1972: 183ff., esp. 186, Jug Type ICB1, probably e), which is not earlier than the second half of the LC IIA (see above). Stratum IV also produced sherds of the Base 140 Ring II jug type (Fig. 8.1:21 -22) , Base Ring II bowl type (Fig. 8.1:23-25) and White Slip II milk bowl type (Basket No. 3709/2, Locus 1325). The White Slip II milk bowl type is also represented in Stratum III (Fig. 8.1 : 26), but is probably out of context there, as it is most unlikely that White Slip II was being exported from Cyprus after the LC IIC at the latest (Äström and Äström 1972: 700, 704). Given the homogeneity of the Cypriot ceramic remains, it is hard to escape the impression that the pottery covered only a limited period of time, at most a century and probably less, and that the latest of the island's exports reached Deir el-Balah not much later than ca. 1300 BCE.</page><page sequence="144">CYPRIOT POTTERY Photo 8.2.

While its morphological relationship to the ubiquitous Base Ring II bull vase is not in dispute (Äström 1972: 191 ff. , Type XVIb), the relief decoration on complete rhyta, not to mention the incised designs on the heads from Deir el-Balah, Ras Shamra and Minet el-Beidha, are typical of Base Ring I (Yon 1980: 79, PI. XII:4-59; Äström 1972: 194, Type XVIIa, No. 4) , even if the ware looks forward to Base Ring II (Yon 1980: 80). Though Yon raises the question of where they were made, in Cyprus or even in Ras Shamra (Yon 1980: 83), there is no doubt about the Cypriot nature of the ceramic technique. On the basis of ware alone the rhyta should be no earlier than the late LC IB , that is, before ca. 1475-1450 BCE, or later than Fig. 8.2. Fragment of Cypriot Base Ring I bull's head rhyton. Photo 8.5. Fragment of Cypriot Base Ring I bull's head rhyton. the end of LC IIA, ca. 1 375 BCE, when Base Ring I effectively comes to an end (Äström and Äström 1972: 700). Though Yon dates the specimens from Ras Shamra to ca. 1350-1250 BCE on the basis of their purported association with Mycenaean HIB (Yon 1980: 218, No. 6), Schaeffer placed them in Ugarit Récent 2, ca. 1450-1365 BCE (Schaeffer 1949: 218, Fig. 91:6) and the 14th through 13th centuries BCE (Schaeffer 1936: 110, Fig. 4). Caubet (Caubet et al. 1981: 30f., Nos. CKY 50, 51) subsequently attributed the type to LC II, ca. 1450-1225 BCE. None of the rhyta said to be from Cyprus was scientifically excavated or has a reliable provenance. Bernhard- Walcher 's date of LC I, ca. 1625-1450 BCE, for the example in Vienna is derived from his classification of the ware as Base Ring I and is therefore notional rather than actual (Bernhard-Walcher 1984: 63-64, Inv. No. IV: 1535). On the basis of the extant data, no further chronological precision is possible. 142</page><page sequence="146">CYPRIOT POTTERY REFERENCES Âstrôm, P. 1972.

Although no clear architectural elements of this period other than the pits were recognized at Deir el-Balah, the corpus of material originating from these loci is representative and diagnostic. Besides the material from the pits (illustrated in Pis. 60-64), similar material was recovered from the wadi, mixed with Late Bronze Age, Iron Age II and Byzantine pottery. The material from the wadi indicates the existence of a nearby occupational site from which the material came, later carried east in the wadi flow. The general picture of the pottery from the pits is as follows: 1 . Late Bronze Age imports are no longer found, apart from the two milk bowls found in Pit 526 (PI. 63:6-7) and a local imitation of a Base Ring jug from Pit 1326 (PI. 62:24). Contamination with typical Late Bronze Age material in these pits, which were cut into the Late Bronze Age debris and were not plastered, is not surprising. 2. The chronological framework of these pits is based on the typology of the domestic ware and Philistine pottery found in them. We use the latter term to designate a group of pottery that is characterized by its special shapes (e.g., bell-shaped bowls, kraters, horn-shaped vessels, etc.), finish (white slip) and decoration (bichrome) (for a full discussion of Philistine pottery see T. Dothan 1982). 3. The plain local pottery appearing in these pits is typical of Iron Age I, i.e., it continues the Late Bronze Age tradition in the area. Both * This chapter has not been updated. local Canaanite shapes and those with Egyptian characteristics, especially bowls, kraters and beerbottles, are represented. PIT 1322 (PI. 60) Bowls The Philistine material from Pit 1 322 is represented only by fragments of Type 1 , the bell-shaped bowl with horizontal handles and white slip (PI. 60: 1-2; T. Dothan 1982: 98-106). PI. 60:2 is paralleled at Tell Qasile (Mazar 1985: Fig. 44:6, Stratum X). The two bases (PI. 60:3-4) most probably belong to this bowl type as well. The bell-shaped bowl is one of the most common shapes in the Philistine repertoire, appearing either with white slip only, as in this case, or additional decoration. The plain coarse-ware bowls also fit the Iron Age I repertoire. PI. 60:5-7 are small open bowls with straight sides. PI. 60:5-6 have red bands decorating the rims. A similar vessel to PI. 60:7 was found at Tell Qasile (Mazar 1985: Fig. 27:16, Stratum IX). Variations on the open bowl include PI. 60:8, a vessel with a slightly incurved rim and rounded body that continues the Late Bronze Age tradition; it is paralleled by a Late Bronze Age II example from Ashdod (Dothan and Porath 1993: Fig. 10:3, Stratum XV). PI. 60:9 has an everted rim and belongs to a group represented by several vessels in Pit 1326, especially PI. 62:4. It too is paralleled in the Late Bronze Age II at Ashdod (Dothan and Porath 1993: Fig. 10: 10, Stratum XV). Kraters PI. 60:10-11 are hammerhead kraters, PI. 61:11 possibly having two handles .

Iron Age I pottery from Pit 421/424. of a large krater with a rope impression, a feature reminiscent of the Late Bronze Age Egyptian-type bowls of Type G at the site (see above, Chapter 2, Fig. 2.1:16-17, and Holthoer 1977: PI. 26: CV7 IR/O/K). The technique is similar, though the shapes differ. Cooking Pots Very few cooking pots were found in the Iron Age pits. PI. 60:13 is a cooking pot with a triangular everted rim, a type that continues the Late Bronze Age tradition and is paralleled at Ashdod (Dothan and Freedman 1967: Fig. 34:18). However, a fragment with an elongated triangular rim more typical of Iron Age I (PI. 64: 17) was found in Pit 421 . The shape and profile of PI. 60: 15 fits well into a group of small cooking pots with triangular rim section, narrow mouth and rounded shoulder. This type of cooking pot is significant for dating, since it is first found in the initial phases of Iron Age I settlements such as Tel Miqne/Ekron together with Myc. UIC: lb pottery; there it continues into the next stratum, where it is found together with Philistine bichrome pottery (T. Dothan 1995: Fig. 3.7:17). Similar vessels occur at Ashdod (Dothan and Porath 1993: Fig. 43:2, Stratum XII) and at Tell el-Far'ah South (Petrie 1930: Pl. XXV, group 542). This type of small, rather closed cooking pot appears at Deir el-Balah with one handle. Jugs and Juglets A large jug with a slanting rim and heavy handles (PI. 60:14) was found in this pit. PI. 60:16 is the rim of a small jug. Storage Jars PI. 60: 17-19 are storage jar rims. PI. 60: 17 has an everted and profiled rim and tall neck, PI. 60: 1 8 an everted and thickened rim and PI. 60: 19 a straight, thickened and rounded rim and tall neck. PI. 60: 18-19 are both paralleled at Gezer (Dever et al. 1986: Figs. 41:3 and 42:7, respectively). 147</page><page sequence="150">CHAPTER NINE Varia Pl. 60:20 is the rim of a large, heavy tray, a type that has a long history as a utilitarian vessel and offers no help in establishing chronology. A similar vessel was found at Tell Jemmeh (Petrie 1928: PI. XLVIII:5f). PIT 1326 (Pis. 61-62) PHILISTINE POTTERY (PI. 61) This group is representative of Philistine pottery, comprising open vessels (bowls and kraters) with white-slip and red-band decoration. It does not, however, provide a guideline for dating this assemblage, since such bowls and kraters span the 12th and 11th centuries BCE. PI. 61:1-8 are from the standard Philistine repertoire, while PI. 61 :9- 16, which share the white slip technique, are stylistic variants. The white-slipped jug (PI. 62: 13) illustrated among the domestic ware may be added to this group. Type 1 Philistine Bowls PI. 61 : 1-6 are bell-shaped bowls (T. Dothan 1982: 98-106, Type 1). PI. 61 : 1-2 have white slip without decoration. PI. 61:3-6 have slip and decoration, which also appears on the handles when present (PI. 61 :3); decorative motifs include stripes and the looped spiral. On our examples, though only part of the decoration is preserved, it can be reconstructed as the antithetical spiral typical of this group (T. Dothan 1982: 98-102, Fig. 2:2, 6, 8). Parallels were found at Ashdod to PI. 61:2 (Dothan 1971: Fig. 73:5, Stratum 9) and PI. 61:6 (Dothan and Porath 1993: Fig. 40:1, Stratum XI). T^pe 2 Philistine Kraters PI. 61:7 is from a typical hammerhead krater (T. Dothan 1982: 106-15, Type 2) with white slip and bichrome decoration (traces of triglyph decoration may perhaps be seen). PI. 61:8 has a slanting hammerhead rim with a rather unusual, rounded profile and typical horizontal handles. White-slipped Variants PI. 61:9-14 share the white slip that appears on pottery accompanying Philistine bichrome ware in this period. PI. 61:9 is handleless and close in shape to the typical carinated bowls of Iron Age I that in many cases, as here, are decorated with red bands on the rim and sometimes with concentric red bands on the bowl as well. It is paralleled at Gezer (Dever et al. 1986: Pl. 40:15). Pl. 61:10 is a carinated, hammerhead bowl, a shape that frequently appears in the Philistine repertoire; a similar though smaller vessel was found at Ashdod (Dothan and Porath 1993: Fig. 33: 18). PI. 61:11 is a small, delicately carinated bowl with a folded rim and red band decoration on the rim. PI. 61:12-14 are white-slipped ring bases that may have belonged to any of the above types. PI. 61 : 15 is a narrow neck, possibly of a jug. PI. 61:16 is a body fragment decorated with an irregular trellis pattern which, though not typical of the Philistine repertoire, appears in the debased decoration of this ware, e.g. at Tell Qasile (Mazar 1985: Fig. 44:18, Stratum X). PLAIN WARES (PI. 62) Bowls PI. 62:1 is a rounded bowl, a style that continues the local Canaanite tradition (see also PI. 60:8); a similar though smaller vessel was found at Gezer (Deveria/. 1986: Fig. 49:6). Pl. 62:2-3 are bowls with everted rims, a stylistic feature related to Late Bronze Age Egyptian-type bowls (see Chapter 2); they also appear in the cemetery of Deir el-Balah (T. Dothan 1979: 55, Ills. 126-27) and at Ashdod (Dothan and Porath 1993: Fig. 33:7-8, Stratum XII). PI. 62:4-6 are small open bowls with a variety of rim styles ranging from thick (PI. 62:4) through hammerhead (PI. 62:5) to slanting and everted (PI. 62:6); PI. 62:4 is paralleled at Ashdod (Dothan and Porath 1982: Fig. 6:5, Stratum 10b) and all three are typical of Iron Age I. PI. 62:7 is a triangular thick rim, strikingly everted, from a large flat bowl; like PI. 62:2-3, it fits into and continues the Egyptian- type repertoire. PI. 62:8 is a large bowl with a slight hammerhead. PI. 62:9, a flat bowl base, is typical of Iron Age I and but also very prominent in our Late Bronze Age repertoire (see Chapter 2). 148</page><page sequence="151">IRON AGE I POTTERY Chalices Chalices are a well-known feature of Iron Age I . PI . 62: 10 is a carinated chalice typical of the period at sites such as Tell Qasile (Mazar 1985: Fig. 43:22, Stratum X). Cooking Pots PI. 62:11 is a wide-mouthed cooking pot with an elongated rim typical of Iron Age I; a similar vessel, though more sharply carinated, was found at Ashdod (Dothan and Porath 1993: Fig. 17:3, Stratum XIIIB). PI. 62:12, a cooking pot with narrow neck and everted rim, may have had handles. Jugs PI. 62:13 is a white-slipped jug or jar whose elongated neck and shortened body may identify it as body Type 1 2 in the Philistine pottery repertoire, i.e., the Egyptian-style jug, which is characterized by a tall, slightly bulging neck (T. Dothan 1982: 172-85). It is possible that this vessel falls within the standard Philistine types. This vessel type often bears a lotus decoration on the neck. The vessel from Deir el-Balah has no painted decoration and the analogy here is based on the ware, finish and outline of the vessel, which was found with a group of Philistine pottery in this pit. This vessel is also one of the few closed vessels appearing among the Philistine pottery at the site, in which open bowls predominate. Jars and Storage Jars PI. 62:14-15 are the rims and necks of jars. PI. 62:14 is paralleled at Gezer (Gitin 1990: Fig. 3:1) and PI. 62:15 at Gezer (Dever et al. 1986: Pl. 46:7) and at Tell Qasile (Mazar 1985: Fig. 17:5, Stratum XII). PI. 62:16, with its thickened rim, is typical of the large storage jar of Iron Age I, e.g. at Gezer (Deverei al. 1986: Pl. 42:9). Pl. 62: 17, a flat base, may belong to a large jar. Egyptian-type Vessels PI. 62: 1 8-20 continue the Late Bronze Age tradition and are reminiscent of Egyptian-type groups encountered in large quantities in the previous levels (see Chapter 2). PI. 62:18 is an ovoid or funnel-necked jar, PI. 62: 19 a globular jar and PI. 62:20 the base of a beerbottle. Local Imitation of Base Ring Ware PI. 62:24 is the base of a local wheelmade copy of Cypriot Base Ring II ware, a common type in Late Bronze Age levels in the settlement as well as the cemetery. This vessel, the only such example found in the assemblages of these pits, may represent contamination from earlier levels. Varia Pl. 62:21 is the perforated button base of ajar. PI. 62:22-23 are handles of storage jars that bear finger or thumb indentations. PIT 526 (PI. 63:1-7) A mixed group of pottery ranging from the Late Bronze Age to Iron Age I comes from Pit 526, which cut into the Stratum IX quarry-pond. The two White Slip milk bowls (PI. 63:6-7) may represent contamination from a previous level (see above). PI. 63:1 is an open shallow bowl similar in type to that illustrated in PI. 62:1 . PI. 63:2-3 are Type 1 Philistine bell-shaped bowls: PI. 63:2 is a rather delicate bowl with traces of spiral decoration, and PI. 63:3 is the white- slipped rim of a similar bowl but has no traces of decoration. PI. 64:4-5 may be rims and necks of globular jars (see Chapter 2, Figs. 2.3:5 and 2.3:2 respectively). Both are Egyptian types and may either be intrusive or continue the tradition of earlier periods at Deir el-Balah. PI. 63:5 finds a parallel at Tell Qasile (Mazar 1985: Fig. 27:10, Stratum XI). PIT 421/424 (Pis. 63:8-20; 64) This pit, whose western outline was well defined but whose eastern edge was reconstructed, was identified in the baulks left after the excavation of four squares. The pit itself was cut by an Iron Age II pit (Locus 1114, Stratum II). 149</page><page sequence="152">CHAPTER NINE PHILISTINE POTTERY Bowls and Kraters A proportionately large amount of Philistine pottery was found in this pit. Types include the typical bell- shaped bowls and kraters and a few closed vessels, primarily jugs. PI. 63:8-10 are Type 1 bell-shaped bowls with white slip and band decoration; PI. 63:9 is paralleled at Ashdod (Dothan 1971: Fig. 1:8, Stratum 13a). PI. 63:11-14, also Type 1 bowls, are decorated with antithetical spirals (T. Dothan 1982: 206, Fig. 66:2-6). At Tell Qasile parallels occur to PI. 63: 1 1 (Mazar 1985: Fig. 29: 16, Stratum XI) and PI. 63: 13 (Mazar 1985: Fig. 13:3, Stratum XII). PI. 63:15-18 are kraters, varying in size and shape of rim . PI . 63 : 1 5 , a krater of intermediate size , has traces of spiral decoration and a pronounced rim bordering on hammerhead. PI. 63: 16 has a splayed hammerhead rim, a slightly rounded body shape and traces of a lightly applied spiral. On the whole this krater is unusual and diverges from the normal type both in shape and in the manner in which the decoration is drawn; its shape is paralleled at Tell Qasile (Mazar 1985: Fig. 16:20, Stratum 12). PI. 63:17, with a slanting rim, ribbed neck, and rounded body, is another unusual type; it seems to be a hybrid shape that has a debased Philistine (or hybrid Canaanite-Philistine) decoration executed in black paint on white slip, and finds a parallel at Ashdod (Dothan and Porath 1993: Fig. 24:1, Stratum XIII). PI. 63:18 is a krater rim, paralleled at Ashdod (Dothan and Porath 1993: Fig. 27:5, Stratum XII) and at Tell Qasile (Mazar 1985: Fig. 16:25, Stratum XII). Jugs PL 63:19-20 are body fragments most likely of Philistine jugs, i.e., closed vessels with heavy white slip and bichrome decoration. PI. 63:19 has spirals separated by a metope design made up of dotted half-circles and horizontal lines (T. Dothan 1982: 21 1 ,Fig. 69:3). PI. 63:20, possibly a beer-jug, bears a combination of semicircles with herringbone design and black and red filling (T. Dothan 1982: 181, PI. 87; 210, Fig. 68:5-6); it is paralleled at Tell el-Far' ah South (Petrie 1930: PI. LXIII:43). Bases PI. 64: 1 is a ring base from a small, closed vessel, possibly a jug, stirrup jar or feeding bottle. PI. 64:2-5 are bases of bowls, most probably belonging to Type 1 . All these bases are typical of Philistine pottery in the finish of the base ring and its shape. PLAIN WARES Bowls PI. 64:6 is a small deep bowl; the rim is flat with red band decoration and slight incisions were made below the rim on the exterior of the bowl. It is paralleled at Gezer (Dever et al. 1986: Pl. 45:13). Pl. 64:7-8 are carinated bowls (T. Dothan 1982: 266, Fig. 8:7); a similar bowl to Pl. 64:8 occurs at Tell Qasile (Mazar 1985: Fig. 29:3, Stratum XI). PI. 64:9 is a heavy rim of a hammerhead bowl, paralleled at Tell Qasile (Mazar 1985: Fig. 28:31, Stratum XI) and at Ashdod (Dothan and Porath 1993: Fig. 32: 1 1-15, Stratum XII). The large bowls in PI. 64:10-12, with their variety of rim profiles, have affinities to the Late Bronze Age tradition at the site. PL 64: 10 is a profiled rim of a large, heavy open bowl (see Chapter 2, Fig. 2.1:13). PL 64:11 is a profiled rim of a large open bowl (see Chapter 2, Fig. 2.1:14), paralleled at Gezer (Gitin 1990: PL 4:6). PL 64: 12 is a stepped rim of an open bowl (see Chapter 2, Fig. 2.1:16-17). Cooking Pots PL 64:13 is an open, wide, elongated triangular rim from a typical Iron Age I cooking pot. Similar examples come from Tell Qasile (Mazar 1985: Fig. 27:20, Stratum XI) and Gezer (Dever et al. 1986: PL 45:20). Flasks Pl. 64:14 is a body fragment from a flask bearing concentric red line decoration, paralleled at Ashdod (Dothan and Porath 1993: Fig. 32:11-15, Stratum XII) . This style is typical of Iron Age I and continues the Late Bronze Age tradition (see Chapter 4). 150</page><page sequence="153">IRON AGE I POTTERY Storage Jars PI. 64:15-16 are fragments of storage jars, the former an indented handle and the latter a thickened, slightly profiled rim. Beerbottles PI. 64: 17 is the base of an Egyptian-style beerbottle sites as well (see Chapter 2). SUMMARY The Philistine pottery appearing in Pit 421/424 belongs to a rather advanced, debased stage in the Philistine pottery chronology (T. Dothan 1982: 27-28) rather than to the elaborate initial phase. The Type 1 bowls are a good diagnostic group and fit well into the Philistine pottery repertoire. From their outline and vestigial horizontal handles they may be dated to the late 12th and early 11th centuries BCE. The kraters show a variety of rims that diverge from the original Type 1 Philistine krater. This is seen not only in their outline but in their rather unusual decoration. On the whole, the picture derived from the Philistine and local pottery found in this pit is of a complex typology that fits well into the framework of the second half of the 12th through the first half of the 11th centuries BCE. The Philistine pottery and the local coarse ware accompanying it continue the Egyptian tradition of the site as well as some of the Canaanite elements of the Late Bronze Age. In the undisturbed loci there was no trace of imports, either Mycenaean or Cypriot. There may perhaps have been a gap between the end of the Late Bronze Age settlement (ca. 1200 BCE) and the following phase. REFERENCES Dever, W.G. et al. 1986.

Fig. 10.1 presents red-slipped and burnished sherds deriving mainly from the wadi of Stratum I, while Fig. 10.2 presents plain ware from wadi loci. These are augmented by pottery from two stratified Stratum II pits (PL 65). RED-SLIPPED BURNISHED WARE (Fig. 10.1) The fragments shown in Fig. 10.1 attest to the red-slipped ware that was common in the region during the llth-lOth centuries BCE. Those from wadi loci may have been carried from an Iron Age II site in the near vicinity. Taken as a group, the red-slipped and burnished pottery represents a rather large assemblage and spans a wide chronological range, starting at around the middle of the 11th century and continuing into the 10th, and possibly even later. Shapes representative of the debased Philistine pottery are discussed first, as this was the first group to discontinue the use of white slip and bichrome decoration and adopt red slip and burnish. Fig. 10.1:1-4 are bell-shaped bowls. Fig. 10.1:1 is still very close in outline to the Philistine prototype. The horizontal handles are vestigial, unlike the more pronounced handles of the prototypes. Such examples are of great importance because they continue the tradition of the pottery seen in the Philistine pits of Stratum III, and provide the basis for our assumption that there was continued occupation at Deir el-Balah in the Iron Age I. For parallels to this first group, bell-shaped * This chapter has not been updated. bowls, the pottery from Ashdod Strata IX-X and Tell Qasile Stratum X is especially instructive. It should also be noted that at Tel Miqne-Ekron Stratum IVA (second half of the llth-early 10th centuries BCE), the debased forms and decoration of Philistine pottery still appear, though red-slipped wares are dominant. This stratum, currently in press, offers a variety of close parallels to the red-slipped burnished wares of Deir el-Balah. In all these cases we perceive changes in technique: though some Philistine shapes such as the bell-shaped bowl continue, white slip and painted decoration are on the wane and red slip and sometimes irregular hand burnish are introduced. These diagnostic features point to an uninterrupted sequence in the 1 2th- 1 1th centuries BCE at Deir el-Balah. Fig. 10.1:1 (Photo 10.1) is a complete bell- shaped bowl with vestigial horizontal handles. It is red-slipped and hand-burnished on the interior and exterior. Parallels come from Ashdod, Area G, Strata XI-X (M. Dothan 197 1 : Fig. 74:2-3) and Tel Sippor (T. Dothan 1982: 49, Fig. 6). Photo 10.1.

The bowl is large, and the slant of the rim is reminiscent of krater types. Parallels come from Ashdod, Area C (Dothan and Freedman 1967: Fig. 33:8) and Hazerim (Gophna 1966: Fig. 4:7). Fig. 10.1:3-4 are related to the bell-shaped bowls, though the handles are not preserved. Fig. 10.1:3 is a bell-shaped bowl which is red-slipped on the interior and exterior and has an irregular hand burnish. It is paralleled by a vessel from Tell Qasile, Stratum X (Mazar 1985: Fig. 43:15). Fig. 10.1:4 is a bell-shaped bowl rim, red-slipped on the interior and exterior with an irregular hand burnish. Fig. 10.1:5 is a large platter-shaped bowl with vestigial horizontal handles. It has an uneven red slip and possible traces of burnishing. No close parallel was found to this unusual shape, though a somewhat similar vessel comes from Hazerim (Gophna 1966: Fig. 4:11). Fig. 10.1:7 is a simple curved bowl with a slightly thickened rim. It has a red slip on the interior and exterior and an irregular hand burnish. It is paralleled at Gezer (Gitin 1990: PI. 10:19). Fig. 10:1:6, 8 are bases related to the hand- burnished bowls. Fig. 10.1:6 is a low ring base from a fairly large open bowl. It bears traces of red slip on the interior and exterior and faint traces of burnish. It is paralleled at Ashdod, Area M , Stratum Xb (Dothan and Porath 1982: Fig. 1:10) and at Lachish, Stratum V (Aharoni 1975: Fig. 41:7). Fig. 10.1 :8 is the ring base of an open vessel, red-slipped on the interior. A parallel comes from Gezer (Gitin 1990: PI. 8:14). Fig. 10.1:9-12 are bowl rims with bar handles of different types. Fig. 10.1:9 is a small everted ridged bowl rim with remains of a horizontal bar handle. It is red-slipped on the interior and exterior, with an irregular hand burnish on both interior and exterior. The handle appears to be of the type of elongated bar handle ending in a knob at each end, also found at Ashdod, Area D, Stratum VIII (M . Dothan 1 97 1 , Fig . 37 : 1 4) . Fig . 10.1:10 is a small rounded bowl with a slightly inturned rim and a portion of a horizontal handle (possibly a bar handle). It bears traces of red slip and burnish on the exterior and rim. A similar though much larger vessel comes from Ashdod, Area D, Stratum VIII (Dothan and Freedman 1967: Fig. 37:8). Fig. 10.1:11 has a small bar handle with three knobs; it is red-slipped and hand-burnished. Parallels to this type are found on small, shallow bowls (Type 13, T. Dothan 1982: 185, PI. 19) and at Ashdod, Area C (Dothan and Freedman 1967: Fig. 33:6) and at Tell Qasile, Strata XII and XI (Mazar 1985: Figs. 12:10, 18:22). Fig. 10.1:12 is a large, straight-sided bowl with a flattened, internally stepped rim and an unusual large, horizontally pierced bar handle. It has red slip on the exterior and partially on the interior and is not burnished. Fig. 10.1:13, a medium-large rounded bowl with a slightly everted rim, has a heavy red slip and is wheel-burnished on the interior and exterior. Parallels are found at Tell Qasile, Stratum XI (Mazar 1985: Fig. 10.24:7). Fig. 10.1:14 is similar in shape to Fig. 10.1:13, though it has a more flattened rim. It too bears a heavy red slip and wheel burnish on the interior and exterior. A similar vessel was found at Tell Qasile, Stratum XI (Mazar 1985: Fig. 10.22:14). Fig . 1 0 . 1 : 1 5 is a carinated bowl with a thickened , out-turned rim. It has faint traces of red slip and burnish on the interior and exterior.

Fig. 10.1:20 is a medium-sized bowl with a ridged profile and a light red slip on the interior and exterior, which may have been burnished. It is paralleled at Ashdod, Area G, Strata X-IX (Dothan and Porath 1993: Fig. 45:9). Fig. 10.1:21 is an unusual carinated bowl with an everted rim. It is red-slipped and wheel- burnished inside and out. A possible parallel comes from Tell Qasile, Stratum X (Mazar 1985: Fig. 45:11). Fig. 10.1:22 is a small, everted carinated bowl with red slip on the interior and exterior. The slip is burnished on the exterior. Parallels come from Tell Qasile, Stratum X (Mazar 1985: Fig. 44:3) and from Gezer (Gitin 1990: PI. 32:26; it seems larger than the Deir el-Balah bowl, though the exact diameter of the latter is unknown). Fig. 10.1:23 is a ridged bowl rim with self slip and wheel burnish on the rim and exterior. Parallels are known from Ashdod, Area C (Dothan and Freedman 1967: Fig. 33:5) and Tell Qasile, Stratum X (Mazar 1985: Fig. 46:3).

Fig. 10.1 : 29 is a krater rim with an inturned rim and straight sides. It is red-slipped and burnished on the interior and exterior. It is paralleled at Tell Qasile, Stratum IX (Mazar 1985: Fig. 53:12) and at Gezer (Gitin 1990: PI. 11:2). Fig. 10.1:30 is a handle and rim from a krater or other large, open vessel. The rim is hammerhead in shape and the handle is finger-indented. It is red-slipped and hand-burnished on the interior and exterior. A similar vessel was found at Tell Qasile, Stratum IX (Mazar 1985: Fig. 53:15). Fig. 10.1:3 1 is a jug handle and rim with a simple profile and red slip and burnish on the exterior. Fig.l0.1:32isajug handle with a heavy red slip and three painted black lines. It has possible traces of burnish. Knobs on each side of the handle, below the rim, are imitations of rivets on metal vessels. A parallel comes from Gezer (Gitin 1990: PI. 9:13). PLAIN WARE (Fig. 10.2) An additional five unslipped sherds, all common Iron Age forms, were apparently also carried down in the wadi flow from the Iron Age settlement somewhere near the site of Deir el-Balah. Fig. 10.2:1 is a cooking pot rim with an inturned flange. Fig. 10.2:2 is an inturned heavy-rimmed krater rim with a carinated body. Fig. 10.2:3 is a high-necked krater with a hammerhead rim. Fig. 10.2:4 is a simple hammerhead krater rim. Fig. 10.2:5 is a ridged rim sherd with an interior flange; the sherd is too small for the diameter to be established.

Killebrew The ceramic repertoire presented in Figs. 11.1-2 and Photos 11.1-2 is a representative sample of Roman and Byzantine sherds discovered at Deir el-Balah, either from the fill of the wadi (Stratum I), which cut through the Late Bronze strata, or from topsoil loci. The latest material found in these loci was Byzantine, thus indicating a late or post- Byzantine date for the filling up of the wadi bed and subsequent covering of the site by sand dunes. It should be stressed that no Roman or Byzantine architectural remains were found at the site and that the material found in the wadi bed was clearly It should be noted that this manuscript was first submitted to Professor Trude Dothan two decades ago. At that time, little had been written regarding the storage jars termed here "Gaza" storage jars. Following its submission, copies of my manuscript were circulated to scholars dealing with research on Gaza wines and storage jars of the Byzantine period (see e.g. Mayerson 1985; 1992). As a result, my unpublished work has been quoted and these storage jars have entered several published works as "Killebrew Type A" and "Killebrew Type B" or Types A and B (see e.g. Stager 1991: 52-53; Mayerson 1992: 76-80, who referred to them as the gazition [my Type A] and the askalônion [my Type B]; Kingsley 2002: 26-27; Sibella 2002: 12; Gadot and Tepper 2002-2003: 143). Thus, I have selectively updated this chapter to reflect the more recent publications that have appeared since I originally submitted my typology of the Gaza storage jars from Deir el-Balah. The discussion of other pottery types that are ubiquitous during the Roman and Byzantine periods has not been updated. washed in from a nearby Roman and/or Byzantine site. Consequently, our selection of sherds was based solely upon typological considerations and does not necessarily reflect their relative quantities or location on the site. Only a few sherds dating from the Roman period were recovered in the fill of the ancient wadi bed (Fig. 11.1:2 is a low ring base belonging to a terra sigillata plate). The vast majority of the pottery was Byzantine in date. Two fragments of open cooking pots or casseroles were recovered. These casseroles were a popular form in the Byzantine period, spanning the 5th to 7th centuries CE (see e.g. Birger 1981: 75-76, PI. 12:12 and references there). This open vessel, often accompanied by a lid, was used for cooking steamed food such as vegetables, fish and meat. The casserole and lid were formed as one vessel and, when the clay was leather hard, the lid was cut at an angle from the bottom half of the casserole. This explains why the casserole's rim slants inward (e.g. Fig. 11.1:1, 3), while the lid's rim slants outward (e.g. Fig. 11.1:4) (Haaretz Museum 1978: 64, 67). Fig. 11.1:3 includes the horizontal handle typical of this type. A lid that was used with this type of open cooking pot is presented in Fig. 11.1:4. By far the most numerous Byzantine ceramic type evident in the wadi fill is the so-called "Gaza" amphora or storage jar (Figs. 11.1:5-19, 11. 2; Photos 11.1-2. These storage jars make up approximately 90% of the Byzantine pottery repertoire recovered from Deir el-Balah. Also termed "Late Roman Amphora 4" (Carthage: Hayes 1976: 11 7) or "Late Roman Amphora 3" (Benghazi: Hayes 1992: 64-65, Type 6), these jars have been discovered in contexts of the 4th to 7th centuries throughout the 163</page><page sequence="164">CHAPTER ELEVEN Fig. 11.1.

However, they are most common in the southern coastal plain of Palestine. On the basis of this evidence and a limited pétrographie examination of these sherds, John Riley was the first 164</page><page sequence="165">ROMAN AND BYZANTINE POTTERY Fig. 11.1. Roman and Byzantine pottery. 165</page><page sequence="166">CHAPTER ELEVEN Fig. 11 .2. Gaza storage jars Types A and B: Type Al (after Zemer 1977: No. 49); Type A2a (after Zemer 1977: No. 50); Type A2b (after Zemer 1977: No. 51); Type B1 (after Zemer 1977: No. 53); Type B2 (after Zemer 1977: No. 52). to suggest the Gaza region as the possible origin of these amphorae (Riley 1975: 30). Bringing together the literary sources of the 5th and 6th centuries, he proposed that these storage jars contained the famous "Gaza" wine that was exported from the port cities of the southern coastal region to sites throughout the known Byzantine world (for a summary of the sources relevant to this issue, see Riley 1975: 30, n. 20; Landgraf 1980: 82; Mayerson 1992). Though only fragments of these storage jars were recovered at Deir el-Balah, the group can be subdivided into two types on the basis of the general shape, rim profile and base of complete examples from other sites in the area (Fig. 11.2). (It should be noted that all sherds presented in Fig. 11.1:5-14 were of two-handled amphorae, though the handles were not always preserved.) The first group, Type A, is cylindrical in shape with narrow shoulders and either a short upright rim (Type AI ; Fig. 1 1 .1:7-8) or a simple rim that slants inward and is either thickened or resembles a "hole mouth" (Type A2a and A2b; Figs. 1 1.1:5-6). The base tapers either to a point (Type A2b) or to a slightly flattened bottom (Type A2a; Fig. 11.1:18-19). Accretions of clay remain on the neck and shoulders of the vessel. 166</page><page sequence="167">ROMAN AND BYZANTINE POTTERY Photo 11.1. Storage jar handles. Photo 1 1 .2. Storage jar body sherds. 167</page><page sequence="168">CHAPTER ELEVEN This type is ribbed, the ribbing beginning at the lower extension of the handle or just below (Fig. 11.1:8). One subtype of this group includes very fine incised parallel lines encircling the storage jar, approximately two-thirds from the top of the amphora. Type A is taller and narrower than Type B , averaging ca. 70-85 cm in height; it has a capacity of ca. 25-26.5 liters. It is found in contexts of the 5th-7th centuries CE but may continue into the 8th century CE (see e.g. Reynolds 2005: 574-575; see Egloff 1977: 116-117 and Arnon 2007: 63 for 8th-century contexts). P. Mayerson (1992) has identified Type A as the gazition , the container for the famous Gaza wines (and a wide variety of other products) mentioned in Byzantine period sources and inscriptions. The second type, B (Fig. 1 1 .1:9-15), has much broader shoulders with vertical loop handles applied at the highest point of the shoulder, over the ribbing. The rim is low and vertical with a square or slightly rounded profile, some nearly holemouth in form. The vessel is barrel-shaped with a rounded base (Fig. 11.1:16-17). Type B is shorter and broader, averaging 40-55 cm in height, with a capacity of ca. 9-16 liters, and is the more prevalent type at Deir el-Balah. Two sub-types can be identified: Type B 1 is broader and shorter with a rounded base, while Type B2 is narrower and slightly elongated with a flattened base. P. Mayerson (1992) has identified Type B as the askalônion , a container also mentioned in contemporary written sources and inscriptions. Although it has been suggested that Type B is earlier in date than Type A (see e.g. Majcherek 1995; Oked 2001 : 235; Reynolds 2005: 574-575), this is questionable due to the appearance of Types A and B together among wasters associated with late Byzantine potters' workshops (see e.g. Gadot and Tepper 2002-2003 and below). During the last few decades, storerooms filled with these jars and more than two dozen potters' workshops that produced them have been surveyed or excavated. At the nearby coastal site of Umm al- Hajar, rooms filled with these storage jars, apparently awaiting shipment, were found (V. Tzaferis, personal communication). At the site of 'Ard el-Mihjar just south of Ashkelon, a storeroom filled with dozens of Type A storage jars was excavated in 1996 (Fabian and Goren 200 1 ) . This storeroom was revealed after heavy flooding and collapse of a sand dune that had buried the site; one can only speculate about the number of storerooms filled with Gaza storage jars and potters' workshops currently buried under the post-Byzantine period dunes that cover large swaths of the southern coast of Palestine. An increasing number of kilns and potters' workshops associated with the production of these storage jars have been excavated or surveyed in the southern coastal plain. As early as the 1970s, several kiln waster sites near Tell Jemmeh produced large numbers of wasters belonging to our Type A, demonstrating that potters of this area were producing these amphorae in large numbers (Schaeffer 1979: 219). Interestingly, very few of these sherds were discovered in domestic household dumps of settlements in this region, indicating that the potters of Type A storage jars were primarily supplying the exporters of local produce (perhaps wine) and only to a much lesser degree providing for local households (Schaeffer 1979: 177,219). In recent years, numerous additional potters' kilns and workshops that produced Types A and B Gaza storage jars have been surveyed or excavated. Large heaps of wasters, sometimes standing five to ten meters above the surface, often mark the presence of potters' kilns and workshops (see e.g. Gibson et al. 1998: 322). At Khirbet Baraqa, located east of Ashdod Yam, salvage excavations uncovered a pottery workshop and pits filled with Gaza storage jar wasters (Rand 2000; Van den Brink 2000; Gadot and Tepper 2002-2003). Recently, a number of kilns have been documented at Ashdod (Baumgarten 2000), Ashkelon (Israel 1995a: 105; 1995b) and its environs (Johnson and Stager 1995), Nir'am Junction (Schuster 2000) and in the Lachish region (Israel 1993). Pétrographie studies of the wares of these jars by Y. Goren (Fabian and Goren 2001) provide additional confirmation that they were produced at workshops in Israel's southern coastal plain. These jars have also been found in association with wine presses near Ashkelon (Israel 1995a: 168</page><page sequence="169">ROMAN AND BYZANTINE POTTERY 102, 105; 1995b; Nahshoni 1999; Kogan-Zehavi 1999 [note the abundance of Type B storage jars]). Pitch found on the interior walls of numerous sherds belonging to both Types A and B at Deir el-Balah, a feature often observed on these vessels at other sites, hints at the use of these jars as wine containers (see e.g. Kingsley 2002: 26). Subsequent residue studies from the interior bases by P. McGovern have indicated that resined wine was stored in these jars (Fabian and Goren 2001: 213-215). A final note should be made of depictions of Gaza storage jars on mosaic pavements. On a 6th-century mosaic floor located in the fields of Kibbutz Kissufim, a man holding grapes is leading a camel laden with cylindrical storage jars, presumably containing wine (Cohen 1980; 1993: 279). In a mosaic in the Church of St. Stephen at Horvat Be'er Shema, a Gaza storage jar appears between grape clusters (Gazit and Lender 1993: 276). REFERENCES Arnon, Y. 2007.

Neutron Activation Analysis has confirmed that these coffins are of local origin (Perlman et al. 1973: 147-51). They were made by skilled craftsmen and are representative of the pervasive Egyptian culture of the site. Coffin fragments 1-9 represent portions of lids whose features are analogous to those found in the Deir el-Balah cemetery (Dothan 1979: 129-46). Nos. 1-3 are fragments of facial features; 4-7 are fragments of arms, hands or wigs; and 8-9 are the lower edges of lids with evidence of the string-cutting technique used in their manufacture. Nos. 10-13 are pieces of coffin bases with slight protuberances indicating feet or flared edges. Most of the coffin fragments from the settlement (not all shown in Fig. 12.1) were found in the kiln areas of Loci 502 , 5 1 2 , 523 and 1313. Also found in Kiln 512 were numerous fragments of tabun ware which may represent secondary use of both coffin fragments and tabun material in the functioning of the kiln. Fragment No. 7, found in Kiln 1313, has a clay accretion that was added after breakage. Another group of coffin fragments was found in Locus 1201, a water installation. This suggests that broken coffin ware was used for construction purposes as well. A circular coffin base perforated with holes before firing was fouiid in Kiln 512. This may be indicative of the kiln's use for firing anthropoid coffins. It has * This chapter has not been updated. been suggested that the circular base may represent the remains of a platform separating the firebox from the firing chamber of the kiln, although its diameter of approximately 43 cm. suggests that it is too small for this to have been its original use (Vol. 1 , Chapter 7; Killebrew 1989: 106).

Anthropoid coffin base, fragments, Locus 512 (PI. 37:16). Also noteworthy is the coffin fragment from Pit 1913 (No. 5), which bears traces of red pigment. Pit 1913 is thought to have been used in conjunction with Room E. Ochre and blue material, together with refuse from the surrounding industries, appear in the pit, and ochre was found in most of the surrounding rooms (see Chapter 26). LIST OF COFFIN FRAGMENTS (Fig. 12.1) 1 Nose fragment from topsoil Locus 502 above the Stratum V Kiln 512 (Photo 12.1). This finely modelled nose is of the naturalistic type, similar to that of the coffin found in Tomb 114 (Dothan 1979: 10). 2 Face fragment from Locus 1 935 , a Stratum V pit (Photo 12.2). While this fragment is somewhat difficult to define, it may be identified as an incised wig and a portion of either a brow or modelled eye. 3 Lid fragment from Kiln 1 3 1 3 of Stratum IV. This seems to be from the rounded top of a coffin lid and bears an incised groove that delineates the top of a face or wig. 4 Hand or wig fragment from Kiln 1313. A negative impression is evident on this piece. 5 Arm fragment from Locus 1913, a Stratum V pit; see discussion above (Photo 12.3). Part of an applied arm is attached and large portions of a string-cut lower edge are evident. 6 Hand or wig fragment from Kiln 1313. A negative impression appears. 7 Hand or wig fragment from Kiln 1313. The negative impression on this large sherd is more likely to be a hand than a wig, as no facial features are discernible. There is a steep carination under the hand. 8 Lid edge from Kiln 1313. The string-cutting is evident from the lines on the lower finished edge. 9 Lid edge from Kiln 1313. The lower edge of this coffin fragment shows indications of being string-cut on two faces. 10 Base fragment from Locus 523 , a topsoil locus above Ashpit 1 309 of Kiln 1313. While it is not easy to identify the bases of coffins, the heavy nature of this sherd and the interior contour indicate that it is the rounded lower edge of a flat coffin base. 11 Base fragment from Locus 523 . This base has a well-defined protuberance, possibly indicating the projection of two feet. 1 2 Base fragment from Locus 4 1 8 , a mixed locus . As in No. 11, the base protrudes outward. The upper edge is worn and tapers slightly. 1 3 Base fragment from Locus 5 1 1 , a mixed locus . In this base the curvature is discernible, though it is too fragmentary to provide an accurate diameter. The interior edge is inturned, but no evidence of a finished surface remains. 176</page><page sequence="176">ANTHROPOID COFFIN FRAGMENTS FROM THE SETTLEMENT REFERENCES Dothan, T. 1979.

Three are made of carnelian (Reg . No. 6062) and four of "Egyptian blue" dotted with traces of gold (Reg. No. 6063). "Egyptian blue" is similar in chemical composition to faience; it can be fired and ground as a pigment or finely powdered and mixed with water to be molded, dried and fired. "Egyptian blue" was made into beads, amulets and other small objects at an early period and was used more ambitiously in the New Kingdom. The many materials called "Egyptian blue" are not homogeneous and may contain quartz, calcite and sometimes colorants other than copper (Davies 1982: 159). Each cylinder was pierced through by a square aperture. Both the size of the pieces (each approximately 2.2 cm. high, with a diameter of about 2.4 cm.) and the nature of the aperture rule out their use as beads in a necklace. Rather, they should be reconstructed as the links of a scepter or flail with pieces of "Egyptian blue" alternating with carnelian, mounted on a rod. No trace of a rod was recovered, making it impossible for the excavation team to determine whether the cylinders had been mounted or were awaiting assemblage. On exhibit in the Brooklyn Museum are glazed cylinders of the same size with a square aperture, extremely similar to those found at Deir el-Balah. Purchased, their provenance is unknown; they are dated in the exhibit to the Ptolemaic period. It seems that they could be reconstructed as links of a scepter (Dr. A. Fazzini, oral communication). This chapter has not been updated. Scepters and flails, often depicted in Egyptian art, are extant in very few examples. As insignia of the god Osiris and symbols of authority, they were generally held only by rulers, chiefs and viziers. The scepter, a kind of pastoral staff held in the left hand of both the god Osiris and the king, takes the form of a short staff ending at the top in a bent crook and is made up of sections on a bronze core. The flail, a kind of whip known as nekhekhw , was the complement to the scepter and the second insignia of Osiris; it was held by both the god and the king in the right hand. It consists of a short handle, acutely bent at the top, to which are attached three "swingles" by a beaded thong Photo 13.1 . The cylinders. 179</page><page sequence="178">CHAPTER THIRTEEN Fig. 13.1 . The cylinders, reconstruction as a scepter and drawing of the inner third coffin of Tutankhamun. on wooden cores, enabling them to swing freely (Carter 1933: 77-78). Osiris, originally a deified pastoral chieftain who had been ritually slain, was identified as the God of the Dead with the judicial powers of the supreme judge, as well as the God of Fertility exercising control over the inundation of the Nile. He is represented as a king in his mummy wrappings, a herdsman's hood and flail, and two tall plumes on his headgear. The king, or ruler, was assimilated to Osiris in the hope of salvation for mortals (Aldred 1987: 36, 134-35). The closest parallel to this unique find came from the tomb of Tutankhamun, which contained a number of scepters and flails composed of alternating pieces of gold and dark blue glass, imitating lapis lazuli mingled with obsidian. They were found both in the hands on the anthropoid 180</page><page sequence="179">A SCEPTER OR FLAIL coffins and in boxes of equipment that Tutankhamun had used in his daily life and which had been buried along with him. Two sets of scepters and flails were recovered from Crate 269 (Murray and Nuttal 1963: 11; Aldred 1987). One of these sets had links of the same dimensions as the pieces from Deir el- Balah and bore a cartouche reading "Tutankhaten" rather than "Tutankhamun," indicating that the set was crafted early in Tutankhamun's life during the heyday of the Amarna age (Desroches-Noblecourt 1977: 86, 111. 104). A striking parallel to the Deir el-Balah find comes from Tutankhamun's inner third coffin (Desroches-Noblecourt 1977: 268, PI. LVI). The semiprecious stone and metal pieces were lacking from the flail, and only the metal rod upon which they would have been mounted remained. Remarkably, the rod is square in shape, identical to the apertures in the pieces found at Deir el-Balah, providing further confirmation that these cylinders should be reconstructed as belonging to a scepter or flail. Since such items are emblems of authority, the pieces from Deir el-Balah may indicate the presence there of a governor or administrator, and may imply that the building complex in which they were found was an administrative residence or governor's palace.

No. 2249; Fig. 14.1; Photo 14.1), found in Locus 1055 in the settlement, most probably belonged to a chest or box (Aldred 1955: 694). This is a mushroom-shaped knob with a perforated stem for attachment, made of a pink, well-polished stone and measuring 2.4 cm. in diameter and 2.1 cm. high. A similar knob made of gypsum, lacking its stem, was found in Tomb 1405 in the cemetery (Reg. No. 4001 ; Vol. I, Chapter 1 , Fig. 1.35:4). The earliest example of such a knob in Palestine, though it is made of wood rather than stone, was found amongst the furniture of a Middle Bronze Age tomb at Jericho. Although no inlaid box was fully reconstructed, the remaining evidence provided the general proportions and a guide to how the various wooden parts were held together. In Tomb H 18, a rectangular box was found. A hole, into which a wooden knob handle was fitted, was bored through the top edge of the end of the box. A similar knob was fitted into the lid (Fig. 14.2; Kenyon 1960: Fig. 230). Numerous pieces of bone inlay was found throughout the area of the tombs, and associated with them were the wooden knobs and corner posts that are typical features in the construction of boxes (Kenyon 1960: 533-34). Chests with similar knobs of wood and stone, dating from the XVIIIth Dynasty, are known from Egypt (Davies 1982: 200-203). These chests have been found with a variety of contents: cosmetic unguents, jewelry and objects of undefined significance. The chests vary in shape: rectangular, cylindrical with lids that swivel horizontally on a knob, and multi-compartmented chests with several * This chapter has not been updated. lids. The sizes of these chests also vary: 10-20 cm. in length, 5-8 cm. in height, and 6-10 cm. in width. These chests were usually made of inexpensive wood but were often inlaid with costlier woods, ivory or decorated bone. If we are correct in our supposition that the knob from Deir el-Balah belonged to a wooden chest, the wood has disintegrated, as has the stem that was inserted into the perforated knob and Fig. 14.1 . The stone knob. Photo 14.1 . The stone knob. 183</page><page sequence="181">CHAPTER FOURTEEN Fig. 14.2. Reconstruction of knob as the handle of a chest from Jericho. fitted into the side of the chest in the reconstruction suggested by Kenyon (1960: Fig. 230). The knob was a simple but effective device for closing and locking chests of this kind. A cord was lashed around a knob projecting from the lid and a corresponding knob on the body of the chest. A dab of wet clay, sometimes embossed with the owner's mark, was used to fasten the cords wound around the knobs. Several such chests were found in Tutankhamun's tomb, nearly all rectangular, some with flat lids, some with a triangular front flap, and some domed. Most were made of wood (a few of reeds) and had panels of painted ivory (Desroches-Noblecourt 1977: 84-87). The knobs were gold-plated. It is of interest that a knob was found in the cemetery at Deir el-Balah. This would indicate, if we are correct in our suggestion that it was the knob handle of a chest, that the burial gifts included wooden chests, a feature that is well known in both Canaan and Egypt. The knob found in the settlement may thus be connected with the manufacture of burial goods supplying the nearby cemetery, or may be an item of everyday use. REFERENCES Davies, W.V. 1982.

The blade, 7.4 cm. long and 2.9 cm. wide, has a slightly convex cutting edge in front. The shorter rear end curves upward away from the handle, its lower side concave. The blade was inserted into a slit in the handle and the attachment secured by metal riyets, which are barely visible, on the reverse. The handle is cylindrical in section with a rounded knob at the butt. After cleaning, two rounded protrusions appeared above the insertion of the handle and below the upper triangle of the blade. They resemble rivet heads but do not seem to have any practical function; they may be interpreted as a decorative feature. Adhering to the surface of the razor were traces of fabric, suggesting that the razor was laid in cloth wrappings, and possibly straw. The fabric is a linen cloth of tabby weave of the simple form, with single wefts over single warps. The threads are S-twisted. The flax fiber shows distinct cross-markings and nodes (Dothan 1979: 68). The exact mode of use of this razor is not clear. Petrie categorizes this type as a "rotating" razor, in which the razor rotated and the edge worked in a saw-like fashion (Petrie 1917: 50, PI. LXI). Razors of this type are known from Egypt, e.g., from Tell el- Amarna (Frankfort and Pendlebury 1933: 35, PI. 34), Buhen (Randall-Maclver and Woolley 1911: 154, PL 64) and Gurob (Petrie 1891: 18-19, Pis. XVIII, XIX), and date from the New Kingdom. * This chapter has not been updated. The name given to this razor was derived from the verb chak (to shave) (Davies 1982: 189, Pis. 220,221). This razor is often found together with the "multifunctional" razor and it seems that they Fig. 15.1 . The bronze rotating razor. Photo 15.1. The rotating razor. 185</page><page sequence="183">CHAPTER FIFTEEN were items in the same shaving kit, each with its own distinct function. Several razors of the "multifunctional" type were previously found at Deir el-Balah (Dothan 1979: 19,111. 34; 72,111. 157), and razors thus seem to be a standard element in the burial gifts in the tombs. Razors have a long history in Egypt, beginning in the late predynastic and protodynastic periods. The New Kingdom razor evolved from the predominant head-and-body razor toward the end of the Old Kingdom. There was a change in the shape of the blade, from parallel sides to splayed sides. During the Middle Kingdom a variant emerged, which had a protruding cutting edge. The New Kingdom razor has a longer protrusion, coupled with a separate haft of wood or metal. The basic form and composition of this razor, with its convex cutting edge at the end and its curved handle with a knob at the butt, appears to have remained more or less unchanged throughout the New Kingdom. This razor, which was named dega, has a flat, slender handle with a chisel-shaped butt at one end and a curved, cutting edge at the other. This edge curves back sharply into the neck to create a hook (Davies 1982: 190). In later periods, more elaborate forms were developed with curved hooks at the top and flared butts which became fully winged by the Ramesside period (Davies 1982: 192). There is no direct evidence as to how it was used, but it was probably intended for cutting and shaving of a kind requiring more precision than that achievable with the rotating razor (Davies 1982: 190). Because of its thinness, it agrees with the requirements of the needle used for papyrus splitting, according to Petrie (1917: 52, PI. LXV:58). BRONZE ARROWHEADS (Fig. 15.2:1^1) Arrows are made up of three parts, each made of a different material to suit its particular function. The arrowhead (the destructive part) is made of the hardest possible material - flint, bone or metal. The shaft of the arrow, which must be long, thin, hard, straight and light, is made of wood or reed. The tail is made of feathers. The attachment of the arrowhead to the shaft is of two types: if the base of the head is inserted into the shaft, the arrowhead is known as a tang; if the shaft is fitted into the base of the head, it is known as a socket. The effectiveness of the arrow is determined by the shape and structure of its head. The form is dictated by the nature of the defense and armor or by the purpose (Yadin 1963: 8-9); the difficulty is distinguishing between war heads and hunting heads. During the Late Bronze Age, arrowheads for battle were generally made of bronze, rather thick in the middle and with a rib, either protuberant or flat (Yadin 1963: 81). The distinguishing feature between javelin-heads and arrowheads is length: an overall length over 10 cm. defines the object as a javelin-head, while smaller objects are arrowheads. The dividing line between the two in blade length is 6 cm. (Yadin 1963: 19). The shape of the arrowhead is not necessarily a criterion for its dating, though certain shapes tend to dominate in certain periods. Characteristic of the Late Bronze Age I and II are long, narrow, oblanceolate and elliptical blades; lanceolate and ovate forms mark both Late Bronze Age and Iron Age I styles. The rib may be a significant element. A high rounded rib on an oblanceolate blade is characteristic of the Late Bronze Age, especially Late Bronze IIA (the Amarna Age) (Yadin 1963: 18). Sub-elliptical arrowheads with long, narrow tangs were clearly the standard of the Late Cypriot period in Cyprus, though there is much variety in the size of weapons, in the elliptical or rhomboidal section, the relative position of the widest point and the length of the tang (Catling 1964: 130). 1.

Square forms have the advantage of piercing larger holes. Some pins have a plain shaft, while others have an eyelet in the shaft. The pin may be regarded as the prototype of the borer. Most were used by hand, perhaps for pricking out stitch holes in leather work. These were mere expanders for forcing and enlarging holes in skins. Another interpretation may be as kohl sticks when they are found in terminal Late Bronze Age deposits, for these toilet aids are better attested after than before 1200 BCE. Pins with both square and rounded sections were found at Gurob and at the Ramesseum (Petrie 1891: 18, PL XVIII:36-37; Petrie 1917: 52-53). Photo 15.3. Bronze pins. 1. Reg.

The nearly parallel sides probably come to a blunt point at the head, which may have been inserted into a wooden handle. The cutting edge, which is very narrow, is perpendicular to the plane of the wider faces of the blade. The chisel was used for cutting and for levering out cut pieces. 1. Reg.

No. 6095, Locus 1392; Fig. 16.1a; Photo 1 6 . 1 a) is a piece of lead sheet forming a strip that is elongated and roughly pentagonal in shape. The strip appears to have been cast. It is 75 mm. long and 20.5-28.5 mm. wide, and weighs 57.71 g. The strip is no longer actually flat. Few stretches of its rim can definitely be said to be intact, though little actual damage is discernible except for the narrower end, where a corner appears to have broken away. The resultant loss of material perhaps amounts to 5% or ca. 2.9 g., so that the original mass of our object may have been ca. 60.5 g . Impressed into the surface of the strip is a large sign, formed by broad channels deeply sunk into the strip's obverse. The reverse shows some flattening, so that most of the sign's general shape appears in a kind of shadow. Furthermore, the strip is slightly bent where the stamp was struck into the material. One cannot but wonder why the sign was stamped so asymmetrically on the strip; or perhaps a larger sheet was stamped before the strip was cut out from it. An object is usually interpreted as a scale weight by calculating its mass as a number of hand units (e.g., shekel, old deben, kite, drachma) or by relating its mass to the number of hand units in a higher unit (e.g. mina, libra). However, it has been pointed out by Petruso (1978) that a weight step with a mass of "just 60 g.," intermediate between * This chapter has not been updated. the hand unit and the table unit, was used in the Aegean world. Petruso based his investigation on thirteen cast lead weights and eight stone weights, each with "simple markings of some sort which can be interpreted as indicators of value on a common system." He found marks for Vs, lh, V2, 1, 2, 4, 8, 12 and 24, with a mean of 61 .3 g . and a median of 61.5 g. The data given by Petruso, however, lend themselves to a more discriminating analysis resulting in a mass of over 63 g. Furthermore, while the shaping and adjusting of a stone weight must be done by taking a blank larger than the desired artifact and working material away from it by splitting, pecking and grinding, achieving the intended mass of a lead weight involves different steps. It may have been possible to weigh the raw material before melting and casting, though no evidence for such a process with respect to early weights is so far available. Lead is soft enough to be cut, pared or bored. The production of ancient lead weights does not appear to have been researched, and Petruso makes no comments on the production of the lead discs he studied. However, later lead weights from the Hellenistic period show features clearly intended to permit an adjustment to the intended weight standard. Such features are the remainder of the lead-filled casting channel which could be diminished or cut away altogether; the "ear" or "handle," which in casting came out as a lug on the weight's body but was often pierced, reducing it in shape (and mass) to a kind of loop; and the raised grid on the lead weight's reverse, with the fields 191</page><page sequence="189">CHAPTER SIXTEEN Fig. 16.1 . The marked lead strip (a) and the bronze scale weight or sling bullet (b). filled by a raised "dot" that could be pared off to lower gradually the mass of the cast product. None of these means of mass adjustment have so far been observed on the weights discussed by Petruso. In his study of Greek weights Petruso (1978: 42) found that in a later period one-eighth of a mina was very prominently represented among the weights with a half-crescent. He also found the actual mass of these pieces to be of widely varying Photo 16.1. The marked lead strip (a) and the bronze scale weight or sling bullet (b). gram value. However, he drew attention to the fact that identical signs and inscriptions appeared on pieces of widely varying mass. A tabulation of these Greek scale weights according to their frequency is given in Table 16.1 . The picture that emerges is one of a wide spread, with a peak in the group with a mass of 59-63 g. and a mean mass in this largest group of 61 .14 g. This picture appears to be fairly well in line with Petruso's conclusions for the earlier period. Such an intermediate weight step is not unknown elsewhere. More or less contemporary with or following this development in the Aegean world, other civilizations too introduced an intermediary weight step comprising a small number of the then current hand units. In Egypt weights of the "new deben" were introduced under the XVIIIth Dynasty; their mass (91 g.) was two-thirds of ten old deben (13.65 g. each) (Helck 1980: 1202). In Persia the ten-shekel step (81 .86 g. and 84.10 g.) came to the Table 16.1 . Greek scale weights according to frequency.

These developments appear to have come about as a consequence of developing silver production in the ancient Near East. However, no such change has so far been observed in the Bronze Age Levant. It was only later, under the Judean Kingdom, that the Egyptian "new deben" unit of 91 g. was adopted, with a division into eight Hebrew shekels of 1 1 .375 g. each. In view of these widespread developments in the same direction, Petruso's term "popular sub-unit of the mina" (Petruso 1978: 42) seems justified. The piece from Deir el-Balah bears the hieratic Egyptian numeral 10, which was also used by the Phoenicians (for the Phoenician numeral 10, see Schroeder 1869: 188, Pl. C; Euting 1885: 97; Lidzbarski 1898: Vol. 2, PI. 46). This indicates either "ten such pieces form one unit" (10 x 63.48 g. = 634.8 g.) or "this piece comprises ten units" (63.48 g. = 10 x 6.348 g.). Both equations point to the Egyptian standard of 636.7 g. = 50 x 12.734 g . = 100 x 6.367 g., originating in the Xllth Dynasty (Hultsch 1898: 6 ff., Ill ff., 117, 203). While it is not related to the mina standard to which the Aegean weights studied by Petruso appear to relate, our lead object appears from its absolute mass of 57.71 g. to belong to Petruso's type of "popular" scale weights. Considering all its unusual physical features on the one hand, and its approximate correspondence to the mass suggested for the Aegean intermediary weight step on the other, one cannot reject the possibility that this marked lead strip is a scale weight. However, a single artifact with questionable features is not an adequate basis for metrological generalizations about weighing practices at the site from which it derives. II. A BRONZE SCALE WEIGHT OR SLING BULLET The artifact (Reg. No. 3238, Locus 1230; Fig. 16.1b; Photo 16.1b) is made of cast bronze. It is 41.5 mm. long, 19.7 mm. wide and 14 mm. high; its extant mass is 39.29 g. In shape the artifact is reminiscent of a sling projectile. It bears little resemblance to a grain- shaped scale weight: there is no base and at each end of the long axis the body is formed into two sharp edges. There appears to be no spot on the surface where the casting funnel joined the hollow space in the mold, unless the small cavity on one side should be seen as the remnant of such a feature. Further, no part of the surface can be recognized as an area where, after casting, the mass of the object has been adjusted (by grinding down) to the desired weight standard, as is usual for stone and (later) lead weights. Of course, the cast product may have been found satisfactory without any adjustment. In respect of all this, it must be pointed out that the artifact had already been thoroughly cleaned and all corrosion cover been removed before this investigation was started: it is possible that the loss of metal from such cleaning amounted to 0.75-1 .5 g . In order to obtain additional information as to how the mold for its casting was made, the artifact was submitted to Henk Mienis of the Department of Evolution, Systematics and Ecology of the Hebrew University of Jerusalem. We were advised that the cast artifact appeared to have the form of the inner space of a bivalve mollusc of the family of Uniovidae. Which particular species had been used for making the casting mold could not be determined. One of these molluscs, Unio terminālis Bourguinat 1852, a freshwater species today confined to the Jordan River and the Sea of Galilee, once existed in the Hulah swamps and may have lived in other parts of Palestine. It is known from archaeological excavations that this species was collected as early as the Late Natufian period for its layers of mother-of-pearl as well as for food (Mienis 1987). Using a tentative estimate of ca. 40.8 g. as the original mass of our object, one could calculate this mass as 3 x 13.600 g., a unit comparable to one known from early Egypt and maintained for a long period (Hultsch 1898, based on Petrie's recoveries of scale weights in Egypt). However, in view of the absence of features characterizing a cast metal weight pointed out above, this comparison is most likely to be coincidental. 193</page><page sequence="191">CHAPTER SIXTEEN Could our artifact have been intended as a sling bullet? Slinging is known to have been practiced in Greece in the Mycenaean period; the projectiles were pebbles and shaped stones (Fouyeres 1896). Metal bullets as slingshots, mostly cast in lead, appear to have come into use in the Greek world from the 5th century BCE. Bronze bullets have been recovered only rarely. A shape with sharp edges at the end of the long axis has so far not been observed. The object thus appears to be unique, a local product made by an ingenious bronze caster.

FEMALE FIGURINES A variety of female figurines came to light in the settlement of Deir el-Balah. We have divided them into the following groups: A) reclining female figurines on stone plaques; B) clay plaque figurines in relief; C) clay molds and a figurine made from such a mold; and D) Ushabti figurines. A. RECLINING FEMALE PLAQUE FIGURINE MADE OF STONE 1. Reg. No. 308, Locus 502 (Fig. 17.1; Photo 17.1) Fragmentary reclining female figurine made of white limestone, 11.7 cm. high, 8.5 cm. wide and 2.3 cm. thick. It was found east of Kiln 512 on the surface of the Late Bronze Age settlement. This is the lower part of a reclining female figurine. Our fragmentary figurine, which has traces of red paint on the side, depicts a slender, nude young woman in a frontal pose with straight legs and with arms stretched alongside the body. The hands are exaggerated in length and have disproportionately large palms. The plaque is rectangular and is flat on the reverse side. A projection at the bottom of the plaque represents a footrest along which the feet of the figurine are extended, pointing forward, emphasizing her reclining posture, and indicating that this figurine belongs to the group of figures lying on beds, the so-called "concubine" figurines. The connotations and typology of this group are discussed in depth by Tadmor (1982: 145). This figurine is larger than, but otherwise identical to, the complete figure shown in Photo * This chapter has not been updated. 17.2 (Tadmor 1982: 141-44; Dothan 2008: 146, IMJ 70.1 13.459), which probably originates in the illegal diggings in the cemetery of Deir el-Balah. There is a striking similarity in the treatment of the body and in the shape of the plaque. The complete plaque depicts a reclining slender young woman, nude but for a necklace, depicted in a frontal pose with straight legs and with arms stretched alongside the body. There is a clear elongation of the arms and legs, and the palms are disproportionately large. The body is covered in red paint, except for the heavy, long, Egyptian-type wig, the necklace and the pubic triangle, which are painted black. The plaque is rectangular except for the slightly rounded head, and is flat on the reverse side. The bottom part represents a low footrest, along which the feet are extended, pointing forward. Another complete example in the Dayan collection most probably originated from the Deir el-Balah cemetery and definitely belongs to the same group of reclining figurines on beds (Ornan 1986: 24-25; Dothan 2008: 147, IMJ 82.2.950). It is identical in concept to our figurine but differs in the more rounded stylization of the body, face and wig. While most figurines in this group represent slender young women, this one portrays a fuller- figured and more mature woman. Judging by its stylistic features, this figurine should be dated to the beginning of Iron Age 1, 1200-1 100 BCE. These are the only known examples from Canaan of "concubine" figurines. They have parallels in Egypt from the New Kingdom, 1500- 1200 BCE (Tadmor 1982: 145). These figurines share a number of features. 1) They are invariably nude and depicted frontally. 2) The feet pointing forward indicate a supine position, a standard 195</page><page sequence="193">CHAPTER SEVENTEEN Fig. 17.1. Reclining female plaque figurine made of stone (No. 1). Photo 17.1. Reclining female plaque figurine made of stone (No. 1). artistic convention in antiquity; a standing figure, in contrast, is shown with feet pointing sideways or in opposing directions. 3) The plaque is interpreted as a bed with a footrest, either stylized as in our figurine or fully represented as in other examples. The absence of any divine attributes on these figures suggests that they represent humans. An association of the Deir el-Balah figurines with burial is demonstrated by their assumed presence Photo 17.2. Reclining female plaque figurine made of stone (IMJ 70.113.459) from illicit digging at Deir el-Balah. in the cemetery (this is also the case in Egypt; see Petrie 1891). This permits the hypothesis that they were in some way connected with funerary practices 196</page><page sequence="194">FIGURINES and customs. The fact that the plaque published here was found in the settlement of Deir el-Balah is of importance for its interpretation as an artisans' quarter producing funerary supplies for the nearby cemetery. Of great importance is the Egyptian background and character of these figurines, which provide an indication of the cultural and religious background of the inhabitants of Deir el-Balah. B. RECLINING FEMALE PLAQUE FIGURINES MADE OF CLAY 2. Reg. No. 589 A, Locus 543 (Fig. 17.2) Upper part of a reclining female plaque figurine, 10.3 cm. high, 6.6 cm. wide and 3.6 cm. thick. It was made in the open mold technique from light reddish-brown clay mixed with straw, with a grayish-brown core. The plaque is covered by a patina like that on the pottery from the crater fill. Only the upper half of the figurine was found. Judging by the rough contour of the plaque and the indistinct features of the face (the eyes and the mouth are incised), it is probable that this figurine was discarded before completion. The figure is depicted frontally: parts of the arms are visible, as well as the breasts, face and headdress. The figure wears a wig that falls straight down to just above the breasts and a conical cone on top of the wig. Fig. 17.2. Reclining female plaque figurine made of clay (No. 2). This cone is well known in Egyptian representations and is interpreted as a cosmetic cone, used for moisturizing and perfuming the hair and placed on the head in a lump. It frequently adorned the wigs of both men and women, as portrayed in paintings, reliefs and sculptures. From wall painting in tombs we know that it was not restricted to the nobility. Early in the XVIIIth Dynasty, it took the form of a low, semicircular lump that often had a bumpy outline. During the reign of Thutmose IV, the cone became larger and higher and assumed a tall, conical shape (Freed 1982: 199), like that depicted on these clay figurines from Deir el-Balah. 3. Reg. No. 205, Locus 464 (Fig. 173; Photo 173) Fragmentary reclining female plaque figurine with infant, 6.2 cm. high, 4.2 cm. wide and 2.3 cm. Fig. 17.3. Reclining female plaque figurine with infant made of clay (No. 3). Photo 17.3.

It was made in the open mold technique from reddish-yellow clay with a reddish-brown core. Only the lower torso of the figurine is preserved. It depicts a reclining nude female with part of her right hand. To her left, by her side, are what are most probably the feet of an infant. The plaque is rectangular and is flat on the reverse. The bottom is slightly rounded and shaped like a low footrest. The plaque itself, like the others found at Deir el- Balah, is disproportionately thick in comparison to the slender figure lying on it. The figure of the woman has apparently retained the characteristics of Egyptian-style small female statuettes of figures lying on beds: she is nude and is depicted frontally, her arm is held beside her body and her legs are outstretched with the feet on the footrest, pointing forward. In this category there are also depictions of more than one human figure, e.g. male and female or mother and child (Tadmor 1982: 145), as in our reconstruction of the plaque. C. CLAY FIGURINE MOLDS 4. Reg. No. 3903, Locus 1377 Upper (Fig. 17.4; Photo 17.4) Figurine mold, 19.7 cm. high, 7.7 cm. wide and 1.7-2.9 cm. thick, made from reddish-yellow clay mixed with straw, with a gray core. The top of the mold is arched and the bottom is straight. An incision on the reverse, made before firing, is possibly a potter's mark. The excavation of this figurine is shown in Vol. I, Photos 5.66-59. The head and body of the figure are depicted frontally. Minor anatomical details, such as the fingers and toes, are blurred. The figure is nude and there is almost no adornment on the body, apart from a pair of plain disk earrings and three Fig. 17.4. Clay figurine mold (No. 4). 198</page><page sequence="196">FIGURINES bracelets on each wrist, indicated by bars. The headdress comprises a wig which falls down to the shoulders in grooved steps. On the top of the head is a cosmetic cone. One arm is pressed against the flank and the other lies across the body below the breasts. The palms are disproportionately large. The legs are straight and set slightly apart and the feet point forward, indicating a supine position. 5. Reg. No. 6022, Locus 1348E Upper (Fig. 17.5; Photo 17.5) Figurine mold, 18.8 cm. high, 7 cm. wide and 1 .9-3 cm. thick, made from reddish-yellow clay mixed with straw, with a light brown core. The top of the mold is arched and the bottom more or less straight. The top left-hand corner is broken and cuts the head diagonally. There is an incision on the reverse side which is damaged owing to the broken corner. The head and body are depicted frontally and the fingers and toes are blurred. The figure is nude and there is almost no adornment on the body apart from three bracelets on each wrist, indicated by bars, as well as a pair of plain disk earrings, only one of which is visible owing to the broken corner. The headdress comprises a wig, as in the above-mentioned mold, as well as a cosmetic cone. The female figures depicted in both of these molds are identical. They were cast from the same die, though the molds themselves are of different sizes. These two molds were intended for modelling female plaque figurines of clay, of which one fragmentary mold-die or figurine was found (No. 6). 6. Reg. No. 2266, Locus 1056 (Fig. 17. 6; Photo 17.6) Die or figurine fragment, 5 .2 cm. high, 6.2 cm. wide and 2.5 cm. thick, made from pink clay mixed with straw, with a dark core. Photo 17.4. Clay figurine mold (No. 4). 199</page><page sequence="197">CHAPTER SEVENTEEN Fig. 17.5. Clay figurine mold (No. 5). Photo 17.5. Clay figurine mold (No. 5). 200</page><page sequence="198">FIGURINES The fragment shows part of the upper torso and belly and part of the left arm. The figure is depicted frontally. The body is nude and unadorned, apart from a suggestion of bracelets, indicated by bars, on the arm. This was possibly a die that was used for impressing a mold, or a discarded figurine cast from a mold. The molds found at Deir el-Balah were intended for the open mold technique typical of both Egyptian and Canaanite plaque figurines of the Late Bronze Age. This method enabled mass production to meet the large popular demand. The mold was covered with clay that was pressed in to fill the entire depression; the clay was then smoothed and squared off rather roughly and removed from the mold before firing (for discussions of molds and techniques seeTadmor 1982: 149; Ben-Arieh 1983: 72; Keim and Mazar 1995: 136-38). Numerous lumps of clay were found in the vicinity of the molds at Deir el-Balah; this area may thus be interpreted as a potters' workshop. It is commonly accepted that mold-made female plaque figurines originated in Mesopotamia and Iran at the end of the third millennium. They are also attested to in Syrian sites of the second millennium (Tadmor 1982: 164). Relatively few molds of this type dating from the Late Bronze Age have been found in Israel, compared to the large number of molded figurines and plaques that have been found in excavations. One mold was found in Stratum C at Tell Beit Mirsim; it was used for molding the relief "Astarte" figurines typical of the Late Bronze Age (Albright 1938: 69). At Gezer, Late Bronze Age figurines of nude females impressed in low relief on terracotta ritual plaques were found. With one exception, all had been formed in terracotta molds, a few of which were also found (Macalister 1912: Vol. II , 4 1 1 ). At Tel Qarnayim in the Beth-Shean Valley, a pottery mold dated to the Late Bronze Age was found on the surface of the mound. It is rectangular and is 15.5 cm. high, 9.5 cm. wide and 1 .9 cm. thick, with one of the lower corners missing (Ben-Arieh 1983: 72). At Lachish, two parts of molds and six impressions made from them were found, all dated to the Late Bronze Age and all depicting "Astarte" Fig. 17.6. Mold-die or figurine fragment (No. 6). Photo 17.6. Mold-die or figurine fragment (No. 6). figurines. Some of these were found in a potters' workshop, indicating that the figurines were made on the site (Tufnell 1958: 90). This type of female plaque figurine extended into the Iron Age and continued into the Persian period. Examples have been found at Tel Batash (Keim and Mazar 1 995 : 1 36-38) and Tel Dor (Stern 1994: 126). The plaque figurines and molds found at Deir el-Balah are apparently unique in their typology. They have no parallels in Canaan, but are rather 201</page><page sequence="199">CHAPTER SEVENTEEN Egyptian in style. The attitude of these figurines, their Egyptian-style wigs, the cosmetic cones (Davies 1982: 199-200), the lack of attributes and the position of the feet differ from all other plaque figurines found in Canaan and show a close affinity to Egypt, emphasizing the Egyptian character of the site. D. USHABTI FIGURINE 7. Reg. No. 475, Locus 501 (Fig. 17.7; Photo 17.7) Ushabti figurine, 8.9 cm. high, 4.4 cm. wide and 3.5 cm. thick, made from reddish-yellow clay mixed with straw, with a gray core. Fig. 17.7. Ushabti figurine (No. 7). Photo 17.7. Ushabti figurine (No. 7). Only the upper torso and the head are preserved, depicting a female figure with arms folded across her chest. She is wearing a plain wig that falls straight down to her shoulders, and she has no adornments of any kind. The top of the plaque is arched, following the contour of the figure's head, and is rounded at the back. A complete Ushabti figurine was found in illicit diggings in the cemetery of Deir el-Balah (Ornan 1986: 22; Dothan 2008: 148, IMJ 82.2.39). The figurine is painted black and yellow, with some traces of red on the upper half. It was probably made in the open mold technique, with a strip of clay attached to the back. Traces of the join between the two parts of the figurine are still visible. A deep incision on the back may be a potter's mark. The absence of an inscription, or of any tools in the hand, emphasizes the simplicity of the figure. Judging from the material from which it was made and from the low standard of workmanship, it probably dates to the XlXth Dynasty (13th century BCE). These figurines were originally called "Shabtiou," "Shabti" or "Shawabti." A slight modification in later periods led to "Ushabti." The name has been given various explanations: a) It stems from the word wsb, meaning "to respond"; the interpretation "she who shall respond" corresponds with the text calling the Ushabtis to work; b) There are connections with the word sbt, dubiously translated as "labor"; c) The name is derived from the word swb, meaning "persea wood"; these figurines were originally carved out of wood, possibly persea (Hayes 1953: 326). Ushabti figurines first appeared during the Middle Kingdom in Egypt as little mummiform statuettes of wax or mud, with the arms and legs concealed. Each clearly represents a fully bandaged mummy, wearing a long wig. This form, with few exceptions, remained standard for these figurines until their disappearance in Greco-Roman times. In the Xllth Dynasty, these wax or mud figurines were replaced by fairly large and well-carved mummiform statuettes made of wood and stone. The association of the deceased Egyptian with the god Osiris is suggested in these figurines by the Osirian pose, with the arms crossed 202</page><page sequence="200">FIGURINES under the wrappings, and by the prominent part played by Osiris and his wife Isis in the inscriptions on them. Their popularity and number increased during the Second Intermediate Period and the New Kingdom, when they were made of pottery, terracotta, faience and other materials, and were sometimes placed in coffins of their own. During the XVIIIth Dynasty, the Ushabti figurines still retained the salient characteristics of their predecessors. Relatively large in size, found in private burials, and still few in number, they had not entirely abandoned their original role as mummiform representations of their deceased owners. The spell written on them, however, makes it clear that their primary function was to substitute for their owners in the chores of the hereafter. In most instances the arms of the figurines are folded across the chest. In some of the more developed cases the hands hold hoes, axes, yokes or baskets. The growing demand for Ushabti figurines led to mass production of small molded figurines made of clay or other cheap materials. They were turned out in accordance with a few standard designs, and this led to a decline in the standard of craftsmanship. Published information on Ushabti figurines found in Israel is scanty. Examples were found in anthropoid coffin burials in the Northern Cemetery of Beth-Shean. These figurines are schematic, with pronounced wigs, hands and sometimes facial features. They are each about 9 cm high, with a dark core. The excavator, however, notes (without references) that similar figurines were also found among the residential material of Level VII at Beth-Shean, as well as at Tell el-'Ajjul (Oren 1973: 124). Information about three other Ushabti figurines dating from the XXVIth Dynasty has been published by Giveon (1974: 165-75). The provenance of only one (Arsuf) is known. These Ushabti figurines, which are scarce in Canaan, are extremely important pointers to the cultural and apparently ethnic background of the coffin burials in the Deir el-Balah cemetery. The small number of Ushabti figurines discovered in Israel, like that of other Egyptian funerary offerings, contrasts sharply with the abundant finds of other Egyptian objects from the second half of the second millennium BCE. This fact underlines the distinctive Egyptian concept of death, which required that an Egyptian be buried only within the boundaries of his own country. The discovery of Egyptian funerary objects at the very sites that were administrative centers in Canaan corroborates the assumption that the people buried in those cemeteries were Egyptians. II.

Zoomorphic figurine (No. 8). 203</page><page sequence="201">CHAPTER SEVENTEEN are incised lines in the shape of a triangle on the back. The animal depicted may be interpreted as a zebu (the ancestor of the domesticated cow). The zebu, the most common species of wild cattle in ancient times, appears in Assyrian, Egyptian and Canaanite depictions as a horned animal with a small hump on its back (Bodenheimer 1949: 80, 190, 208). On Egyptian evidence, the humped- backed zebu was an Asiatic import introduced after the Hyksos invasions, which assumed considerable importance in the New Kingdom (Carrington 1972: 70-71). The closest parallels come from Tell Jemmeh, where the richest collection of these solid terracotta, hand-modeled, humped animals was found, ranging from the Iron Age I to the Persian period (Holland 1975: 247-48, Pis. 18-21). These are no doubt crudely represented humped oxen, with horns, ears and sometimes pierced eyes, with or without a dewlap. The hump is either at the base of the neck or at the center of the back; the tail is usually slightly arched and hangs down between the hind legs. In one case, stripes were painted on the neck and body, representing a harness, similar to the incised lines on our example indicating that this animal was used to draw a cart. Petrie notes that the range of the ox figurines is from level GS 183 to level BZ2 (by his dating, 1250 BCE to 600 BCE). The greater part of these figurines (38 in all) are humped oxen, found from FL185 and upwards to FL196 (Petrie 1928: 18, PI. XXXVII). The assemblages at Tell Jemmeh date from the Iron Age; no examples from the Late Bronze Age were published, as Petrie only just reached the remains of that period. Other examples of humped-back zebu, without a dewlap, were found at Gezer, dating to the Third Semitic Period, and at Jerusalem, in Iron Age II levels (Holland 1975: 104, 124). At Tell 'Eitun, a broken kernos with a hollow, hump-backed animal was found in a tomb dating to the 10th-9th centuries BCE (T. Dothan, personal communication; Edelstein et al. 1971: 87). The example found at Deir el-Balah appears to be the earliest known example of a zebu figurine. Fig. 17.9. Zoomorphic figurine (No. 9). Photo 17.9. Zoomorphic figurine (No. 9). Taking into consideration the Egyptianizing character of this settlement, it is interesting to note that the zebu was depicted on Egyptian wall paintings only in the New Kingdom (Carrington 1972: 71). 9. Reg. No. 45, Locus 406 (Fig. 17.9; Photo 17.9) Fragmentary zoomorphic figurine, 7.2 cm. long and 3.2 cm. wide, made of coarse reddish-yellow clay with a gray core and straw inclusions.

Apart from the "Ptah seal," which has been published previously, the material is described here for the first time. The archaeological contexts of the finds should not be considered secure criteria for their dating; rather, the finds date the contexts in which they were found. An attempt has been made to list all excavated parallels from Canaan as well as from Egypt as a basis for future studies. Parallels from collections have been used only when they are essential to the discussion. Hieroglyphic signs are referred to throughout this chapter as they appear in Gardiner's Sign-list (Gardiner 1973). The photographs were taken by Zev Radovan and the drawings were made by Sarah Halbreich, both under the author's guidance. DESCRIPTION 1. Bulla (Reg. No. 2087; Locus 1013; Fig. 18.1:1; Photo 18.1:1) Material. Brown clay. Dimensions : Bulla: L 27.5 mm., W 21.5 mm., T 5.5 mm.; seal: L 14.25 mm., W 8 mm. Method of manufacture : A lump of clay was attached to a rolled papyrus where the string tied it; the clay was then impressed by a seal.1 Workmanship : Bulla: excellent; seal: mediocre (part of the oval frame is missing). Technical details: Fingerprints and seal impressions on the face; string and papyrus impressions on the back. Unfired. Preservation: Broken; the right part is missing. Seal impression: Within a horizontal oval frame are depicted four hieroglyphs. On the edges are two wdìte. yes "Horus eyes" (D 10) facing one another, and two nfr "good" (F 35) in the center. The whole combination has the appearance of a human face. Seal shape: From the oval shape of the impression it is clear that the seal was a finger-ring.2 The mediocre workmanship of the seal, as deduced from the sealing, indicates that it was a faience finger-ring made in a mold, a very common product in Amarna.3 Typology: The seal that impressed our bulla belongs to a group of small objects that contain various combinations of the wdìt and nfr hieroglyphs, sometimes, but not always, in the shape of a human face. Among them are a metallic finger-ring from Gurob (Petrie et al. 1891: 19, Pl. XXII:10), two scarabs in the Egyptian Museum in Cairo (Newberry 1 907 : 52 , PI . I V:36205 ; 55 , PI . I V:362 1 6) , a scarab from Matmar (Brunton 1948: 69, PI. XLVIII:26)4 and a model throw-stick amulet of blue faience from Malkata (Hayes 1951: 234-35, Fig. 34:a). From the various, excavations at Amarna came objects such as scarabs (Petrie et al. 1894: 27, 29, Pl. XV:87-88, 133), molds for finger-rings and amulets (Petrie et al. 1894: 29, Pis. XVI:171-74, XVII:250-51), a magic ball (Peet and Woolley 1923: 31, PI. LIV:636), finger-rings (Frankfort and Pendlebury 1933: 115, PI. XLIX:I.B.25 and I.C.54; Pendlebury et al. 1951: Pl. CXII:I.C.60), clay sealings (Frankfort and Pendlebury 1933: 37, PI. L:274) and stamped bricks (Kemp 1978: 23, Fig. 1). The only known object from Canaan that belongs to this group is a scarab in the British Museum, said to come from illicit excavations at Gezer, with the 207</page><page sequence="204">CHAPTER EIGHTEEN Fig. 18.1.

Bullae and plaque. prenomen of Amenhotep III (Hall 1913: 303, No. 2880 = Giveon 1985: 126-27, No. 49). Date : The bulla should be dated to the Amarna period or mid- 14th century BCE on the basis of two factors: its typology and the excavated parallels. Typology : The above-mentioned group appears exclusively in the "extended" Amarna period, during the reigns of Thutmose IV, Amenhotep III and Amenhotep IV/Akhenaten. Excavated parallels : The same hieroglyphic combination appears on two excavated objects from Amarna: a finger-ring (Petrie et al. 1894: 27, Pl. XV: 133) and a clay sealing (Frankfort and Pendlebury 1933: 37, PI. L:274, fourth seal from right in upper row) Archaeological context : Locus 1013 is a pit, most probably a favissa, related to Stratum IX, Phase 1 , of the Amarna period (Vol. 1 , Chapter 5, IX. 1 .2.3). The bulla should therefore be considered as having been found in situ. 209</page><page sequence="206">CHAPTER EIGHTEEN 2. Bulla (Reg. No. 3715; Locus 1326; Fig. 18.1:2; Photo 18.1:2) Material : Brown clay. Dimensions'. Bulla: L 26 mm., W 17.5 mm., T 6 mm.; seal: D 39 mm. Method of manufacture : A lump of clay was attached to a rolled papyrus where the string tied it; the clay was then impressed by a seal (see n. 1 above). Workmanship : Bulla: excellent. Technical details: Fingerprints and seal impressions on the face; string and papyrus impressions on the back. Unfired. Preservation : Broken; less than half is preserved. Seal impression : A rosette of twelve leaves of which only four survive, surrounded by 36 small squares of which only ten survive. The central circle is missing. Seal shape: The circular shape of the impression indicates that it was made by a molded rosette inlay (Petrie et al. 1894: 30, Pl. XVIII:393^37), rather than by a seal. Typology: The rosette inlays are one of a range of inlay groups typical of the faience industry at Amarna.5 Date: The bulla should be dated to the Amarna period or mid- 14th century BCE on the basis of two factors: its typology and an excavated parallel to its "seal." Typology: The "seal" belongs to a group of faience objects typical of Amarna. Excavated parallel: the closest excavated parallel is a rosette inlay found in Petrie's excavations at Amarna (Petrie et al. 1894: 30, Pl. XVIII:429). Archaeological context: Locus 1326 is a Stratum III, or Philistine, pit that cut inter alia Locus 1 342, a surface of Stratum IX Phase 1 of the Amarna period (Vol . 1 , Chapter 5 , IX . 1 .3 .7) . It seems to us that the bulla had remained in situ on the surface and was "annexed" to the later pit during the excavations, as a result of the difficulty of following the exact shape of the pit's curved contours.6 3. Plaque (Reg. No. 16/1; Locus 336; Fig. 18.1:3; Photo 18.1:3) Material: Black stone (serpentine?). Dimensions: L 14.5 mm., W 9 mm., T 7.5 mm. Method of manufacture: Carving, abrading, drilling and incising. Workmanship: Mediocre. Technical details: Perforated, drilled from both directions. Preservation: Complete. Plaque shape: The plaque resembles a rectangular brick7 with six sides (A-F).8 The two large sides (A and C) are decorated and the two medium sides (B and D) are plain, while the two narrow sides (E and F) are perforated. Plaque's decorated sides: Side A: The hieroglyph nfr "good" (F 35) within a vertical rectangular frame. Side C: Two discs, possibly Rr [the sun-god] "Re" (N 5) incorporated in what seems to be the hieroglyph mn (Y 5) within a horizontal rectangular frame. Typology: The plaque may belong to one of two groups of seals: that with mottoes or that with "royal names": Seals with mottoes: If the signs on side C are interpreted as 'Imn and /?r, the whole could be read as nfr Imn-RF or "good [is the god] Amon- Re." The nfr could be an abbreviation in a sentence such as Imn-Rr nfr hsi , "Good praise [for the god] Amon-Re,"9 or may alternatively be a component of a combination like nfr and rnķ "life" (S 34). 10 Seals with "royal name": It is possible that the hieroglyph mn is an abbreviation of the name 'Imn-htp (Amenhotep), a common name among the pharaohs of the XVIIIth Dynasty. If so, the hieroglyph nfr could be a component in various combinations.1 1 Date: The plaque should be dated to the mid- XVIIIth Dynasty or mid- 14th century BCE on the basis of two factors: an excavated parallel and the style of the hieroglyph mn. Excavated parallel: The closest excavated parallel was found in Tomb 265 at Riqqeh (Engelbach et al. 1915: Pl. XVII:68), dated to the period of Amenhotep III. Hieroglyph style: The hieroglyph mn appears as ķist "foreign land" (N 25) on a rectangular plaque from Tomb 1026 at Matmar that should 210</page><page sequence="207">TWO BULLAE, A PLAQUE, FOUR SCARABS AND A STAMP SEAL be dated to the mid-XVIIIth Dynasty (Brunton 1948: 60, PI. XLVIII: 29). 12 Archaeological context : Locus 336 is a floor in Building 33 1 related to Stratum IX Phase 1 of the Amarna period (Vol. 1, Chapter 5, IX. 1.1. 2). The plaque should therefore be considered as having been found in situ. 4. Scarab (Reg. No. 297; Locus 500; Fig. 182:1; Photo 18.2:1). Material : Glazed steatite. Dimensions : L 19 mm., W 14.5 mm., H 10.5 mm. Method of manufacture : Carving, abrading, drilling, incising and glazing. Workmanship : Mediocre. Technical details-. Perforated, drilled from both sides. Preservation : Complete. Scarab shape :13 According to Rowe's segmented typology, the scarab may be classified as follows: Head and Clypeus (HC) Type 1 1 ; Elytra and Pronotum (EP) Type 33; and Side Type 22 (Rowe 1936: Pis. XXXII-XXXIII, XXXV). The ranges of these types of HC and side are from the Xlllth to the XXVIth Dynasty, while the EP type has a shorter range, from ca. the Hyksos period to the XXIInd Dynasty. Only three scarabs combining these three components exist in Rowe's catalogue: one is dated to the XVIIIth Dynasty and two to the XlXth (Rowe 1936: Nos. 536, 674, 723). Scarab base : An inscription consisting of 17 hieroglyphs within an oval frame. This combination of hieroglyphs seems to represent a confusion of a known formula, since only parts of it may be fully identified. In the upper part 'Imn-Rr ("Amon-Re") and Pth ("Ptah"),14 the names of two gods, appear clearly. The lower right part may be interpreted as an abbreviation of the name Mn-nfr ("Memphis") (Gardiner 1973: 183, n. 1). This suggestion is based on three considerations: 1 The triangular hieroglyph is the determinative that is added to names of royal pyramids (Gardiner 1973: Sign-list O 24). 2 The hieroglyph r (D 2 1 ) should be considered the phonetic complement (Gardiner 1973: 38) of the word nfr, and as the only remnant of it. 3 The name of the Memphite god Ptah appears in the upper part. Typology : If our proposal to read the name of Memphis is correct, this scarab belongs to a group of Memphitic scarabs with mottoes that was classed by Drioton as "sentences sur l'avenir de Memphis" (Drioton 1957: 14-25). Drioton, however, suggested cryptographic interpretations'5 of the various formulas, which we do not favor (Brandl 1982: 377-79). The issue should remain open until scarabs with complete formulas are discovered.16 Date: The scarab should be dated to the XlXth Dynasty or the 13th century BCE on the basis of three elements: scarabs with the same shape, scarabs displaying the same typology, and a redated excavated parallel. Scarab shape: Only two excavated scarabs with the same details of shape are found in Rowe's catalogue, both from Tomb 936 at Tell el-Far' ah South (Starkey and Harding 1932: 25, Pis. LIV-LV:256 and 284 = Rowe 1936: Nos. 674 and 723, respectively). The first bears the prenomen of Ramesses II, the pharaoh to whose reign the whole tomb is dated. Scarab typology : The Memphite scarabs appear to be dated mainly to the early Ramesside period, when this religious center became the Dynastic capital. Excavated parallel: The only known excavated parallel is from .Canaan. It is a scarab found in Tomb 93417 of the XlXth-XXth Dynasties cemetery at Tell el-Far' ah South (Starkey and Harding 1932: 24, PI. LII:149 = Giveon 1985: 22-23, No. 5). The excavators attributed this scarab to the Hyksos period, and Giveon, who followed them, even related it to the "rnrr group"18 typical of that time. However, on the basis of the two elements discussed above, it is clear that their dating should be rejected, and that the scarab should be attributed to the Ramesside period. Moreover, the same tomb contained representatives of two other of the Memphite group of scarabs (Starkey and Harding 1932: 211</page><page sequence="208">CHAPTER EIGHTEEN Fig. 18.2. Scarabs. 212</page><page sequence="209">TWO BULLAE, A PLAQUE, FOUR SCARABS AND A STAMP SEAL Photo 18.2. Scarabs. PL LIII:216- 2 = Giveon 1985: 38-9, No. 50 and Drioton 1957: No. 22, respectively).19 Archaeological context : Locus 500 is a topsoil locus whose top slopes from south to north between 1 8 .5 1 and 1 8 .22 , and whose base is between 18.13 and 17.99 ASL. The scarab's level of 18.05 ASL indicates that it was found at the base of the locus. The information that the scarab was found in the western half of the square shows that it was located beyond the area of the Stratum I wadi 213</page><page sequence="210">CHAPTER EIGHTEEN that diagonally cut the square (A-9), and strongly points to the possibility of relating it to Installation 520 of Stratum V (Vol. 1 , Chapter 5, V.l .1 .2). The good condition of the scarab also supports this suggestion. If we are correct, this scarab should be considered as having been found in situ. 5. Scarab (Reg. No. 6181; Locus 1907; Fig. 18.2:2; Photo 18.2:2) Material: Glazed steatite. Dimensions : L 20 mm., W 15 mm., H 10 mm. Method of manufacture: Carving, abrading, drilling, incising and glazing. Workmanship: Good. Technical details: Perforated, drilled from both sides. Preservation: Complete. Scarab shape (see n. 13 above): The appearance of the scarab beetle is very schematic and some details are lacking: Head and Clypeus (HC) : The head is a trapezoid divided horizontally into three strips, the central one of which is sliced vertically into five, while the other strips are plain. The clypeus is plain and unusually small. The eyes are missing, while the plates are longer. Elytra and Pronotum ( EP ): The prono tum is separated from the elytra by a straight line and the suture dividing the elytra is a straight line. The suture is "supported" at differing but close distances by two opposite diagonal short bars, apparently equivalent to those of the clypeus. Side: The front and central legs are not depicted, while the hind leg is hinted at by a short diagonal line. Only the side is exactly paralleled in Rowe's catalogue, where it is classified as Type 38 with a range from the Xllth to XXth Dynasties (Rowe 1936: PI. XXXV); exact parallels to the HC and EP of our scarab are lacking there. An exact parallel to our scarab's shape was found in an excavation at Lod (Brandl 1999: 20* n. 23; 2003: 255 n.41). Scarab base: Within a vertical oval frame is a depiction of a scene consisting of a large feather on the right, an obelisk in the center and a divine figure with a human body and a falcon's head from which two vertical strokes emerge upwards, all above a horizontal line. A fragmentary sun disc fills the empty space above the feather. This composition is reminiscent of a small group of scarabs20 that contain only three signs: a large feather on the right, an obelisk in the center and a deity that may be identified as Rr-Hr-iķty [the composite god] "Re-Harakhti." The size of the feather points to equality with the deity on the other side of the obelisk and thus seems to be one of two candidates: Mirt the goddess of Truth, or Šw [the air-god] "Shu" (H 6). On the basis of two obelisks of Ramesses II from Tanis, where Re-Harakhti and Shu appear on different faces of their pyramidions,21 it seems likely that Shu is the second deity on these scarabs.22 The change above the head of Re-Harakhti and the "transfer" of the sun disc to the space above the feather on our scarab indicate that it had ceased to be a figurative composition and had become a "picture inscription" or rebus. Consequently, the components around the obelisk may be interpreted as follows: the feather as M?rt the goddess of Truth; the sun disc as Rc [the sun-god] "Re" (N 5); and the strange deity as wsr "powerful" (F 12).23 These could be read as the beginning of the prenomen of Ramesses, most probably that of Ramesses II ( Wsr-Mict-Rr [stp-n-R^). Moreover, since the obelisk itself could be used only as an ideogram or a determinative (O 25), 24 it is possible that this scarab actually commemorates one of the obelisks erected during the reign of this ruler and named after him. Typology: The scarab belongs to the first (and in our view the only) main type in the group of "Rebus-like Name Scarabs" (Brandl 1982: 372-73, 389, nn. 8-9). In this group the canonical shape of hieroglyphs in a royal name have changed into a more composite shape, which is still easily identified by anyone familiar with Egyptian hieroglyphs. Date: The scarab should be dated to the XlXth Dynasty or the 13th century BCE on the basis of three factors: the scarab's shape, its typology and the best candidate for the shortened royal name. 214</page><page sequence="211">TWO BULLAE, A PLAQUE. FOUR SCARABS AND A STAMP SEAL Scarab shape : As mentioned above, the best parallel of the scarab's shape is the one excavated at Lod, since it has the same details. That scarab is dated inter alia by its head and clypeus, which belong to a new group appearing exclusively in the XlXth Dynasty or the 13th century BCE (Brandl 2003:255-258; 2004: 142 [No. 36], n. 195, 181 Fig. 3.36). Typology. The "Rebus-like Name Scarabs" are typical of the XlXth-XXth Dynasties (Brandl 1982: 372-73, 389, nn. 8-9), especially during the reigns of Ramesses II and IV. Royal name: The three hieroglyphs Wsr-M !ci-rc appear in the prenomen of several Ramesside kings, but only the reliefs of Ramesses II display the same rebus writing. Archaeological context: Locus 1907 is atopsoil locus in its upper part and a Stratum V surface in its lower part (Vol. 1, Chapter 5, V.l. 7.1). The scarab may therefore be related to Stratum V, and may be considered as having been found in situ. 6. Scarab (Reg. No. 3782; Locus 1359; Fig. 18.2:3; Photo 18.2:3) Material: Glazed steatite. Dimensions: L 20 mm., W 13.5 mm., H 9 mm. Method of manufacture: Carving, abrading, drilling, incising and glazing. Workmanship: Excellent. Technical details: Perforated, drilled from both sides. Preservation: Broken on the two long edges of the vertical base. Scarab shape (see n. 13 above): According to Rowe's segmented typology, the scarab may be classified as follows: Head and Clypeus (HC) Type 5; Elytra and Pronotum (EP) Type 33; and Side Type 22 (Rowe 1936: Pis. XXXII-XXXIII, XXXV). The ranges of these components are Xllth-XXVIth Dynasty, Hyksos to XXIInd Dynasty and XHIth-XXVIth Dynasty respectively. Only two scarabs with all three components appear in Rowe's catalogue: both came from XlXth Dynasty contexts (Rowe 1936: Nos. 475, 731). Scarab base: Within a vertical oval frame is depicted a scene consisting of the god Pth (Ptah) standing in his implied naos,25 holding the wis scepter. In front of him is the altar formed by two dd pillars with two bi birds (looking like falcons) on them.26 The group stands above a nb sign that serves as an exergue, while a winged solar disc covers it. It has been suggested that this combination represents a Memphite Triad, in which the two b ì birds should be identified as the gods Shu and Tefnut (Kákosy 1980). 27 Typology: The scarab belongs to the category of "Scarabs bearing Names and Figures of Gods" (Newberry 1906: PI. 41). Six seals of this type have been excavated in Canaan. A similar scarab from Deir el-Balah was acquired by Petrie ( 1 934: 4, Pis. X, XI:438 = Rowe 1936: No. 718). One scarab was found at Lachish (Tufnell 1953: 368, PI. 43:28 = Ben-Tor 1989: 65, No. 30) in a later context, Pit L. 15:50, which is related to the Persian period Stratum I (Tufnell 1953: 153). Two such scarabs were found at Beth-Shean: one in Locus 1282 (James 1966: Fig. 100:6) and one in Tomb 7 in the Northern Cemetery (Oren 1973: 124-25, Fig. 51:14). A scarab (IAA No. 60-953) was also found in Tomb 4 at Yavneh, which contained five well-dated scarabs (IAA Nos. 60-950-954; Brandl 1986-1987: 168).28To this list, also discussed by Othmar Keel (1989: 294-95, 298, Nos. 55, 53, 52, 56 and 54), one can add a bifacial rectangular seal found at Tel Ishtori (el-Malkha) in the Beth-Shean Valley (Zori 1962: 171, PL 19:4-5). Although many such scarabs from Egypt are known, only three have documented find spots. One was found in 1899 at Naukratis (Newberry 1907: 344, PI. XVII:37373), another in the Merneptah Temple at Memphis (Petrie and Walker 1909a: PI. 34:27) and the third in Burial 1 82 at Tell Basta (El- Sawi 1979: 87,Figs.201,209,210,No. 1947). One such scarab was found in Nubia in Tomb S 563 at Semna, one of the Second Cataract Forts (Dunham and Janssen 1960: Pl. 123:20). Date: The scarab should be dated to the XlXth Dynasty or the 1 3th century BCE on the basis of four factors: scarabs with the same shape, excavated 215</page><page sequence="212">CHAPTER EIGHTEEN parallels, parallels with a royal name and a parallel with a Memphitic motto. Scarab shape : The two above-mentioned scarabs with the same details in Rowe's catalogue were found in Tombs 960 and 967 at Tell el-Far' ah South, both in use during the XlXth Dynasty. Excavated parallels: The scarabs from Beth- Shean Tomb 7 and Yavneh in Canaan, Memphis and Tell Basta in Egypt and Semna in Nubia were found in well-dated 13th century contexts. Parallels with a royal name : One scarab from the Chicago Art Institute (Pier 1906: 82, PI. 11:1452 = Jaeger 1982: 194, 111. 569) bears the name of Ramesses II. Two or three more scarabs with some additions also bear the name of the same pharaoh (Hall 1913: No. 2185; Petrie 1917: PI. 40:[ 19.3.1 8] = Jaeger 1982: 338, n. 796). Parallel with a Memphitic motto29: One bifacial oval plaque has the scene discussed above on one face, while on the other it contains one of the most common Memphitic sentences: "Every good deed is richly rewarded by Ptah" (Fraser 1900: No. 439 = Hornung and Staehelin 1976: No. 716 = Kákosy 1980: 51, n. 12). Archaeological context: Locus 1359 is another surface related to Stratum V (Vol. 1, Chapter 5, V.l. 7 .2). The scarab may therefore be considered as having been found in situ. 7. Scarab (Reg. No. 44; Tomb 602; Fig. 18.2:4; Photo 18.2:4) Material: Glazed steatite. Dimensions: L 18 mm., W 12.25 mm., H 9 mm. Method of manufacture: Carving, abrading, drilling, incising and glazing. Workmanship: Good. Technical details: Perforated, drilled from both sides. Preservation: Complete. Scarab shape (see n. 13 above): According to Rowe's segmented typology, the scarab may be classified as follows: Head and Clypeus (HC) Type 9; Elytra and Pronotum (EP) Type 43; and Side Type 22 (Rowe 1936: Pis. XXXII-XXXIII, XXXV). The ranges of these components are the Xllth-XXVth Dynasty, XlVth-XIXth Dynasty and XHIth-XXVIth Dynasty respectively. Only one scarab combining all three components appears in Rowe's catalogue; it came from a XlXth Dynasty context (Rowe 1936: No. 698). Scarab base: An oval and ladder shape strip made of 27 small squares encircles an inner horizontal oval frame. In the inner oval is inscribed the god's name Jmn-Rr (Amon-Ra), with two horizontal nb signs serving as exergues (Brandl 1979: 85, n. 70). Typology: The scarab belongs to the category of "Scarabs bearing Names and Figures of Gods" (Newberry 1906: PI. 41). Several parallels were found in Canaan, among them two from Tell el- Far' ah South, found in Tombs 978 and 984 (Starkey and Harding 1932: Pis. 49, 57:398 = Rowe 1936: Nos. 757 and 753 respectively). One scarab was found at Lachish in Locus 4004 (Tufnell 1958: 122, Pis. 37-38, No. 272). In Egypt such scarabs were found in Tomb 201 atRiqqeh (Engelbach et al. 1915: Pl. 1 8: 100), and in Burial 203 at Tell Basta (El-Sawi 1979: 93, Figs. 219, 222-23 [No. 1976]). Date: The scarab should be dated to the XlXth Dynasty or the 13th century BCE on the basis of the scarab's shape and excavated parallels: Scarab shape: The above-mentioned scarab with the same components was found in Tomb 984 at Tell el-Far'ah South, in use in both the XlXth and XXth Dynasties, and correctly related to the earlier period (Starkey and Harding 1932: PI. 57:388 = Rowe 1936: 166-67, No. 698). Excavated parallels: All the excavated parallels mentioned above are dated to the XlXth Dynasty.30 Archaeological context: Tomb 602 is dated to the 13th century BCE, since it contained a local imitation of a Mycenaean HIB pyxis (Vol. I, Chapter 1 , Fig. 1 .12: 1). The scarab should thus be considered as having been found in situ. 8. Stamp seal (Reg. No. 483; Locus 521-522; Fig. 183; Photo 183) Material: Clay. Dimensions: Face: H 81 mm., W 41 mm.; handle: 216</page><page sequence="213">TWO BULLAE, A PLAQUE, FOUR SCARABS AND A STAMP SEAL max. D 70 mm. Method of manufacture : Modelling, carving, perforation. Workmanship : Mediocre. Technical details : The design is 10 mm deep. Preservation : Complete. Seal shape : The shape of the seal imitates metal or faience finger-rings. The design is very prominent and lacks a frame, so that the impression is deep. Seal face : The entire design consists of a single element, the image of the god Pth (Ptah). He is depicted in profile in his mummified form31 with the typical scullcap, holding the wis scepter with both hands and with the mnit (menât) hanging over the back of his neck.32 He is standing on a raised platform. Fig. 18.3. Ptah seal. Typology : This type of object was usually made for sealing clay products such as jar stoppers or bricks.33 The prominence of the design on our seal, as well as the lack of a frame, point in our view to an alternative identification as a master- seal for preparing molds for faience plaque amulets.34 Date : The object may be dated to the early Ramesside period i.e. the XlXth Dynasty or the 13th century BCE, when the religious importance of Memphis, Ptah's center, was elevated. Archaeological context Locus 521-522 is a pit attributed to Stratum V (Vol. I, Chapter 5, V.l .6.6). The stamp seal may therefore be considered as having been found in situ . Previous bibliography: Dothan 1985: 63, Figs. 5-6; Keel 1989: 290-91 , 111. 32 (where it was erroneously described as a finger-ring , both in writing and in the scale of the drawing); 1995: 114. CONCLUSIONS The glyptic finds from Deir el-Balah may be associated with two strata, Stratum IX Phase 1 and Stratum V, dated to the 14th and 13th centuries respectively. They accord well with the cities that served as the capital and religious center in Egypt during each period, Amarna during the first and Memphis during the second. The finds of the earlier period were apparently manufactured in Egypt and brought to the site,35 while those of the later (Ramesside) period, which join the finds Photo 18.3. Ptah seal. 217</page><page sequence="214">CHAPTER EIGHTEEN from the anthropomorphic coffins (Giveon 1979; Brandl 1979), were made locally in Canaan during its colonization in the days of Ramesses II. The later seals also reflect direct connections with Tell el-Far' ah South. As a by-product, some corrections have been suggested to previous datings of seals from Matmar, Tell el-Far' ah South and Beth- Shean. CATALOGUE No. Object Reg.

NOTES 1 For a reconstruction see Brandl 1995: 144-45, Fig. 2. 2 On the typology of finger-rings see Keel 1995: 113-15. 3 For recent works dealing with both molds and faience finger-rings at Amarna see Bosse-Griffiths 1980; Shaw 1984; Shannon 1987; Boyce 1989; 1995a: 58-73. 4 This scarab came from one of the "unregistered graves" in Area 1000. An Amarna type finger-ring and a "seal" with the prenomen of Amenhotep III came from similar localities (Brunton 1948: PI. XLVIII: 17-1 8). It seems that all these finds originally belonged to a dismantled temple of Akhenaten that stood at the location of the Ramesside temple (Brunton 1948: 64, Pis. XLV, XLIX:8, 10). 5 Molded faience rosettes were used not only as inlays but also as pendants in collars (Boyce 1995b: Fig. 11.4a [C1A-C1C, CID]). On such molds from various sources see Herrmann 1985: xxii, 108-23, Nos. 509-929; Schlick-Nolte and von Droste zu Hülshoff 1990: 426-28, Kat. -Nr. 473-75. 6 Our "reconstruction" is based on the following: 1) the level of Pit 1326 is between 17.14 and 16.40 ASL; 2) the bulla was found in the pit at the level of 16.60 ASL; 3) Surface 1342 is at 16.56 and the top of the accumulation above it is at 16.82 ASL. 7 On rectangular plaques see Keel 1995: 89-93. 8 It is advisable to name all of the faces in any type of rectangular seal (cf. Brandl 1986-1987: Fig. 1:3) rather than referring only to obverse and reverse (Hall 1913) or side A and side B (Hornung and Staehelin 1976). 9 Compare with an oval plaque from Beth Shean 221</page><page sequence="218">CHAPTER EIGHTEEN (Rowe 1936: No. S.20) and a rectangular plaque from Lachish (Tufnell 1958: PI. 38:318). These plaques were so common during the reign of Amenhotep III that in some cases the hieroglyph htp (R 4) was added to the god's name so as to create the nomen of that pharaoh. This may be seen on a semi-cylindrical seal from Lachish (Tufnell 1958: PI. 38:314 = Jaeger 1982: Ills. 774, 923). 10 This combination appears on rectangular plaques from Koptos (Petrie 1896: PI.

XVII:68). 1 1 One combination appears on two rectangular plaques (Petrie 1889: Nos. 840^1 = Hall 1913: Nos. 360 and 359, respectively) originally related to Amenhotep I, and another on an oval plaque (Petrie 1889: No. 1284 = Hall 1913: No. 1776) related to Amenhotep III, all in the British Museum. 12 Contrary to Brunton's statement about the New Kingdom tombs at Matmar: "All the burials of this period seem to be of the XlXth Dynasty; it is remarkable that there are no graves of the previous Dynasty" (Brunton 1948: 58), several XVIIIth Dynasty tombs may be isolated there. Tomb 1109, with an oval plaque of Amenhotep II (Brunton 1948: 60, PI. XLVIII:20), contains the same type of pottery vessel (52N) as Tomb 1026 (Brunton 1948: PI. XLIV: Tomb Register XIX-XXI Dynasties). 13 See diagrams showing parts of the scarab beetle in Rowe 1936: PI. 23; Ward 1978: Frontispiece and Keel 1995: 20, Fig. 1. 14 The hieroglyph t (X 1) is carved upside down in the shape of the hieroglyph nb (V 30), a common phenomenon in XlXth Dynasty scarabs with the name Pth. 15 On cryptography see Keel 1995: 177-78. 16 One such scarab (No. 26) actually appears in Drioton's article. 17 This tomb was in use during both Ramesside Dynasties, the XlXth and the XXth, at least until the days of Ramesses IV. 18 On the rnrr scarabs see recently Keel 1995: 175-76. 19 Three more representatives of the Memphite group were found in the same site (Starkey and Harding 1932: Pis. L:40, LXI:34, LXXIIL42; the last two = Drioton 1957: Nos. 14 and 21 respectively). 20 These scarabs were found at Lidir-Ledrai in Cyprus (Ohnefalsch-Richter 1893: Pl. CLII: 15); Memphis (Petrie 1925: Pl. XIX: 1490) and Gurob (Brunton and Engelbach 1927: Pl. XLI:70). 21 They appear on faces 1 and 3 of Obelisk XVI and faces 3 and 4 of Obelisk XVII (Leclant and Yoyotte 1957: 54-59, Figs. 7 and 9). 22 Re-Harakhti and Shu appear without an obelisk on several scarabs, from Egypt as well as Canaan. Among them are: Nebeshe (Petrie et al. 1888: Pl. VIII:35); Qau (Brunton 1930: PI. 34:31); Tell el-Yehudiyeh (Petrie and Garrow Duncan 1906: PI. 11:228 = Petrie 1925: PI. 15:1011); Tell el- Far'ah South (Petrie 1930: PI. 43:504; Starkey and Harding 1932: PI. 57:380 = Rowe 1936: No. 706); Beth Shean (Rowe 1936: No. S. 43 = Oren 1973: 127, Fig. 51:27 [erroneously read as Nb-M?rt-Rr - Amenhotep III]); and Aphek (Kochavi 1977: 9, Ph. 15 left [unnumbered] = Giveon 1988: 42^43, No. 31 = Kochavi 1990: XXIV [where it was erroneously described as a "Hyksos" scarab]). 23 There are other forms of rebus wsr signs on Ramesses II scarabs (Bliss 1899: PI. VI:2 = Bliss and Macalister 1902: PI. 83:23 = Brandl 1982: Pl. 1:5a; Macalister 1912: Vol. I: 122, Fig. 44 = Brandl 1993: 231; Brandl 1982: Pl. 1:9-10). 24 Those who favor the idea of cryptogram writing identify the obelisk with the name 'Imn [the god] "Amon" (Drioton 1960: 90). 25 See Leibovitch 1960: 2*, Fig. 3; 5*, Fig. 9; PI. XLI:2: 10 (upper row, first on right). 26 For such two b ì birds depicted en face see a stele from Memphis (Petrie and Walker 1909b: PI. 25); and compare it with amulets from Qau and Matmar (Brunton 1930: PI. 44:15; 1948: PI. 60:11). 27 For appearances of the two b ? birds without relation with Ptah see Petrie and Quibell 1896: PI. 81:123; Hayes 1959: 396, Fig. 249 (upper row, third from left); Monnet Saleh 1970: No. 144; and the two amulets mentioned in n. 26. 28 The writer wishes to thank Prof. Ram Gophna, one of the excavators of the Yavneh tombs, for permission to mention the scarabs from Tomb 4 prior to their publication. 29 For the dating of the Memphite scarabs to the early 222</page><page sequence="219">TWO BULLAE, A PLAQUE, FOUR SCARABS AND A STAMP SEAL Ramesside period see our discussion of Scarab No. 4 above. 30 For a discussion of the range of use of Tomb 20 1 at Riqqeh, see Brandl 1986-1987: 166-68. Among the XlXth Dynasty scarabs in that tomb is No. 105, with the same Memphitic sentence as that mentioned in the discussion of Scarab No. 6 above. 31 Scholars suggest that this depiction originally did not represent mummification, but derived from the artists' inability to depict human arms and legs as separate limbs (Ions 1968: 105; Patrick 1972: 21, PI. 11). Later, when Ptah also became a god of the dead, this form was said to be that of a mummy (compare Quirke and Spencer 1992: 63, 118-19, Ills. 44, 94). 32 For description of Ptah see Ions 1968: 105-106. 33 For example a limestone stamp from El Amarna (Frankfort 1927: 217, PI. I Figs. 1 and 3), three wooden stamps (Petrie 1927: 69, PI. 60:162-64) and stamps made of clay (Hölscher 1954: 61, Pl. 35:B: 1^1). The only other clay stamp from Canaan known to me was found at Megiddo (Loud 1948: PI. 163:14). 34 Compare with plaque amulets depicting Ptah (Petrie 1914: 38, PI. 47:177d) or the four sons of Horus (Petrie 1914: 39^10, PI. 32:182; Ions 1968: 109-11).

No. 2727; Locus 1068; Fig. 19.1; Photo 19.1). The fragment measures 5.5 x 3.5 cm. and is broken on all sides. Transcription: jnj šmw n Translation: bringing (the) harvest tax of/to The reading šmw can definitely be asserted despite the somewhat blurred determinative. The signs for š and mw are clearly discernible. An alternative reading as the season šmw ("harvest-season," "summer") would usually require the "sun" sign (O) as determinative. However, the traces of the group behind the "triple- water-lines" can reasonably be fitted to the grain determinative, but certainly not to the "sun" sign. Moreover, the first gn-group, the right part of which is broken, supports the first reading and excludes the second. One might, at first glance, consider reading instead of the "jar-with- legs" the sign for "second/third/fourth month"1 in a date, to be followed by the season, were it not for the stroke below, n as phonetic complement to jn, thus identifying the whole group. This leaves us with the fortunate coincidence that this fragmentary inscription, short as it is, * I am indebted to Prof. Trude Dothan for the opportunity to publish this fragment, to Orly Goldwasser for passing it on to me, and to Prof. Sarah Israelit-Groll for her valuable support. A color photograph of the fragment has been published in Dothan 1982: 745. Editor 's Note : It is of interest that Pit 1068 (Stratum VI-IV?), in which the inscribed bowl fragment was found, is only 0.2 m . away from the Stratum VII Silo 1074. Fig. 19.1 . Bowl fragment with hieratic inscription. Photo 19.1. Bowl fragment with hieratic inscription. provides us with a key-word enabling us to place it in the context of similar hieratic inscriptions found elsewhere in Israel. The potsherds from Lachish,2 Tel Sera',3 Tel Haror4 and Tell el-Far'ah (S),5 most of which could be restored as bowls with one or two 225</page><page sequence="221">CHAPTER NINETEEN lines of text on the inside and/or the outside, refer to large amounts of grain. In one case, or possibly two (Lachish No. 3; Tel Sera' No. 1 , where only the determinative is preserved), our word šmw (harvest tax)6 is mentioned. The conclusion that our fragment belongs to a similar bowl seems reasonably safe. (It is thus, like most hieratic sherds from Israel, not an ostracon!) Assuming that here too the specification of a certain amount of grain appeared in the text, the above transcription can be extended to jn (m-)šmw n- and translated "[certain amount of grain] which is/was brought as harvest tax of/to...". The passive participle, although rare in Late Egyptian, does appear in administrative texts.7 The omission of the preposition is a common feature in Late Egyptian non-literary texts.8 It would generally favor dating the text to the XXth rather than the XlXth Dynasty, but as an isolated case this can hardly be regarded here as a reliable criterion. As for the paleography, the few signs are not, unfortunately, among the ones allowing any definite conclusions.9 The oblique upper part of the "jar-with-legs" is not a common feature, but it does occur.10 The shape of the "pond" ( š ), with the inner dash drawn in connection to the lower stroke, is again somewhat peculiar." The grain determinative is deplorably blurred.12 Strictly speaking, the long line below could also be interpreted as the plural strokes to the "grain- measure," but the reading n and identification of the plural strokes with what appears as a short, thick line immediately under the horizontal part of the "grain-measure" seems preferable to me. This grain determinative is the only sign that also occurs in the Tel Sera' inscriptions. These have been dated from the end of the XlXth or beginning of the XXth dynasty until at least year 22 of Ramses III.13 On the Lachish bowl the "pond" sign appears three times in three very distinct forms; the one in line 1 on the outside is, like our case, drawn in a peculiar way, though different. The "triple-water-line" appears twice, also in different forms that have no distinct features to allow comparison. The bowl from Lachish has been dated to the reign of Ramses III.14 As for the function of these vessels, it has been established by O. Goldwasser that they represent a Canaanite-Egyptian tradition of documenting the harvest tax on votive bowls.15 We know from various sources (pHarris, pWilbour) that Egyptian temples were the institutions that received such taxes. In view of the large amounts of grain mentioned by the inscriptions, it appears that the bowls had a kind of token function. Scribes at local administrative centers registered on them the products coming in from the surrounding estates. The bowls were then sent, perhaps containing symbolic amounts of grain, to the temple to which the estates were assigned. Goldwasser assumes a local temple.16 1 have doubted this opinion, since I do not believe in the existence of Egyptian temples in Asia apart from a few exceptional cases, the only one in the region of Deir el-Balah being the provincial capital Gaza, where an important temple of Amun existed under Ramses III and probably since the time of Thutmosis III.17 I would rather understand these payments in the light of pHarris 1,11,11, where nine Canaanite towns are mentioned among the benefits of the Temple of Karnak in Thebes.18 As additional material three scarabs, from Beth Shemesh and Tell el-Far'ah (S), have been published by Chr. Uelinger as administrative seals of the respective temple estates of Ramses III.19 The term pr has rightly been translated "estate," i.e. land or cattle in the possession of a temple {hwt)?° Whether the hwt- temple in question here was Karnak or the one in Gaza, as Uelinger has it,21 must remain open, since the missing continuation of our text deprives of us the crucial clue.22 Two secure conclusions, however, may apparently be drawn for our inscription. Firstly, it provides no evidence for an Egyptian temple at Deir el-Balah. Secondly, the inscription from Deir el- Balah extends the list of harvest-tax paying places and collecting centers in Canaan, among which Lachish, Tel Sera' , Tel Haror,Tell el-Far'ah (S) and Beth Shemesh have been verified up to now. 226</page><page sequence="222">A HIERATIC INSCRIPTION REFERENCES Černý, J. 1958.

The group was found in Locus 1006 (see Vol. I, Photo 149) with at least ten smashed vessels, including a chalice that resembles a specimen from Amarna (Peet and Woolley 1923: PL 52 [XLV/1037]). DESCRIPTION All of the four truncated pyramids are made of local kurkar. They are similar in size: 1. Base 11.6 X 12 cm.; top 8.2 x 9 cm.; height 9.6 cm. 2. Base 11 x 10.8 cm.; top 9 x 8.6 cm.; height 10 cm. 3. Base 10.6 x 10.5 cm.; top 9 x 8.2 cm.; height 7.6 cm. 4. Base 12 x 10 cm.; top 8.6 x 8 cm.; height 8.8 cm. Each has a shallow depression in its upper surface. Fig. 20.1 . The stone objects from Locus 1006. DISCUSSION In view of the well-dated context of the four items from Deir el-Balah (all were found in Room 1006 of Building 33 1 of the Amarna period), one would naturally seek their origin and function in the archaeological reports on the various excavations held at Amarna. Ludwig Borchardt, who was the first to expose such limestone objects in the site, suggested that these had functioned as supports for legs of beds and other pieces of furniture (Borchardt 1911: 25-26). Eric Peet and Leonard Woolley, the next excavators of Amarna, also exposed objects of this kind made of limestone. Since they found them near entrances, and in one case one of a pair was even found against each jamb of a door, they suggested that these objects were used as supports for the door frame (Peet and Woolley 1923: 59, 76, PI. 14, Fig. 2 right). As they were familiar with Borchardt's suggestion,1 they raised the possibility that such objects may have served more than one purpose. The final Photo 20.1 . The stone objects from Locus 1006. 229</page><page sequence="225">CHAPTER TWENTY Fig. 20.2. The stone objects from Locus 1006. proof that resolved the debate about the function of such objects was found during the excavations of Frankfort and Pendlebury. A complete set of four such supports was found still in position in the raised niche of the Master's Bedroom2 of House V.37.1 (Frankfort and Pendlebury 1933: 8, PI. 18:2). Outside Amarna, such specimens were found at only two sites, unfortunately in mixed contexts, before the excavations at Deir el-Balah. Two isolated truncated square pyramids made of limestone were found, though in later contexts, in Areas D and A at Mit Rahineh (Memphis) (Anthes et al. 1965: 106-107, Fig. 15, No. 68).3 A single specimen made of hard sandstone was found in Area G at Tel Ashdod in secondary use in a Stratum XV wall (Dothan and Porath 1993: 44, 108, PI. 33:7, IAA No. 91-619). At Deir el-Balah this group of stone artifacts, as well as the pottery, seem to have suffered from a collapse either from a shelf or from a second story. The reconstruction given here (Fig. 20.3) shows the function of these stone objects as supports for the legs of a bed in a bedroom niche. CONCLUSIONS This is the second complete set of Amarna-type stone supports for bed legs ever discovered, and the first to be found outside Egypt's borders. Its appearance at Deir el-Balah contributes in several aspects. It joins other chronological markers that help to date its context, and reflects the use of an authentic Egyptian custom at the site. It points to the location of the most important house in the compound and 230</page><page sequence="226">FOUR AMARNA-TYPE STONE SUPPORTS FOR BED LEGS Fig. 20.3. Reconstruction of the stone objects as supports for the legs of a bed in a bedroom niche. probably locates the Master's Bedroom within the house. Finally, it reflects direct contacts between Amarna and Deir el-Balah and joins other types of locally made Egyptian objects found at the site. REFERENCES Anthes, R. et al. 1965. Mit Rahineh 1956.

NOTES 1 In their reference to Borchardťs suggestion, Peet and Woolley interpreted his words "other furnitures" as referring to chairs (Peet and Woolley 1923: 59, n. 1). However, this seems unlikely, since these supports were not designed to be portable. 2 For the traditional function of such niches in the bedrooms of nobles and pharaohs from the Xllth to the XlXth Dynasties, see Eigner 1996: 78-79, Fig. 3. 3 The publishers of these objects returned to the "chair support" hypothesis, without reference to the earlier finds from Amarna or to their dating. 231</page><page sequence="227">CHAPTER TWENTY-ONE SEVEN STONE BURNISHERS Baruch Brandl INTRODUCTION Among the small finds from the excavations at Deir el-Balah are seven burnishers made on pebbles of different types of stone. They may be divided into four types: elongated, rectangular, pear- shaped and rounded. They are described in order of their registration numbers. The objects were photographed by Zev Radovan and drawn by Sarah Halbreich under the author's guidance. The weights of both complete and broken objects are given as a rejoinder to those who have suggested that such objects could have been used as weights. The use of pebbles and stones as burnishing tools is typical of both Canaanite and Egyptian potters during the 14th- 1 3th centuries BCE. Examples are the potter's workshop in Cave 6034 atLachish (Tufnell 1958: 91, 292, P1.49:15, upper row; Magrill and Middleton 1997: 68, Fig. 1 (middle row, on right, 71); stones Nos. 9-16 in the Cape Gelidonya shipwreck (du Plat Taylor 1967: 128-30); two flattened black stone pebbles from Stratum VII at Beth-Shean (James and McGovern 1993: 193, Fig. 126: lla-b); and potter's installation Q48.4 at Amarna (Rose 1989: 89, Fig. 4.5, No. 8432). DESCRIPTION 1. Burnisher (Reg. No. 2060; Locus 1006; Fig. 21.1:1) Material : Limestone (?). Dimensions : L67 mm.; W 23-26 mm.; T 10.5-1 1 .5 mm.; Wt 32.7 g. Method of manufacture : This appears to be a natural sea pebble that was shortened by the potter. Workmanship : Good. Technical details : The burnisher shows signs of work on its complete narrow edge. Preservation : Apparently complete. Description : The burnisher is shaped like an elongated plaque; the cross-section is oval on the working edge and plano-convex on the other edge. Typology. Elongated. Date : Since it was found on one of the floors of the Amarna period, this object may be dated to the 14th century BCE.

Many of these were made from body sherds of locally made Egyptian- type vessels.1 The objects were photographed by Zev Radovan and drawn by Sarah Halbreich under the author's guidance. They are described in the order in which they appear in the plates; for types comprising more than one specimen, a summary discussion of the type is given after the description. The weights of the "complete" objects are given as a rejoinder to those who have suggested that such objects were used as weights. DESCRIPTION A. LIDS (Nos. 1-14) Fourteen lids were found at the site. All were made from base fragments of open or closed vessels. They belong to two main types, hexagonal (nine examples) and circular (five examples). Their shapes were made by chiseling or chipping of the edges; no signs of rubbing were observed. The lids are illustrated both as components of their original vessels and in their secondary forms. 1. Lid (Reg. No. 684/1; Locus 543; Fig. 22.1:1; Photo 22.1) Material: Yellowish clay; both surfaces yellowish- red. Dimensions'. D 21 cm., H 4.8 cm., L of hexagon side 10.5 cm., T min. 0.95 cm. Method of manufacture: The original vessel, a large bowl, was wheelmade, slipped, burnished and fired. The secondary object was chiseled. Workmanship: Good. Technical details: Well-finished base with marks of smoothing by vegetation on the exterior and concentric grooves or ribbing on the interior.2 Preservation: Broken on two sides, though the shape is clear. Description: Though made on a large bowl base, it is off-center. Typology: Hexagonal; it may have covered a stone or wooden container. Date: The original bowl belongs to the locally made Egyptian assemblage produced during the 13th century BCE (Strata VI-IV). Archaeological context: Locus 543 (Vol. I, Chapter 5 , VI .2) is part of the Stratum VI crater fill . Both the original and the secondary uses of our object may therefore be attributed to the same stratum (VI). Photo 22.1. Lid (No. 1). 239</page><page sequence="233">CHAPTER TWENTY-TWO Fig. 22.1.

Method of manufacture : The original vessel, a large krater, was wheelmade, self-slipped, burnished and fired. The temper was chopped straw. The secondary object was chiseled. Workmanship : Good. Technical details : Marks of a simple wheel on the outer surface of the base, with negative marks of straw and incised grooves made by a scraper. Preservation : Complete, with three scars on the "rim." Description: The lid was made on the lower part of a krater. A hexagonal shape seems to have been intended. The ring base of the original vessel could have served as a holding area. Typology : This object was identified as a lid, since its shape resembles that of Lid No. 1 above. However, the possibility of its having served as a small bowl should not be ruled out.3 Date : The original vessel, with its Canaanite shape, is a hybrid product belonging to the locally made Egyptian assemblage produced during the 13th century BCE (Strata VI-IV). Archaeological context : Locus 575 is "below" Walls 505 and 507 of Stratum V (see Plans 7-8) and mixed in its center with Pit 553 of Stratum VI.

This may indicate the function of these pits, or alternatively show that the lids were used only once. 6 Only one lid was found on a floor, which is dated to the Amarna period. 7 The Philistine products too were made from loessy clays, showing that they were locally made products. 8 The lids appear to have been circular only if they were made on ring or disc bases. All the other lids are hexagonal as a result of the chiseling system; the worker turned the bases six times, and chiseling was always carried out in the front in a straight line. B. DISCS (Nos. 15-19) Five discs were found at the site. Four were made of body fragments of closed vessels. They are divided into two main types: hexagonal (three examples) and pentagonal (two examples). They were shaped by chiseling the edges, and all show signs of rubbing. The general term "discs" has been chosen here since they could have been used either as stoppers4 or, with additional treatment, as anvils in the process of drilling beads (if they were partially perforated),5 gaming pieces (if they had incisions),6 spindle whorls (if they had one hole)7 or buttons (if they had two holes).8 15.

Method of manufacture: The original vessel, a bowl, was wheelmade and fired. The temper was chopped straw. The secondary object was chiseled and thoroughly rubbed. Workmanship: Good. Technical details: Marks of a simple wheel and negative marks of straw on both surfaces. Preservation: Complete. Description: The disc was made on a body sherd of a jug and is roughly pentagonal. Typology: Pentagonal. Date: The original jug must date from the 14th century BCE, since the disc was found on a floor of that date. Archaeological context: Locus 1933 is a kitchen floor on the north of the Amarna period Building 1348 East Lower (Vol. I, Chapter 5, IX.1.1.1) of Stratum IX Phase 1 . Discussion 1 All the Late Bronze Age discs were made on locally made Egyptian vessels. 2 During the Iron Age I the discs were made only from contemporary vessels, though unfortunately not on their painted parts.9 3 Two discs were found in pits (including the 247</page><page sequence="241">CHAPTER TWENTY-TWO crater), and two in contexts that may be mixed with pits, which may indicate the function of these pits, or alternatively show that the discs were used only once. 4 Only one disc was found on a floor, which is dated to the Amarna period. 5 The Philistine products too were made from loessy clays, showing that they were locally made products. C. SCRAPERS (Nos. 20-29) Ten scrapers10 of various shapes11 were found at the site. Typologically they could be divided into three main groups: Group A, made from body sherds that were reshaped into a rectangular,12 trapezoid13 or triangular14 shape; Group B, made of body sherds that were reshaped into a rectangular,15 triangular16 or oval17 shape, but with a perforation that permitted the attaching of a stick or served as a finger grip;18 and Group C, ad hoc shapes resulting from the use of particular parts of the original vessels such as rims, handles or areas of varying thickness.19 Six were made on body fragments of closed vessels and four on those of open vessels. In four cases it was possible to discern from which part of the vessel our specimen originated; two are rim fragments and two are diagnostic body sherds.20 The working edges of all specimens are shown on the left, both in profile and from the front.21 20. Scraper (Reg. No. 298/1; Locus 511; Fig. 223:1) Material : Light brown loessy clay; same color on external surface, internal surface darker. Dimensions : L 5.5+ cm., W 4.9 cm., T 0.8-0.85 cm., Wt 31.7 g. Method of manufacture : The original vessel, a jar, was wheelmade, self-slipped and fired. The secondary object was chiseled and rubbed. Workmanship : Good. Technical details : Rubbed on three sides. Preservation : Broken; only one edge is preserved. Description : Made from a body sherd of a closed vessel. Typology : Rectangular. Since it is not clear whether it had a hole, it could belong to either Group A or Group B. Date : The original jar could belong to any stratum at the site. Archaeological context Locus 5 1 1 is mixed with the Stratum I wadi. 21. Scraper (Reg. No. surface find; Locus 508; Fig. 223:2; Photo 22.6) Material : Grayish loessy clay; same color on external surface, internal surface darker. Dimensions : L 8 cm., W 5.6+ cm., T 0.65-0.7 cm., Wt 33.6 g. Method of manufacture : The original vessel, a jar, was wheelmade and fired. The temper was chopped straw. The secondary object was chiseled and rubbed. Workmanship: Good. Technical details : Marks of a simple wheel and negative marks of straw on both surfaces. It is rubbed on all sides. Preservation : Broken diagonally. It seems that the break was polished so as to allow a finger to rest on it and to press it towards the object being scraped. Description : Made from a body sherd of a closed vessel. Typology : In its final shape this object belongs to Group C, the ad hoc group. Date : The original jar belongs to the locally made Egyptian assemblage produced during the 13th century BCE (Strata VI-IV). Archaeological context : Locus 508 is a mixed topsoil locus. This square yielded traces of Strata VI-III and I, and its southwest corner is just 1 m northeast of the in situ coffin base 1 106 of Stratum V. Photo 22.6.

Technical details: Marks of a simple wheel, marks of smoothing by vegetation and negative marks of straw on both surfaces. Only the round side was rubbed. Preservation: Complete. Description: Made from a rim and wall fragment of a cooking pot. Typology: Belongs to Group C. Date: The original vessel belongs to the locally made hybrid Egyptian/Canaanite assemblage produced during the 13th century BCE (Strata VI-IV). Archaeological context: Locus 5 12 is a Stratum V kiln (Vol . I , Chapter 5 , V. 1 .4) . It is possible that both the original and the secondary uses of our object occurred during the same stratum (V). 29. Scraper (Reg. No. 3708/3; Locus 1326; Fig. 22.3:9) Material: Light reddish clay; light yellow slip on internal surface, heavy yellow slip with light brown painted horizontal stripes on external surface. Dimensions: L 14 cm., W 9.2 cm., T 0.6 cm., Wt 197.4+ g. Method of manufacture: The original vessel, a Philistine krater, was wheelmade and fired. Workmanship: Good. Technical details: Marks of a simple wheel and marks of smoothing by vegetation on both surfaces. It is rubbed only on one long edge. Preservation: Almost complete; part of the working edge is missing. Description: Made from a body sherd of a krater with attached horizontal handle. Typology: Belongs to Group C. Date: The original vessel was made during the Iron Age I. Archaeological context: Locus 1 326 is a Stratum III pit (Vol . I , Chapter 5 , III . 1 .3) . We may therefore attribute both the original and the secondary uses of our object to the same stratum (III). Discussion 1 These scrapers are an additional indication of the existence of a pottery industry at the site. 2 These objects fit well with the dates of the kilns. None was found in the Amarna stratum, five belong to strata of the Ramesside period, and only one or two belong to the Iron Age I. 3 The potters apparently used only fragments of vessels of contemporary date. No distinctive Amarna sherd was used during the Ramesside period, and the only object from an Iron Age I context is indeed from a vessel of the same date. 4 Despite the rich variety of scrapers found at the site, some Group A shapes known from other sites are lacking, such as oval (which seem to belong to the Middle Bronze Age),22 loaf-shaped23 and stele-shaped.24 Likewise, no specimens with the incised decoration that seems to belong to the Iron Age II25 were found. 5 The spatial distribution of all ten objects is very convincing. Those that were excavated in clear archaeological contexts were found in installations of industrial nature: four in pits, one in a kiln and one in the "water installation." None was found in a domestic context. The four that were found in mixed contexts are geographically very close to the potters' installations. It seems likely that the potters (at least in the excavated area) made mainly molded figurines and pottery coffins. The only two wasters known from the site (Reg. Nos. 6097 and 6318/4) were found in the oval Pit 1913 of Stratum V (Vol. I, Chapter 5, V.l. 6.2; Chapter 7), and both seem to have originated in one place. D. BUTTON (No. 30) Only one disc with two holes made of pottery in secondary use was found in the excavations (for similar clay items in primary use, identified as loomweights, see Chapter 23, Nos. 6-7). Such objects are usually identified as buttons (Macalister 1912: Vol. I: 95 = Vol. Ill: PI. 24:33; Vol. II: 90 = Vol. III: PI. 132:37-38). They occur in Palestine from the Middle Bronze Age II (Mallet 1988: 36; Figs. 12:6, 56 and 22:1-3 = Pis. 81:5-6 and 82:8) up to the Iron Age II (Lamon and Shipton 1939: PI. 102: 15-16) and onwards. An object of this kind was found at Memphis (Anthes et al. 1965: 134, Pl. 50a 252</page><page sequence="246">SECONDARY USE OF FRAGMENTS OF POTTERY VESSELS [No. 320]). An alternative interpretation, suggested by Petrie and fully discussed by Van Beek, is that such objects were actually toys or "buzzes" (Petrie 1928: 18, § 39, PL 39:24-25; Sellers et al. 1968: 83; Van Beek 1989; Shanks 1991).26 30. Button (Reg. No. 3793/1; Locus 1323; Fig. 223.10; Photo 22.8) Material : Light reddish loessy clay; same color on both surfaces. Dimensions'. D 3.1-3.8 cm., T 0.6 cm., Wt 7.3 g. Method of manufacture: The original vessel, a bowl, was wheelmade and fired. The temper was chopped straw. The secondary object was chiseled and rubbed. Two holes were drilled, each from both directions.27 Workmanship: Good. Technical details: Marks of a simple wheel, marks of smoothing by vegetation and negative marks of straw on both surfaces. Preservation: Complete. Description: The disc was made on a body fragment of a bowl. Typology: Hexagonal. Date: The original bowl belongs to the locally made Egyptian assemblage produced during the 13th century BCE (Strata VI-IV). Archaeological context: Locus 1 323 (Vol. I, Chapter 5, VI .2) is part of the Stratum VI crater fill. We may therefore attribute both the original and the secondary uses of our object to the same stratum (VI). E. GAMING PIECE (No. 31) Only one object made of pottery in secondary use that could be identified as a gaming piece was found at the site (for a gaming piece made of clay, see Chapter 23,No.5).28 31. Gaming piece (Reg. No. 6049; Locus 1363; Fig. 223.11; Photo 22.9) Material: Yellowish-red loessy clay. Dimensions: D 2.75 cm., T 0.8 cm. Method of manufacture: The original vessel, ajar or jug, was wheelmade and fired. The secondary object was chiseled and rubbed. The external face was incised. Workmanship: Good. Preservation: Complete. Description: The gaming piece was made on a body sherd of a closed vessel. Typology: Rounded. The pattern may represent four lotus flowers and may be compared with an ivory button from Gezer (Macalister 1912: Vol. II: 90-92: Vol. III: PI. 132:40-41,49). Date: If the Amarna date proposed for our object is the correct one, this object may be compared with those found in the dwelling quarter at Sesebi (Peterson 1967: 9-10, 111. 13 upper [MM 30652]; 13, 111. 29 upper, 15 [MM 30651 and 30650]). Archaeological context: Unfortunately, full documentation for this object was not available. Locus 1 363 Lower is a floor attributed to Stratum IX (the Amarna period) ; see Vol . I , Chapter 5 , IX . 1 . 1 . 1 . Locus 1 363 Upper is a floor attributed to Stratum VI ; see Vol . I , Chapter 5 , VI . 1 . 1 . 1 . CONCLUSIONS The 3 1 objects described here have several features in common. 1 Most were made on fragments of locally made vessels, both Egyptian and Philistine, indicating that the preparation for secondary usage was also carried out at the site.

NOTES 1 The terms used here for the Egyptian vessels are more general than those used in recent publications (e.g. Aston 1998). On the local manufacture of Egyptian-style pottery at the site, see above, Chapter 3; Yellin et al. 1986. 2 Cf. Tufnell et al. 1940: 82, Pl. 30:39. Such ribbing can also be noted on the bowl of a stand from Tell el-' Ajjul (Petrie 1934: PL 48 [31M2]). 3 For such bowls see Artzy 1991: 204, Pis. 52:b, 53:a. 4 For such a suggestion see Yadin et al. 1960: Pl. 105:38. 5 Such as those found at Amarna (Boy ce 1995: 95, Fig. 2.27 [9180 and 9231], 96). 6 For a different view, that simple discs may also be identified as gaming counters, see Bieńkowski 1995: 90, Fig. 9.33.1-2; Daviau et al. 2002: 165-66, 254, Fig. 2.125:1-8. 7 Such as those found at Gezer (Dever et al. 1986: Pis. 58:5, 59: 12), Stratum VII at Beth-Shean (James 256</page><page sequence="250">SECONDARY USE OF FRAGMENTS OF POTTERY VESSELS and McGovern 1993: 191, Fig. 120:1-3) and Deir el-Ballas (Lacovara 1990: 42, Fig. 2.3 .a). 8 For additional suggestions identifying them as weights, see Sellers et al. 1968: 83; James and McGovern 1993: 191. 9 Discs made on decorated Bichrome Philistine body sherds were found at Ashdod (Dothan and Porath 1993: 79, Fig. 29:6, PI. 44:5). 10 The term "scraper" (Petrie 1952: 19, PI. 24:41) has been adopted by us for this type of object, since there is wide consensus among scholars that it was used in pottery manufacture to scrape the vessel's surface. Additional suggested functions in the pottery industry are: 1) polisher (Scheffer 1949: 232; Naveh 1962: 101-101, n. 17,Fig.4:21;Briendand Humbert 1980: PI. 52:7-8; Ballet and Picon 1990: 88; Brandl 1993: 231-32; Dothan and Porath 1993: 98-100, Fig. 44:25); 2) rib for the shaping of the interior of large bowls (Rose 1989: 89); 3) rib for the production of particular vessel profiles (Magrill andMiddleton 1997: 71). Other suggested functions that are not connected to the pottery industry are: 1) jar-stopper (Macalister 1912: Vol. II: 169, 221, Vol. III: PI. 191:5, 15); 2) female idol (Schaeffer 1949: 232 [mentioned earlier in Guy 1938: 7]); 3) implements used by weavers (Tufnell 1953: 250, Pis. 41:12, 58:2; 1958: 91); 4) grip for the pump drill (Anthes et al. 1959: 48, Pis. 30a, No. 222; 30b, Nos. 222-23). 11 For this reason the term "felucca" (boat-shaped) given by the Egyptian workers at Megiddo (Guy 1938: 7) to their oval scraper cannot be used as a general term. 12 See Ballet and Picon 1990: 88, Fig. 40:5. 13 See Franken 1974: 165, Fig. 20:5; 167, Fig. 22:7. 14 See Tufnell 1958: PI. 49: 15 (lower left); Ballet and Picon 1990: 88, Fig. 40:6. 15 See Guy 1938: PL 158:1; Schaeffer 1949: 232, Fig. 98: 1,4-5,9; Tufnell 1953: Pis. 41:12, 58:2; Naveh 1962: 100-101, Fig. 4:21 ; Pritchard eí al. 1975:71, Figs. 29:7, 62:9; Pritchard 1988: 123, Fig. 37:20. 16 See Schaeffer 1949: 232, Fig. 98:3, 6-8, 10; Pritchard et al. 1975: 66, Figs. 29:6, 62: 10; Pritchard 1978: 80-81, Fig. 49. 17 See Macalister 1912: Vol. II: 169, 221; Vol. Ill: PI. 191:5, 15; Guy 1938: PI. 158:18, 20; Schaeffer 1949: 232, Fig. 98:2, 11-12; Franken 1985: 36, Fig. 7; Bachi 1971: 100, Fig. 44:25; Brandl 1993: 23 1-32, Figs. 9.6: 1-4, 9.8:4; and most probably also Magrill and Middleton 1997: 68, Fig. 1 (upper row except for the one on the left).

CLAY PRODUCTS INTRODUCTION Among the finds of the excavations at Deir el- Balah are several objects made of unfired or fired clay. The objects made of unfired clay are a jar stopper, a jar sealing and a fragment of roofing material.1 Those made of fired clay are a baking disc, a gaming piece, two loomweights and a mold.2 The objects were photographed by Zev Radovan and drawn by Sarah Halbreich under the author's guidance. DESCRIPTION A. UNFIRED CLAY PRODUCTS 1. Jar stopper (Reg. No. 3725; Locus 1342; Photo 23.1) The term "jar stopper" is used here to define an object that was used more than once to plug an individual storage jar.3 Material : Light brown loessy clay. Photo 23.1 . Jar stopper (No. 1). Dimensions : D (max.) 14 cm., (min.) 12.5 cm.; H 4.5 cm. (upper part 2.5 cm., lower part 2 cm.). Method of manufacture : The lower part was molded into a bowl, while the upper part was shaped by hand. Workmanship : Good. Technical details : Negative marks of straw on the surface. Preservation : Broken; less than a quarter is preserved. Description : A rounded object whose profile resembles two bowls of unequal size, the larger one lying upside down on top of the smaller. The upper part of the stopper is larger since it was spread on top of the rim of the mold (a bowl). A close parallel was found in the Late Bronze Age II temple at Tell Deir 'Alia (Franken 1992: 66, Fig. 4-23:33). Three more were found in Stratum VII at Beth-Shean (James and McGovern 1993a: 80, Fig. 27:5). Typology : Squat; both the upper and lower parts are almost equal in height. Date : This object is related stratigraphically to the earliest stratum at the site and therefore should be dated to the 14th century BCE. Likewise, the parallels from Tell Deir 'Alia and Beth-Shean are dated to the 13th century BCE.4 Archaeological context: Locus 1342 is a Stratum IX Phase 1 surface (Vol. I, Chapter 5, IX .5.1 .3.7). 2. Fragment of jar sealing (Reg. No. 3899/1; Locus 1374; Photo 23.2) The term "jar sealing" is used here to denote an object that was used to seal a storage jar only once. Material : Dark brown loessy clay. 259</page><page sequence="252">CHAPTER TWENTY-THREE Dimensions'. D ca. 8 cm.; H 3.3+ cm. Method of manufacture: Handmade. The sealing was made by pressing clay into the neck of a medium-sized storage jar. The temper was chopped straw and sand. Workmanship : Good. Technical details : There are negative marks of straw on both surfaces as well as in the section. The top includes two finger impressions giving the spaces between them the shape of ridges, most probably a preparation for additional plaster.5 Preservation : Broken; less than half has survived and even the lower part of the profile is missing. Description : A rounded object with a concave- convex profile. The lower part is smooth and fits the inner face of a funnel-shaped jar neck. The upper part is slightly convex with "ridges" for additional plaster. From its shape it is clear that the sealing was created to be used only once. Typology : Egyptian; concave-convex profile. Date : The object should be dated to the Late Bronze Age II, 14th or 13th century BCE. Archaeological context : Locus 1374 is a topsoil locus in Square XX/9. Under it were found intermingled architectural elements of two periods (Locus 1381 , a surface dated to Stratum IX, Phase 1 , and Locus 1 378 , part of the crater fill of Stratum VI) and Pit 1383, which belongs to one of the three Ramesside strata (VI-IV). Photo 23.2. Jar sealing (No. 2). 3. Fragment of reed-impressed roofing material (Reg. No. 732; Locus 597; Fig. 23.1:1; Photo 233) This fragment of building material, though it does not belong to a portable object, is discussed in this chapter since its exact stratigraphie context is not clear. Material : Yellowish-pink loessy clay. Dimensions'. L (extant) 8.3 cm.6; W (extant) 8.7 cm.; T 3.5 cm. Method of manufacture : The wet clay was spread onto a layer of reeds that was placed on the roof beams. Workmanship: Good. Technical details: Negative marks of straw on both surfaces. Preservation: Broken; only a small fragment is preserved. Description: Lower surface: impressions of ten parallel reeds, each one appearing clearly.7 Upper surface: relatively smooth. Typology: Architectural elements of this kind are known in both Egypt8 and Canaan.9 In Egypt traces of such elements were found at XVIIIth Dynasty sites such as Amarna (Peet and Woolley 1 923 : 57-5 8 , Photo 23 .3 . Fragment of reed-impressed roofing material (No. 3). 260</page><page sequence="253">CLAY AND MUD PRODUCTS Fig. 6; Stevenson Smith 1965: 171-72, Fig. 60:A; Kemp and Bomann 1985: 1, 8-12; Kemp et al. 1986: 8-1 1 , 18-19, 21-24) and Malkata, the Palace of Amenhotep III (Stevenson Smith 1965: 171-72, Fig. 60:C-E). In Canaan traces of such elements were found in contexts dated to the Middle Bronze Age and onward, such as Tell el-Far' ah North (MB II) (Mallet 1988: Fig. 23:2, PI. 82:6-7); Beth-Shean (Late Bronze Age II) (James and McGovern 1993b: 191 , Fig. 7:a-b); Tell Keisan (Iron Age I) (Humbert 1980: 23-24, Figs. 7-8); Tel Qiri (Iron Age I) (Portugali 1987: 133-34, Photo 61, Plan 60); and Tel Dan (Iron Age I) (Biran 1994: 135, 138,111. 97). Date : Although the fragment was found in a mixed context, it apparently originated in Stratum V or earlier, since Strata IV-I lack any architectural construction. That is to say, it may be dated to either the 14th or the 13th century BCE. Archaeological context : Locus 597 (Squares A-B/10) is a mixed locus that may contain material from the Stratum I Wadi, Pit 1231 of Stratum IV and Pit 1207 of Stratum V. B. FIRED CLAY PRODUCTS 4. Fragment of baking disc (Reg. No. 2751; Locus 1153; Fig. 23.1:2; Photo 23.4) Clay objects of this type are quite rare and appear only sporadically in archaeological publications. Several different suggestions for its function have been made. The new fragment from Deir el-Balah and an ethnographic parallel enable us to offer a new interpretation. Material: Light brown loessy clay. Dimensions : T (max.) disc 2.7 cm.; D 18 cm. (handle 4 cm.). Method of manufacture : Handmade. The disc was formed by pressing two separate layers onto one another. A cylindrical or conical handle was then attached to the lower face of the disc. The final stage Fig. 23.1 . Clay products. 261</page><page sequence="254">CHAPTER TWENTY-THREE Photo 23.4. Fragment of baking disc (No. 4). was the making of small depressions on the entire upper face of the disc. Well fired. Workmanship : Good. Technical details : The two separate layers could be observed in the inner vertical "walls" of the fragment that serve as cross-sections. Likewise, part of the margin of the area around the handle has survived. Except for a small area, the whole fragment is blackened as a result of use in close proximity to fire or burning charcoal. Preservation : Fragmentary; only a quarter of the disc has survived. Description : When complete, the object looked like a large clay nail, whose upper face was entirely occupied by small depressions. Such objects are known from several Canaanite sites, such as Gezer (Macalister 1912: Vol. II: 120, Fig. 299); Beth Shemesh (Grant 1932: 72-73, PI. 44:30); Byblos, three examples (Dunand 1937: PI. 148:1533 and 1939: 102; 1954: 403, Fig. 426, No. 10898; 1958: 522-23, Fig. 590, No. 12418); Lachish, two examples (Tufnell et al. 1940: 68, Pl. 28:9-10); Ugarit, 19 examples (Virolleaud 1938: 140-41 ; Schaeffer 1949: Figs. 72: 13, 73:8; Matoïan and Boquillon 2001: 183-90); Tell Abu Hureira (Aharoni and Amiran 1952: 58-59, Fig. 4); and Ras el-Basit (Courbin 1986-1987: 108). They were given the following identifications: 1 Brush handles (Macalister 1912: Vol. II: 120, Fig. 299; Schaeffer 1949: Figs. 72:8, 73:13). 2 Bread stamps (Aharoni" and Amiran 1952: 58-59, Fig. 4). 3 Votive nails (Virolleaud 1938: 140; Schaeffer 1949: Figs. 72:8, 73:13). 4 Decorative wall nails (Matoïan and Boquillon 2001: 185-86). 5 Door peg sealings {ibid). 6 Symbolic signs (ibid.). None of these suggestions seems convincing, for the following reasons: 1 The depressions are too large (4-5 mm.) and too shallow (2.5-3.5 mm.) for the bristles of a brush. Moreover, brush handles are generally rectangular rather than rounded. 2 The depressions, which are similar on all the parallels, would create a raised decoration rather than a depressed one in bread. 3 The phenomena represented by identifications 3-6 are unknown in Canaan. The fragment from Deir el-Balah adds a new feature to this class of objects: it is the only clay product of its type found in situ that is blackened, implying that it was close to a fire during its use. This observation, together with the other two typical features (the rounded shape and the depressions on its upper face), points clearly to the conclusion that it functioned similarly to Canaanite and Israelite baking trays. An ethnographic analogy that may support this suggestion is the metal baking disc (Arabic zantuca) used by the local Arabs during the previous century (Avitzur 1976: 107, 111. 284). Typology : Mushroom-shaped. Date : The object is related stratigraphically to the earliest stratum at the site and should therefore 262</page><page sequence="255">CLAY AND MUD PRODUCTS be dated to the 14th century BCE. This date is supported by the finds from Ugarit, which were related to "Ugarit Recent 3" (1365-1200 BCE) (Schaeffer 1949: Figs. 72:13, 73:8). Archaeological context Locus 1 153 (Vol. I, Chapter 5 , IX .5 . 1 .2 . 1 ) is one of two or three Stratum IX Phase 1 pits that predate the main architectural activity. 5. Gaming piece (Reg. No. 3522; Locus 1305; Fig. 23.1:3; Photo 23.5) Only one gaming piece made of clay was found in the excavations at Deir el-Balah.10 Two groups of such objects, each containing five items, made of bone and stone were found in two coffins at the cemetery of the site (Dothan et al. 1979: 24-25, 42^3). Material: Light reddish loessy clay; lower surface light brown, yellowish slip on upper surface. Dimensions'. D 27-28 mm.; T 6.5 mm. Method of manufacture : Handmade, slipped, well fired and incised; chopped straw temper. Workmanship : Good. Technical details : Negative marks of straw on all surfaces. Preservation : Complete. Description: A lentoid disc whose upper, slipped face contains four incisions made after firing. Typology: Incisions consisting of two pairs of parallel lines are a well-known type in the site (Dothan et al. 1979: 24-24, Ills. 44^6, 51-53). A variant with four parallel incisions was found at Sesebi (Peterson 1967: 9-10, 111. 13 upper [MM 30652]). Date: Late Bronze Age. In view of its resemblance to finds from the cemetery, this object may originate in one of the 13th century BCE strata at the site (VI-IV). However, the clay parallel from Sesebi may hint at an earlier date, i.e. the Amarna period Photo 23.5. Gaming piece (No. 5). Stratum IX Phase 1 . Archaeological context: Locus 1305 is mixed with Pit 1305 A of Stratum IV. Loomweights Two clay loomweights were found in the Deir el- Balah excavations. At first sight these objects are similar to buttons made from fragments of pottery vessels in secondary use (for an example from Deir el-Balah, see Chapter 22, No. 30). However, more careful observation shows that they differ from the buttons in several aspects: 1 They were made for a specific purpose in primary use. 2 Their holes are narrower. 3 The holes were made before firing. 4 They are not discs but rather rounded trapezoids. 5 Their thickness is not uniform since their section is oval or lentoid. 6 They are handmade. Such objects are known in the Aegean world from the middle of the second millennium BCE (see for example Anderson 1954: 171-72, Fig. 22; Sackett and Popham 1970: 240, No. 15, Pl. 55e, lower left corner). In Canaan they appear during the Late Bronze Age II (Karon 1992: 42, Fig. 17:7)n and continue into the Iron Age II (Schumacher 1908: 108, PI. 34:f; Lamon and Shipton 1939: PI. 102:17-18,20; Shamir 1996: 148^9, 160, 167, Fig. 22:1). 6. Loomweight (Reg. No. 493; Locus 531; Fig. 23.1:4; Photo 23.6) Material: Yellowish loessy clay; surfaces completely blackened. Dimensions: D 29-29.5 mm.; T 8 mm.; D of holes 2.5 mm. Photo 23.6. Loomweight (No. 6). 263</page><page sequence="256">CHAPTER TWENTY-THREE Method of manufacture : Handmade, well fired; chopped straw temper. Workmanship : Good. Technical details : Negative marks of straw on all surfaces and in the section. Preservation : Almost complete; it was broken during the excavations and restored. Description : A rounded trapezoid with an oval profile; two closely spaced perforations at a slightly diagonal angle. Typology : Oval profile. Date : Late Bronze Age II, somewhere during the 13th century BCE on the basis of its stratigraphical context. Archaeological context : Locus 531 is an ash accumulation mixed with Pit 1170 of Stratum IV and to a lesser degree with Pit 530 of Stratum VI. 7.

Date: Most probably Late Bronze Age II, like the previous item. Archaeological context: Unknown. Photo 23.7. Loomweight (No. 7). 8. Fragment of mold for metal production (Reg. No. 2709; Locus 1063; Fig. 23.1:6; Photo 23.8) This fired clay fragment, possibly of a mold for metal production, is unique among the finds from the excavations at Deir el-Balah. Material: Yellowish loessy clay. Dimensions: L 1.7+ cm.; W 3.9 cm.; H 2.2 cm. Method of manufacture: Handmade. The base was made on papyrus (?) and the "walls" by pressure of a piece of straw matting. Workmanship: Mediocre. Technical details: The base shows prints of papyrus (?), while the sides show prints of straw matting. The inside and the upper part of the outside have been blackened by contact with a hot (metallic?) liquid. Preservation: Broken; only one "wall," its corners and a segment of the base are preserved. Description: The fragment seems to belong to a square or rectangular basin used as a mold; the exact shape of the molded product cannot be established. Typology: Square or rectangular mold. Date: A terminus ad quem early in the 13th century BCE is provided by its archaeological context. However, a 14th-century date cannot be ruled out. Archaeological context: Locus 1063 is a pit belonging to the earlier phase of Stratum VI (Vol. I, Chapter 5, VI.l. 6.8). CONCLUSIONS Seven objects and an additional architectural component have been described here. Most of them belong to the Canaanite sphere . As such , they represent the impact of the local traditions on the New Kingdom settlements that existed at Deir el-Balah. Photo 23.8.

MUD PRODUCTS INTRODUCTION The objects found in the excavations at Deir el- Balah also include a few items made of unfired mud. All of these, six in number, are in fact various components of New Kingdom jar and jug sealings.12 Stamped jar sealings have been found in Canaan in only two sites, both known to have housed Egyptian garrisons: Tell el-Far'ah (S) (Starkey and Harding 1932: 27, 29, PI. 41: 5-6 = Shuval 1990: 140, Nos. 36-37) and Beth Shean (James and McGovern 1993a: 80, Fig. 27:6). For unstamped jar sealings found in the northern part of the country, see Loud 1948: PI. 256: 16; Briend 1980: PI. 82:1. DESCRIPTION A. JAR SEALINGS The jar sealings of the New Kingdom are known mainly from Tell el-Amarna (Petrie 1894: 30, PI. 21; Gunn 1923: 161-164, PI. 55; Fairman 1933: 107-108, PI. 57:A-K; 1951: 143-150, Pis. 81-83; Rose 1995); from various sites in Thebes, i.e. the Ramesseum (Quibell 1898: 15-16, PI. 11), the Valley of the Kings (Daressy 1902: 277-279, PI. 47; Hope 1993; Brock 1995: 55, Fig. 6:A-C), Qurneh (Petrie and Walker 1909: 13-14, PI. 46), Deir el-Medineh (Bruyère 1928: 13, Fig. 5:F; 54, Fig. 43; 1952: 52-54, Fig. 39; Nagel 1929: 49, Fig. 20:1) and Malkata (Hayes 1951: 156-162, 169-174; Hope 1977; Leahy 1978: 29^4, Pis. 15-24)13; and from Buhen (Smith 1976: 162-75, Pis. 45^18; 180-81, PI. 49). All of these were usually used only once14 and stamped by seals.15 1. Fragment of jar sealing (Reg. No. 2162/1; Locus 1013; Fig. 23.2:1; Photo 23.9) Material : Dark gray mud.

CONCLUSIONS The inclusion of mica in the temper of the mud sealings is an indication that that they originated elsewhere, probably in Egypt. Many sealings from Malkata are reported as including mica in their temper (Hope 1977: 10-12). Four of these mud objects were found in a single context: Locus 1013, a pit of Stratum IX Phase 1 . One of the two Amarna-period bullae was also found in this pit, providing one of the criteria for its dating (see Chapter 18, No. 1). It was suggested there that this pit was a favissa.

NOTES 1 The most common unfired clay products found at the site are of course the bricks. 2 Additional types of fired clay products are the pottery figurines and their molds found in Stratum VI (Chapter 17) and the stamp seal (Chapter 18). 3 For such a jar stopper from Aby dos, see Peet and Loat 1913: PI. 6:38 and from Amarna, see Peet and Wool ley 1923: 90 [No. 23]; El-Khouly and Martin 1987:5 [No. 20], PI. 22:20. 4 During the Iron Age, some clay jar stoppers took on the shape of stoppers made of stone. Their lower parts were shaved by sharp tools and became cylindrical (Aharoni 1975: 17, Pis. 15:1,34:11,45:9 = IAA No. 78-2816). 5 Sealings with ridges were found at Tell el-Amarna (Fairman 1951:144, PI. 83:Bi) and Malkata (Hope 1977: 17, Fig. 7:c-d). 6 The length dimension of the fragment was determined by the direction of the reed impressions. 7 Compare with Humbert 1980: 24, Fig. 8. 8 For a general discussion of roofing in Egypt and its decoration, see Stevenson Smith 1965: 171-72, Fig. 60 A. 9 For a general discussion of the roofing of massive structures in Canaan and ancient Israel, see Netzer 1992: 23-25, Fig. 8. 10 Another gaming piece made from a pottery vessel fragment in secondary use is discussed in Chapter 22 (No. 31). 1 1 This object, identified in the publication as a button, has four holes. 12 An additional type of unfired mud product is represented by the two bullae described by B. Brandl in Chapter 18. 13 An additional jar sealing of Ahmose from Deir el- Ballas is mentioned by Laco vara (1981: 121). 14 For the evidence for re-use of sealed and stamped jars, see Hope 1977: 8. 15 For unstamped sealings see Hope 1993: 113 (from 1 1 small or miniature vessels). 16 Several reed stoppers were found at Malkata (Hope 1977: 14, Figs. 7:a, 8:a-b, Pis.

Rosen and Adrian Nigel Goring-Morris At the time of writing, the lithic assemblage from Deir el-Balah was one of the few collections of its kind from the Late Bronze Age. As such, it can provide important information on the technology of that period and on the replacement of flint tools by metal ones. Furthermore, the sample is large enough to allow fairly reliable interphase and intersite comparison. Since the site is stratigraphically unmixed and has been reliably dated to the 13th and 14th centuries BCE, the assemblage provides a relatively unbiased sample of the flint tools used in that period. Although sediments were not sieved, all flints recognized were collected. Since microliths are not a major component of Late Bronze Age assemblages, it may be assumed that the sample is not significantly biased. DESCRIPTION Of the 658 flints recovered, 293 show signs of intentional modification and were classified as tools (Table 24.1). Scrapers (8). The scraper class comprised * This manuscript was first submitted for publication in 1 980 and then revised in 1 983 . Since then , a great deal of research has been conducted on Bronze Age lithic assemblages (see especially Rosen 1997 and references). This research has spanned major changes in methods, huge increases in data, and important advances in theory and understanding. Since reworking of the material was not an option available to us, we deemed it best to publish the report as it was written, with only minor modifications. Table 24.1 . Flint tools.

Of these, three were on blades. Borers ( 1 ). The single borer was manufactured on a pointed flake and exhibits abrupt retouching on one edge of the bit and a notch on the opposing side (Fig. 24.1:7). Blade tools (14). Three blade tools exhibit regular, nibbled retouch. Nine others display single truncations.

The lithic assemblage. 274</page><page sequence="267">THE LITHIC ASSEMBLAGE Hammerstones (9). Nine hammerstones and fragments made from wadi cobbles were recovered. Sickle blade segments (210). The most characteristic feature of flint sickles is the presence of sickle sheen or gloss, the result of the smearing of plant silicas on the working edges of the blades (Witthoft 1967; Semeno v 1976). Only 13 of the pieces classified as sickles totally lacked gloss, although 12 exhibited only minimal luster. The rest showed relatively high gloss. Only one piece showed gloss on two edges. Of the 210 sickle blades, 161 were unbroken. Of these, 147 had quadrilateral/parallelogram medial sections, typologically characteristic of the Late Bronze Age (Fig. 24.1:1-6). These average 5.0 X 3.6 X 0.9 cm. in dimensions. Of these, 85 are parallelogram in shape, 31 are quadrilateral and 20 are rectangular. Dorsal serration working edge retouch is found on 134 of the pieces and other retouch varies from edge damage to sharpening. All but three of the pieces are bitruncated and 119 are backed or partially backed. Remains of hafting adhesive are found on 14 pieces, mostly along the backed edge; on one of these pieces a bone chip from the handle was still attached. The adhesive does not appear to be bitumen, but resembles that used for hafting arrowheads in Egyptian Protodynastic contexts (Clark et al. 1974) and similar material from the Sinai Epipaleolithic, which was identified as lime plaster (Bar-Yosef and Goring-Morris 1977; Tomenchuk 1983; Kingery et al. 1988). It seems to be at least partially calcareous in nature. Twenty-three pieces are end sections, triangular or subtriangular in shape and technologically equivalent to the medial sections (Fig. 24.1:10). The ratio of medial to end sections is 6.4: 1 , giving an approximate average length of 37 cm. to each complete sickle. This is not significantly longer than the length of the sickles described by Gilead (1973) in his review of the flints from Tel Nagila and Har Yeruham. Intrusive elements included two Canaanean sickle segments, both in slightly abraded condition, and one with gloss on both edges. These are typical of the Early Bronze Age. Two Pottery Neolithic sickle segments were also recovered, one with fine denticulated retouch and straight truncations and the second (broken) with coarse denticulation typical of the Yarmukian and Jericho IX. One miscellaneous sickle shows partial backing on a flake. Miscellaneous trimmed pieces (21). Two fragments were bifacially and three unifacially retouched. Two pieces show truncations and 12 flakes show miscellaneous retouch. Varia (8). Two fragments exhibit polish. One scraper, manufactured on a flat chunk with cortex on both sides, vaguely resembles a tabular scraper. One broken rectangular piece of mottled flint shows semi-invasive pressure flaking retouch. One retouched bladelet, one Pottery Neolithic arrowhead and one Pre-Pottery Neolithic arrowhead were also recovered. Debitage. This category consisted of 107 plain flakes, 50 primary flakes, 36 blades, 155 pieces of debris (chunks, shatter and chips) and 1 1 cores. Of the cores, 10 are small, irregular flake cores and the eleventh is a nearly exhausted bladelet core, clearly intrusive. None are appropriate to the production of the blade flakes required for sickle manufacture. Included among the flakes are a small obsidian flake and a pièce esquillée, both probably Neolithic. The blade category includes a broken Canaanean blade and 11 possibly utilized blades. The blades are generally irregular and most were probably not produced from prepared blade cores. DISCUSSION The absence of blade cores suitable for the production of sickle segments and the generally low number of flakes suitable for use as blanks imply that the sickle blades from Deir el-Balah were manufactured elsewhere. This is not surprising, considering the distance from available raw material. The variability in the size of the segments and in the angle of the truncations suggests that the sickles were produced as complete composite tools and were brought to Deir el-Balah as such, with the flints already intact in their handles. In at least one case, the handle was of bone. This may be contrasted with the Early Bronze 275</page><page sequence="268">CHAPTER TWENTY-FOUR Age sickle industry, based on Canaanean blades. Although it is clear that Canaanean blades were trade items (Schick 1978; McConaughy 1979; Rosen 1983, 1997), it appears that in most cases the flint blanks for sickle manufacture, rather than the sickles themselves, were the items traded. The extremely high percentage of sickles in the Deir el-Balah assemblage is the consequence of two factors. First, it is clear that by the Late Bronze Age, the use of metal had become sufficiently common to displace flint in many day-to-day functions. The continued use of flint testifies to its availability as a raw material and the relative efficiency of its cutting edge for reaping grasses (Steensberg 1943; Coles 1973). Although the use of flint continues at most sites through the Iron Age, it is likely that its use was restricted to mundane, everyday activities. Given the nature of Deir el-Balah as an Egyptian outpost or military center, the use of flint for domestic purposes might have been even more restricted than at other settlements. Comparison with other sites provides not unexpected results. On a general level, the non- sickle assemblage, consisting of high percentages of ad hoc elements such as notches, denticulates and irregular scrapers, is similar to those of Gezer (post-Early Bronze Age) (Rosen 1983), the "Cow Site" (Rosen 1982a) and Tel Nagila (Gilead 1973). The sickles, however, show interesting parallels and contrasts. The length distribution from Deir el-Balah may be compared to the Middle Bronze Age assemblages from Gezer and Tel Nagila and the Iron Age assemblages from Gezer (Fig. 24.2). It is clear that the sickles from Deir el-Balah are significantly shorter than those of the Middle Fig. 24.2. Comparison of lithic assemblages from Gezer, Tel Nagila and Deir el-Balah. Bronze Age and longer than those from the Iron Age. Other data (Rosen 1982b) indicate that sickle length indeed decreases from the Middle Bronze through the Iron Age. In conclusion, it should be stressed that information about technology, trade, agriculture and chronology can be culled from good lithic collections.

Of the total assemblage, 16 items (mostly very small fragments) were unidentifiable and were discarded. The assemblage consists mainly of stone implements, but also includes bowls and plates and various objects of related nature. The majority are tools for splitting, crushing, grinding and making powder or paste, with a remarkably large number of quernstones. To avoid the interchangeable and often confusing usage of "quernstone" and "millstone" (Childe 1943; Forbes 1954), the term "quernstone" is used here to denote the push-action pair of stones, while "millstones" are all milling tools of the push, circular or rotary action varieties (quernstones, palettes, mortars, etc.). Millstones based on rotary motion are known from the second half of the first millennium BCE (Curwen 1941; Forbes 1954: 274; Avitzur 1976: 75) onwards. They have reportedly been found elsewhere as far back as Philistine times (Macalister 1912: 37, Fig. 299a; Childe 1943: 24), but these are in all probability not rotary millstones (Amiran 1956: 49). None were found at Deir el- Balah. The Catalogue, found at the end of this chapter, lists all 152 identified items arranged according to: a) The occupation levels of the site. The first three groups (Stratum IX, Strata VIII-VII and Strata VI-IV) include material from clean loci and from pits dug in the vicinity or inside the buildings. * This chapter has not been updated. Finds from later levels could not be so classified and appear along with earlier objects in the mixed and topsoil groups. Some of the latter, especially from the wadi area, may include specimens up to the Byzantine period. b) Rock types: beachrock, kurkar, basalt, limestone, a group of "sandwich" stones made up of layers of limestone and flint and a "miscellaneous" grouping of tools and other objects made of a variety of stones. c) Groupings of tools; bottoms and riders of quernstones, palettes and rubbing stones, mortars, bowls, etc. Bottoms and riders of quernstones were distinguished by the slight concavity of bottoms as against the slight convexity of riders, noticeable especially at the edges. An additional aid to differentiating bottoms from riders was the direction of scratch grooves on the working surface. The miscellaneous items are listed together at the end of each stratigraphie group. The right-hand column of the Catalogue refers to all other stone finds from a given locus in each stratigraphie group.. The Catalogue shows the preservation of the objects, whether whole, damaged or fragmentary, followed by the measurements of the maximal length, width and thickness. They were then classified by size, or in case of fragments, their original size was inferred with a fair amount of certainty. The parameter used was the length: up to 15 cm.: small; 15-20 cm.: medium; longer than 20 cm.: large. The variation in shape, especially among quernstones, is given by the object's type (outline) and cross-section.

In the Deir el-Balah assemblage the most numerous items are beachrock millstones, all quernstones. Beachrock, kurkar, limestone and "sandwich," and many of the miscellaneous stones, can be found near or within roaming distance of the site and can be considered as local stones, fashioned into implements by the artisans of Deir el-Balah. This, as well as finds from other sites such as Tel Michal (Singer- Avitz 1989: 350), contradicts the claim that in central Canaan no stones suitable for use as millstones were to be found (Dar 1 978: 28 1 ) and all were imported as finished products. However, the basalt stones were indeed imported, in all probability as finished products, mainly from northern regions. The "dike basalts" are the only ones that certainly originated in Central Sinai and are included here in the miscellaneous group. This group (see Table 25.2) includes local stones, some more common than others, and rocks which originate in more or less distant regions (the Negev and Sinai); among the latter, some are fairly common (sandstone), some much less accessible (schist), and some are rocks from Central Sinai either brought to Deir el-Balah by human agents or swept to its vicinity by the torrents of Wadi el- Arish or Wadi Besor. The only specimen originating in the West is the pumice stone. Known from the Mediterranean islands of Santorini and Lepari, it could have reached Canaan as merchandise (Wachsman 1990), but it could alternatively have drifted to its shores with the eastward currents of the sea. I.TOOLS 1. QUERNSTONES No dramatic changes have taken place in the basic principle and design of push querns since the Pre-Pottery Neolithic (Amiran 1956: 46; Avitzur 1976: 74), and although some improvements were introduced through the ages, they are considered to be of no particular chronological significance (Amiran 1956: 47; Lapp 1978: 110). In some rural and nomadic communities they were still being used up to modern times. Dar (1978: 282) notes that the Bedouin of Sinai had an active quarry until a few generations ago, and that the finished product was sold in the Beersheba and Gaza markets. The opinion that in ancient Egypt the push action was the predominant cereal milling method, as indicated in Egyptian models and paintings (Forbes 1954: 274), fits in with the Deir el-Balah assemblage, of which quernstones comprise the main bulk: 109 out of a total of 152 objects. Details are listed in Table 25 .3 . It is felt that the term "saddle quern," sometimes used for plain quernstones (Macalister 1912: 34; Curwen 1941; Toombs and Wright 1963: 39; Dever et al. 1986: Pl. 57:4), should be reserved for quernstone riders featuring a gripping ridge. Such specimens are known from Egypt (Forbes 1954: Fig. 176), but none were found at Deir el-Balah. 280</page><page sequence="272">STONE IMPLEMENTS AND RELATED OBJECTS Table 25.2.

Twenty-one are of the oblong-wide type, almost but not quite tray-like. They differ in size, thickness and cross-section (see Catalogue and Fig. 25.2:1-4). Riders: Of all the riders listed in the Catalogue, 53 are push quernstones. The others are usually small rubbing stones to be used with a variety of milling bottoms. Of the quernstones, 19 are of the oblong type (Fig. 25.1 : 1 , 5), 32 are bun-shaped (Fig. 25. 1 :2-', 6-7), one is rectangular (Fig. 25. 1 :8), and one resembles a bun section. Within these types, as in bottoms, are individual differences in size, thickness and cross-section. Most of the Deir el-Balah querns are made from local rocks (see Table 25.3), while 17 were made from imported basalt. An effort was made to compare the Deir el-Balah finds with more or less contemporary horizons at other sites. Quernstones 281</page><page sequence="273">CHAPTER TWENTY-FIVE from other sites are mostly basalt imports, although at Hazor, and perhaps also Megiddo, basalt can be considered local stone. Regardless of the rock used for their manufacture, the overall design and variations of quernstones do not differ from the Deir el-Balah assemblage. Quernstones similar to Fig. 25.2: 1 - 4 are reported from Hazor (some of them described as riders), all basalt (Yadin et al. 1961: Pis. CCII:26, CCVI: 17-20). A beachrock quern almost identical to Fig. 25.2:3 came from Tel Michal (Singer- Avitz 1989: PI. 76:7). Oblong quernstones were found at Megiddo (Loud 1948: PI. 264:2-3), one of "granite-like" and one of "coarse volcanic" stone, resembling Fig. 25.1:5. Bun-shaped querns like Fig. 25.1:2-4, 6-7 were also found at Tell el-Ful made of "fossilized lime" (Lapp 1978: PI. 24:3) and at Hazor made of basalt (Yadin et al. 1961: Pl. CLXXIII:5), and a basalt twin to the beachrock quernstone in Fig. 25.1:2 came from Gezer (Dever et al. 1986: Pl. 57:4). Fig. 25 .1:8 shows a small kurkar stone which because of its push action is included in the quernstones group. A very similar stone, also kurkar, is reported from Lachish as a "rubbing stone" (Tufnell et al. 1940: Pl. XXIX:20). 2. MORTARS The earliest device for crushing herbs and foodstuffs was the utilization of naturally occurring rock depressions. From these cup-marks evolved portable mortars that, along with the querns, are the earliest milling tools, with mortars the earlier of the two (Avitzur 1976: 71). Mortars can be used either for crushing by pounding or for grinding- milling in a circular motion by pestles or rubbing stones. Both types of mortars were found at Deir el-Balah. It is noteworthy that none of the basalt mortars common at other sites were found at Deir el-Balah, nor were tripod mortars, known since the Middle Bronze Age II (Starkey and Harding 1932: PI. XLII; Albright 1938: PI. 38:39-40; Avitzur 1976: 73). Of the five mortars found at the site, two have shallow depressions pockmarked by pounding. One from a floor of Stratum VI is made of a bulky and crude "sandwich" stone (Fig. 25.2:9); the other, a well-fashioned, smooth-bottomed limestone mortar (Fig. 25.2:7) from the crater fill of Stratum VI, is comparable to a mortar from Tell el-Far' ah (S) (Starkey and Harding 1932: PI. XXVI: 13-14). Three pieces show signs of circular motion. Two are made of kurkar; judging from their state of wear, the one from an early Stratum VI pit (Fig. 25.2:8) was little used, while the other (Fig. 25.2:5) from a floor of Stratum VI (the same locus as the "sandwich" mortar) is well worn and resembles in shape and finish a limestone mortar from Gezer (Seger 1988: PI. 30:37). The third, from a Strata VI-IV pit, is a well-worn limestone mortar with a remarkably smooth overall finish (Fig. 25.2:6) and is similar to a broken limestone mortar, also from Gezer (Seger 1988: PI. 6:7).

PALETTES Palettes were generally used for grinding small quantities of material and to produce fine powders, which could then be made into a paste, such as spices, pigments, cosmetics and the like. No cosmetic palettes of the type associated with the Egyptian culture featuring a cup or cups were found at Deir el-Balah. All nine palettes are small, flat objects, either rectangular or trapezoid (Fig. 25.3:4-6), and are made of a variety of stones, as shown in Table 25.4. 4. RUBBING STONES The 17 rubbing stones, sometimes called polishing stones, are small riders that can be worked in a circular or a combined circular and push motion against palettes and also against some mortars, Table 25.4.

Made of a variety of stones and shapes, some resemble pebbles but are clearly man-made. Basalt: In almost every excavation, most of the rubbing stones found are made of basalt, for example stones from Lachish (Tufnell et al. 1940: Pl. XXIX: 17-19), Tell Beit Mirsim (Albright 1938: Pl. 44:8, 12, 14-15, unstratified), Tell el-'Ajjul (Petrie 1932: PI. XXVII:89). At Deir el-Balah, five of the 17 rubbing stones are basalt. Two are from the Amarna Age Stratum IX; one is dome-shaped and depressed on top, perhaps as a finger grip (Fig. 25.3:8) and has a parallel, although much smaller, in a "goethite nodule" from Gezer (Dever et al. 1986: Pl. 41:1). The other is pebble-shaped. Three others, also pebble-shaped, were found in topsoil. One of these has a worn flat and also a worn rounded surface, such as might be used against a bowl. Kurkar: Of the five kurkar rubbing stones, one came from the Amarna Age Stratum IX. It is a flattish, triangular pyramid with a depression on its upper side which, if not the result of damage, may have been a finger grip. A stone from a mixed locus is palette- shaped but worn on both its surfaces and doubled as a pounding stone on both narrow edges. Limestone: Of the three limestone rubbing stones, one is a flattish fragment found in topsoil. The two others are flat discoid chalky limestones, one from Strata VI-IV (Fig. 25.3:9), the other from topsoil. Similar discs made of pottery sherds, known from many sites, e.g. Gezer (Dever et al.

This is cautiously argued in the report on Tel Michal, where 15 such ceramic discs were found (Singer- Avitz 1989: 360). The Deir el-Balah stone discs, with their smoothed surfaces, are considered here not as stoppers but rather as rubbing stones. Sandstone: One rubbing stone was found in topsoil. Gavroid and siltstone: There is one of each, both found in mixed loci. Both types of stone can be found in Sinai. Pumice: The single specimen, from an Early Stratum VI pit, is an ovoid object (Fig. 25.3:7) similar to a pumice stone from Gezer (Dever et al. 1970: Pl. 36:5). It is the only stone item that reached Deir el-Balah from the West. 5. PEBBLES Five worn pebbles served in a similar fashion to the rubbing stones. Two limestone pebbles were found, one from Strata VI-IV and one in topsoil. A ferrogeneous limestone pebble, hard and heavy, came from Stratum IX. From Stratum VI came a pebble of microgavro, a magmatic rock that can be found in Central Sinai in association with dike basalt, of which one pebble was found in topsoil. The latter is a lumpy piece with three rubbing surfaces and pounding marks at both ends. 6. POUNDERS/PESTLES Although each of the three tools is differently fashioned, all three could have been used as either pounders or pestles. Two are made of flint, one from a mixed locus (Fig. 25.3: 1) and the other a topsoil find (Fig. 25.3:2). The third, from a Stratum V pit (Fig. 25.3:3), is made of a very dense smoothly finished basalt and resembles pestles found in many sites. It was also used after it had been longitudinally split, as evidenced by pounding marks at the broken edge. Fig. 25.3. Pounders, palettes, rubbing stones, chisels, scraper, plates and bowls.

CHISELS Two chisels, one of very dense basalt from Stratum IX (Fig. 25.3:10) and another made of a darkish limestone found in the crater fill of Stratum VI (Fig . 25 .3 : 1 1 ) are completely different in design and workmanship. The basalt tool is bulky and rough, while the limestone chisel is carefully fashioned with a smooth finish. 8. SCRAPER This polishing-burnishing stone is a small, not very regular triangular and flat kurkar stone found in topsoil; it is worn on one of its narrow surfaces (Fig. 25.3:12). 9. SHARPENER A very hard stone made of sandy conglomerate with quartz micropebbles, found in a Stratum IV pit, is in all probability a whetstone. II. PLATES AND BOWLS The Deir el-Balah assemblage comprises 12 such objects, six designated as plates and six as bowls. In some instances there is a difficulty in assigning a particular object (especially if it is fragmentary) to the plates or bowls category. Amiran ( 1 970) , when dealing with (much earlier) Egyptian stone vessels from Ai, mentions two possible terminologies: a "very shallow dish" (Type T-2 according to Emery and Klausens) or a "flat bottomed dish and bowl" (Type X according to Reisner). Considered along these lines, the Deir el-Balah finds were classified into plates, shallow bowls and bowls, some ring- based. Ring-based vessels appear quite frequently at many excavations with variations, some subtle, in the height and thickness of the ring, its angle with the bottom, etc., as can be noted by comparing Fig. 25.3: 14-15 to finds from Tell el-'Ajjul (Petrie 1934: PI. XXII:3, 5), Gezer (Dever et al. 1986: Pl. 61:3), Megiddo (Loud 1948: Pl. 262:12, 16) and Hazor (Yadin et al. 1960: Pis. CXXVII:17, 19, CXLIX:l-6; Yadin et al. 1961: Pl. CCVI:3, 6-7), whence also came a shallow plate, probably not ring-based (Yadin et al. 1961: Pl. CCVI:9). A similar plate was found at Gezer (Dever et al. 1986: Pl. 62:1). These two resemble the plate on Fig. 25.3:13. The basalt items are mostly made of a dense stone, but there are also two of the porous kind and one of the very dense variety. One bowl is made of a darkish limestone and one is of quartzite (see Table 25.5). Special mention should be made of a heavy, slightly damaged quartzite shallow bowl, in which a bright red ochre residue is clearly visible (Table Table 25.5. Plates and bowls. No. Stone Type Str.

It differs from all the other specimens in its overall shape, in its thickness (outer diameter at rim 13.7 cm., inner 1 1 .5 cm.) and in its granular, shallow depression (overall height 3.7 cm., depression 1 .4 cm. deep). It came from a Stratum IX locus (1904) in the industrial quarter, where a small kurkar rider and five weightstones were also found. A shallow ring-based bowl (Table 25.5, No. 1) came from a room of Building 331 of Stratum IX (Locus 1006), rich in finds of domestic nature, where the four kurkar bed supports were found (see Chapter 20). Table 25.5, Nos. 7-9 came from a very mixed topsoil locus (501) situated at the point where the wadi enters the crater and which contained objects from the crater fill, the former crater pits and objects swept by the wadi 's current from nearby areas. Stone finds from this locus alone number 13 items; two bowls, one plate, five beachrock quernstones, two kurkar rubbing stones, one basalt pebble and two weightstones. III. VARIA Five stone finds that are not tools or vessels include a small flint core from an Early Stratum VI pit and an unidentified large kurkar and limestone object that may have been the rim of a hollowed lid of some kind of an installation. The latter came from a workshop area, probably a clay cleaning site, of Strata VI-IV. Two small lumps, somewhat worn, may have been utilized as pigment sources. One is a purplish sandstone from the crater fill (Stratum VI). The other is a reddish iron concretion (hematite?) from a floor, also of Stratum VI. Also from a workshop area of Stratum VI (a suggested place of coffin manufacture) came a small piece of "alabaster" (crystalline limestone or calcite in geological usage). Dothan discusses the term "alabaster" as used for gypsum in geology, and for both gypsum and calcite in archaeology (Dothan 1979: 106, n. 35). This small piece was probably intended for inlay decoration. ACKNOWLEDGMENTS I wish to thank Avriel Adler for her diligence in making the drawings and typing the manuscript. Sincere appreciation is due to Yoram Neri and Yoav Avni for the identification of rock types in the miscellaneous group. Mr. Avni also supplied information on their distribution and thus on their possible origins. It is a special pleasure to note the assiduous assistance and useful advice of Baruch Brandl, to whom I am most grateful. 289</page><page sequence="281">CHAPTER TWENTY-FIVE fà Ö O 0 J 1 u 5» ^ ^ mm O ^ S ^ U¡ mm S -2 a «■! 2 S - * 3) &lt;C g ^ ^ ^ &lt;D * 4-. -t-&gt; &lt;d . e S « Cļ OOO O Īd "čd "tf O ^ 2 25c*5 « OOO O c/2 (/3 c/3 O c/3 c/3 C ^o &lt;D &lt;D &lt;D -O cd cd cd -O '«?

Apart from one piece (17 g.) of hematite, the yellow, red and dark red ochre from all find localities is non-crystalline and soft. When rubbed, it yields a fine powder that dissolves well in water without le vigation. Although hardness determination was not carried out, samples were submitted to laboratories for spectral analysis. In order to determine whether the yellow ochre could have been the raw material used to produce the red pigments, and to observe the sequences of hue and chroma change to red when roasted, we submitted the individual yellow pieces to controlled firing. In all cases, hues and chroma changed to reds and the color values were found to be identical with those of the red ochre found in all localities of the site. For color determination we used the Munsell Soil Color Charts (1975). The tests suggest that the yellow limonite had been brought to the site and fired there. This is also indicated by a piece of red ochre whose entire cortex is intensely coated with a blackish soot, which usually develops when yellow ochre is roasted in a wood fire. That the red ochre had been powdered by rubbing or grinding on the spot is attested by prominent traces of abrasion on eight pieces of red and dark red ochre. This was probably done on specially fashioned rubbing or grinding utensils. A well-made stone bowl (Reg. No. 6423, Locus 1904; Chapter 25, Photo 25.1), with a rough crystalline surface on its basin- like interior, shows irregular red staining that speaks for its use as a grinding utensil. Another rubbing or This chapter has not been updated. Table 26.1 . Amounts of the various color pigments. Stratum Quantity Weight (g.)

It may be significant that 63% by weight of the ochre (both yellow and red) from the excavated area came from Strata VI-IV, mostly from Pit 1 9 1 3 ; Loci 1348EU and 1377U also yielded relatively abundant remains. The fragments of three pottery mixing bowls came from Loci 1348EU, 1377U and 1913. These finds and find spots illustrate that the population of Deir el-Balah processed ochre, probably in specific working areas. It is possible that the roasting of the yellow raw material was done in wood fires in Locus 1392U, the open courtyard. However, it is not yet possible to conclude that the abundant ash found there is related to ochre firing. In any case, the opening of the courtyard to the west could provide sufficient draft for a roasting installation whose location would have been adjacent to Loci 1348EU and 1377U. The presence of such a large amount of ochre in Pit 1913 poses some difficulties of interpretation. The purpose of the pit is not known but it seems, judging from its content, that it was not a refuse dump. We would put forward the hypothesis that the ochre and pottery fragments of a mixing bowl were swept into the pit by water or shifting sand. We observed that all remains recovered from the pit were encrusted with sand and that sand concretions there contained many fragments of red ochre. Finally, we may raise the question of how the occupants of Deir el-Balah used the ochre. Only further evidence can shed light on the possible use of red ochre in the decorating of pottery, the dyeing of textiles or the painting of woodwork.

Kislev Department of Life Sciences, Bar-Ilan University Charred cereal grains were found at Deir el-Balah during the 1980 and 1981 excavation seasons. The grains were manually collected from four adjoining loci in Pit 1207 in Square A/10 (Table 27.1). They belong to Stratum V, which is dated to the mid- 1 3th century BCE. In addition to charring, most of the grains also show signs of heat-induced puffing. Barley kernels are typically found without their hulls. Over time, probably because of changes in soil moisture between the rains and from winter to summer, the grains become very fragile and suffer corrosion on their surface. When they reached the laboratory, Table 27.1 . Cereal grains found at Deir el-Balah. Locus 1202 1204 1207 1222 Reg. No. 3074 3073 3072 3202 Hordeum distichon 47 29 1 300 4 H. d. var. nudum 20 Triticum parvicoccum - - 2 19 Lolium sp. 4 Unidentified 1 most of the grains were broken into two or more parts. The grain count in the richest sample (Locus 1207) was therefore determined by weighing the existing complete kernels and calculating their average weight. The total weight of whole and fragmented grain remnants was then divided by the average weight of a single whole grain. The majority of the grains found belong to barley (Table 27.1). Barley has several distinct morphological types, i.e. the number of fertile spikelets per node in the ear (one or three) determines whether the barley is two-rowed (. Hordeum distichon) or six-rowed ( Hordeum vulgare). The former has only straight kernels, while in the latter two thirds of the kernels are twisted and the rest are straight. Besides, each species can be further identified, even in charred material, as a hulled or naked type. All barley grains recovered were identified as two-rowed, since no kernel was twisted. Only 80 kernels could be measured: their average dimensions (without the radical tip) are 6.1 X 3.0 X 2.4 mm. They are widest and thickest at the middle, and their thickness/breadth (T/B) ratio is rather uniform (Table 27.2). Most of the kernels Table 27.2. Measurements (in mm.) and ratios of barley (N = 80).

A few grains, however, showed wrinkled surfaces and no ridges, and were consequently identified as naked two-rowed barley ( Hordeum distichon var. nudem). Barley kernels from other loci resemble those from the largest sample, given in Table 27.2. Of the naked wheat ( Triticum parvicoccum), only 10 grains could be measured: 4.9 x 2.6 x 2.3 mm. on the average. No insect damage could be observed in the cereal grains. CONCLUSIONS The cereal grains from Deir el-Balah belong mainly to hulled two-rowed barley. The naked wheat and naked barley are more securely regarded as mere impurities, commonly found in primitive crops together with weeds like darnel (Lolium temulentum). In Egypt six-rowed barley has been grown almost exclusively in ancient periods as well as in modern times (Täckholm et al. 1941). This contrasts with barleys grown in Israel, which were generally a mixture of both species in different percentages, although sometimes almost pure two-rowed barley was grown in the southern parts of the country. Therefore, one may safely conclude that the barley from Deir el-Balah was grown locally and not imported from Egypt. REFERENCE Täckholm, V., Täckholm, G. and Drar, M. 1941 . Flora of Egypt, Vol. I. Cairo. 308</page><page sequence="299">CHAPTER TWENTY-EIGHT HISTORICAL OBSERVATIONS* Trude Dothan STRATUM IX: THE AMARNA PERIOD Stratum IX, built on virgin soil, was the earliest occupation level encountered in the excavation of Deir el-Balah. In the opinion of the excavators, the closest parallels to Stratum IX come from Tell el-Amarna, the capital city of Pharaoh Akhenaten ( 1 379-1 362 BCE). The major architectural feature of this stratum was a large residence built in direct proximity to a manmade pool. The items discussed here, beginning with the architectural remains and moving to the small finds, represent a quintessence of the best-stratified elements from this level. The area excavated represents at best a "window" on the original settlement of Deir el-Balah, the great majority of which remains buried under the sand dunes. Since the extent of the data gathered is limited, care must be taken in making far-reaching comparisons and conclusions. However, the building complex at Deir el-Balah shares several features with Tell el-Amarna. Both settlements were newly planned and built; Amarna was a veritable "boom town" that rose from the dust in a few short years, while Deir el-Balah, undoubtedly designed and executed on a more modest scale than Akhenaten's capital city, was most likely also established in a brief period. The placing of a building complex in immediate proximity to a pond or reservoir such as that at Deir el-Balah was extremely common at Amarna, as attested to by the excavation of the many elaborate estates (Ricke 1932: Introduction; * For detailed architectural analysis of the site's remains and their Egyptian affinities, see Vol. I, Chapter 6, The Egyptian Origin of the Architecture at Deir el-Balah (by B. Brandl). Badawy 1956: 491-94; Stevenson Smith 1958: 18). Finally, the bricklaying techniques used at Deir el- Balah and Tell el-Amarna are quite similar. ARCHITECTURE AND HYDROLOGY The pond, a large crater measuring approximately twenty meters square, was the first feature developed by the original settlers at Deir el-Balah. The boundaries of this pond were traced in the excavation and partially defined on all four sides. Testing of samples of mudbricks from the residence, carried out by geologists P. Goldberg and A. Miller Rosen, indicated that the marl dug out from the pond was utilized to manufacture bricks (Killebrew et al. 2006). When digging was completed, a pit 5 m. deep with steeply sloping, stepped sides remained. Hydrological investigation of this crater indicated that it was adapted for use as a manmade reservoir in Strata IX-VII. The findings of A. Issar (Vol. I, Chapter 9) are that the site lies in a natural trough with a high clay content which, when compacted, can hold water. The indication is, therefore, that the pond held water for at least a few months of the year and perhaps longer, depending on the type and degree of soil compression carried out by the inhabitants of Deir el-Balah. The construction of ponds in immediate proximity to residences was a common feature of Egyptian New Kingdom architecture (Badawy 1958: 21-24). Numerous depictions of gardens with ponds as their central feature exist in Theban and Amarnan tombs. Moreover, a number of ponds, which are generally a difficult item to isolate in archaeological investigation, have been excavated at Tell el-Amarna (Ricke 1932: Fig. 36; Frankfort and Pendlebury 1933: PI. 1 1 ; Badawy 1958: 92-93, 309</page><page sequence="300">CHAPTER TWENTY-EIGHT 151; Stevenson Smith 1958: 200-204; Kemp 1977: 32). These remains, coupled with the tomb depictions, provide insight into the use of the pond at Deir el-Balah. The ponds on the large Egyptian estates undoubtedly served aesthetic as well as utilitarian purposes, since they are often depicted as being surrounded by rows of graceful trees and filled with fish (Badawy 1968: PI. 5). However, the pond at Deir el-Balah appears to have been primarily utilitarian in function, serving as the main water supply for the site during several phases of its existence. The low water table at Tell el-Amarna created special problems for pool design. At the "Christmas House," a pond with dimensions identical to those at Deir el-Balah was excavated (Ricke 1932: 49, Pl. 17, House Q46.1; Badawy 1956: 492-94). Since the water table lay some seven meters below the surface, it was evident that the pool was not designed to be completely filled with water. Rather, reinforced stepped sides, similar to those of the Deir el-Balah pond, led to the center of the pool, where a smaller well had been sunk. Painted depictions, such as that in the XVIIIth Dynasty tomb of Merire at Amarna, provide some evidence for the means of drawing water from the well. Even as far back as the late XVIIIth Dynasty, there is evidence for a device known in modern times as a shaduf - a suspended, weighted arm from which hung a bucket or leather bag that could be swung down to retrieve water from lower depths (for the depiction from the tomb of Merire, see Ricke 1932: 49; Stevenson Smith 1958: PI. 162:A-B; for a depiction from the tomb of Apy, see N. de Garis Davies 1927: 217). Thus, the use of the pond at Deir el-Balah may be reconstructed in two different ways: either it was completely filled, holding water up to its surface, or it had a smaller well in the middle that was approached from the stepped sides. However, no indications of such a secondary well were found at Deir el-Balah, making the former suggestion the more likely. The major architectural feature of Stratum IX was a large complex of buildings, which perhaps formed a single residence, built directly next to the pond. This residence was composed of three mudbrick buildings set at a right angle. The two north-south buildings together measured approximately 50 m. in length and contained the remains of as many as fifteen rooms. The single east- west building measured approximately 20 m. in length and contained at least four or five rooms. The buildings bordered the pond on its east and south. It is probable that these buildings were part of a larger complex, although the northernmost and westernmost boundaries of the complex were not determined since it continued under the sand dunes. In one of the rooms of the residence four worked kurkar stone bases were found. The key to the identification of these unusual items, which measure 13 cm. square and have sloping sides and a slight depression on top, is the only other extant set, which was uncovered in the excavations at Tell el-Amarna. The German excavators of Tell el-Amarna recovered the plan of more than 250 buildings, whether grand estate or humble home, that shared a basic common blueprint (Ricke 1932: 2). While the buildings at Amarna introduced a number of innovative architectural features, they preserved some traditional Egyptian elements as well. One of these, dating at least as far back as the Xllth Dynasty (Petrie 1891), is the bedroom niche. The niche, which was recessed and elevated, would have been approached from an antechamber. It was in such a niche at Amarna that a set of stone bases identical to those from Deir el-Balah was found (Frankfort and Pendlebury 1933: 8, house V37.1). The placement of the four bases in the four corners of the room at Amarna strongly indicates, as first suggested by B. Brandl (see also Chapter 20), that they served as the supports of a bedstead. On this basis, then, it may be postulated that the room in which the Deir el-Balah set was found was the master bedroom of the residence. POTTERY A number of rooms had well-preserved beaten earth floors on which were found large amounts of pottery. These ceramic finds included locally made pottery of Canaanite and Egyptian styles, with the Egyptian-style pottery predominating (see Chapter 310</page><page sequence="301">HISTORICAL OBSERVATIONS 2). The Canaanite vessels included cooking pots, juglets, bowls and flasks (see Chapter 4). It seems likely that some of the Egyptian-style vessels, especially those decorated with the blue pigment often referred to as "Amarna Blue," were imported from Egypt. Since Egyptian vessels on the whole have a long range, care must be taken in using them to assign an absolute chronology. However, the use of "Amarna Blue" together with red and black decoration was especially popular during the late XVIIIth Dynasty. Moreover, it appears that this pottery was produced in particular centers, such as Amarna and Malkata in the XVIIIth Dynasty and Memphis in the XlXth Dynasty (Davies 1982: 88-89; see also Chapters 2, 3). This, together with the fact that some of the Egyptian-style vessels, such as a chalice and a small drop-shaped painted vessel, have exact parallels at Amarna itself, may point to a direct link between Deir el-Balah and Tell el- Amarna. Further dating evidence is provided by the imported vessels found in the residence. These include a Mycenaean IIIA/B stirrup jar (see Chapter 7) and Cypriot White Painted II milk bowls (see Chapter 8), which again have close parallels with imported vessels found at Amarna (Hankey 1973: 128-36; 1981: 38^19). OTHER FINDS Among the objects found in this stratum (see Chapters 13-16) were a lead strip (a weight?), a bronze razor, a stone knob and, scattered on a floor of the residence, ten cylindrical pieces of carnelian and blue frit, dotted with traces of gold and pierced through with a square aperture. Both the size of the pieces and the nature of the aperture of the latter indicated that they should be reconstructed as parts of a scepter or flail . As insignia of the god Osiris and symbols of authority, they were generally held only by rulers, chiefs and viziers. The closest parallel to this find comes from the tomb of Tutankhamun, where a number of scepters and flails composed of alternating pieces of gold and lapis lazuli or obsidian were found. One of the sets recovered had links of the same dimensions as the pieces from Deir el- Balah and bore a cartouche reading "Tutankhaten" and not "Tutankhamun," indicating that the artifact was crafted early in Tutankhamun 's life, during the heyday of the Amarna Age. The pieces from Deir el-Balah may thus indicate the presence of a man of authority (a governor or administrator), perhaps implying that the building complex in which they were found was an administrative residence or governor's palace. Just to the west of the residence, in the open area alongside the building, a pit (possibly a favissa) was excavated. It contained a clay bulla (see Chapter 18, No. 1) bearing four hieroglyphs, and other finds including a complete pottery stand. Bullae were used to seal papyrus documents, and traces of the strings that bound the papyrus and to which this bulla was affixed remain on its back. The closest parallel to this seal again comes from Tell el-Amarna and provides an excellent indication of the date of the Stratum IX locus in which it was found. The bulla may be an indication of direct correspondence between Tell el-Amarna and Deir el-Balah. DISCUSSION The cumulative evidence of pond, residence, pottery and other finds, coupled with the sites 's stratigraphie sequence (see below), indicates that Stratum IX should be dated to the Amarna Age. The Amarna era was a turbulent time in Egyptian history, witnessing a change in religious focus under Pharaoh Akhenaten that had far-reaching political, social and economic ramifications. On the basis of the Amarna Letters, historians have generally maintained that Egypt in this period focused on domestic activity and was ambivalent toward foreign policy - a stance reflective of the introspective nature of Akhenaten himself. As a result, Egypt's hold on its Canaanite possessions deteriorated sharply and Canaan was subject to political, social and economic upheaval. The return to a vigorous Egyptian military policy occurred only under the successors of Akhenaten, beginning with Horemheb. However, after careful rereading of the Amarna Letters several scholars have challenged this long- held view. The problems reflected in the letters, such 311</page><page sequence="302">CHAPTER TWENTY-EIGHT as intercity disputes, harassment by raiding bandits and accusations of disregard of imperial orders, bureaucratic incompetence and corruption (Several 1972: 122-33), are exactly the type of matters about which one would write to one's sovereign. Thus, the correspondence reflects normal relations between the court at Amarna and the subject princes. As Weinstein notes: "Thus whatever difficulties Egypt may have had in the Levant during the Amarna period, the Amarna Letters do not support a theory of imperial decline in Palestine" (Weinstein 1982: esp. 17). Furthermore, the thorough reassessment of the letters by Raviv (1966: 45-51) made clear that while Egyptian control of Canaan during this period appears to have remained stable, the Hittite threat on the border of Syria was strong. This necessitated preparations on the part of the Egyptian government for a military campaign that included the gathering of provisions and the mustering of troops by the local Canaanite governors. Although the campaign does not seem to have materialized during Akhenaten's reign, such a military excursion, led by Horemheb during the reign of Tutankhamun, to regain lost border holdings, is mentioned in an inscription in the Memphite tomb of Horemheb (Redford 1973: 36^19). In addition, fragments of Amarna art from the Aton shrine at Karnak provide pictorial evidence for a battle against Asians (Redford 1979: 270-87; Schulman 1988). Activity on the Nubian front has been verified by depictions in Amarna tombs of battle scenes against Nubians and of bound Nubian prisoners-of-war, and by a series of commemorative stelae from Buhen and Amada recounting a campaign undertaken there in Akhenaten's twelfth regnal year (Schulman 1982). Significant evidence for building activities on both Egyptian borders during the Amarna era has been provided by archaeological excavations and surveys, both past and present. In the early 1970s, a survey conducted under the auspices of Ben-Gurion University and directed by E. Oren identified more than eighty New Kingdom sites in northern Sinai - ample evidence of the systematic settlement of the area by New Kingdom pharaohs. The survey distinguished three main types of sites by function: 1 ) administrative buildings, 2) military architecture and 3) water installations for irrigation (Oren 2006). Two significant complexes were founded during the 14th century BCE, like Deir el-Balah: Bir el-' Abd, located midway between the Suez Canal and Gaza and containing a water installation for irrigation and drinking supplies and an extremely well- preserved granary consisting of four cylindrical mudbrick silos (Oren 1973b: 112-13); and Haruvit, a two-phase site in northeastern Sinai, containing storerooms, a courtyard and a potter's workshop. The latter was abandoned without destruction at the end of the 14th century BCE and not resettled (Oren 1983: 78-79). At Sesebi, on the border of Nubia, a walled fortress-town was constructed during the Amarna Age but before Akhenaten's sixth regnal year (so dated because the depictions of the king found there are in the ordinary style of the XVIIIth Dynasty rather than that of Amarna). The rich material finds from this site, both pottery (especially Mycenaean imports) and art objects, have close parallels to those from Amarna itself. The site, where there may have been some slight Egyptian occupation early in the XVIIIth Dynasty before its fortification under Akhenaten, flourished throughout the XlXth Dynasty as well (Blackman 1937: 145-51). The cumulative evidence of the military activity in Canaan and Nubia during the Amarna Age and the building activity at sites such as Bir el-'Abd, Haruvit and Deir el-Balah are highly significant. Akhenaten's reign, rather than being a period of inactivity in foreign affairs, was characterized by continued Egyptian commitment and involvement in maintaining the strength of its borders and the stability of the empire. In light of this, the nature of the settlement founded at Deir el-Balah during the Amarna era is intriguing. The site is located on the furthest border of Egypt, just before the entrance to Canaan at Gaza. This location, coupled with the unique architectural elements of Stratum IX and the diagnostic assortment of special finds, indicates that in this era Deir el-Balah was an Egyptian administrative center, perhaps with links to the capital at Tell el- Amarna. 312</page><page sequence="303">HISTORICAL OBSERVATIONS THE INTERMEDIATE STRATUM VIII Four pits and the scanty remains of a structure and floors gave evidence of the next occupation phase at Deir el-Balah, a short interim settlement that again utilized the pond as its water reservoir. Though the lack of diagnostic finds created a difficulty in dating these remains, they should perhaps be linked to the reign of Horemheb, Akhenaten's general and Tutankhamun's successor. Under his reign Egypt embarked on a renewed ascent to imperial preeminence that reached its zenith under the Ramesside kings. STRATUM VII: THE "SETI" FORTRESS A dramatic change occurred in the nature of the settlement above the intermediate phase that followed the Amarna level. Although caution must be exercised in making any sweeping statements because the area of excavation was so limited, this area presented an unusually well-defined and cohesive picture. An isolated, fortified structure was built adjacent to the pond, partially overlying the remains of the Amarna Age residence and the intermediate remains. The selection of the building site was clearly determined by its easy access to the pond, which remained in use during this period. The close proximity of fortress to pond is one of the hallmarks of the fortresses shown on the reliefs of Seti I at Karnak. According to Gardiner's classic study "The Ancient Military Road between Egypt and Palestine" (1920), the Seti reliefs constituted "the earliest equivalent of a map that has come down to us from the ancient world," and their topographical data indicated "a long line of forts and sheets of water." In Gardiner's words: "Seti I came to the throne of Egypt about fifty years after the death of Akhnaton, that is, c. 1300 B.C. He was the son and co-regent of the elderly Ramesses I, who had been appointed by Horemheb, Tutankhamun's military commander and successor, to succeed him. Seti I conducted numerous foreign wars to reinforce Egyptian control over Palestine and to conquer Syria, during which he crossed into the country from Egypt, via the Ways of Horus, at least three times. The network of fortified wells across the Sinai were not only 'service stations' for the Egyptian army but necessary protection against the Shosu, desert raiders who disputed Egyptian hegemony. It was Seti 's policy to properly maintain this strategic military and trade route which had been in existence since the days of Thutmosis III in the 15th century B.C. But the Seti reliefs, more than giving us the historical context of the fortress, provided us with an almost exact blueprint of the kind of structure we were excavating. The eleven forts and nine wells (or ponds) shown in the relief are depicted between the legs of the horses and the chariot wheels in scenes showing the victorious Pharaoh Seti I smiting his enemies or receiving tribute from his vanquished foes. The depictions are singular - one contains a palm grove, another a fortress with a window. The forts have two or more towers. Some of them are two storeys high, three are set on hills. Some of the ponds are of irregular shape, some are rectangular and bordered by trees. Nine of the fortresses are either adjacent to or overlook ponds, and one of them is referred to in the hieroglyphics as 'the town which His Majesty Built Newly'." The fortress at Deir el-Balah appears to have been two stories high, with supporting walls more than two meters thick and four corner bastions - an indication that it was built in royal Egyptian style, like those on the relief. The fortress was twenty meters square and had fourteen rooms. The massive mudbrick walls, preserved in some places as high as one meter, were the only foundations for this structure. The main outer walls were 2.4 meters wide and the mudbricks were somewhat larger than those in the Amarna residency. There was a subsidiary building adjacent to the fortress on its western side. In addition to the features that could be correlated to the Seti relief, it had the Egyptian- type feature of a layer of sand along the base of the foundation trench. The length of time that the fortress was in use is difficult to define, since no floors were found in the building itself. This 313</page><page sequence="304">CHAPTER TWENTY-EIGHT may be because only the foundations remained or perhaps, though in our opinion less likely, because the building was never finished. Gardiner's detailed analysis of the Seti reliefs provides us with some intriguing further speculations. He points out that since the scene on the far right shows Seti presenting his prisoners to Amun, and that on the far left the storming of a town on the maritime plain of Canaan, it is reasonable to suppose that the intermediate scenes represent the road between Egypt and Canaan. This is confirmed by the hieroglyphic legend that mentions the success of Pharaoh in Shosu-land, "starting from the fortress of Tjel [Kantara], to Canaan." He then relates the data to certain passages in the Papyrus Anastasi I. This papyrus, apparently composed during the reign of Ramesses II (1304-1237 BCE), contains a letter from one scribe to another in which the former taunts the latter with his complete ignorance of the geography of the northern Sinai road. In so doing he mentions twelve names of stations along the route, as well as the major fortified cities in Canaan. According to Gardiner, "five [of the names] can certainly be identified in the Sethos reliefs, three more find equivalents there that are reasonably probable; two names in Pap. Anastasi I are undoubtedly absent from the Karnak wall, where, on the other hand, there are eight or nine names that do not occur in the papyrus." In 1920, Gardiner predicted that future excavations along the route "would reveal many of the fortresses depicted in the Karnak sculptures." Indeed, the 1972-82 survey of northern Sinai undertaken by Ben-Gurion University under the direction of E. Oren provided actual archaeological evidence supporting the reliability of the Seti reliefs, at least in overall terms. The finds at Bir el-'Abd and Haruvit, for example, point to the existence of an artificial pool at the former and a fortress at the latter. At Bir el-'Abd there was a depression that measured 10 by 15 meters and was bordered by a kind of embankment composed of layers of dark silt, containing fragments of New Kingdom pottery. The well-preserved fortress at Haruvit was 2500 meters square and included a massive enclosure wall, a gatehouse, a wide courtyard and a complex of compartments. It had huge buttresses that may have been the bases of watchtowers, and the entrance was large enough to accommodate chariots. Not far from the fort, the expedition uncovered an industrial quarter that included a potter's workshop and a complete potter's kiln. Haruvit is about seven miles east of el-Arish, 91 miles from the starting point of the Ways of Horus and 49 miles from Gaza. But while the Egyptian starting point at today's Kantara (Tjel or Sile) is well recognized, the route's terminus is less clear-cut. Biblical and historical sources name the "Brook of Egypt" as the border with Canaan, but the brook's identification is disputed. While the more traditional identification is with Wadi el-Arish, it has been suggested that the border lay further north, closer to Gaza, at the Brook of Shihor (Na'aman 1980). Gardiner writes that "beyond El Arish the desert-character of the landscape begins to disappear, gradually giving place to meadows and arable land. Rafa is the present [1920] Syro- Egyptian frontier, but consists now of little more than mud-huts. The railway from Kantara runs at the present time as far as Der el-Bela, only a little distance, beyond which lies the famous Philistine city of Gaza." Since two of the fortresses shown on the Seti reliefs are designated as towns that "His Majesty Built Newly," the Deir el-Balah fortress, a mere six miles southwest of Gaza, may well have been one of them.

The remains of the ancient artisans' village, fort and governor's residency have once again been consigned to the earth, though now they are covered with vegetable gardens and orchards rather than sand. Of much greater consequence to the present-day inhabitants is the fact that in 2005 Israeli forces withdrew unilaterally from the whole of the Gaza Strip. If peace is achieved between our two embattled peoples, it will come as no surprise if the Palestinians demand the return of all the artifacts removed during the excavations. There is a precedent for this: on the signing of a peace treaty between Israel and Egypt, Egypt's archaeological claims were amicably met. However the situation in Gaza is more complicated. Prior to the official involvement of the Hebrew University and Tel Aviv University at the site, about 90% of the artifacts in the cemetery had already been illegally removed and sold to private museums, private collectors and dealers. I use the term "illegally" advisedly, since the law stipulates that all digging requires permission from the authorities and even the inadvertent discovery of antiquities on one's own land does not confer ownership on the finder. Yet, as we all know, the law has always been "more honor'd in the breach than the observance." With the passage of time and the continual resale of archaeological artifacts, it becomes more and more difficult to assign original guilt. Whatever the ultimate disposition of the material treasures of Deir el- Balah, the historical implications are incontrovertible. Deir el-Balah was the site of an Egyptian or Egyptian-style settlement on the border of Canaan during the 14th and 13th centuries BCE. During the 14th century BCE, it contained an official palace, governor's residency or private villa, with many stylistic features that link it to Tell el-Amarna, the contemporaneous royal city of the heretic King Akhenaton. It was built in proximity to a manmade pool, a feature known during this period in ancient Egypt. Subsequently, a fortress was built, superimposed on the residency/ villa. We believe that this is one of the fortresses mentioned and depicted in the Seti I reliefs at Karnak, especially since in its architectural features, including its proximity to the pond, it bears a strong resemblance to the other fortresses along the Ways of Horus. However, we do not have any clues to its ancient name. During the 13th century BCE, the Ramesside period, which was the final stage of the Egyptian presence in Canaan, we are certain that there was an artisans' village in Deir el-Balah. It was at this time that the pond went out of use as a pond and became the site of industrial kilns and a water installation. The artisans' village produced artifacts primarily for the mortuary industry, notably anthropoid coffins and burial gifts for the nearby cemetery which was related to it chronologically. The evidence for this from the cemetery is overwhelming. The problems of the excavations at Deir el- Balah, as we have repeatedly noted, stem from the fact that we received only a glimpse and not a comprehensive picture of the past of this particular area. Our view was severely circumscribed: it is as if a tiny window was opened on a huge vista, or a curtain drawn aside only partially. The cemetery, we know, continues under the sand dunes and 317</page><page sequence="307">AFTERWORD the settlement area surely does as well. But time was against us, as were objective conditions: the reluctance of the landowner and the topography of the area, with its forty-foot high sand dunes. What is abundantly clear, even from the limited area excavated, is that in the 14th and 1 3th centuries BCE the inhabitants of Deir el-Balah enjoyed the fruits of a flourishing international trade. This is evidenced by the rich ceramic assemblages, consisting of locally made Canaanite and Egyptian- style pottery together with Egyptian, Cypriot, Mycenaean and Minoan imports. The development of this trade was one of the dominant features of Eastern Mediterranean civilization at the time. Cyprus played a central role in this commerce, mediating between the Levant and the Aegean world. The cosmopolitan nature of the ancient Near East came to an end towards the end of the 13th century, when dramatic changes occurred all over the region. The Hittite Empire collapsed, destruction swept through the Mycenaean world, cities were abandoned and there were vast population movements to the east. Among the new inhabitants of Canaan at the beginning of the 12th century BCE we find the Philistines, one of the migrating Sea Peoples and, at about the same time, the Israelites. At Deir el-Balah today, there are no physical indications that a dig ever took place. Nothing tells the chance visitor that more than 3000 years ago there was an outpost of Egyptian civilization beneath the vegetable patches and orchards. Perhaps a museum of the excavation will stand here one day. Meanwhile, all around, as in Shelley's well-known lines about the ruins of a statue of King Ramesses II, Ozymandias in Greek: "The lone and level sands stretch far away." 318</page><page sequence="308">PLATES</page><page sequence="309">Pl. 1.
