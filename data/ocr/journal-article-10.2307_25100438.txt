In the beginning of that instructive and very amusing dialogue, the Cratylus, Plato makes the sophist observe " that there is a propriety of appellation naturally sub sisting for everything that exists, and that this name is not what certain persons conventionally call it, while they articulate with a portion of their speech; but that there is a certain propriety of names, naturally the same, both among Greeks and among Barbarians." In proof of this, Cratylus denies that his friend Hermogenes is correctly so called ; because, being neither wealthy nor eloquent, he manifest ly cannot be deemed, in any sense, the " offspring of Her mes." The ensuing discourse, to which these remarks are</page><page sequence="2">412 the evolution of language. [Oct. the natural prelude, proceeds to treat of the true signification of names, the derivation of words, and the origin of human speech. It is, so far as we know, the earliest contribution to philological science. Previously to the time of Plato, the inquiries of men were conducted, not only without conscious regard to those logical rules to which all investigation must conform, but also without conscious regard to the true sig nificance of those terms and phrases with which no investiga tion can dispense. " It is a dominant characteristic of intel ligence, viewed in its successive stages of evolution, that its processes, which, as originally performed, were not accom panied with a consciousness of the manner in which they were performed, or of their adaptation to the ends achieved, be come eventually both conscious and systematic." * The grad ual change from unconscious action to conscious action, which accompanies the development of intelligence, may be seen equally in the growth of every child and in the growth of the human race. Just as men called the moon " the measurer," without knowing the cause of her periodic movements ; just as they floated their canoes and lighted their fires, though igno rant of the laws of hydrostatics and chemistry; just as com merce, manufactures, and agriculture flourished for centuries before the generalizations of political economy were reached; just as induction and syllogism were in familiar use when the categories and predicables of Aristotle had not been heard of; ? so, in like manner, the use of complex forms of speech preceded by ages the first investigations into the structure and composition of language. In the infancy of the world, whole nations lived and died, as it were unconsciously, with out leaving record of their existence ; and similarly, we know that men must have talked, and even written, when scarcely more than half conscious of the mere existence of language, ? a consideration which needs to be duly taken into account by those who maintain that language is a product of human invention. It is to Plato's Cratylus that we must look for the germ of philological science. But we need not look there long without .* Spencer, Principles of Psychology, p. 339&lt;</page><page sequence="3">1863.] THE EVOLUTION OE LANGUAGE. 413 perceiving the vast difference between the germ and the full grown organism. With Plato, inquiries into the significance of speech were but operations subsidiary to philosophy. Every science, as Muller remarks, originated in some practical neces sity. Geometry was once the measuring of land, astronomy and metallurgy were ancillary to navigation and weapon-mak ing, and philology was the servant of dialectics. Moreover, the Greeks could no more construct sound linguistic theories without a knowledge of foreign languages, than they could construct sound political theories from the scanty facts lying within the limited range of their own experience ; and in this respect, Plato's Republic and his Cratylus are in the same category. The erroneous derivations which fill the latter work are the natural results of the ignorance of " barbaric " dialects, and the consequent realism which so injuriously affected the entire course of Grecian speculation.* We do not now propose here to give a history of philological inquiry, or to notice, otherwise than to express our admira tion for it, Professor Miiller's sketch of the empirical stage of the science. Passing over the purely grammatical achieve ments of Aristarchus and his compeers, and the more compre hensive labors of Leibnitz and Hervas, if we contemplate the present condition of the science of language, we shall be com pelled to acknowledge that, though important inductions have been made, and wide generalizations arrived at, the science still presents more or less of an empirical character. It is empirical in the qualified sense in which chemistry is empiri cal, as having hitherto discovered no ultimate law from which the genesis of its phenomena may be explained. Though the philologist at present compares, analyzes, and classifies the facts before him, he is yet unable to affiliate those facts upon any primordial principle. In these days, when the science of language is invoked, on the one hand to illuminate psycho logical problems, and on the other hand to arbitrate in ethno logic controversies ; when it has opened up and made real to us the wondrous vision of that pre-historic time when the an cestors of the Celt, the Indian, the Roman, and the Teuton, =* Lewes, History of Philosophy, pp. 12,27, 154, 257; Lersch, Sprachphiloso phie der Alten, Vol. I. pp. 52, 90, Vol. III. p. 21. 35*</page><page sequence="4">414 THE EVOLUTION OF LANGUAGE. [Oct. forming a single rural community, lived together on the high lands of Central Asia, in the sacred Aryana-vaedjo ; and when it promises to give us the key to the long-sealed mysteries of ancient mythology and symbolism, ? the vast importance of the discovery of some such fundamental law must be obvious to all. Not only will the acquisition of a more rational char acter by the science of language further our knowledge of psychical and ethnic science ; not only shall we thereby ob tain still surer indications of the early phases of religion and society; but at the same time that light will be thrown over the whole field of our philosophic thinking. Whenever new uniformities in nature are disclosed, or new phenomena brought out from the realm of chaos into the realm of order, our belief in the unity of the absolute cause of phenomena is rendered firmer and more valid; for " community of result implies community of causation." Enough has been said to indicate what is here purposed. An attempt will be made to show how the growth of human speech has conformed throughout to a fixed and regular law of evolution. But it will be first advisable to examine some of the theories which have from time to time been maintained respecting the origin and growth of language. "The philosophy of the eighteenth century," says Renan, " showed a marked preference for artificial explanations in everything concerning the origines of the human mind." As an example, we might cite Rousseau's theory of a social con tract. Assembled in high parliament, this theory assumes, our antediluvian ancestors discussed, like the Persian conspirators in Herodotus, the different forms of government, and the con ditions of social existence. Peering with telescopic vision down the vista of future ages, and foreseeing th? requirements of humanity, they framed for posterity a constitution incapable of amendment or repeal. This contract, it is maintained, is the keystone of the social arch. The annulling of this won drous ordinance would involve universal disintegration; and it would thus seem that ? to reverse the dictum of Mackintosh ? constitutions do not grow, but are made, or at least were made, once for all, by our legislation-loving progenitors. The ories of this sort, the serious refutation of which would now be</page><page sequence="5">1863.] THE EVOLUTION OE LANGUAGE. 415 almost superfluous, were in great favor a century ago ; for they were the natural growth of that revolutionary feeling whose tendency was to seek the origin of all social phenomena in the individual will of man. Language accordingly was interpreted as an artificial product; and this view was main tained by Condillac, Maupertuis, Volney, Rousseau, and Con dorcet. Of the French philosophers, Turgot alone seems to have been free from this universal tendency to look upon lan guage as a material entity. Such a theory is open to grave objections. Manifestly, if the growth of language were in any way dependent upon determinate volition, an incalculable element would at once be introduced into our problem. But this is not the case. The most potent sovereign and the wisest senate would find themselves utterly unable to control one iota of grammatical structure, or to introduce a single phonetic change; while the arbitrary metamorphosis of a neuter into a feminine, though boldly attempted by the Emperor Sigis rnund,* is no more possible than the conversion of an adult working-bee into a queen. Changes in the grammars and vo cabularies of languages are constantly taking place, it is true. The language of Virgil and Catullus has become that of Dante, of Corneille, of Camoens, and of Lope; the language of De Montfort's Parliament has been gradually transmuted into the vernacular of the Thirty-Seventh Congress ; and the noble Sanskrit of Kalidasa's dramas has lapsed into the jargon of the Sepoy. But none of these changes were produced by the con scious intervention of man. On the contrary, they have often taken place in spite of the united exertions of fastidious schol ars, of academic bodies, and of the elect of society. There fol lows the obvious comment, that an invention which is unmodi fiable by human caprice presents a very suspicious anomaly. Mankind invent locomotives, chronometers, torsion-balances, and floating batteries; and an action for infringement of pat ent awaits the too slight innovation of some luckless after experimenter. Legislative assemblies frame laws which in the ensuing session are repealed. The statute-book may be burned, the charter rescinded, and the monarch dethroned. But not * Miiller, p. 47.</page><page sequence="6">416 THE EVOLUTION OP LANGUAGE. [Oct. one of the laws of lingual growth can thus be suspended, and the inference is obvious, that what is not amenable to human control cannot be the product of human invention. Add to this, that language can hardly be considered, as on this theory by implication it must be considered, a material entity. Even were the proposed solution accepted, however, it would be no solution ; for we should still have to inquire how language was invented. Inventive art implies science, science implies ob servation, observation implies phenomena to be observed ; and hence, as we have seen, philology became possible only at a late date, and after a large accumulation of facts had been made, to serve as materials for theory. Accordingly, language could not have been framed without some a priori knowledge of linguistic structure, which being impossible, the theory ends in absurdity. The vast fabric of human speech was not, then, the lucky notion of some primeval Yankee, nor could it have been devised by a conclave of patriarchal savants, who be queathed it as an heirloom to posterity. Those who assert that such was the case have forgotten to explain to us how in that archaic Quaker meeting there was effected the interchange of ideas necessary for carrying on the discussion. The reaction against the revolutionary philosophy, which took place early in the present century, was attended by the devel opment of a new theory in respect to the origin of language. The failure of all attempts to explain language as a product of human ingenuity led philosophers to consider it as a Divine gift, supernaturally bestowed upon man ; and this theory was upheld by De Maistre, De Bonald, Lamennais, and Gioberti. With reference to this theory we may observe, that it offers us, not a real, but a verbal explanation. As Cousin acutely writes, " The institution of language by the Deity removes the diffi culty, but does not solve it: the revealed signs would be for us no signs at all, but things which it would be forthwith necessary to elevate to the rank of signs, by attaching to them certain significations." Prom this inevitable conclusion, let no one infer that the phenomena of language are not, in common with all other phenomena, the divine manifestations of Omnipotence. An atheistic supposition, such as that language sprang up of it</page><page sequence="7">1863.] THE EVOLUTION OE LANGUAGE. 417 self, would, in its denial of universal causation, be the most obviously absurd of all. In the sequel, we shall find the rational interpretation of linguistic phenomena bringing us ultimately to the First and Inscrutable Cause. Our present conclusion is destructive only of that crude and irreverent anthropomorphism, which, like the declining spirit of the Greek tragedy, introduces the deus ex machina whenever some Gor dian knot in its theory needs cutting. As the sole remaining alternative, we are obliged to look upon language, not as a material product, but as an organic growth, conforming to definite laws of development, and de termined by conditions partly physical and partly social. This view, the only one consistent with the present state of scientific knowledge, has received the sanction of nearly all the most eminent philosophers and philologists of the age, and is expressed, with more or less distinctness, in the writings of Schelling, Grimm, Humboldt, Bunsen, and Muller. It is the only view which will permit linguistic phenomena to be inter preted in accordance with some law of nature. Before pro ceeding, however, it is advisable to guard against a miscon ception which may arise from the use of so vague a word as growth, ? a word which, being commonly employed to denote the development of plants and animals, is apt to suggest incor rect analogies. In the widest sense, indeed, all growth is one and the same process. But in none save the most abstract sense can the growth of language be conceived as at all similar to the growth of a tree ; and the comparison instituted between the two by Friedrich Schlegel is vicious even as an analogy. We derive little mental illumination from the assertion that " all parts of language are implicitly contained in the primi tive germ, just as the parts of a plant potentially pre-exist in the seed." * The latter statement is more than questionable, and the former requires for its mere comprehension that ter * This is distinctly asserted by Renan, in the following singular passage : " Un gerrae est pose : le germe se developpe ; mais rien ne se cree, rien ne s'ajoute ; tout y e'tait." (Histoire des Langues Semitiques, p. 461.) This excites the laughter of Steinthal: " Nun denke man an den Keim, aus dem ein Aehre, ein Baum wird ; an das Eichen, aus dem ein Thier, ein Mensch wird; an Adam, aus welchem Aris toteles, Leibnitz, Shakespeare, u. s. w. geworden sind! Sie waren alle schon in Adam und Eva gewesen! " (Ursprung der Sprache, pp. 138, 139.)</page><page sequence="8">418 THE EVOLUTION OF LANGUAGE. [Oct. rible metaphysical acumen which has hitherto been vouchsafed to Germans alone. But speculations like this of Schlegel, though more poetic than philosophical, were still held in some favor as long as the terminations of words were supposed to be mere excrescences, entirely devoid of meaning, and growing out from the root of the word much in the same manner as the branches of a tree appear to grow out from the trunk. It was thought that there could be no alternative between this opinion and that which assumes that terminations were origi nally adopted by mutual agreement, to express with algebraic brevity the different shades of thought. Be this as it may, the alternatives are alike absurd. When, at last, terminations were shown to be the remnants of significative words, these opinions were deprived of all plausibility, and the way was paved for a scientific analysis of language. The real nature of grammatical terminations was first divined by the acute and penetrating genius of John Home Tooke. But that eminent philosopher was prevented from proving, or even correctly illustrating, his admirable suggestion, by the scarcity of facts at his command. It was reserved for the present century, and for the labors of Humboldt, Bopp, and Garnett, to develop the conception of Tooke, and from the widest possible induction to establish the original independence of all terminations in all languages. The way was opened in 1816, by the Conjugations system of Franz Bopp, and in 1833 appeared the " Comparative Grammar " of the same author, ? a book which " will form forever the safe and solid foundation of comparative philology," and a great part of which is devoted to showing the pronominal character of ter minations and their once independent power. Its successors, the " Etymological Researches " of August Friedrich Pott, the " Teutonic Grammar-" of Jacob Grimm, and the gigantic work on the Kawi and Polynesian languages by Wilhelm von Humboldt, are all founded on the same general principles. But although with immense learning and admirable acuteness the same universal fact is in these writings set beyond dispute, a still further step was needful before the discovery could be completed. It was proved that the endings of words were originally pronouns ; but the manner in which the pronoun</page><page sequence="9">1863.] THE EVOLUTION OF LANGUAGE. 419 was joined to the root had not yet been thoroughly investi gated, and it was supposed by these writers that to the root in its crude form was appended the pronominal termination in the nominative case. The fatal objection to this is almost too obvious to need mention. All nominative cases must at some time have had case-endings, and these, like all endings, must once have been pronouns. Now, if these terminal pronouns were also nominative cases, we are at once forced to postulate other pronouns as their case-endings, and we are thus intro duced to an infinite series of repetitions, from which there is no escape. Other difficulties presenting themselves when we consider the logical connection of root and termination, we are led to suspect that the pronominal affixes were joined to the root, not as nominatives, but as crude forms destitute of in flection. This was shown to be the case in 1849, when, after elaborate analytic researches in more than eighty languages, Mr. Garnett announced that word-endings were originally un inflected pronominal roots, with a locative signification. In a paper on the " Nature and Analysis of the Verb," contributed to the records of the London Philological Society, this brilliant discovery was first given to the world ; and though the labors of its accomplished author were soon after brought to a close by his too early death, it found a worthy expounder in the learned Donaldson, whose works on the classic languages furnish at once its ample proof and its extensive illustration. A more important and prolific discovery than Mr. Garnett's has hardly ever been made in the science of language. It entitles its author to the first place among English philologists. It leads on the one hand to an ultimate analysis of human speech, and on the other hand to a philosophical classification of all lan guages.* Schlegel's theory of word-vegetation must thus give place to the discovery of the real nature of terminations, and the way * See Mutter's Lectures, p. 251 ; Eenan, p. 12; Garnett's Philological Essays, pp. 96, 214-227, 289-342; Donaldson's New Cratylus, p. 572; Varronianus, p. 407 ; Hebrew Grammar, p. 35 ; Bopp, Vergleichende Grammatik, Vol. I. pp. 194, 242 -545, Vol. II. pp. 253-310 ; Rodet, Grammaire Sanscrite, p. 29 ; Tooke's Diversions of Purley, p. 190; and the excellent notes of Roorda in Gericke's Java nese Grammar.</page><page sequence="10">420 THE EVOLUTION OF LANGUAGE. [Oct. is cleared for that analysis and classification which must precede the statement of the law of linguistic evolution. In reviewing the labors of the last half-century, it is seen that every inflected word consists of two parts, ? the root, express ing the material idea of the word, and the termination, which is itself a pronominal root, expressing the idea of locality ; while words which cannot be inflected may be considered as unmodifiable roots. To roots we are thus brought down, as the ultimate, undecomposable elements of speech. And since roots are all that is primitive in language, in a very ancient dialect we should expect to find the sentences consisting sim ply of juxtaposed roots, with no appearance of inflection. This is actually the case in the Chinese, and a few examples taken from that language will serve to illustrate the general principles here referred to. In Chinese, ten is expressed by ski, and two is expressed by eul; if we wish, therefore, to say twenty, we join the two, and have eul-shi. The process here is transparent; but it requires a prolonged study of philology and acquaintance with the Gothic language for us to be able to say that the English twenty was likewise originally two-ten. " The locative is formed in various ways in Chinese: one is by add ing such words as cung, the middle, or net, inside. Thus kuo-cung, in the empire ; i sui cung, within a year. The instrumental is formed by the preposition y, which preposition is an old word meaning to use. Thus y ting, with a stick, where in Latin we should use the ablative, in Greek the dative. Now, however complicated the declensions, regu lar and irregular, may be in Greek and Latin, we may be certain that originally they wTere formed by this simple method of composition. There was originally, in all the Aryan languages, a case expressive of locality, which grammarians call the locative. In Sanskrit, every sub stantive has its locative, as well as its genitive, dative, and accusative. Thus, heart in Sanskrit is hrid; in the heart, is hridi. Here, there fore, the termination of the locative is simply short i. This short i is a demonstrative root, and in all probability the same root which in Latin produced the preposition in. The Sanskrit hridi represents, therefore, an original compound, as it were, heart-within, which gradu ally became settled as one of the recognized cases of nouns ending in consonants. If we look to Chinese, we find that the locative is ex pressed there in the same manner, but with a greater freedom in the choice of the words expressive of locality." ? Muller, p. 219.</page><page sequence="11">1863.] THE EVOLUTION OF LANGUAGE. 421 It is thus apparent that the locative, which is the most primitive case, arose by the addition of a pronominal root, and Professor Muller goes on to show that the later cases, such as the genitive and dative, were formed in the same manner. A similar explanation might be given of the origin of the various forms of the verb. In showing how language has been reduced to roots as its ultimate units, we have tacitly recognized the existence of dif ferent kinds of such units. Between the root which always retains its radical character, and the root which eventually lapses into a mere termination, the difference is sufficiently obvious, and has been usually recognized by grammarians, in their classification of the elements of speech. Thus, Becker, in his able work, distinguishes between roots notional and roots relational, the former expressing ideas, and the latter expressing relations of ideas,* ? a nomenclature which is suf ficient for all practical purposes, though it might be objected that a relational root expresses an idea in denoting locality. We shall employ, as more satisfactory, the terminology of Miil ler, who designates the two fundamental elements of speech as roots predicative and roots demonstrative. There is some difficulty in accurately distinguishing the two kinds of roots, which seems to countenance Garnett's opinion, that there was originally no difference between them. Whether a purely etymological analysis is likely ever to enable us to derive the one from the other is still uncertain, though Garnett's attempts in this direction have been attended with signal success. Considering, however, for present purposes, both classes of roots as equally primitive, we have now to illustrate the man ner in which they are naturally affected by being joined. Predicative roots denote either existences or actions ; demon strative roots mark the position or locality of actions and ex istences. A concrete example will render this more intelligible. The root kill or killing simply expresses an action, without giving us any further information ; the roots here, there, and yonder designate certain positions in which any action, such as killing, may take place. They are the conditions under which * Becker, Organism der Sprache, p 158. vol. xcvii. ? no. 201. 36</page><page sequence="12">422 THE EVOLUTION OF LANGUAGE. [Oct. the phenomenon is realized in thought, ? its forms, as our meta physical friends would say. Putting together these roots, ? enveloping the act in its conditions, ? we have the para digm : Killing - here, ^ r Killing -near -me, Killing - there, y = -&lt; Killing - near - you, Killing - yonder,) ( Killing - near - him. Philology tells us that this is the way in which the persons of the verb were formed, and that even the time-worn endings of our English verb were once locative roots. An affix signify ing that the action is performed here, near the speaker, con verts the crude root into a first person, and similarly with the other affixes. Our paradigm, therefore, becomes Killing - near me, ) f I kill, Killing-near you, &gt; = J Thou killest, Killing - near him, ) ( He kills. The action is thus subjected to the limitations necessary for its realization. Instead of the mere skeleton-idea represented by " kill," we have simply to put on a termination indicative of subjective proximity, and we shall at once have the constable at our heels. It is pleasant to find that these results coincide with those which are obtained from an analysis of ideas. The ultimate elements of all knowledge are Space, Time, Matter, Motion, and Force ; of which the first four may be interpreted in terms of the last.* Our notions of Matter and Motion are gained through experiences of resistance occurring respectively in co existent and sequent positions. Space is the abstract or blank form of all experiences of coexistence, and the abstract of all experiences of sequence is Time. Of Force we can have no immediate knowledge. We know it only as manifested to us in the forms of Matter and Motion, under the conditions of Space and Time. Since the expression of our knowledge must come under the same law as our knowledge itself, it follows that language must have an element to express Matter and Motion, which are the contents of mental relations ; and likewise an element to express the forms of mental relations, which are Space and Time. These requirements are fulfilled * Spencer, First Principles, pp. 228-237.</page><page sequence="13">1863.] THE EVOLUTION OF LANGUAGE. 423 respectively by predicative and demonstrative roots : so that the inductive discovery of what the constituent elements of language are is in harmony with the deductive discovery of what those constituent elements must be. It will now be necessary to explain the principles upon which a rational classification of languages is founded. Before we can trace the law of dfalectic evolution, we must glance at the different stages in which that evolution appears. If we were to attempt, without any knowledge of the struc ture of language, to arrange in a system all the dialects spoken over the earth, we should naturally make our classes coincide with geographical and chronological divisions. The languages of America would constitute one class, those spoken in Asia a second, and so on ; while the disused dialects of antiquity would be ranked apart from those which form the medium of communication in modern times. Upon some such implied basis as this was founded the vague division of known lan guages into Oriental, Classical, and Modern, which prevailed until the middle of the last century. But with the advance of etymological knowledge it was perceived that such a classifica tion unites many languages whose vocabularies differ, and sep arates some whose vocabularies are alike. It was seen that the Hebrew and Arabic dictionaries contain scarcely any words in common with those of Tartaric dialects ; while the discovery of Sanskrit offered an example of an Oriental language whose stock of words was almost identical with that of the so-called classic tongues. The first and most obvious step to be taken in advance of the old classification was to arrange languages according to the similarity of their vocabularies. But it was soon perceived that, on this principle, some languages, as the English, could not be classed at all. Twenty languages or more contribute, each its quota, to the filling of the English dictionary ; and " on the evidence of words alone, it would be impossible to classify English with any other of the established stocks and stems of human speech." Even after leaving out of account the lesser ingredients, as it was found that the words of French descent were about equal in number to those of Saxon origin, it was concluded to regard English as formed from a mixture of the Latin and Gothic stocks. But while the English</page><page sequence="14">424 THE EVOLUTION OE LANGUAGE. [Oct. vocabulary thus defied all attempts at classification, the English grammar was seen to be unquestionably Teutonic. " Hervas was told by missionaries, that in the middle of the eighteenth century the Araucans used hardly a word which was not Span ish, though they preserved both the grammar and the syntax of their own native speech." It was further perceived that, though the Turkish dictionary was filled with Persian and Ara bic words, yet the grammatical structure of the Turkish ren dered its classification with those languages impossible. A second step was accordingly taken, and grammatical structure was made the basis of classification. Mixed languages were no longer thought of. The English fell at once into its place by the side of the German and the Dutch, and the other European tongues speedily found their proper positions. With truly poetic vision, Friedrich Schlegel " embraced in one glance the languages of India, Persia, Greece, Italy, and Germany, and riveted them together with the simple name of Indo-German ic " ; and his idea, when taken up in Germany, " led almost immediately to a genealogical classification of the principal languages of mankind." * The Semitic family came, ready to hand; and many of the nomadic dialects of Africa, Eastern Asia, and Polynesia were arranged in groups according to the relationship indicated by their common structure. But a comprehensive principle of classification had not yet been discovered. Two families indeed ? the Semitic and the Aryan ? had been established, and their relations to each other had been well ascertained. But the languages of Eastern Asia, though disposable in many subordinate groups, refused to sub mit to any of the rules of classification as yet laid down. While their mutual likeness was vaguely surmised, the nature of that likeness could not be formulated. Some held that they were the degraded forms of more highly developed languages. Some held that the relationships already perceived were the only ones existing; and that each group had its separate origin. Some transferred to philology the antiquated zoological doc trine of types, and maintained that each class of languages was formed upon its own primordial plan. A universally applica * Miiller's Lectures, pp. 84, 85, 165.</page><page sequence="15">1863.] THE EVOLUTION OF LANGUAGE. 425 ble method of classification was not suggested, until the series of analytic researches above mentioned, culminating in the great discovery of Garnett, enabled Max Miiller to classify all languages according to the manner in which their ultimate elements are compounded. In a letter to the Chevalier Bun sen, published in 1854, Muller announced the principles of his morphological classification ; applying them to the nomad lan guages of Asia and Polynesia, which, with a philosophic insight not inferior to Schlegel's, he brought together in one group, and riveted with the single name Turanian.* Miiller's discov ery is cavilled at by Renan, who, with extreme lack either of candor or of discernment, says that " the idioms united under the name Turanian have only a single character in common, ? that of being neither Aryan nor Semitic." f M. Renan's own views will be examined further on. At present we must con fine ourselves to the elucidation of Miiller's classification, merely remarking by the way, that, in our judgment, Miiller's opinions are separated from those of Renan by a distance as vast as that which separated the Copernican system of the universe from the Ptolemaic. It will soon become evident that the Turanian languages are united by positive as well as by negative characteristics ; and, moreover, that we owe to Max Muller a method of classification which is absolutely universal. Analysis brought us down to roots ? predicative and de monstrative ? as the ultimate units of language ; and all grammatical forms have been seen to arise from the coales cence of the two. It is the degree of this coalescence which forms the basis of Miiller's classification. No conception could be clearer or more philosophical. We have here a principle of universal applicability. " According to the manner in which roots are put together, we may expect to find three kinds of languages, or three stages in the gradual formation of speech. " I. Roots may be used as words, each root preserving its full inde pendence. * Bunsen's Christianity and Mankind, Vol. III. pp. 263-521 ; Miiller's Survey of Languages, p. 90. t Renan, L'Origine du Langage, p. 41. 36*</page><page sequence="16">426 THE EVOLUTION OF LANGUAGE. [Oct. " II. Two roots may be joined together to form words, and in these compounds one root may lose its independence. " III. Two roots may be joined together to form words, and in these compounds both roots may lose their independence. " The first stage, in which each root preserves its independence, and in wThich there is no formal distinction between a root and a word, I call the Radical stage. This stage is best represented by ancient Chinese. The second stage, in which two or more roots coalesce to form a word, the one retaining its radical independence, the other sinking down to a mere termination, I call the Terminational stage. This stage is best represented by the Turanian family of speech. The third stage, in which roots coalesce so that neither the one nor the other retains its substantive independence, I call the Inflectional stage. This stage is best represented by the Aryan and Semitic families." ? Mutter, pp. 286, 287. Languages in the first, second, and third stages have been also termed, respectively, Monosyllabic, Agglutinative, and Amalgamative. After what has been said in respect to the structure of language, this grand and luminous system will require but little explanation. It has already been noticed that the Chinese say $ cdng, " with a stick," where in Latin we should say baculo; here the $ is not a simple preposition, like the English with, but it is a verb, and when used as such means to employ. So that, for " with a stick," a Chinaman says " employ stick." In the Chinese there is nothing except monosyllabic roots, which may be used as nouns, verbs, ad jectives, adverbs, or whatever else is required. " As long as every word, or part of a word, is felt to express its own radical meaning, a language belongs to the first or radical stage. As soon as such words as tse in gi-tse, day, li in uo-li, at home, or y in y cdng, with the stick, lose their etymological meaning, and become mere signs of derivation or of case, language enters into the second or Terminational stage. By far the largest number of languages be long to this stage." ? Mutter, p. 288. Not only the nomadic dialects in Asia and Oceanica, but the refined Turkish, the venerable Basque, the many-syllabled tongues of America, and perhaps also the innumerable idioms of Africa, ? all go to make up the vast Turanian family.* * Rapp, Vergleichende Grammatik, Vol. I. p. 11 ; Beltran, Gramatica de la Lengua Maya, pp. 16-108.</page><page sequence="17">1863.] THE EVOLUTION OF LANGUAGE. 427 The Turanian are distinguished from the Inflectional lan guages by the circumstance that in them the root is never blended with the termination, but always stands out clear and distinct. This is sufficiently illustrated by the following para digm, from the Maya, an old dialect of Yucatan. Prom the root xic, to go, compounded with bin, the sign of the future tense, we have bin - xic - en, bin - xic - on, bin - xic - ech, bin - xic - ech, bin - xic ; bin - xic - ob. And similarly, in Turkish, from the root bakar, to regard, we have bakar - im, bakar - ir, bakar - sin, bakar - sinir, bakar ; bakar - lac. A Latin paradigm will show the contrast in the Inflectional languages, where the root is blended with the termination, and more or less obscured. From the root es we have 's-urn, e-s, es-t, 's-umus, es-tis, 's-unt. And an Aryan conjugation, like the Hindustani hun, hai, hai, hain, ho, hain, is evidently incompatible with the genius of the Turanian languages. Not only, therefore, do the languages of Turan negatively agree in being neither Aryan nor Semitic, but they also posi tively agree in the manner in which they combine roots into words. The degree of coalescence exhibited by them, inter mediate between that which takes place in Chinese and that which takes place in Hebrew or Sanskrit, is common to them all; while the differences in their vocabularies are no greater than might be expected in languages spoken by nomadic tribes destitute alike of literature and of political organization. With the establishment of the Turanian family, Miiller's classi fication becomes universal; and analysis shows that it depends upon a universally applicable principle. Having hastily traversed the difficult and possibly unin viting field of philological induction, we recur to our funda mental problem. On the one hand, an analysis of language</page><page sequence="18">428 THE EVOLUTION OF LANGUAGE. [Oct. has brought us down to roots ? predicative and demonstrative ? as its ultimate elements ; while, on the other hand, it has been shown that the rational system of classification is that which is based upon the degree of coalescence exhibited by the two orders of roots, when they combine to form words. Are these empirical results to be taken as ultimate laws ? or can they be affiliated upon some principle deeper and more comprehensive than any which the mere contemplation of roots and inflections can reveal to us ? The last of these conclusions is that which we are obliged to accept. Whether we watch the phenomena of language in the concrete, or rea son abstractly from analogies furnished by other phenomena, we are alike compelled to believe that the inductions of phi lology are affiliated upon some all-pervading law of linguistic growth. The law of organic development, announced in the early part of the present century by Goethe, Schelling, and Von Baer, and vaguely expressed in the formula that u evolution is always from the homogeneous to the heterogeneous, and from the simple to the complex," has recently been extended by Herbert Spencer, so as to include all phenomena whatever. Long ago, the researches of German physiologists had shown " that the series of changes gone through during the develop ment of a seed into a tree, or an ovum into an animal, con stitute an advance from homogeneity of structure to hetero geneity of structure." Between the primitive germ, uniform in its physical texture and chemical composition, and the adult organism, multiform in its complex combination of tis sues and organs, the contrast is sufficiently striking, and it was here that the true nature of evolution was first perceived. In 1828, it was demonstrated by Yon Baer, that the change from homogeneity to heterogeneity is that in which all organic evolution essentially consists: * and his discovery, admirably applied and illustrated by Milne-Edwards and Lewes, has taken its place among the indisputable truths of science. What Mr. Spencer has done is to show " that this law of organic evolution is the law of all evolution. Whether it be * Von Baer, Entwickelungsgeschichte, Vol. I. p. 153.</page><page sequence="19">1863.] THE EVOLUTION OF LANGUAGE. 429 in the development of the earth, in the development of life upon its surface, in the development of society, of govern ment, of manufactures, of commerce, of language, literature, science, art, this same advance from the simple to the com plex, through successive differentiations, holds uniformly. From the earliest traceable cosmical changes, down to the latest results of civilization,.the transformation of the homogeneous into the heterogeneous is that in which evolu tion essentially consists." * The stupendous induction, from all classes of phenomena, by which Mr. Spencer proceeds to establish and illustrate his theorem, cannot be given here. A few examples, intended to facilitate its comprehension, must suffice, ere we pass on to that special application which more nearly concerns us. Differentiation is the arising of an unlikeness between any number of the units composing an aggregate. Omitting, as irrelevant, the details of the nebular hypothesis, attention is called to the contrast between the originally homogeneous matter from which the heavenly bodies were formed, and the highly heterogeneous solar system, in which planets and sat ellites exhibit differences in bulk, weight, velocity, and tem perature,? in their period of rotation, their distance apart, their orbital and axial inclination, their physical constitution, and their specific gravity. In the formation of a thin crust over the once molten but gradually cooling earth we observe a marked differentiation; and the resulting condensation of water previously existing in a vaporous state ends in a differ entiation between land and sea. Upheavals follow, entailing differences of level, which in turn cause the downward flow of precipitated water in rivers ; and these, carrying along masses of rubbish in their course, give rise to differences of stratified deposits. Step by step arise, over the earth's surface, differ ences in climate, soil, and magnetic condition, ? differences thermal, chemical, electric, and hygrometric, ? until that sur face changes its characteristics from mile to mile, presenting phenomena so infinitely varied, that the scientific labors of centuries have as yet but partially enumerated them. The * Spencer's First Principles, p. 148.</page><page sequence="20">430 THE EVOLUTION OF LANGUAGE. [Oct. development already noticed of a germ into an adult animal is a series of conspicuous differentiations, among which may be mentioned the embryonic separation of a part of the ali mentary canal into a bile-secreting gland, as well as the sepa ration of the heart from the median bloodvessel, of which it originally formed an indistinguishable portion. The facts of political economy may be cited en masse, in illustration of this law. The earliest shape assumed by society was that of a collection of individuals with like offices to perform, and like abilities to exercise in their performance. Every warrior made his own bows, arrows, and slings, built the rude hut which was to shelter him from the inclemency of the weather, and roamed the forest or searched the stream in quest of food for the sup port of life. A differentiation, however, soon arises between the governors and the governed; and then between the re ligious and the civil rulers, who have hitherto been blended in some weird and hazy form, like Menes or Odin. With the ad vance from nomadism to agriculture comes the differentiation of laborers from proprietors, and afterwards of proprietors from capitalists. Coincident with the progress to higher and higher grades of civilization appear the various and diverging forms of labor, ever more multiplied and distinct. Agricul turists, manufacturers, merchants, bankers, inventors of pro cesses and discoverers of laws, legislators, justices, soldiers, and policemen are now co-operating members of that complex social organism which in the course of ages has been evolved from a homogeneous multitude of barbarians. The phenom ena of " division of labor " are so obviously instances of dif ferentiation, that they were alluded to as such by Goethe half a century ago. From Mr. Spencer's work examples innumer able might be culled, did space permit, illustrating and con firming the law in the development of the varied products of civilization, ? painting and sculpture, music and poetry, sci ence and literature, customs and manners. Equally in the rise of parts of speech, in the coining of words to express new ideas, in the divergent meanings ac quired by words originally synonymous, in the perpetual out growth of provincial dialects, and in the branching off of lan guages from a common stock, may be seen a manifest differen</page><page sequence="21">1863.] THE EVOLUTION OF LANGUAGE. 431 tiation, involving a gradual change from simplicity to complex ity. Whether an etymological analysis will ever allow of our reducing the primitive elements of language to predicative or to demonstrative roots alone, is, as we have seen, uncertain; but what has been already accomplished enables us to point to an early phase of speech, in which the distinction between the two orders of roots is not clear. In the Chinese, in which the only parts of speech are roots, and a predicative root may be used at will as a demonstrative root, as in the phrase y cdng u employ stick," the homogeneity of structure is manifest. We have already adverted to the multifarious purposes which may be served by a single Chinese word. Without any change of form, the sound ta may mean great, greatness, and to be great. But this is nothing to what occurs in the Annamitic and the Cochin-Chinese, where the same syllable may be made to sig nify twenty-three entirely different things, according to the way in which it is accented. Thus, in Annamitic, Ba ha ba ba means, when rightly pronounced, " Three ladies gave a box on the ear to the favorite of the prince." * The homogeneity of this will probably not be disputed. The first differentiation arises when, by the varying colloca tion of two or more roots, nouns and verbs are formed; and when a pronominal root is appended to a noun, converting it into an adjective, a second differentiation takes place. In like manner, by further differentiations, arise adverbs, prepositions, conjunctions, and articles ; while the once uniform verb has become multiform through the successive appearance of moods and tenses, numbers, persons, and voices, until, as in Greek, if conjugated throughout, it yields about thirteen hundred forms. Originally all nouns were concrete. " There are dia lects spoken at the present day which have no abstract nouns, and the more we go back in the history of languages, the smaller we find the number of these useful expressions. As far as language is concerned, an abstract word is nothing but an adjective raised into a substantive."! See here the con * Max Miiller, Introductory Lecture on the Science of Language, delivered at the Royal Institution, the 21st of February, 1863. t Miiller, Comparative Philology, p. 33.</page><page sequence="22">432 THE EVOLUTION OF LANGUAGE. [Oct. spicuous differentiation, ? first of nouns into substantives and adjectives, and then of the latter into adjectives proper and nouns abstract. Those verbs and adjectives which denote actions and qualities not sensuous, have arisen by differentia tion from those which express sensuous qualities and actions. Witness the adjective " right" and the verb " reflect," which we habitually use without thinking of " straightness " or of " bending back." Yet contemporaneous with their derivative meaning is their primary signification still in use ; as when we speak of " reflected light," or of a " right line." In the evo lution of families of words from a common root, the process may be likewise traced. From the single root spac have arisen, in English alone, words so different as bishop, spy, respectable, sceptic, spite, suspect, despise, conspicuous, speculate, aus picious, species, and spice. From the root ar we have, in various languages, aratrum, aroma, art, earth, arbeit, errand, vTrrjperrjs, and oar. More notable instances of differentiation could not be desired. Once more, in the evolution of families of languages from a common stock, we find still further illus trations of this process. The generation of the six Romance dialects from the Latin, and of the various Teutonic languages from the slightly divergent idioms of the Gothic, are examples which will occur to every one; while in the development of thirty or more Aryan languages from a common ancestor, we have a still more prominent fact of like implication. Add to these, that, in our own time, a slight differentiation is traceable between English as spoken in America and the same language as spoken in England. Enough has been already said to show that the evolution of language is a change from homogeneity to heterogeneity, through continuous differentiations. But on carefully recon sidering the matter, we shall become convinced that this gen eralization does not express the whole truth. It does not in clude all the phenomena of evolution, to the exclusion of all other phenomena. " That there are changes from the less heterogeneous to the more heterogeneous, which do not come within what we call evolution, is proved in every case of local disease. A portion of the body in which there arises a cancer, or other morbid growth, unquestionably displays a new differ</page><page sequence="23">1863.] THE EVOLUTION OF LANGUAGE. 433 entiation." * Yet such a change, so far from constituting a further stage of evolution, is a step toward dissolution. An example from philology is not easily found, yet when we re flect that in many languages which have no literature, like the Iroquois, the Huron, and the Palenque, differentiation goes on so fast as completely to change the vocabulary of the language in less than twenty years, we are inclined to suspect that such rapid differentiation cannot be strictly termed growth. The suspicion is aroused, that the formula of evolution above given does not contain all that it should, but that an important ele ment has been omitted ; and such Mr. Spencer has shown to be the case. " At the same time that all evolution is a change from the homogene ous to the heterogeneous, it is also a change from the indefinite to the definite. As well as an advance from simplicity to complexity, there is an advance from confusion to order, ? from undetermined arrange ment to determined arrangement. In the process of development, no matter what sphere it is displayed in, there is not only a gradual multi plication of unlike parts, but there is a gradual increase in the distinct ness with which these parts are marked off from each other. And so is that increase of heterogeneity which characterizes evolution distin guished from that increase of heterogeneity which does not.This advance from the indefinite to the definite is obviously not primary, but secondary, ? is an incidental result attendant on the finishing of certain changes.That is to say, the acquirement of definiteness is sim ply a concomitant of complete union of the elements constituting each component division. Thus, evolution is characterized, not only by a continuous multiplication of parts, but also by a growing oneness in each part. And while an advance in heterogeneity results from progressive differentiation, an advance in definiteness results from progressive inte gration."? First Principles, pp. 177, 196. Evolution is accordingly a change from indefinite homoge neity to definite heterogeneity; and this definition is strictly universal. The arising of an unlikeness within an aggregate between any number of its component units is differentiation ; while integration is the separate grouping of those units which are similarly differentiated. A few examples will render this clear. When autumn leaves are blown from their branches * Spencer, First Principles, p. 175. vol. xcvu. ? no. 201. 37</page><page sequence="24">434 THE EVOLUTION OF LANGUAGE. [Oct. by an equinoctial gale, the strong current of air fails to detach those which have remained green ; while the red and yellow leaves, whirled about by eddying gusts, are at length collected by themselves in ditches and around stone walls. On any un paved road in March, upon which, under the influence of a uniform wind, the mud is beginning to dry, we may see incipi ent integration exemplified in the separate linear heaps which are formed respectively of fine dust, coarse sand, and pebbles. When the Rhone comes tumbling from its Alpine sources into the Lake of Geneva, its contained sediment, according to the size of its particles, is deposited in different strata along a slope of nearly two miles in length, the boulders being at the mouth of the river, while the fine mud lies at the end of the slope ; and a like phenomenon occurs when the sea tears off and car ries to a great distance a part of the eastern coast of England. On letting a handful of powdered sugar fall to the ground in a slight breeze, the fragments will fall in lines more or less in clined, according to their weight; the lumps falling perpendic ularly, while the small particles are carried several yards off. The separating power of currents, whether of air or water, is recognized in the winnowing of chaff, and in the manufacture of emery ; and the Sheffield knife-grinder wears a magnetized mask, by which to separate the steel-dust from the waste of the stone. In each of these cases is exhibited that segregation of like units which follows the exposure of an aggregate to the action of a uniform force ; and this is -what is meant by inte gration. In the formation of the solar system, the matter composing each planet and satellite was not only separated from the surrounding matter, but was concentrated into a dis tinct body of definite shape. Among telluric phenomena may be cited the advance from the earth of the primary period, covered with innumerable islands, to the earth as it now is, with ocean and continent clearly marked out and separately integrated ; the collection of detritus into strata, and of strata into systems ; the " unification of similar elements " which oc curs in crystallization wherever the conditions allow of it; and the integration of climates which has resulted from the growing difference between the sun's heat and the heat of the earth. From the phenomena presented by living organisms, countless</page><page sequence="25">1863.] THE EVOLUTION OF LANGUAGE. 435 instances of integration might be culled. "Witness the pro gressive concentration of the segments of articulate animals, made manifest by contrasting the centipede with the crab, or the caterpillar with the butterfly ; and, in higher animals, the union of the anterior vertebrae to form the skull. In the rise of families, and their coalescence, first into tribes and ulti mately into states, and in the partial union of these states in federations, as well as in the growing interdependence, politi cal and commercial, of nations in themselves distinct, still further illustration is found. Rude and fragmentary as our illustrations have necessarily been, they still have all the same implication; and if they fa cilitate the apprehension of what is to follow, their object will have been attained. We are now to consider the process of integration as a part of the evolution of language. Whoever has studied the excellent " Grammar of the Ro mance Languages," by Diez, will not fail to have been struck by the progressive concentration of syllabic sounds, with the con sequent contraction of words, which has attended and in part constituted the change of colloquial Latin into the modern dialects of the South of Europe. The differentiation of the mother tongue into Italian, French, and the kindred languages, whereby it has become notably heterogeneous, is not more marked than the accompanying integration of vast numbers of words, evidenced by such changes as those of pater, catena, blasphemare, captivus, sacramentum, separare, focus, prataria, and de illo, into pere, chaine, bldmer, chetif, serment, sevrer, feu, prairie, and du. It may be objected that chetif, though a more integrated form than captivus, is no better adapted to express an idea, and that therefore such integration as this can hardly be considered part of an evolution from an incom plete state to a state of completeness. To this it may be an swered, that, inasmuch as each of the sounds composing any word must awaken a separate sensation before the perception of the entire word can be followed by the idea of the thing which it signifies; and as these sensations, though rapidly suc cessive, are still successive and not simultaneous, the fewer the sounds which go to make up any word, the sooner must the word be represented in consciousness. In short, the more</page><page sequence="26">436 THE EVOLUTION OF LANGUAGE. [Oct. concentrated are the component elements of a word, the sooner will it be followed by its corresponding thought, the sooner will it be understood. And this difference, though wholly in appreciable in the case of any single word, is yet quite percep tible in a moderately long sentence, in which the frequent oc currence of compounds or of polysyllabic words usually some what retards our apprehension of the meaning. Accordingly, since language must be deemed perfect in so far as it tends to call up definite ideas, ? or, technically speaking, since the per fection of language must be rated according to the degree in which words are integrated with their corresponding thoughts, ? it follows that the integration of words, for the reason just mentioned, must be a part of the evolution of language from an incomplete state to a state of completeness. Unimportant as may seem the change from captivus to chetif, it is neverthe less one of a host of like changes, which form an essential fea ture of linguistic development. On turning our attention to languages of a very low order, the force of these considerations will become still more apparent, and we shall be convinced that a clumsy and lumbering language must necessitate clumsy and lumbering thought. " In a Ricaree vocabulary extending to fifty names of common ob jects, which in English are nearly all expressed by single syllables, there is not one monosyllabic word ; and in the nearly-allied vocabu lary of the Pawnees, the names for these same common objects are monosyllabic in but two instances. Things so familiar to these hunting tribes as dog and bow are, in the Pawnee language, ashakish and tee ragish ; the hand and the eyes are respectively iksheeree and keereekoo ; for day the term is shakoorooeeshairet, and for devil it is tsaheekshka kooraiwah ; while the numerals are composed of from two syllables up to five, and in Ricaree up to seven." ? First Principles, p. 204. The right hand, in the Cherokee, is denoted by tsikatesixquo yeni, and in the Mohawk by gowweeintlataquoh; while in the Okanagan, woman is euphoniously termed tukulthlimeilooch. Nor is this polysyllabism a peculiarity of the American tongues ; for if we visit the coast of New Guinea, we shall hear the eyebrows called matatangowarah; and, in Western Tasmania, no shorter name can be found for the eyelashes than matara pulupulura. But the most prodigious example of all is to be</page><page sequence="27">1863.] THE EVOLUTION OF LANGUAGE. 437 seen in an old Mexican Paternoster, where " amen " is obliged to content itself with the substitute chontacholacahuanla, and where '* Forgive us our sins " is neatly expressed by " Caquila matzancaniuhquintacallitcan " ! " That the great length of these familiar words implies a low degree of development, and that in the formation of higher languages out of lower there is a progressive integration, which reduces the polysyllables to dissyllables and monosylla bles, is an inference fully confirmed by the history of our own language." Mr. Spencer cites the consolidation of the Anglo Saxon words steorra, mona, sunu, and nama into the English forms star, moon, son, and name. And in the shortening of the Anglo-Saxon plural in as to our plural in s, as well as in the displacement of the terminal an in infinitives by the single letter e, he finds still further confirmation. The Elizabethan tellen has lapsed into tell; burned, except in the Church service, has become burnt; and, similarly, the dissyllable bre-ad has become, except in some rustic localities, the mono syllable bread. To which it may be added, that the naow and dew and waal, which are frequently heard from uncultivated persons are expressions far less integrated than their civilized equivalents. A remarkable example of integration is found in the coalescence of " God be with you " into " Good by " : and the French meme, the Danish erzbisp, and the Italian darottelo, when compared with their ancestral forms, semet ipsissimus, archiepiscopus, and dare-habeo-tibi-illud, exhibit the process in its extreme phase. The part played by integration in the evolution of language has been noticed by Miiller, who, however, utterly failing to perceive its true import, has named it " phonetic decay," and continually speaks of it as " disease," " corruption," and " taint." But we are now about to show that it is upon the comparative degrees of integration exhibited by different lan guages that his admirable classification is entirely and exclu sively founded. And when we find that it is by means of this " phonetic decay" that all grammatical forms have arisen, enabling language to delineate the faintest shades of thought, we can no longer have any hesitation in admitting integra 37*</page><page sequence="28">438 THE EVOLUTION OF LANGUAGE. [Oct. tion to be an indispensable part of the process of linguistic growth. The earliest, or Radical stage of language, represented by the old Chinese and its cognate dialects, is distinguished by the almost entire absence of integration. Every word is sim ply a monosyllabic root, and every root maintains its inde pendence. Root and termination are as distinct as the seg ments of the terebella; and, like the head and tail portions of that many-jointed animal, each can be used without the other. This absence of inflection prevents any intimate union of the different parts of a sentence, such as becomes possible when either inflections or relational words are introduced; and the expression of ideas is consequently vague and ill-defined in the extreme. The lack of coherence between the elements of words entails a corresponding lack of coherence between the elements of a proposition. And so incoherent and indefinite is the character of conversation in the Celestial Empire, that a Chinaman, in order to signify that he is journeying from Pekin to Canton, must resort to the following sentence, to our ears hardly intelligible : " Going-blockhead * origin Pekin end Canton." Yet even the Chinese, which is the monosyllabic and unin flected language par excellence, exhibits, in some of its dia lects, signs of incipient integration. As Dr. Latham remarks, " The separate words most in use to express relations may become adjuncts or annexes." This is seen in the phrase uo-li=domi, at home, where li, originally meaning interior, is losing its independent signification. When this coalescence has taken place to such an extent that an entire set of words have lapsed into mere terminations, used only in combination with other words which stand to them in the relation of roots, language has passed into the second, or Terminational stage. On turning back to our remarks upon Miiller's system of classification, it will be seen at once that it is their more complete integration, shown in the partial merging of the termination in the root, which distinguishes the Turanian * So transcendent are the politeness and humble self-abnegation of the Chinese, that, to indicate the first person, they are in the habit of using such words as tshin, subject; in, blockhead; or tsie, thief. See Miiller's Introductory Lecture.</page><page sequence="29">1863.] THE EVOLUTION OF LANGUAGE. 439 languages from the Chinese and its allies. And when we come to the Semitic and Aryan families ? whose distinctive mark is, that in them both root and termination have lost their individuality, and are significant only when combined ? our statement, that a high degree of integration is attended with a high degree of evolution, is so verified as to exclude the possi bility of denial. An investigation of the true principles of classification, discovered by Muller, shows us that the phe nomena classed by him under the head of " phonetic decay " are in no way symptoms of any disease or taint, but are, on the contrary, indispensable phases in the evolution of language. Were it not so, the English ? the most highly integrated of all languages ? would have to be rated lower than the Chinese ; and the fact that it expresses so much more perfectly than the latter the thoughts and feelings attendant upon an advanced stage of civilization, could in no wise be accounted for. A third kind of integration must be briefly defined. We have seen that the development of language, and its gradual perfection as a means of expressing thought, must be depend ent upon and accompanied by an increasing logical coherence of the elements of propositions ; and the progressive integra tion, first of constituent sounds, and secondly of component roots, has been pointed out as tending to this result. But the logical coherence of sentences is furthered by still another process. Accompanying the integration of sounds and words, there is an integration of clauses. " After the development of those grammatical forms which make definite statements possible, we do not at first find them used to express anything beyond statements of a simple kind. A single subject with a single predicate, accompanied by but few qualifying terms, is usually all. If we compare, for instance, the Hebrew Scriptures with writings of modern times, a marked difference of aggregation among the groups of words is visible. In the number of subordinate propositions which accompany the principal one, in the various complements to subjects and predicates, and in the numerous qualifying clauses, ? all of them united into one complex whole, ? many sentences in modern composi tion exhibit a degree of integration not to be found in ancient ones."? First Principles, p. 207. The rational interpretation of the phenomena of language</page><page sequence="30">440 THE EVOLUTION OF LANGUAGE. [Oct. would be incomplete without some allusion to the causes of differentiation and integration. In bringing the growth of speech under the formula of evolution in general, a class of less familiar facts is ranged along with classes of facts that are more familiar, and is, to that extent, explained. But to per fect the explanation, it will be desirable to hint at the princi ples which necessitate evolution, and, after showing that a cer tain set of changes invariably take place, to show likewise why, in the nature of things, they must take place. This latter point has been treated by Mr. Spencer with a learning and a power no less conspicuous than are displayed in his treatment of the former ; and our fast-diminishing space, as well as the neces sity of viewing the subject in yet other phases, will oblige us here to confine ourselves to the mere reproduction of his illus trations. It results from the fundamental principles of all science, " that, in the actions and reactions of force and matter, an un likeness in either of the factors necessitates an unlikeness in the effects." When the different portions of any homogeneous aggregate are exposed to the action of unlike forces, or to un equal intensities of the same force, they are of necessity differ ently affected thereby. Between the unequally exposed parts there arise structural differences, entailing differences of prop erty and function. That which before was homogeneous has become heterogeneous through the appearance of certain un likenesses ; and, under the name of differentiation, the rise of such unlikenesses has already been described. All that re mains is to show that such unlikenesses cannot but arise, ? that differentiation must needs take place. It must take place, because it is inconceivable that all the parts of any aggregate should be similarly conditioned with respect to any incident force. Whether it be the mechanical vibrations caused by a blow, the lengthened undulations constituting heat, or the shorter undulations constituting light, that are propagated through any body, it equally follows that the respective vibra tions will be communicated in different degrees to those parti cles which are situated on the nearer and on the farther side of the body, and to those particles which are laterally near to or remote from the line taken by the incident force. The dif</page><page sequence="31">1863.] THE EVOLUTION OF LANGUAGE. 441 ferent particles will be variously moved, heated, or chemically affected, and a whole series of differentiations will thus have arisen. In the impossibility of balancing an accurately made pair of scales, in the equal impossibility of keeping a tank of water free from currents, in the rusting of iron, in the uneven cooling of a heated metal, and in the presence of onion-shaped bodies in quarries of trap-rock, this principle is manifest. We need go no further than the kitchen, to perceive that the crust formed on a loaf of bread, or a joint of roast meat, is due to the necessarily unequal exposure of outside and inside to the incident force coming in the shape of heat from the walls of the oven. Universally, the tendency of things, amid the con flict of unlike forces, is toward heterogeneity ; and this tenden cy is expressed in the formula, that " the state of homogeneity is a state of unstable equilibrium." The more heterogeneous an aggregate becomes, the more rapidly must differentiation go on, because each of its component units may be consid ered as a whole, bearing relations to the other units similar to those which the aggregate bears to other aggregates ; and thus the differentiation of the whole must be followed by dif ferentiation in each of the parts. Coincident with the differentiation of aggregates, there is a differentiation of the incident forces. When a body is broken up by collision, its original momentum is severed into a group of momenta, which differ both in amount and direction. The ray of solar light which falls upon the foliage of a tree and upon the wall of the brick building behind it, is separated by reflection into red and green rays, in which the undulations differ, both in height and in breadth. Each portion of the dif ferentiated force must in its turn enter as a factor into new differentiations. There must thus be a multiplication of ef fects, ? a multiplication increasing with the heterogeneity; because the forces which all bodies mutually exert upon one another must become ever more varied and complex in their amounts, intensities, kinds, and directions. Prom these examples, which, meagre as they are, will suffice to illustrate what is meant by the instability of the homogene ous and the multiplication of effects, it will be seen that dif ferentiation is a necessary consequence of the fundamental</page><page sequence="32">442 THE EVOLUTION OF LANGUAGE. [Oct. properties of matter and force. And that of these fundamen tal properties integration is also the necessary consequence, will become evident when we reflect that, " in the actions and reactions of force and matter, in the absence of unlikeness in either of the factors the effects must be alike." Differently affected units must be differentiated, and similarly affected groups of units must be integrated. Throughout the known universe, the change from indefinite homogeneity to definite heterogeneity must, therefore, ever go on, and the ratio of its progress must be a geometrical ratio. Without transgressing all our experiences of force and matter, no other result is conceivable. In the phenomena of language, the instability of the homo geneous is best seen in the acquirement of unlike meanings by words originally synonymous. This process, which Coleridge terms " desynonymization," is so admirably described by Mr. Spencer, that we cannot do better than cite the whole passage. " In the old divines, miscreant is used in its etymological sense of unbeliever ; but in modern speech it has entirely lost this sense. Simi larly with evil-doer and malefactor ; exactly synonymous as these are by derivation, they are no longer synonymous by usage ; by a malefac tor we now understand a convicted criminal, which is far from being the acceptation of evil-doer. The verb produce bears in Euclid its pri mary meaning, ? to prolong or draw out ; but the now largely devel oped meanings of produce have little in common with the meanings of prolong ot draw out. In the Church of England liturgy, an odd effect results from the occurrence of prevent in its original sense, to come before, instead of its modern specialized sense, to come before with the effect of arresting. But the most conclusive cases are those in which the contrasted words consist of the same parts differently combined; as in go under and undergo. We go under a tree, and we undergo a pain. But though, if analytically considered, the meanings of these expres sions would be the same were the words transposed, habit has so far modified their meanings that we could not without absurdity speak of undergoing a tree and going under a pain. Countless such instances might be brought to show that between two words which are originally of like force an equilibrium cannot be maintained. Unless they are daily used in exactly equal degrees, in exactly similar relations (against which there are infinite probabilities), there necessarily arises a habit of associating one rather than the other with particular acts or objects.</page><page sequence="33">1863.] THE EVOLUTION OF LANGUAGE. 443 Such a habit, once commenced, becomes confirmed ; and gradually their homogeneity of meaning disappears. In each individual we may see the tendency which inevitably leads to this result. A certain vocabu lary and a certain set of phrases distinguish the speech of each person ; each person habitually uses certain words in places where other words are habitually used by other persons ; and there is a continual recur rence of favorite expressions. This inability to maintain a balance in the use of verbal symbols, which characterizes every man, character izes, by consequence, aggregates of men ; and the desynonymization of words is the ultimate effect." ? First Principles, pp. 378, 379. In our attempt to show that the evolution of language has been a change from indefinite homogeneity to definite hetero geneity, no explicit allusion has been made to the opposing theories in regard to the common origin of languages. To the acceptance of the doctrine here defended, it is not of vital im portance that this much disputed question should be answered either affirmatively or negatively. Whether or not it be decided that all the varieties of human speech have descended from a single ancestral language, it still remains true, that, as whole families like the Aryan and Semitic have demonstrably arisen from a common source, the growth of language has been marked by continuous differentiation. Whether we accept the monogenetic doctrine of Miiller, or the polygenetic doc trine of Renan, we must admit that the difference between the higher and the lower forms of speech is the difference be tween their comparative degrees of integration. Even though language may never have been absolutely homogeneous, yet, since it can be shown that its progress has been from relative homogeneity to relative heterogeneity, our position is in no wise altered, nor is the opinion here maintained in the least invalidated. Yet, on account of the interest attaching to the inquiry, it is well to notice some of the arguments of those who deny the possibility of a common origin for all languages, as well as some of their subsidiary statements, which are at variance with any theory of evolution whatever. After pronouncing the less highly integrated Greek and Sanskrit " superior" to the more highly integrated modern languages, on account of their greater wealth of inflections, M. Renan proceeds to the startling assertion that the Sanskrit</page><page sequence="34">444 THE EVOLUTION OF LANGUAGE. [Oct. and the Greek are types ? perhaps even degraded types ? of the primitive Aryan speech. The opinion of Renan is that of a large but rapidly decreasing number of philologists, among whom we are sorry to mention the acute and learned Donald son.* These eminent scholars apparently perceive no incon gruity in the supposition, that the language of the naked, hand to-mouth-living savages who first of men peopled the earth was superior in complexity and richness to that language which has served as the medium of thought for a Mill, a Newton, and a Herschel, ? in which have been conceived and written the magic prose of De Quincey and the divine poetry of Tennyson. The incongruity is, however, one which cannot here be passed over. When we are explicitly told that the savage in praying to his fetish makes use of a rich and perfect idiom, while the philosopher in working out his profound gener alizations makes use of an idiom that is imperfect and meagre, ? when we are implicitly told that there is no such thing as an evolution of language, but only a perpetual dissolution, ? we shall be slow to believe such an astounding statement, except on the strongest and most abundant evidence. But such evidence is never brought forward. Many content themselves with vaguely asserting that complex languages, like the San skrit, could never have existed in any simpler state ; and this is the chief argument adduced by Renan. This, however, is simply begging the question ; for to say that a complex lan guage must be primitive because it could never have existed in a simpler state, is to say that a complex language must be primitive because it must be primitive, ? an argument in which, unfortunately, the assumed premise is identical with the disputed conclusion. Against this somewhat reckless reasoning may be urged a consideration which will tend to prove that a primitive language cannot be like the Latin or the Sanskrit, ? cannot be other than simple. There can be no words with out some knowledge of the objects which they represent, and there can be no grammar without some perception of the rela tions in which things stand to one another. Now, if any one will venture to say that a race of primeval savages, with their very limited knowledge of surrounding objects, and with their * New Cratylus, pp. 87, 389.</page><page sequence="35">1863.] THE EVOLUTION OF LANGUAGE. 445 rudimentary and undeveloped perception of the relations borne by those objects to one another and to themselves, did never theless make use of a language more copious in words and more intricate in inflection than the idioms of the civilized Greeks and Hindoos, we shall be at a loss whether to sus pect his candor or his sanity. But M. Renan contends that, throughout the period which we know historically, all lan guages have been becoming, not more complex, but more sim ple, and that there is no reason for supposing that the process of simplification has not gone on from the beginning. He appears unaware that the etymological simplicity entailed by long-continued integration is far more than balanced by the syntactic complexity arising from long-continued differentia tion. Though the English, by the absence of inflections, may be said to be simpler than the Sanskrit, yet by the presence of countless relational words it must be pronounced far more complex than the latter language. Its greater heterogeneity cannot for an instant be denied. There is one consideration which completely destroys M. Re nan's oft-repeated assertion that the inflectional languages never could have existed in a state analogous to the Chinese. The analysis of the ultimate elements of words in the Aryan lan guages, so admirably achieved by Humboldt, Bopp, and their compeers, has shown that all terminations and other inflectional modifications had once their.proper meaning, which is now obscured and lost by their fusion with the root. The particu lars of this analysis have already been narrated. Now where, in a survey of the Aryan languages, does this independent meaning appear ? If we go back to the earliest extant frag ments of the Lithuanian, Zend, and Sanskrit, we find the ter mination still blended with the root, its meaning still chopped and defaced. Will M. Renan put us off by saying that these terminations never really had a separate meaning, but arose with their original significations already obscured? To do this would be to put himself into a position like that taken by the old opposers of geology, who accounted for the existence of fossils by assuming them to be the relics of animals created in an already defunct state. The discovery of the once inde pendent meaning of terminations compels us to believe that vol. xcvii.?no. 201. 38</page><page sequence="36">446 THE EVOLUTION OF LANGUAGE. [Oct. language once existed in a state in which that independence was fully recognized, and in which that meaning was fully felt; and such a state could be no other than that in which we still find the Chinese. Thus vanishes the difficulty of proving a common origin for languages. If we have reason to believe that the common parent of the Saxon, the Latin, and the Sanskrit must, at some remote period, have passed through the radical and termina tional stages before reaching its inflectional state, then all the impassable barriers set up between different families of speech are thrown down. The three great divisions of languages must come to be looked upon as three successive epochs of linguistic development; and we shall be vindicated in having all along implicitly treated them as such. One remaining objection must, however, be noticed. Probable as it doubtless is that a language should pass from one stage into another, it may still be said that we have no inductive evidence that such has been the case. It is said that no intermediate links can be found. But this is far from being universally true. " In Chinese, and particularly in Chinese dialects, we find rudi mentary traces of agglutination." As before remarked, the words oftenest used as affixes are apt gradually to lose their proper meaning. " A modern Chinese is no more aware that li (a locative affix) meant originally interior, than the Tura nian is of the origin of his case-terminations." The integra tion just becoming perceptible in the Chinese has been observed by Stanislas Julien, who traces it in numerous compounds. Though in the literary language of the Mandarins little ad vance has been made,* in the provincial dialects integration is beginning to show itself. " In the Shanghai dialect, wo is to speak, as a verb ; woda, a word. Of woda, a genitive is formed, wodaka; a dative, pela-woda; an accusative, tang wodaT f " In agglutinative languages, again, we meet with rudimentary traces of inflection. Thus, in Tamil, the root tungu, to sleep, has not retained its full integrity in the de rivative tukkam, sleep." In certain Kalmuck dialects, there is a partial blending of termination and root. J And " such * Bazin, Grammaire Mandarine, p. xvii. t Miiller's Lectures, p. 330; Bazin, Principes Generaux du Chinois Vulgaire. % Remusat, Recherches sur les Langues Tartares, Tom. I. p. 180.</page><page sequence="37">1863.] THE EVOLUTION OF LANGUAGE. 447 has been the advance which Turkish has made toward inflec tional forms, that Professor Ewald claims for it the title of a synthetic language, a title which he gives to the Aryan and Semitic dialects after they have left the agglutinative stage." * We need, therefore, be no longer puzzled by the absence of transitional phases, when we find that alleged absence to be a figment. Nothing remains to deter us from accepting the doctrine of the common origin of languages. Equally in the presence of intermediate forms, in the original significance of terminations, and in the psychological impossibility of the existence of an Aryan language in a primitive state of soci ety, we see cogent reasons for believing in such a common origin, while this belief is strengthened when we reflect that on any other supposition it would be impossible to account for the origin of the more complex varieties of speech. To an ancient Greek it might have been easy to believe that lan guage sprang full grown, equipped and armed, from the mind of man, like Pallas from the brain of Zeus ; but to those familiar with modern ideas of development, any such notion is utterly inconceivable. From the conclusion that all languages have had a common origin, the inference need not be drawn that there was ever a time when the thoughts of men were exchanged through the medium of a single vocabulary. Not the original unity, but the original homogeneity of language, is here maintained. If, in an analysis of language, there be one conclusion more deeply than any other impressed upon us, it is the conclusion that for all primitive languages there can be but one kind of grammatical structure, ? that structure of which the An namitic and the ancient Chinese afford the best examples. That all the elements of speech, whether predicative roots or roots demonstrative, had once their several independent mean ings, is a fact which cannot be gainsaid without rejecting nearly all that inductive philology has hitherto accomplished. But a language in which predicative and demonstrative roots have each their separate meanings is a language in which there is little or no integration ; ? witness the Chinese. It is a language in which there is little or no differentiation of parts * Miiller, p. 337.</page><page sequence="38">448 THE EVOLUTION OF LANGUAGE. [Oct. of speech; ? witness also the Chinese. It is a language in which existing words may readily die out and new words may readily come into use, because no permanent integration has as yet linked large classes of words indissolubly together;? witness the Annamitic, and those lower Turanian dialects, like the Tahitian and Rarotongan, whose integration is only in cipient. It is, in short, a language that is both indefinite and homogeneous. But while the primitive homogeneity of lan guage precludes us from accepting any doctrine of poly genesis, its primitive indefiniteness is at the same time inconsistent with the theory of a unity of origin as commonly understood. To suppose that there was ever a single definite language, from the modifications of which all others have since sprung, is much like supposing the solar system to have arisen from the modifications of some primitive heavenly body. Meta phorically speaking, we may suppose language to have had a sort of nebular origin. Reasoning as we must, in the absence of inductively ascertained data, we can only take the lowest form of language known to us, and infer therefrom, as the original speech, a form still more homogeneous and indefinite than that. Such a kind of speech might less properly be termed a language, than a mass of ill-defined though articulate sounds, onomatopoetic to a certain extent, and to a certain extent interjectional, but to a still greater extent the acci dental accompaniments of vague endeavors to communicate thought by gesticulation. Though the existence of any such embryonic language is purely hypothetical, it is nevertheless countenanced by whatever scanty evidence can be gleaned from the study of the lowest forms of speech which are known to us. Alike in the negro describing his adventures and in a gang of quarrelsome Chinamen may be seen that proneness to gesticu late which characterizes the lower races ; and in proportion as the speech is inadequate, is gesticulation prevalent. Nor is there any reason to doubt that the casual occurrence of a semi-articulate sound simultaneously with the gesture called forth by the sight of an external object, would give rise to a mental association between object, gesture, and sound. Thou sands of synonymous sounds might thus become successively associated with the same object; and the nascent language</page><page sequence="39">1863.] THE EVOLUTION OF LANGUAGE. 449 thus formed would bear the same relation to the Chinese that the Turanian dialects bear to the Sanskrit. As soon as, by a process of " natural selection," certain of the roots thus mis cellaneously arising had become permanently associated with certain external objects, this nascent speech would have passed into the radical stage, and language would have arisen. But what is it that occasions a " natural selection " among roots ? Why is it that some roots are eliminated, while others are bound up with their corresponding ideas ? And why did not language remain an incoherent, homogeneous mass of in definite sounds ? In answering these questions, we shall be greatly assisted by a glance at the early formation of society. On remembering that society first became possible through the organization of the family,* we shall be inclined to suspect that it was also the organization of the family which rendered possible the evolution of language. As long as men were not integrated into families, the spontaneous use of a new sound would be as easy as the recollection of an old one; and in such a state of things there could be none other than a merely nascent language. But consequent upon the earliest forma tion of families would be the persistence in consciousness of certain sounds used by the members of the family in common. The persistence of these sounds in consciousness, checking the tendency to the continual formation of new sounds, would render possible that permanent association of the sign with the object, which is an essential condition of language. Passing from this hypothetical speculation, which may be taken for what it is worth, we find that a medium cohesion, among the elements of society is the condition most favora ble to lingual no less than to social progress. Among the no madic tribes inhabiting Africa, Eastern Asia, and America, the lack of social stability entails a corresponding lack of stability in language. In most Turanian tribes there is so little social cohesion that permanent lingual integration is impossible. Coincident with the greater social cohesion observable among * " Communities began to exist wherever a family held together instead of sep arating at the death of its patriarchal chieftain. In most of the Greek states and in Rome there long remained the vestiges of an ascending series of groups, out of which the state was at first constituted." ? Maine, Ancient Law, p. 128. 38*</page><page sequence="40">450 THE EVOLUTION OF LANGUAGE. [Oct. Magyars, Turks, and Finns, we find in the language a greater stability, and an approximation to the Aryan type. But in China, where the social fixity is so great that there has been little progress for thousands of years, there is a corresponding retardation of lingual development. In highly civilized na tions, where the presence of conservatism implies a certain amount of fixity, dialectic regeneration goes on most rapidly in the provinces, where the fixity is least ; and in the Chinese, such integration as there is takes place, not in the language of the Mandarins, but in the vulgar dialects. In interpreting the phenomena of language in accordance with the law of evolution, a large class of unexplained facts is ranged along with other facts that have been explained. But, though our complex symbols of thought are thus made more simple, they are symbols none the less. Had we the seventy senses of the inhabitant' of Saturn in Yoltaire's inim itable satire, our knowledge gained thereby would be no less purely relative than it now is. " Never, in our highest gen eralizations, can we rise above the finite; our knowledge, whether of mind or matter, can be nothing more than^ the knowledge of the relative manifestations of an Existence, which in itself it is our highest wisdom to recognize as beyond the reach of philosophy, ? in the language of St. Austin, Cogno scendo ignorari, et ignorando cognosci." Knowing as we do the absolute only in its phenomenal man ifestations, we cannot fail to derive much speculative advan tage from the continual detection in those manifestations of new uniformities. Whenever apparently disconnected phe nomena are brought into the formula of a common law, their community of causation is likewise disclosed. Each unclassed group of phenomena, for all our limited knowledge could tell us, might be the manifestation of some order-hating Ahriman. But when generalization has gone on till the most remote phenomena are seen to be allied, when in all parts of the uni verse the order of evolution is ascertained to be the same, then absolute community of causation will have been estab lished, Ahriman will be vanquished by Ormuzd, and science and religion will be in complete accord.</page></plain_text>
