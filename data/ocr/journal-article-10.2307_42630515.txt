L'origine de cette iconographie reste incontestablement byzantine, mais les enlumineurs et les sculpteurs d'ivoire carolingiens ont enrichi l'archétype pendant de nombreuses décennies. La plupart de ces transformations provenaient du désir de développer un symbolisme triomphal, inhérent à ce type de modèle. Le motif du ser- pent lové au pied de la croix semble l'une des additions les plus importantes et apparaît pour la première fois dans le Sacramentoire de Drogon. Le serpent, symbole de Satan, signifie doublement il sert de référence typologique à la chute d'Adam et représente le Christ triomphant du Malin. Quoique l'on puisse déduire le sens du motif des écrits bibliques et patristiques, l'explication la plus plausible provient de la liturgie carolingienne de la période. La personnification de la Syna- gogue semble être l'un des éléments les plus variables de ces crucifix- ions. Elle est représentée par un grand nombre de poses, de gestes et d'attributs différents - et apparaît même, en ce qui concerne le Sacramentoire de Drogon, sous forme masculine - . Dans certains cas, on pourrait croire que la diversité formelle de ce motif laissent entrevoir une attitude plus bienveillante à l'égard du Judaïsme que ne le reflétait le modèle byzantin lui-même. In motifs, image ninth-century emerges including that Carolingian female features personifications a number art a type of highly of of Crucifixion the symbolic Church image emerges that features a number of highly symbolic motifs, including female personifications of the Church and Synagogue, a serpent coiled around the base of the cross, personifications of the sun, moon, earth and ocean, and figures of the awakened dead. The earliest extant example of this iconography is found in the Drogo Sacramentary (Fig. 1), which was produced at Metz ca. 850 for Arch- bishop Drogo (823-55), an illegitimate son of Charle- magne.1 Other versions of this imagery appear on a number of Carolingian ivory carvings, such as a bookcover in Paris (Fig. 2), from the later Metz group, dated ca. 870;2 and the cover of the Pericopes of Henry II in Munich (Fig. 3), made at the Court School of Charles the Bald, also ca. 870. 3 A large number of studies have appeared, beginning in the middle of the nineteenth century, that have attempted to discover the origin and meaning of this complex imagery.4 None of these efforts, however, has considered these Cru- cifixion scenes as products of various stages in an evolu- tionary process. Such an approach is critical to a full comprehension of the iconography. In this article the pic- torial and textual sources of the individual elements of the composition will be analysed and the various stages in its development will be identified. Through this method is gained not only a more complete understanding of the over- all meaning of these images, but also an insight into the working methods of Carolingian artists. Any discussion of the origin and development of this Crucifixion imagery must begin with its earliest known manifestation in the Drogo Sacramentary. As seen in Fig- ure 1 , the central figure of Christ on the cross is flanked by figure I. Drogo Sacramentary, Crucifixion. Paris, Bibl. Nat., MS lat 9428, fol. 43v (photo: Bibl.

Between Christ and John the Evan- gelist, to the right of the cross, is seated the figure of an old man who holds a large round object in his left hand and gestures toward Christ with his right hand. A large serpent is coiled around the base of the cross, and on either side of the cross is a sarcophagus, from which a tiny figure emerges, raising its arms toward Christ. In the sky above Christs head is a wreath flanked by the half-figure of a hovering angel on either side. The angels are in turn flanked by personi- fications of the sun (on the left, above the Virgin) and the moon (on the right, above John). The other Carolingian examples of this iconography postdate the Drogo Sacramentary by at least twenty years, but almost all of the details of the Drogo Sacramentary Cru- cifixion scene can be found in the later Carolingian works, with a few additions and omissions. Added motifs include figures of Stephaton and Longinus, personifications of the earth and ocean, and representations of the Three Women at the Tomb. Moreover, in a number of the later works, fe- male personifications of Synagogue or Jerusalem are depicted to the right of the cross, replacing the figure of the old man, who is unique to the Drogo Sacramentary. These female personifications are represented in a variety of poses. On the Nicasius diptych in Tournai (Fig. 4), for example, a female figure, identified as a personification of Jerusalem by inscrip- tion - HIERUSALE(M) - stands facing the cross and looks up and gestures toward Christ.5 On the Metz ivory bookcover in Paris (Fig. 2), a female personification of Syna- gogue holds a banner, stands with her back to the cross, but turns her head to look up and over her shoulder at Christ.6 On an ivory plaque in Florence (Fig. 5), a female figure of Synagogue walks away from the cross at the far right of the scene.7 She does not look back at Christ. On the bookcover from the Court School of Charles the Bald in Munich (Fig. 3), to the far right of the cross a standing personifica- tion of Ecclesia confronts a seated personification of Syna- gogue who wears a crown and holds an orb.8 Ecclesia lays one hand on Synagogues orb, as if to claim it for herself. Was the illustration in the Drogo Sacramentary the source for the later Carolingian Crucifixion scenes? Or was the Drogo Sacramentary illustration itself based on an ear- lier pictorial model? A possible source for this imagery is revealed by an examination of Byzantine Crucifixion scenes. An early tenth-century Byzantine enamel quatrefoil in Tbilisi depicts a scene of the Crucifixion with features closely related to the Carolingian versions: two angels hov- ering in the sky above the cross, the Virgin at the far left of the scene, Ecclesia holding up a chalice to the left of the cross, John the Evangelist to the right of the cross, and Syna- gogue at the far right, walking away from the cross.9 The Figure 2. Ivory plaque, Crucifixion. Paris, Bibl. Nat., MS lat. 9453 (photo: Bibl. Nat.) only feature of the scene on the Tbilisi enamel that is not found in the Carolingian examples is a skull of Adam at the base of the cross. The similarity between the scenes of the Crucifixion on the Tbilisi enamel and the related Carolingian works suggests a common archetype. Since the Carolingian ex- amples predate the Tbilisi enamel, a few scholars have sug- gested that this imagery developed in the West during the Carolingian period and influenced middle Byzantine Cru- cifixion scenes.10 Most scholars, however, believe that the iconography of Ecclesia and Synagogue beside the cross is Byzantine in origin, since this imagery is fairly widespread in Byzantine art, not confined to a few monuments.11 A variation of the iconography seen on the Tbilisi enamel can be seen in another Byzantine monument, an eleventh-century Gospel book in Paris (Fig. 6), where personifications of Ecclesia and Synagogue hover in mid- air on either side of the cross, being propelled by angels.12 In this illustration Ecclesia is without a chalice,13 but many middle and late Byzantine Crucifixion images conflate the iconography seen on the Tbilisi enamel - Ecclesia with a chalice - with that depicted in the Byzantine Gospel book - 4</page><page sequence="3">Leesti / Carolingian Crucifixion Iconography Figure 3. Ivory plaque. Crucifixion. Munich, Bayerische Staatsbibl., Clm. 4452 (photo: Staatsbibl.) Ecclesia and Synagogue propelled by angels.14 The scene on the Tbilisi enamel is the earliest of these Byzantine ex- amples, and it is also the closest to the Carolingian ver- sions, since Ecclesia and Synagogue are both standing at ground level and the propelling angels do not appear. The Byzantine origin of this iconography cannot be conclusively established without finding either a Byzantine image that predates the Drogo Sacramentary or a Byzantine textual source.15 However, the earlier evolution of this im- agery in the East can be partially substantiated by other visual evidence. If one compares early Western and early Eastern depictions of Ecclesia, such as the personifications of Ecclesia in a fifth-century mosaic at Santa Sabina in Rome (Fig. 7), 16 and a personification of Ecclesia in a sixth/seventh-century fresco in the Monastery of Apollo at Bawit,17 it can be seen that the Western figures' attributes are codices, while the Eastern figures attribute is a chalice. Since the Eastern per- sonification is more closely related to the subsequent iconog- raphy of Ecclesia catching the blood of Christ in a chalice, it seems most likely that this imagery developed in the East. At the very latest, this iconography must have emerged by the middle of the ninth century, since by ca. 850 it had become known in the Latin West and was copied in the illustration in the Drogo Sacramentary. However, an even earlier date for the development of this Byzantine iconog- raphy can be hypothesized on the basis of a scene of the Crucifixion in the Carolingian Utrecht Psalter (Fig. 8), dated ca. 820. 18 In this image a figure of the psalmist stands to the left of the cross and holds up a chalice to catch the blood and water from Christs side, in illustration of Psalm 115 (1 16): 13: "I will take the chalice of salvation: and I will call upon the name of the Lord" (Douai version). The similarity of this figure to the later Carolingian depictions of Ecclesia beside the cross suggests that the scene in the Utrecht Psalter derives from the same pictorial tradition.19 Therefore, the iconography of Ecclesia at the Crucifixion can probably be dated at least as early as ca. 820. The influence of Byzantine Crucifixion iconography in the Latin West during the Carolingian period would cer- tainly not be the first instance of Eastern influence on West- ern Crucifixion images. In the earliest Western scenes of the Crucifixion, for example, such as an early fifth-century ivory plaque in the British Museum, Christ is dressed in a very short loincloth, much briefer than the knee-length loin- cloth seen in the Carolingian works.20 This costume is quite distinct from the ankle-length, sleeveless tunic ( colobium ) depicted in early Byzantine art, as seen in the Rabbuia Gos- pels of 586 (Florence, Bibl. Laur., MS Plutarch I, 56, fol. 13r).21 By the eighth century, however, the Byzantine colobium is frequently represented in Western Crucifixion images, such as in a fresco dated 741-52 in the Theodotus Chapel of Santa Maria Antiqua in Rome.22 The knee-length loincloth worn by Christ in the Carolingian works is also Byzantine in origin. The earliest extant depiction of this costume is on a seventh/eighth-cen- tury icon at Mount Sinai, and eventually the perizoma sup- plants the colobium as the standard garment for Christ in Eastern Crucifixion scenes.23 The long, Byzantine type of loincloth is first seen in Western art in the eighth century, in such works as the Merovingian Gellone Sacramentary (Paris, Bibl. Nat., MS lat. 12048, fol. I43v), dated ca. 780.24 Other details of Carolingian Crucifixion imagery also re- flect Byzantine iconography. The motifs of the hovering angels and the suppedaneum , for example, first appeared in Byzantine art in the seventh/eighth century, and are depicted on the aforementioned icon. The hovering angels were in- corporated into Western Crucifixion imagery prior to the Carolingian period, as is witnessed by the Gellone Sacramentary illustration. The suppedaneum may not have been adopted in the West until the ninth century; the Drogo 5</page><page sequence="4">RACAR/XX, 1-2/ 1993 Sacramentary is one of the earliest known Western mani- festations of this motif.25 Another feature of Byzantine Crucifixion iconography that was incorporated into Western versions is the sagging, contrapposto pose of Christ, as seen on the Tbilisi enamel, where Christs hips are swung out to his right. His drooping body is suggestive of the fact that he is dead on the cross,26 and his twisted form would seem to be a logical develop- ment of the affixing of his feet to a suppedaneum. This pose is not represented in a fully developed manner in Byzantine art until the tenth century,27 but a mid-ninth-century Byz- antine icon at Mount Sinai shows Christs left leg slightly overlapping the right, thus representing an early phase of this twisted pose.28 On some Carolingian ivory carvings (Fig. 2) Christs left leg also seems to be slightly more prominent, reflecting his pose on the icon. In other Carolingian works, however, such as the Stuttgart Psalter (Stuttgart, Württem- bergische Landesbibl., MS Biblia fol. 23, fol. 27r), dated ca. 830, Christs right leg overlaps the left.29 In the Drogo Sacramentary Christ s right leg is also more prominent, and his hips are swung out to his left, the reverse of the pose seen in Byzantine art. Nevertheless, the essential similarity of this pose to Eastern versions suggests that the contrapposto pose of Christ on the cross must have emerged in Byzantine art by the middle of the ninth century, and was copied in re- verse by the artist of the Drogo Sacramentary. It should now be possible to suggest a probable recon- struction of the Byzantine model or models, depicting Ecclesia and Synagogue flanking the cross, that was consulted by the Carolingian artists. The Carolingian work that is most closely related to the Tbilisi enamel - the earliest extant Byz- antine example of this iconography - is the ivory plaque in Florence (Fig. 5). In both images Ecclesia and Synagogue are depicted without banners, with Synagogue at the far right of the scene, walking away from the cross. Thus the Flor- ence plaque is probably the most faithful reflection of the Byzantine model. Other details of the Carolingian Crucifix- ion scenes may also have been present in the Byzantine model. The figures of Stephaton and Longinus, for exam- ple, are commonly depicted in Byzantine Crucifixion scenes. In addition, the figures of the awakened dead could also derive from a Byzantine model. Stephaton, Longinus and figures of the awakened dead are depicted in the scene in the Byzantine Gospel book in Paris (Fig. 6). The awakened dead are not frequently seen in Byzantine art, however,30 and might instead represent Carolingian additions to the Byzan- tine model: figures of the awakened dead are depicted be- neath the cross in a scene of the Crucifixion in the Utrecht Psalter (fol. 90r).31 Such an image could have inspired the inclusion of this motif in the later Carolingian works. Figure 4. Ivory plaque, Crucifixion. Tournai, Cathedral Treasury (photo: A.C.L Brussels) A number of additions were made to this Byzantine model by Carolingian artists. These include the serpent at the base of the cross, the wreath above Christs head, the banners held by Ecclesia and Synagogue, and the personi- fications of the earth and ocean. The personifications of the sun and moon probably also represent Carolingian additions. These figures are seen in some early Byzantine Crucifixion images, such as a sixth-century lead ampulla in Monza,32 but were rarely depicted in Byzantine art after the sixth century. (Instead, non-anthropomorphic symbols were used.) Con- sequently, while these figures probably derive ultimately from Byzantine art, they were not likely to have been included in the same model that depicted Ecclesia and Synagogue. Personifications of the sun and moon had already become associated with Western scenes of the Crucifixion by the early Carolingian period, as seen, for example, on the Harrach ivory diptych from the Court School of Charlemagne.33 The wreath above Christ s head appears for the first time in a Crucifixion scene in the Utrecht Psalter (Fig. 8). The serpent at the base of the cross and Ecclesias banner appear for the first time in the Drogo Sacramentary (Fig. 1). Later Carolingian ivory carvers added personifications of the earth and ocean, and scenes of the Women at the Tomb. In addi- tion, Carolingian artists, with the exception of the carver of the Florence plaque, frequently altered the Byzantine type of Synagogue. On the Paris plaque (Fig. 2), for example, she was moved closer to the cross and provided with a ban- ner identical to that of Ecclesia, while on the Munich plaque (Fig. 3) she was engaged in a confrontation with Ecclesia. In the Drogo Sacramentary she was dropped altogether and replaced with the figure of an old man. In summary, the Carolingian Crucifixion scenes that depict Ecclesia and Synagogue beside the cross derive ulti- 6</page><page sequence="5">Leesti / Carolingian Crucifixion Iconography Figure S. Ivory plaque, Crucifixion. Florence, Museo Nazionale (photo: Gab. Fotografico, Soprintendenza beni artistici e storici, Florence) mately from a Byzantine archetype, but numerous Carolin- gian additions were introduced in a process of elaboration that spanned several decades. Now that the various stages in the evolution of this imagery have been identified, the meaning of these different phases can be discussed. The core of this iconography features figures of Ecclesia and Synagogue flanking the cross. The connection between the personification of Ecclesia and the Crucifixion is founded in the New Testament: "...Christ also loved the Church and delivered himself up for it" (Ephesians 5:25). This connec- tion was made more emphatic in both Eastern and Western patristic literature: "As a wife was made for Adam from his side while he slept, the Church becomes the property of her dying Saviour, by the sacrament of the blood which flowed from his side after his death" (St. Augustine).34 The "sacra- ment of the blood" is symbolized by the Eucharistie wine, which is dispensed in Ecclesias chalice.35 Another relevant text is found in the writings of St. John Chrysostom: "For v there came forth water and blood.' Not without a purpose, or by chance, did those founts come forth, but because by means of these two together the Church consisteth.... When thou approachest to that awful cup, thou mayest so ap- proach, as drinking from the very side."36 The figure of Synagogue is, of course, the Old Testa- ment counterpart of Ecclesia. The Byzantine type of Syna- gogue at the Crucifixion, with her back to Christ, walking away from the cross, is explained by patristic exegesis. St. Augustine, for example, in his commentary on Psalm 44 (45), interpreted the text of Matthew 25:31-41, which de- scribes Christ placing the blessed on his right hand and the damned on his left at the Last Judgement, as a reference to Ecclesia and Synagogue: "'The queen stands on your righť but she that stands on your left is no queen, for she is the one to whom is said, NGo forth ... from me into the eternal fire.' But to the one on the right is said, 'Come hither, you blessed of my father and inherit the kingdom that has been prepared for you since the beginning of the world.'"37 Similar concepts were expressed by the Eastern fathers, such as St. John Chrysostom, who saw Synagogue as rejecting Christ while Ecclesia was faithful to him: "But that spouse [Syna- gogue] was ungrateful towards him who had been an hus- band to her, whereas, the Church ... continued to embrace the Bridegroom [Christ]."38 The symbolic representation of the Crucifixion deriv- ing from these texts stresses the role of Christ as the source of the Church and the Eucharist. It also symbolizes the tri- umph of Ecclesia and the New Covenant over Synagogue and the Old Covenant. This imagery was adopted by Carolingian artists who embellished it with additional sym- bolic motifs. The first stage in the Carolingian reworking of the Byzantine archetype is seen in the Utrecht Psalter. In the Crucifixion scene on fol. 67r of this manuscript (Fig. 8), a figure of Ecclesia beside the cross was transformed into a male figure of the psalmist, in order to illustrate literally the words of the associated Psalm: "I will take the chalice of salvation." In addition, a wreath was placed above the head of Christ. The wreath refers to Christs triumphant martyr- dom and kingship and augments the theme of triumph al- ready implicit in the Byzantine core. The inspiration for the addition of this motif was probably biblical, explained by such passages as Hebrews 2:9: "But we see Jesus, who was made a little lower than the angels, for the suffering of death, crowned with glory and honour: that, through the grace of God he might taste death for all."39 The second stage in the Carolingian evolution was the most important and is seen in the Drogo Sacramentary (Fig. 1). The artist of this manuscript took the Byzantine imagery of Ecclesia and Synagogue beside the cross and ex- changed the Byzantine type of Synagogue for an old man. He also added some motifs already seen in earlier Carolin- gian art, such as the personifications of the sun and moon, the wreath above Christs head, and figures of the awakened dead. Finally, to this already complex iconography he added two more, completely new symbolic motifs: the serpent at the base of the cross, and Ecclesias banner. 7</page><page sequence="6">RACAR/XX, 1-2/ 1993 Each of these added motifs carries a strong triumphal symbolism. The personifications of the sun and moon, for example, while they suggest the eclipse of the sun that oc- curred while Christ was on the cross (Matthew 27:45, Mark 15:33, Luke 23:44), also act as triumphal features. This ico- nography derives ultimately from late antique art: personi- fications of the sun and moon are utilized in a triumphal context on the Arch of Constantine.40 Combined with a Crucifixion scene, these personifications refer to Christs tri- umph over death and his rulership of the heavens. The serpent is a symbol of Satan, serving as a typologi- cal reference to the fall of Adam in the Garden of Eden and as a symbol of Christs victory over Satan.41 The place- ment of the serpent below Christs feet is explained by such biblical passages as Hebrews 2:8: "Thou hast subjected all things under his feet."42 Thus the text of Hebrews 2:8-9 links the wreath and serpent together as dual symbols of kingship and triumph.43 Another biblical passage also ties together the wreath and serpent: "For he must reign, until he hath put all his enemies under his feet. And the enemy, death, shall be destroyed last" (I Corinthians 15:25-26). Consequently, the wreath and serpent in the Drogo Sacramentary illustration are thematically united, and Christ is represented as the imperial conqueror of Satan. The mo- tif of the serpent at the base of the cross in this image may have been inspired by a scene of Christ lancing a coiled serpent similar to one in the Utrecht Psalter (Fig. 9),44 since in this illustration Christ is crowned with a wreath by an angel. Thus the wreath and serpent are symbolically linked in the Utrecht Psalter image as well.45 The concept of the defeat of the serpent by Christ on the cross, which is already implicit in the New Testament, was expanded in patristic literature. According to an early Christian legend, the wood of the cross came from the Tree of the Knowledge of Good and Evil in the Garden of Eden, where the serpent (Satan) had initiated the Fall of Man.46 This event was related to the Crucifixion by St. Irenaeus: "... so that as by means of a tree we were made debtors to God, [so also] by means of a tree we may obtain the remis- sion of our debt."47 This theme was amplified in the Carolingian period. In the Carolingian votive Mass De sancta cruce , for example, the praefatio reads: "On the wood of the cross, you delivered mankind, so that whence came death, there life would reappear. And [so that] he who con- quered on the wood, on the wood would also be con- quered."48 In the praefatio for Holy Saturday ( Sabbato sancto) on fol. 54v of the Drogo Sacramentary another ref- erence to the defeat of Satan is found: "Breaking the prison of the underworld, he raised the bright banners of his vic- tory, and triumphing over the devil, the victor rose from Figure 6. Crucifixion. Pans, Bibl. Nat, NS gr. 74, fol. 59r (photo: Bibl. Nat) the dead."49 This text refers to the conquest of Satan at the Anastasis, or the Harrowing of Hell, an event that was, however, related to the Crucifixion.50 The figures of the awakened dead, like the personi- fications of the sun and moon, have a symbolic as well as a narrative significance. Their meaning ultimately derives from Matthew 27:52, which states that at the moment of Christs death "...the graves were opened: and many bodies of the saints that had slept arose." They also serve as trium- phal symbols and are linked to the figure of the serpent, since in defeating Satan, Christ freed mankind from the sentence of death inflicted upon Adam and his descend- ants: "For by a man came death: and by a man the resur- rection of the dead. And as in Adam all die, so also in Christ all shall be made alive" (I Corinthians 15:21-22); "For he came down and died, and by that death delivered us from death: being slain by death, he slew death" (St. Augustine).51 The Carolingian Mass text already cited {De sancta cruce) also refers to the figures of the awakened dead: "On the wood of the cross, you delivered mankind." Thus the awak- ened dead represent all of mankind, who are offered salva- tion through Christs sacrifice. These figures also represent a typological reference to the Anastasis, when Christ broke down the gates of Hell and defeated Satan in order to save the captive souls of the dead, symbolized by Old Testament patriarchs and prophets.52 Ecclesias banner, known as a vexillum , is also a symbol of victory, and is partially explained by the text from the Holy Saturday Mass: "He raised the bright banners of his victory." The banner is also thematically associated with kingship: in 796 Pope Leo III gave to Charlemagne a triumphal banner that was described as a vexillum Romanae urbis .53 Charle- 8</page><page sequence="7">Leesti / Carolingian Crucifixion Iconography Figure 7. Mosaic, Personifications of Ecclesia. Rome, Santa Sabina (photo: I.C.C.D. Rome) magne was depicted receiving this banner from St. Peter in a mosaic in the Triclinium of Leo III in the Lateran Palace in Rome. The original mosaic, dated ca. 800, is no longer ex- tant, but a sixteenth-century drawing of the mosaic shows Charlemagne holding a banner that is very similar to the one held by Ecclesia in the Drogo Sacramentary illustration: a three-pointed banner attached to a lance (Fig. 10).54 Thus in the Drogo Sacramentary Ecclesias banner represents the triumph and rulership of Christ and the Church. The figure of the old man who is seated to the right of the cross in the Drogo Sacramentary scene has been vari- ously identified by scholars, but the most likely interpreta- tion is that he is a male equivalent of the female personi- fication of Synagogue, since he occupies the place held by Synagogue in Byzantine art.55 The use of a male figure might have been inspired by a poem by Venantius Fortunatus: "Why, Jewish multitude, do you still act un- wisely at your age? Learn as an old man to believe, so that you may gain life. Comprehend, white-haired old man! Although robbed of your youth, let great honor attend your old age...."56 His attribute, a large round object, painted light blue, is probably intended to be an orb, symbolic of the power of the Old Covenant.57 Although the old man is probably meant to represent Synagogue, he has a very dif- ferent meaning from the female personifications of Syna- gogue in Byzantine art. He does not walk away from the cross, but is seated at its foot. He looks up at Christ and makes a gesture of acclamation toward him, as if acknowl- edging the end of the Old Law. The benevolent attitude toward Judaism implicit in the figure of the old man in the Drogo Sacramentary antici- pates by several centuries the iconography of the unveiling of Synagogue, a theme depicted in numerous twelfth-cen- tury works.58 This portrayal might have a textual source in a fifth-century polemical tract entitled De altercatione Ecclesiae et Synagogae , in which female personifications of Ecclesia and Synagogue engage in a disputation over which of them is entitled to rule the world, culminating in Syna- gogue s acknowledgement of the superiority of Ecclesias argument.59 This tract, falsely attributed to St. Augustine in the Carolingian period, was incorporated into the lit- urgy of Holy Week in several Carolingian centres. The posi- tive view of Synagogue in the Drogo Sacramentary might also represent a personal preference of the patron of the 9</page><page sequence="8">RACAR/XX, 1-2/ 1993 Figure 8. Utrecht Psalter, Crucifixion. Utrecht, Universi tei tsb ibi., MS 32/484, fol. 67r (photo: Universiteitsbibl.) Figure 9. Utrecht Psalter, Christ lancing a serpent, fol. 53v (photo: Universiteitsbibl.) manuscript, Archbishop Drogo, who served as archchaplain of the Empire under his half-brother Louis the Pious (814- 40). 60 During Louiss reign the Jews of the Carolingian realm were protected through numerous legal measures, and were even appointed to key government positions.61 It might be assumed that Drogo, as Louis's archchaplain, con- curred with his half-brothers views on Judaism, and might have desired that this attitude be expressed pictorially in a manuscript intended for his personal use.62 The next generation of Carolingian artists incorporated many of the innovations introduced by the artist of the Drogo Sacramentary, but reverted to the original Byzan- tine iconography of a female personification of Synagogue. Nevertheless, certain aspects of the portrayal of Synagogue in the Drogo Sacramentary are reflected in the later Carolingian works. On the ivory plaque in Munich (Fig. 3), for example, Synagogue is seated and holds an orb, like the old man in the manuscript. On the ivory plaque in Tournai (Fig. 4) she faces the cross and looks up and gestures to- ward Christ, also reminiscent of the figure in the Drogo Sacramentary. Moreover, the negative attitude toward Syna- gogue, characteristic of Byzantine art, was not universally adopted by later Carolingian artists. A positive view of Syna- gogue is clearly depicted on the Tournai plaque, where her gesture seems to acknowledge Christ.63 And on the ivory plaque in Paris (Fig. 2), although Synagogue turns her back to the cross, she seems to be hesitant to depart from the scene, as is indicated by her backward glance. The most radical departure from the Byzantine iconog- raphy of Ecclesia and Synagogue beside the cross is seen on the Munich plaque, where a seated figure of Synagogue holds an orb of rulership that is claimed by a standing fig- ure of Ecclesia. This imagery symbolizes the transfer of power from the Old Covenant of Synagogue to the New Covenant of Ecclesia, and was probably inspired by the text of the Altercatio. The later Carolingian Crucifixion ivories also introduce two more motifs that expand the triumphal imagery in the Byzantine model and its earlier Carolingian variants: personifications of the earth and ocean, and scenes of the Women at the Tomb. The personifications of the earth and ocean derive ul- timately from late antique triumphal iconography, and are depicted in this context on the Arch of Galerius.64 In early Carolingian art they are seen in the Utrecht Psalter, although not in conjunction with the Crucifixion.65 On the later Carolingian Crucifixion ivories the personifications of the earth and ocean serve as earthly equivalents of the personifications of the sun and moon, and expand the sym- bolic realm of Christs rulership beyond the heavenly sphere to the earthly zone.66 Scenes of the Women at the Tomb had been associated with Crucifixion scenes at an early date, as seen in the Rabbuia Gospels.67 These two scenes were also combined in earlier Carolingian examples, such as the Harrach diptych.68 In the later Carolingian ivory carvings of the Crucifixion, the images of the Women at the Tomb repre- sent not just the continuation of the narrative beyond the Crucifixion, but the promise of life after death that was implicit in the Resurrection of Christ.69 In conclusion, the core of the iconography of the Carolingian Crucifixion scenes with Ecclesia and Synagogue 10</page><page sequence="9">Leesti / Carolingian Crucifixion Iconography FigurelO. St. Peter presenting vexillum to Charlemagne. Rome, Bibl.Vat., MS lat. S407, fol. I86r (photo: BibLVat.) flanking the cross is Byzantine. However, Carolingian art- ists, beginning with the artist of the Utrecht Psalter, made a considerable number of changes and additions to the Byz- antine model. The majority of these changes resulted from a desire to augment the triumphal symbolism of the Byz- antine archetype. The culmination of this process of accre- tion is represented by the Munich plaque (Fig. 3), which stresses the cosmic kingship of Christ, symbolized by the personifications of the sun, moon, earth and ocean; his tri- umph over death, reflected in the motifs of the serpent and the Women at the Tomb; and the triumph of the Church, indicated by Ecclesias banner and her acquisition of Syna- gogues orb. In addition, the image incorporates the con- cept of Old Testament prophecy and New Testament fulfillment. The figure of Synagogue represents the Old Law, which yields to the New Law of Ecclesia; and the serpent, which represents the Old Testament Fall of Man, contrasts with the New Testament sacrifice of Christ on the cross and his redemption of mankind, symbolized by the figures of the awakened dead. Thus the Carolingian versions of this iconography comprise a far more all-encompassing theo- logical commentary than their Byzantine model. These works also reveal the vitality and independence of Caro- lingian artists, who freely modified Byzantine and earlier Carolingian imagery in a continuous process of creation and variation. * I would like to thank Robert Deshman for reading this manu- script and offering numerous helpful suggestions. 1 Wilhelm Köhler and Florentine Mütherich, Drogo-S akr amentar, Codices selecti, XLIX (Graz, 1974), Kommentar , 23; facsimile, fol. 43v; Wilhelm Köhler, Die karolingischen Miniaturen , III, part 2: Metzer Handschriften (Berlin, 1960), 151, 159, plate 83c; Franz Unterkircher, Zur Ikonographie und Liturgie des Drogo-Sakra- mentars (Graz, 19 77), 17-19; Sonia Simon, "Studies on the Drogo Sacramentary: Eschatology and the Priest-King," Ph.D. diss.

For the Drogo Sacramentary in general, see also Robert Calkins, "Liturgical Sequence and Decorative Crescendo in the Drogo Sacramentary," Gesta , XXV (1986), 17-23. There have been attempts to date the manuscript to a period prior to 835 because of the fact that it did not origi- nally contain the Mass for All Saints (which was added to folio 1 by a later hand). Since the Mass for All Saints was instituted in the Carolingian realm in 835, it has been suggested that the manuscript must date from before this time. However, the Drogo Sacramentary is not a complete sacramentary text, and does not contain many of the Masses found in a standard Frankish sacramentary. For further discussion of the date of the manu- script, see Leesti, "Drogo," 4-6, and below, n. 62. 2 Adolph Goldschmidt, Die Elfenbeinskulpturen , I: Aus der Zeit der karolingischen und sächischen Kaisen Vili. -XI.

Peter Lasko {Ars Sacra : 800-1200 [Harmondsworth, 1972], 35ff.) dates this plaque ca. 820-30 because of its stylistic resemblance to the ivory covers of the Psalter and the Prayerbook of Charles the Bald, which are copied from the Utrecht Psalter. Following Lasko's dating, Christian Beutler (Der Gott am Kreuz: Zur Entstehung der Kreuzigungsdarstellung [Hamburg, 1986], 6) sees the Munich plaque as the prototype for the Carolingian Cruci- fixion images discussed here. However, the Munich ivory is more closely related in style to the Cathedra Petri , made for Charles the Bald ca. 870, than it is to the Utrecht Psalter. Consequently, the traditional date for the Munich plaque remains the most likely probability. For the Cathedra Petri , see Cattedra lignea di S. Pietro , Lawrence Nees, A Tainted Mantle: Hercules and the Classical Tradition at the Carolingian Court (Philadelphia, 1991). 4 The literature on this topic is vast, and is summarized in Leesti, "Drogo," 116-43.

XXV (Rome, 1940), 41, 100- 103. Pre-Carolingian Western origins have also been suggested. For example, Christian Beutler ( Gott am Kreuz) suggests that this iconography was developed at Milan between 384 and 394 and revived in the ninth century. His argument is based largely on certain iconographie parallels between the Munich Crucifix- ion ivory and a late antique silver plate from Parabiago. While it is true that both works feature personifications of the sun, moon, earth and ocean, the central register of the plate depicts the pagan goddess Cybele, not the Crucifixion. Beutler's attempt, on the basis of textual sources, to reconstruct a late fourth-cen- tury work that depicted a scene of the Crucifixion in place of the pagan goddess is not convincing. In addition, according to Hans Achelis {Die Katakomben von Neapel [Leipzig, 1936], 71- 72, plate 46) Ecclesia is depicted beside the cross in a badly dam- aged fifth/sixth-century fresco in the catacomb of San Gennaro in Naples. However, Achelis s theory has not received wide ac- ceptance; see, for example, Reil, Christus am Kreuz , 395; Johannes Reil, "Die Darstellung der Kreuzigung Christi in der Katakombe von Neapel," Zeitschrift fur Kirchengeschichte, ' LIV (1935), 52-61; Elisabeth Lucchesi Palli, "Kreuzigung Christi," Lexikon der christlichen Ikonographie , ed.

For a discussion of this figure in Byzantine art, see Sauerland, Psalter Egberts , 179-84, 213. 14 See, for example, the late eleventh/early twelfth-century fresco cycle at Kastoria (Ann W. Epstein, "Frescoes of the Mavriotissa Monastery near Kastoria: Evidence of Millenarianism and Anti- Semitism in the Wake of the First Crusade," Gesta , XXI [1982], 21-29, fig. 7); and the late twelfth-century fresco cycle at Ktima (Cyril Mango and Ernest J.W. Hawkins, "The Hermitage of St. Neophytos and its Wall Paintings," Dumbarton Oaks Papers , XX [1966], 119-206, fig. 32).

The iconography of Ecclesia and Synagogue propelled by angels is seen in a few Western exam- ples, such as an eleventh-century ivory plaque from S. Italy in Berlin (Herbert L. Kessler, "An Eleventh Century Ivory Plaque from South Italy and the Cassinese Revival," Jahrbuch der Ber- liner Museen, VIII [1966], 67-95, fig. 1); and a thirteenth-cen- tury Exultet roll in Troia (Myrtilla Avery, The Exultet Rolls of South Italy [Princeton, 1936], II, plate CLXXIX). 15 Orlandos, Patmos , 216, 362, believes that a Byzantine source is found in the Great Canon of Andrew of Crete. For a discussion of this text, see below, n. 38. 16 Joseph Wilpert, Die römischen Mosaiken und Malereien der kirchlichen Bauten vom IV. bis XIII. Jahrhundert (Freiburg, 1917), III, plate 47.

Berg identifies this figure as Joseph of Arimathea, based on the writings of the Carolingian liturgical commentator Amalarius of Metz. This explanation is very unlikely since the iconography seen in the Utrecht Psalter is unique while that of Ecclesia beside the cross is widespread, and probably predated the scene in the Utrecht Psalter. Another example of a Carolingian variation of the mo- tif of Ecclesia beside the cross is seen in a late ninth-century sacramentary (Tours, Bibl. Mun., MS 184, fol. 3r; Köhler, Miniaturen , I, part 1: Die Schule von Tours , Die Ornamentik [Berlin, 1933], 424-25, plate 124d) in which a tonsured monk in front of an altar raises up his hands to the cross. 20 Wolfgang F.

Orlandos, Patmos , 216, 362, believes that the source for the iconography of Ecclesia and Synagogue beside the cross derives from the Great Canon of St. Andrew of Crete (ca. 660-740): As a mixing-bowl Thy Church has received Thy Life- bearing Side, Whence springs to us the double fount Of forgiveness and of knowledge, O Saviour, in type of the Old and New Covenant, And of the two together. (Ode 4; Patrologiae Graeca , XCVII, 1352; translated in Derwas J. Chitty, The Great Canon: A Poem of Saint Andrew of Crete [London, 1 957] ,21.) This text may refer to the presence of Syna- gogue at the Crucifixion, but does not explain why she walks away from the cross in the Byzantine Crucifixion scenes. Con- sequently, Andrew of Crete cannot be the source for this ico- nography.

Additional interpretations for the serpent are advanced by Ferber, "Crucifixion," 324-25: as the brazen serpent of Moses (Numbers 21:9), and as a reference to an eighth-century Metz legend, in which St. Clement exor- cised a number of demons in the form of serpents. Elizabeth A. Kirby ("The Serpent at the Foot of the Cross, 850-1050," Riforma Religiosa e Arti nell'Epoca Carolingia, ed. Alfred A. Schmid [Bologna, 1979], 129-34) suggests that the serpent in these Crucifixion images is a liturgical reference, to the lighting of the New Fire during Holy Week. 42 Deshman, "Exalted Servant," 393. 43 Deshman, "Exalted Servant," 393; Reil, Christus am Kreuz, 87. 44 DeWald, Utrecht, 41-42, plate LXXXIV. 45 The imagery of Christ lancing the coiled serpent is probably derived ultimately from imperial iconography (Deshman, "Ex- alted Servant," 400-401; Reil, Christus am Kreuz, 90). Compare a Constantinian coin depicting a labarum piercing a serpent (Walter Lowrie, Art in the Early Church, rev. ed. [New York, 1969], 111, plate 55b); and unidentified emperors (or warri- ors) on horseback and on foot lancing serpents on Einhard s arch, a piece of goldsmith's work dated ca. 820-40, now destroyed (Hans Belting, "Der Einhardsbogen," Zeitschrift fur Kunst- geschichte, XXXVI [1973], 93-121, figs, la, lb; Kurt Weitzmann, "Der Aufbau und die unteren Felder des Einhard-Reliquiars," Das Einhardkreuz, ed. Karl Hauck [Göttingen, 1974], 33-49). The motif of the coiling serpent could also derive from depic- tions of the serpent coiled around the tree in the Garden of Eden. Compare an illustration on the Genesis frontispiece in the Grandval Bible (London, Brit.

Al- ternative theories include: the Old Testament prophet Hosea (Raddatz, "Entstehung," i-iv, 5; Unterkircher, Ikonographie , 18; Schiller, Iconography , II, 106, 110; Schiller, Ikonographie , IV, 45); the centurion who acknowledged Christ as the son of God at the Crucifixion (Reil, Christus am Kreuz , 104); the Pharisee Nicodemus, who helped Joseph of Arimathea bury Christ (Berg, "Iconographie," 326); and Drogo himself, in the guise of Melchisidek (Simon, "Priest-King," 43-44, 88-89). 56 Patrologiae Latina , LXXXVIII, 187-88; translated in Seiferth, Synagogue and Church , 29. The relationship of this text to the old man in the Drogo Sacramentary illustration was first noted by Cahier, "Cinq plaques," 56-57, n. 3. 57 Raddatz, "Entstehung," 5, 60; Schiller, Iconography , II, 106; Unterkircher, Ikonographie , 19; Reil, Christus am Kreuz , 103; Leesti, "Drogo," 136-40. Alternative theories include: a shield (Weber, Geistliches , 18, 39-40); and a paten (Berg, "Iconog- raphie," 326; Simon, "Priest-King," 43-44, 88-89). 58 See, for example, one of Abbot Suger's stained glass windows at Saint-Denis, dated ca. 1140; Marie-Louise Thérel, Le Triomphe de la Vierge-Église: sources historiques, littéraires et iconographiques (Paris, 1984), 217ff., fig. 100; Philippe Verdier, Le couronnement de la Vierge: les origines et les premiers développements d'un thème iconographique (Montreal, 1980), 32ff., plate 48b. 59 Patrologiae Latina , XLII, 1131 -40; English paraphrase in Seiferth, Synagogue and Churchy 36-38. For the authorship of the Altercatio, see Clavis Patrum Latinorum , ed. Eligius Dekkers (Bruges, 1961), 132, no. 577. For the possible derivation of the Altercano from a lost fifth-century Byzantine source, see Raddatz, "Entstehung," xli-xliii, n. 285; Schlauch, "Allegory," 456, n. 1. 60 For a biography of Drogo, see Christian Pfister, "L'archevêque de Metz, Drogon," Mélanges Paul Faber (Paris, 1902), 101-45. 61 For Carolingian Jewish policy, see Bernard S. Bachrach, Early Medieval Jewish Policy in Western Europe (Minneapolis, 19 77), 66ff.; Seiferth, Synagogue and Church , 52ff.; Raddatz, "Ent- stehung," 33-56. 62 Raddatz, "Entstehung," vii. Because of the benevolent attitude toward Judaism expressed by the Crucifixion scene in the Drogo Sacramentary, Raddatz dates the manuscript ca. 830, during Louis's lifetime. However, after Louis's death Drogo continued to serve as archchaplain under his nephew Lothair I (840-55), who does not seem to have negated his father's pro-Jewish poli- cies (see Bachrach, Jewish Policy , 120-22). Furthermore, the Drogo Sacramentary was a personal possession of Drogo, not a statement of official imperial policy. 63 Steenbock, "Nicasius-Diptychon," 1011. 64 Hans Peter Laubscher, Der Reliefichmuck des Galeriusbogens in Thessaloniki , Deutsches Archäologisches Institut, Archäologische Forschungen, I (Berlin, 1975), 71-73, plates 58, 59; Margaret S.P.
