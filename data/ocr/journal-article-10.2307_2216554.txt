<plain_text><page sequence="1">319 SOME REFLECTIONS ON THE ANALYSIS OF LANGUAGE Language is a perennial problem for the philosopher. If he has something new to say-and if he has not he is called a philosopher only by courtesy- he must say it in a language which, in a sense, is liable to imply its falsity. For he is involved in the attempt to make old words carry new meanings; to change the connotation of familiar terms and the implications of the state. ments which contain them. The originality of the pioneer consists in dis- covering and questioning the unconscious assumptions of current philosophy. He shakes himself free from habits of thought in which his contemporaries are bound. Yet he must use the same language as they, and lay himself open to inevitable misunderstanding. He is apt to find comprehension and support first among contemporary pioneers in other fields. To contemporary students of philosophy he is more likely to seem guilty of abusing language and defying logic. This penalty of genius is not confined, of course, to the philosopher. But in his case it involves a special problem of language. He must use words with as much precision as he can compass. He must depend upon logical implication to a great extent. Yet the implications of state- ments do not inhere in the language which expresses them, but rather depend upon the manner in which they are thought, on the attitudes of the mind which apprehends them, and on the unrecognised assumptions which underlie and support the thinking. For the original philosopher as for the original poet, though in different ways, the problem of discovering how to say what he means is unavoidable, and to some extent insuperable. The best he can hope for is that there will be those among his contemporaries who are, at least emotionally, prepared for understanding him. The present philosophical preoccupation with problems of language, however, is of a novel temper. It tends to combine a utopian faith in the techniques of philosophical analysis with a radical scepticism of their ability to perform the functions for which they were devised. It has perfected the formal logic of tradition, and made it an instrument of precision; and it uses the instrument to demonstrate the futility of attempting to answer, or even to formulate meaningfully, the traditional questions of philosophy. In this it reflects, no doubt, as philosophy has always done, the prevailing temper of its social environment, which in all fields of human effort has perfected its technology while losing faith in its ability to secure the ends which alone would provide its technology with an adequate justification. My purpose in this paper is not to enter into controversy with the pro- tagonists of contemporary logical analysis. I have no desire to question the brilliance or the importance of their contributions to logical theory. Whether these contributions, however, have any application outside the field of</page><page sequence="2">320 JOHN MACMURRAY formal logic is open to doubt. The reflections on the analysis of language which I have to offer have this doubt as their background; but in them- selves they are no more than gropings after a properly empirical theory. They are concerned in particular with the effect of transferring the locus of logical analysis from thought to language. In a proper empirical sense, language is only language in use. If we are to consider it for itself, as an object of analysis, and yet retain an empirical standpoint, we must consider it in relation to its use. This means that we must treat it not as a bare fact but as an artefact. As an artefact, language is no doubt peculiar in its plasticity (which lends it the character of a medium rather than an instrument), and in the intimacy of its connection with our thinking. But it shares with all artefacts an essential relativity to human purposes. No artefact can be defined without reference to the purpose it is designed to serve, since this is the basis of the classification of artefacts, and in many cases there is no other property which can so serve. Weapons, for example, include howitzers and knobkerries; and what have these in common but the purpose for which they are used ? This needs to be stressed. The tendency to exclude all teleological references is carried too far, and even becomes ridiculous, when we are dealing with deliberate human activ- ities and their products. Only metaphysical dogmatisms could exclude anthropomorphism from the human field. There can be no empirical objec- tion to treating human beings as if they behaved like human beings. We need, then, a definition of language which refers to the purpose for which it is designed. In this connection we must avoid the tendency to talk of the function of language. The term 'function ' is a biological meta- phor, which carries no implication of conscious purpose, nor indeed, in my opinion-though others might disagree-of purposiveness of any kind. Language does not function; it is used. Now the purpose for which lang- uage is designed is communication between persons. It can be defined sufficiently for present purposes as a system of articulated sounds designed for the purpose of communication. No doubt any medium structured for communication between persons might properly be called a language; but we may confine ourselves here to the commoner and more specific use of the term. Such a definition does not exclude written language, as might at first be supposed. Writing is derivative from speech. It is a pictorial representa- tion of spoken words, and not a different kind of language; not another medium of communication. It can be read aloud, and so translated back into the articulated sounds which it represents. To insist on this has some, if only a limited, importance. The analysis of language, whether grammatical or logical, has usually been carried out with an eye to the written word, as if writing were the normal form of language. The effect of this habit is to exaggerate the importance of grammatical and logical norms, and even to disguise their character. The purpose of writing is to extend the range of communication in space and time. But in the absence of the speaker two aids to effective communication are lost, the tones and inflections of the</page><page sequence="3">THE ANALYSIS OF LANGUAGE 321 living voice, and the reciprocity of conversation. It is no longer possible to indicate to the speaker that he has failed to make himself clear, or to ask for further elucidation of his meaning. As a result, written language must be more fully, more rigidly, and more exactly structured than speech to achieve the same communication. The structuring of language is not like the structure of a material system. It is not inherent in language per se. It is plastic, variable and relative to its purpose. To talk like a book is a fault in the use of speech, and too close an observance of the rules of grammar and syntax is pedantry. Even more obnoxious would be the attempt, if anyone were bold enough to make it, to put all one has to say into logical form. Beyond a certain point, a strict obedience in the living use of language to the grammarian's or the logician's norms would defeat its own purpose by making communication impossible. One can say of them what a great musician retorted when taken to task for breaking the laws of counterpoint: 'The rules, my good sir, are my most obedient servants '. It follows from our definition that whatever is not a medium of com- munication is improperly called a 'language '. The prevalent habit of referring to 'mathematical language' is therefore to be deprecated. An algebraic system, consisting of a set of symbols together with the rules for their manipulation, is, like language, an artefact. Like language, it is an artificial medium structured for use. But the purpose for which it is designed is not communication, but calculation. Since the rules for the use of any instrument are relative to the purpose it serves, it follows that there can be no proper analogy between the rules of mathematics and those of grammar and syntax. In mathematics, a failure to observe the rules defeats the object for which the instrument is used. The result is incorrect. But failure to observe the rules of grammar and syntax does not necessarily produce a failure in communication. Indeed, a judicious defiance of the rules may on occasion facilitate it. The objection will be raised at this point that the assimilation of language and mathematics concerns their logical structure only. To express our experience of the world in adequate symbols, to formulate meaningful assertions, to arrive at correct conclusions by inference, involves a structure which is not merely analogous in language and in mathematics, but identical. What used to be called the ' form of thought ' is the same in both cases, and the difference between calculating and communicating is irrelevant. In reply to this I must offer two submissions. First, the question at issue is whether the formulation of this structure, even supposing it is iden- tical in the two cases, is properly described as an analysis of language; and whether, if it is, it is an adequate analysis for logical purposes. Secondly, the manipulation of mathematical symbols in accordance with the rules- that is to say, the carrying out of mathematical operations-would seem to be, per se, not an example of thinking, but a substitute for it. Such operations can be carried out by machines, and however marvellously they may calculate, machines do not think. Surely we are justified in asserting that any operation which can be carried out by a machine is ipso facto not an instance of thinking.</page><page sequence="4">322 JOHN MACMURRAY This is not to say that mathematics does not involve thinking, and thinking of a very precise and formal kind. Thinking is necessary to under- stand the meaning of mathematical symbols and the principles governing their use; to formulate the expressions and equivalences required for the solution of particular problems; to determine at specific points in the course of a calculation, what the next step should be, and to interpret the result. Mathematical operations are carried on in an atmosphere of thought if they are carried out by a mind. But to the extent that the use of language is necessary to thinking, mathematical thinking is carried on in ordinary language and not in mathematical symbols. It is conceivable that a mathe- matician should make a contribution to his subject in a paper which employed no mathematical symbols at all. It is inconceivable that he should write a paper which consisted of nothing else. In general principle, those parts of a scientific paper which appear in mathematical notation, are records or indications of calculations made by the author, which are interpolated in what he has to say in order that they may be checked or used by the reader. They are analogous, in some sort, to diagrams or maps interpolated for reference in the letterpress of a book. This is no complete account, of course, but it is sufficient to throw doubt upon the propriety of talking about mathematical notations as 'language'. Language, then, is a medium of communication. Its structure is relative to the purpose of communication; and it is only in use that it is truly language. Consequently, an empirical analysis of language must start from the concrete situation in which alone language exists. We must begin with the fact of communication. At its simplest, this situation involves two persons who intend to communicate with one another by means of speech. This existential framework of language is represented grammatically by the first and second personal pronouns, I and You. These pronouns have a peculiar status. They denote the author and the recipient of a communica- tion respectively. They refer always to particular individuals, yet only in reference to a particular communication. In the case of question and answer, for instance, the 'I' relative to the question becomes the 'You ' relative to the answer. Thus the symbols ' I ' and ' You ' are both relative to com- munication and correlative to one another. These relativities suggest that persons are constituted by the relation of communication, and that it is as ' capacity to communicate' that the faculty of speech is the differentia of Man. The issue is not relevant here, however, though on quite other grounds I consider that it contains an important truth. It is enough for the present purpose to remark that there can be no statement which does not presuppose an ' I ' and a ' You ', and that there can be no ' I ' without a ' You ' and no ' You ' without an ' I '.1 Besides the first and second person, communication also presupposes the grammarian's third 'person '-that about which something is said; 'By the term ' statement' in this connection I mean ' anything said ', the content of any communication, whether it be an assertion, a question, a command or any other kind of ' saying '. I shall use the term in this sense throughout.</page><page sequence="5">THE ANALYSIS OF LANGUAGE 323 the object of reference for the statement. The third ' person ' appears much more frequently in sentences than the first or second, often as the gram- matical subject. Indeed, when 'I' or 'You' appear, it is most often as object of reference, when the speaker talks about himself or about his hearer. It was this grammatical fact that led to the attempt, in traditional formal logic, to express all propositions in the form 'S is P'. It is now generally recognised that this was a logical mistake. It involves a faulty logical analysis of comparative propositions, such as 'Edinburgh is due north of Blackpool', for example. But the empirical reason for this variation in types of statement has been overlooked, and with it, its logical significance. Under normal conditions there is no need to specify in a statement either the first or the second person; it is usually obvious who is the speaker and who is addressed. The third 'person' is in a different case. The object referred to is selected by the speaker, and varies from statement to statement be- tween the same parties. Now it is a necessary condition of communication that the object about which the communication is made should be the same for speaker and hearer. For any particular statement, therefore, a common object must be established for both. It is part of the speaker's task to direct the hearer's attention to the object of his own. Till this is achieved he cannot say what he wants to say about it. One of the commonest linguistic devices for this purpose is to begin a statement by naming the object of reference. It is no doubt the prevalence of this device in language that has given rise to the selection of the formula ' S is P' as the norm for all assertive statements. But however convenient this particular linguistic form may be for many types of communication, it has no logical pre-eminence. Indeed, there are no grounds for assuming that any particular lingusitic form is peculiarly 'logical '. The fact that the medium of expression partly determines the form makes it doubtful. With sound as the medium the simultaneous must be represented through a succession; whereas, in painting, succession must be expressed through simultaneity. However this may be, the important point is that logically the third 'person '-that which a statement is about-is not part of the statement, but one of its presuppositions. The need to mention it in statements at all arises from the purpose of communication, and has reference to the second person only. In the absence of a hearer, to name it would be unnecessary, since the speaker's attention is already focussed upon it. Any statement which is to be understood must, then, be accompanied by some indication of its object of reference. Any device which is effective will do. Where the object is physically present, the speaker may point and say, for example, ' That is the town hall'. I may point out some fungi to a child and say : ' People who eat these things are taken ill and sometimes die '. I might have said: ' These mushrooms are poisonous '. The two statements are logically identical, and which is to be preferred depends upon whom I am talking to. The first form is probably the better if my hearer is a small boy. Once the object has been clearly indicated, it need not be repeated. A sentence is not necessarily a complete statement; indeed,</page><page sequence="6">324 JOHN MACMURRAY only the simplest statements can be made in one sentence. If a student arrives late for his Zoology class, the first sentence of the lecture which he hears may be: 'The tarsi are usually composed of five segments, the final segment being provided with a hook or claw'. He will probably ask his neighbour: 'What is he talking about ? 'and the answer will be: 'Insects '. Empirically speaking, then, the grammarian's three persons, which we may refer to as the 'I ', the 'You ' and the ' Object ', are the three formal presuppositions of language. They constitute a three-dimensional frame- work, as it were, for any communication. The general formula which ex- presses the full language-situation is: 'I say S to You about 0 '; where O stands for the Object and S for what is said about it, the statement. The significant implications of this formula are as follows :- (1) Any instance of language (S) is such in virtue of a three-fold relation, to an 'I ', to a 'You' and to an Object. (2) Any analysis of language which fails to take account of all three terms, 'I ', 'You' and 0, to which every S is related must be inadequate. (3) The fact that there is an S presupposes, though it does not express, a determinate set of relations between 'I', 'You' and 0, such that 'I' and ' You ' are aware of one another and intend to enter into communication, and that each is aware of O. Since language is only language in use, it must be possible to ask, with reference to any actual S, the question : 'Who said it ? ' If this question cannot be answered, we cannot be sure that we are dealing with an actual instance. If in principle it is unanswerable, then we are not. This is import- ant for any analysis of language, whether grammatical or logical. To dis- cover the structure of language we must examine particular instances. We must select examples; and the first question to be asked about any sample offered for examination is whether it is a genuine instance. One is often disturbed by the pedantic unreality of the examples offered by grammarians and logicians alike. It is impossible to believe in them, because one cannot imagine an actual context in which they might be said. Yet they are offered as normal instances. This dissatisfaction is not felt merely on stylistic grounds. It reflects the suspicion that these sentences have been invented to fit a formula already established, and can provide no evidence of its accuracy. If I start with the formula S is P, I can proceed to substitute words for S and P in any way I please. I can produce the sentences, ' Wonk is trive', 'Piety is pink', 'Grass is green'. Yet I have not advanced a step. All three are simply different versions of the original formula. The last is no more a genuine instance of language than the others, as can be realised if we ask: 'Who said so ? ' One would expect the primary for- mulae of logic at least to be established by an unprejudiced examination and comparison of authentic instances of language, conducted in accordance with well-tried methods of inductive investigation, varying the conditions as much as possible, while keeping within the limits of normal usage, and avoiding, in the first instance, highly specialised uses such as those of poets on the one hand and scientists on the other.</page><page sequence="7">THE ANALYSIS OF LANGUAGE 325 In fact, it is notoriously difficult to find in any normal instance of lang- uage, as it is spoken or written, statements which exhibit in their natural structure the forms of proposition or inference which appear in logical treatises, whether traditional or modern. Before they will yield the formulae, they have to be bowdlerised and tortured into what used to be called ' logical form '. This fact tends to throw doubt on the validity of the formulae. The older logicians had an explanation and an excuse. They believed that they were analysing not language but thought, and that the formulae they invented expressed the forms of thought. But if this is denied, and logic is considered to be an analysis of language, can we avoid enquiring what is the relation between language, as people actually use it, and these logical formulae; and with what justification they are used as instruments of analysis upon real language ? If we attempt to determine the logical structure of statements without reference to the person who makes them, it becomes impossible to give any empirical account of the nature of propositions. If we are to distinguish between grammatical and logical structure, we must draw a distinction between sentences and propositions, or some equivalent distinction. If the proposition is not referred to the speaker, then it must be objectified. It must be credited with some kind of independent being. This leads naturally to the belief that propositions subsist eternally in a world of their own independently of their embodiment in sentences. Such a theory, which has actually been propounded in our own time, is highly 'metaphysical' in the bad sense. It is the logical equivalent of the belief in metempsychosis. The ' sentence ' is the body and the ' proposition ' is the soul of a statement and this soul is simple and unchanging, moving from incarnation to incarna- tion in accordance, presumably, with some law of probability, yet independ- ent, essentially, of them all. The attempt to escape from this absurdity into some causal theory of the relation between sentences and their meaning does not seem to me to mend matters. Such theories are at least not empir- ical, unless by 'empiricism' we mean a particular metaphysical position. They are not characterised by a humble attention to our experience of thinking and speaking, but by a sort of arrogant ingenuity which forces that experience into the strait-waistcoat of structures which originate, no doubt empirically enough, from other sources. The relation of any statement to the second person is as important for the analysis of language as the relation to the 'I '. If we define language, for purposes of analysis, as a ' means of expression ', we implicitly ignore its relation to a 'You '. But the structure of language is determined at least as much by the speaker's intention to be understood by someone else as by his purpose of expressing himself. Now traditional logic and theory of knowledge work within a framework constituted by the relation between Subject and Object, that is to say, between the 'I' and the '0' of my symbolism. This procedure rests upon the view that the subject-object relation is the form of all knowledge and therefore of all thought, and that what is to be analysed is thought or knowledge. To shift the locus of analysis</page><page sequence="8">326 JOHN MACMURRAY from thought to language is salutary precisely because it reinstates the second person, as the recipient of any communication, in the framework of reference for logic. Properly understood, this new approach constitutes an important advance in philosophy. Unfortunately, it does not seem to have been properly understood by the protagonists for its adoption. There is nothing surprising in this. It is a common occurrence in the history of philosophy, and easily comprehensible. The pioneer remains entangled in the assumptions of the system of thought which his own originality is under- mining. The full implications of his discovery take time, and often a long time, to become apparent. He tends to use them, therefore, as weapons in a controversy which they have robbed of significance. In modern philosophy, the conflict between Idealism and Realism has its source in the limitations of the Subject-Object frame of reference. The absence of the 'You' from this schema involves the consequence that any problem which requires a reference to the second person for its solution becomes insoluble. This reference must be replaced either by a reference to the Subject-the 'I '- or to the Object, and in either case there will be conclusive reasons against the solution offered. Idealists and realists are the proponents of' subjective ' and 'objective' solutions respectively. Historically, the substitution of language for thought emerges as a realist move to achieve a complete objec- tivity, by banishing the Subject. To put it crudely, if in the context of the idealist-realist controversy, I say, as a realist: 'But thinking is only talking', I seem to be arguing for a 'physical' and against a 'mental' interpretation of thinking. If I take my statement seriously, I shall proceed to show that all the characteristics and functions of thought can be accounted for without referring to the Subject and its supposedly ' subjective ' doings. Yet in doing so I shall still be using the subject-object dichotomy as my frame of reference. I shall be in a position similar to Berkeley's when he denied the existence of matter. The denial depends upon the distinction between 'mind ' and ' matter ', and is comprehensible only in terms of it. Terms like ' mind ' and ' matter ', or ' subject ' and ' object ' are strictly correlative. They have their meaning and function only in relation to one another. Consequently, to abolish one is ipso facto to abolish the other. Properly understood, the transference of the locus of analysis from thought to language implies that thought is inextricably bound up with communica- tion; that it is the individual moment in the mutual determination of a common world. So far from abolishing the 'I ', it introduces the ' You ' as the correlative of the 'I '. With this, the framework within which philo- sophical problems are discussed acquires a third dimension, a new axis of reference; and new possibilities are open for the solution of old problems. The problem of significant negation-to take a simple example-can be examined in a new light. One of the commonest uses of the negative judg- ment, and perhaps its basic use, is to express dissent from a proposition that someone else affirms. I cannot meaningfully assert both p and not-p at the same time: but 'I' can assert not-p while 'You' assert p. Indeed this is the point at which communication becomes debate; and the resolution</page><page sequence="9">THE ANALYSIS OF LANGUAGE 327 of the contradiction between us extends the boundaries of the world we share in common. The problems of the criteria of validity can be re-exam- ined, to take another example. The old criterion of truth-quod semper, quod usque, quod ab omnibus-can come into its own. It is ruled out of any discussion which has only the subject and the object as its points of reference. In this two-dimensional frame truth must mean objectivity, however objec- tivity is conceived; since the validity of a proposition can clearly not rest on the fact that the subject thinks it. But in a three-dimensional framework, where the relation between the 'I' and the 'You ', and the differentiation of the two, are recognised as essential, the ground of validity might be found either by reference to the object, or to the 'You' or to both. In other words, the range of agreement secured by an assertion may be an essential element in the criterion of truth, though not, of course, by itself a proof of validity. It is certainly one of the de facto grounds of most of our knowledge; even of our scientific knowledge, and even for scientists in their own field of research. In the case of value judgments especially it may prove to be the element of major importance and this might put an end to the deadlock between subjectivists and objectivists. The objection that this would leave all value judgments hypothetical, even if correct, could hardly be made by those who hold that all propositions are either hypo- thetical or tautological. It might perhaps be combined with the verification principle if one could shew that the verification of a value-judgment is to be found in its ability to unify persons in common action. The relation of S (what is said) to O (that about which it is said) is common to both frames of reference. But the introduction of the second person into the original schema makes a difference to the Object. O has now a double relation, instead of a unique relation to 'The Mind', whatever that strange term may be supposed to denote. This double relation of the Object to the 'I' and to the 'You ' throws light, amongst other things, upon the taut- ologies of definition. If there is to be communication, the Object must be one and the same for both speaker and hearer. The purpose served by definition in communication is to determine a common object of reference for the 'I' and the 'You '. If I say to someone : ' Sea-pies are plentiful this winter ', he might ask: 'What are sea-pies' ? I should answer: 'Sea-pies are oyster-catchers'. This will be a sufficient definition if he knows the bird I called a 'sea-pie ' by the other name. The common object however can be determined in this way only if I know both names while my hearer knows only one. If he is unacquainted with the object itself, and would not recognise the bird if he saw it, a definition of this kind is useless. In that case two alternatives are open to me. It may be that my remark was occasioned by seeing some oyster-catchers about. In that case I may point to them and say : ' These are sea-pies '. If this is not possible, I must have recourse to a 'definition by description.' I may offer the sort of description of the bird which would enable my hearer to recognise it if he did see it. A11 these ways of answering the question are properly called 'definitions' because they serve the same purpose. They are ways, not of</page><page sequence="10">328 JOHN MACMURRAY saying something about an object, but of determining that the attention of a hearer is focussed upon the object which is before the speaker's mind and about which he has a communication to make. When I am satisfied that I have succeeded in defining the term 'sea-pie' for my hearer, I can repeat my original statement that sea-pies are plentiful this winter, and perhaps go on to advance a hypothesis to account for the increase in their numbers. But any attempt to determine the logical status and function of definition within the subject-object frame of reference must make definition seem pointless and meaningless, unless we surreptitiously introduce the reference to a second person. The Object is what is before the Subject's mind, that on which his attention is directed. Consequently, no definition is necessary, or even in the strict sense, possible. The nearest approach to definition in such a reference that one can think of is an exclamatory formula of recognition, as when one says, on landing in the United States for the first time : ' So this is New York ' ! So far as the Subject is concerned, any description he gives himself of the Object is necessarily an exploration, an analysis, a further determination of what is already in the focus of his atten- tion, already defined as the Object for him. This contention is, I admit, partly a matter of the usage of terms. But the essential point is not at all how we use or ought to use the term 'definition', but the fact that if we omit from our logical frame of reference the differentiation of' I ' and ' You ', we conceal one of the most difficult practical problems in the attempt to extend knowledge by discussion, the problem of using language to secure the certainty, or the reasonable probability, that all the people involved are thinking and talking about the same thing. The foregoing reflections have been concerned with the frame of reference, constituted by the relations between the ' I', the ' You ' and the ' Object', within which any statement must fall. They lead naturally to a consideration of the statement itself (S). The only reflections I have to offer on this subject concern the meaning of statements and the related topic of the nature of propositions. Before doing so it may be well to repeat that the term ' state- ment ', and its symbol ' S ', are being used in an inclusive and non-technical sense, and refer to 'what is said' whenever language is used. This may be a question or a command, for example, as well as an assertion; and includes the words used as well as their meaning. In particular it is intended as a device for avoiding the distinction between ' sentences ' and ' propositions ', since this distinction and its equivalents are involved in, if they are not part of, the attempt to answer the question which I have in mind, and to some extent imply an answer or a type of answer which should not be pre- supposed. The need to distinguish the verbal element in a statement from its meaning is frequently demonstrated by reference to the possibility of trans- lating it from one language to another. This shows that the meaning may remain constant while the medium of 'expression' changes. This makes the point convincingly, no doubt; but it is an unsatisfactory instance to choose for the purpose. It proves the distinction by reference to a contingent</page><page sequence="11">THE ANALYSIS OF LANGUAGE 329 fact-the actual co-existence of different languages-and not by reference to the nature of language as such. One suspects that the reason of its popular- ity is that it avoids reference to the ' You '. One thinks of a single ' Subject' who knows two 'languages', and thus can express the same thought in two distinct media. Yet the choice of medium, and of words within the same general medium, is mainly determined by the need to be understood by the person addressed. Translation is merely a particular case of this : it makes the statement understandable by a larger number of hearers. It would be better to exemplify the distinction, therefore, by reference to the part played by the second person in determining the form of statements. One chooses different words and different verbal constructions to communicate the same meaning to a child and to an adult, to a beginner and to an expert. I can best assure myself that a student has not merely heard what I said, but also understood what I meant, by finding whether he can repeat it to me 'in his own words '. The question ' What does this statement mean ' ? is equivalent to ' How is it to be understood' ? It is essentially a listener's question. I cannot in the same sense ask: 'What do I mean by my statement '? In another sense I can ask this ; indeed, in two other senses. In one sense the question is equivalent to 'What would someone else take me to mean'? We may disregard this, because it contains the essential reference to the second person. If I exclude this reference, the question 'What do I mean by that ' ? is equivalent to ' Do I really think that ? Is it thinkable' ? Thus the limitations of the two-dimensional frame of reference tend to blur the distinction between the meaning and the validity of a statement; and in a discussion between people who are seriously attempting to stay within that framework there is a tendency to confuse understanding with agreement. 'I do not understand you' tends to become equivalent to 'I do not agree with you '. We reach a point at which you say to me : ' I can't understand you; you just can't mean what you say: it isn't thinkable, it is just nonsense '; to which I reply : 'But I do think it'. Now in principle, understanding a statement and agreeing or disagreeing with it are quite distinct. The task of understanding a statement belongs to the hearer, not to the speaker; and before the hearer can say whether he agrees or disagrees he must have understood. Even to say that a statement is meaningless implies that in some sense and to some degree at least it has been understood. I may be correct in saying that it conveys no meaning to me, or that I cannot imagine it conveying a meaning to anyone who heard it. But to say that a statement that someone has actually made is meaningless is strictly self-contradictory. It is to say that it both is and is not a state- ment; that the speaker is not trying to communicate anything, but merely making noises: that he is not, in fact, using language. Every statement, if it is a statement, must have a meaning. To say that I do not understand it, so far from suggesting that it may be meaningless, already implies that it has a meaning. What then is the proper answer to the question : ' What is the meaning</page><page sequence="12">330 JOHN MACMURRAY of a statement ' ?, i.e. ' When we refer to the meaning of a statement, what are we referring to ' ? If we are to stick to our empiricism, the proper answer seems to be that its meaning is 'what the speaker was trying to convey to his hearer when he made it '. If we are in real doubt, the best procedure is to ask him for an explanation. If this is impossible, then we must do the best we can by a careful study of the context. We must not assume, in either case, and especially in the second, that it must be possible to ascertain with certainty what the statement means. The speaker may not be good at explaining, or we may be incapable of comprehending him, through lack of the requisite experience or for other reasons. To assume that the meaning of every statement, if only it were ' properly ' expressed, must be comprehen- sible by everyone who understands the language, would be to fly in the face of all experience. That the meaning of a statement is whatever the person who made it intended to convey seems to me to be the only possible definition of meaning that is warranted by the facts. It will be objected, however, that we can consider any statement without reference to the person who made it or the person to whom it is addressed, and ask ourselves what it means. If we do this, we can usually give an answer. To this I should reply that if we perform this operation, what we have left is no longer a statement but only a sentence or a group of sentences. We are asking another question: 'What is the meaning of a sentence ' The proper answer to this question is that a sentence has no meaning. When we talk about the meaning of sentences, as we frequently do, we are either speaking loosely, or speaking in a context where it is unnecessary to distinguish between grammatical and logical structure. But if I abstract completely, for purposes of analysis, from the context of a statement, what remains-we have called it the 'sentence '- has no meaning of any kind. If it seems to have a meaning, that is only because I automatically supply it with a different context of my own, possibly the barest context within which it can carry a meaning, in which case it will have the minimum of meaning for me. If I am asked for the meaning of the sentence : 'Queen Anne is dead', I am asked to imagine someone saying this to me 'under normal circumstances' or 'in the ordinary run of conversation' and to say what it would convey to me. The answer I give will depend upon the kind of context I supply. If I supply the context denoted by the term 'common usage' I shall possibly answer that the sentence means: 'Your news is stale'. If I supply the context suggested by the term 'literal sense ' I may reply that it means: ' There was a queen of England called Anne, but that was some time ago'. But if I supply no context at all, the sentence has no meaning at all. To some this may seem mere quibbling, to others true but unimportant. Yet if there is something that can in all strictness be called the meaning of a sentence, then this meaning of any statement the sentence is used to convey must become normative. It will be the ' normal', the ' proper ', the ' significant' meaning of any statement that is made, or heard or read. To establish such norms, even by implication, amounts to a refusal of com-</page><page sequence="13">THE ANALYSIS OF LANGUAGE 331 munication except within limits imposed upon the speaker. It is one of the oldest dodges of the sophist to cast ridicule upon a speaker by insisting upon the 'literal' meaning of what he has said, when quite clearly it is not so meant. The effect is to make him appear to be talking nonsense. Indeed, the occasion we have for referring to the 'literal' meaning of a statement is when we want to contrast it with the actual meaning. The 'literal' meaning of a statement is either simply its meaning, in which case the term 'literal' is redundant; or it is just not its meaning, but something that someone might wrongly take it to mean. But we cannot legitimately sub- stitute for 'the literal meaning of a statement' the phrase 'the meaning of a sentence', when we are concerned to distinguish between logical and grammatical analysis. A sentence is a grammatical unit; and grammar considers language in abstraction from the meaning it is used to convey. A sentence is therefore a statement considered without reference to its meaning. If it had a meaning it would no longer be a sentence but a state- ment. Similarly, one cannot talk about 'the monetary value of the obverse side of a shilling '. To say that the meaning of a statement is what the person who makes it is trying to communicate does not imply that he can speak as he pleases. If the hearer were ignored; if language were merely a means of self-expression, it would imply this. If I am thinking, I can make any noises I please and give them any meanings I please, if it helps me along. I can invent a private 'language ' of my own, and keep it secret. What prevents this in fact is that language is a medium of communication; that it is addressed to some- one in the hope of being understood. The only fundamental rule for the use of language is this: Speak so that you will be understood by the person to whom you are speaking. All other rules are particular applications of this to particular types of situation, in respect of particular classes of hearers or particular kinds of Object. Whoever undertakes, whether as grammarian or logician, to formulate rules for the use of language is in the precarious position of one who sets out to teach an art. For the use of language is an art, and in its higher reaches, in philosophy as in poetry, a most difficult art. A teacher of painting, for instance, must formulate some sort of ' science ' of painting, and a set of techniques based upon its principles. He must insist that his pupils learn the principles and practise the techniques; and he must use them himself as a basis for criticising their efforts. If he is a good teacher, however, he will know that neither the principles nor the techniques are to be taken too seriously, and he will tell his pupils this from the start. He will have in mind the risk he runs of destroying what natural capacity his pupils may possess. Above all, he will never imagine that his principles can be used to decide the artistic value of a real painting. Yet in spite of all this; in spite of the fact that he will himself say on occasion : ' You can't really teach art. There are no rules. Every artist is a law to himself ', he yet performs a significant and necessary function in the training of painters. The analogy with grammar is clear. It provides an important method- ology for teaching and learning the use of language; yet the need to have</page><page sequence="14">332 JOHN MACMURRAY recourse to its rules is evidence that a speaker's capacity to use the language is still inadequate. The same would seem to be true, prima facie, of logic. I find it hard to believe that any mature philosopher has recourse to the principles and techniques of formal logic when he is seeking to make a contribution to philosophy, even in the field of logical theory. On the other hand, my experience as a teacher of philosophy has convinced me that formal logic, particularly the traditional kind, is an all but indispensable instrument of philosophical training, and that it is far too little used nowa- days. It is the best means we possess for training in the precise use of language upon which philosophy depends. But to imagine that a formal analysis of the language in which a philosophical theory is communicated can determine the validity of the theory is to take logic altogether too seriously. It is indeed to fall a victim to the fallacy of rationalism against which empiricism is a protest. The analysis of statements into sentences and the meaning they convey seems complete in its kind. There is no third element over and above these. Now a sentence is the unit for the grammatical analysis of language. What then is the corresponding unit of its logical analysis ? The natural answer is that the unit of logical analysis is a proposition, and there is no doubt that this is the term customarily used to denote the logical unit by logicians. But this is not very helpful for our purpose. We want to know in what sense a proposition is a unit in the analysis of language, and how it is related to the other units we have discussed-to a statement, and to a sentence. It seems clear that we cannot hold that logic is an analysis of meaning in abstraction from the words which communicate it. Meaning is always the meaning of a statement. Even if we are justified in saying that the meaning of a statement is the 'thought ' or the 'idea' that it conveys, it is doubtful whether what these terms refer to has a structure independent of its expression; and even if it has, the structure is not amenable to logical analysis except as it is expressed. Yet it is clear that different sentences may be used to convey the same meaning, and that when they do, they are logi- cally identical. This seems to imply that logic considers language from the point of view of its meaning. The units of logical analysis, propositions, are determined by the meaning of statements, and not by the particular words and grammatical structures used in them. We have to ask ourselves, therefore, to what extent, if at all, the logician can rely upon grammatical analysis as an aid to logical analysis. Is there any definite analogy between gram- matical and logical analysis, or any real parallelism between grammatical and logical structure ? Let us confine ourselves to one aspect of this general question. Is there a fixed correspondence between the units of the two analyses, the ' sentence ' and the 'proposition ' ? Is it true that to every sentence there corresponds a proposition ? If we are to answer this in terms of the empirical practice of logic as we know it, the answer is certainly in the negative. In the first place, logic confines itself to one particular use of language, and to one particular class of statements. It excludes questions, commands, threats,</page><page sequence="15">THE ANALYSIS OF LANGUAGE 333 exhortations and the like and concentrates upon statements which make assertions. Moreover, in deciding whether a statement is or is not an asser- tion, it is not guided by grammatical form, but by the intention of the speaker. It will recognise a rhetorical question as an assertion, in spite of its gram- matical form; and a sentence in the indicative mood as the expression of a threat. These excluded types of statement all have meanings. They can be understood. Grammatically they are sentences, but to these sentences no proposition corresponds. In the second place, even among assertions logic distinguishes between those which have an ' emotive' meaning and those which have an ' objective ' or factual meaning, and excludes the former. It is untrue, therefore, that to every sentence there corresponds a proposition. At most the correlation refers only to a particular class of sentences. To this we may add, that in the living use of language, a proposition may be expressed by a single word, or in a phrase that is not a complete sentence; or again it may require a number of sentences to express it. Even within the classes of statements that logic deals with, the correspondence between the grammatical and the logical unit is accidental. At most we may say that with a little ingenuity we can usually find or frame a sentence which has a meaning complete in itself, and which expresses a proposition. From what is indisputable in these observations one must conclude that it is misleading, to say the least, to describe logic as we know it as the analysis of language tout court, in any sense that suggests a parallel with grammar. Perhaps there could and should be such a science, but this is not a question to be mooted now. Rather we shall keep our attention on the question: 'What is a proposition, as a logical unit of language ' ? and seek an answer through the empirical consideration of the situation in which logic, as we know it, arises. The obvious answer, that a proposition is a statement that can be true or false, is unhelpful; since its application depends upon the settlement of the controversy as to the proper use of the terms 'true' and 'false '. If 'I' make a statement to 'you ', you may understand it, and then disagree with it. If the communication is to continue, I must then produce a further set of statements which express my reasons for asserting it, while you, on your side, produce your reasons for rejecting it. Now when an assertion is challenged in this way by the second person, and arguments for and against it are adduced, it becomes the Object about which other state- ments are made with a view to reaching an agreement which will permit the original communication, about the original Object, to be resumed. In this dialectical process, in which an assertion is in dispute between an 'I' and a 'You ', and evidence is produced for and against its acceptance, the statement which is the Object of the dispute is a proposition relative to the statements which are made as grounds for accepting or for rejecting it. Thus a statement becomes a proposition by becoming the object of a dispute. It is called a proposition because it has been proposed for acceptance, but not accepted. When agreement has been reached between the parties to the dispute, either by the withdrawal of the statement or by its acceptance</page><page sequence="16">334 JOHN MACMURRAY with or without amendment, the statement ceases to be a proposition. Empirically speaking, then, we may say that a proposition is a statement in dispute, and that any statement which can become the object of such dispute is potentially a proposition. It follows from what has been said earlier that there can be no dispute, between the person who makes a statement and the person to whom it is made, as to the meaning of the statement. The statement means what the first person is trying to convey. There may, of course, be a misunderstanding on the part of the second person, and a dispute between the two about who is to blame for it. Before a statement can be disputed it must have been understood. It is thus strictly inaccurate to talk about the 'meaning of a proposition'. If a statement is a proposition, it is already the Object of a communication, and as such a common object for the disputants-the same statement for both parties. The dispute-situation, then, in which statements become propositions, is one in which, to express it formally, both p and not-p. P stands for the statement as accepted by the ' I' ; not-p for the same statement as rejected by the ' You '. The dispute itself consists of two sets of statements, the one being the evidence for p, the other the evidence for not-p. These evidence- statements are not themselves propositions; though any of them may become a proposition if it is challenged and so becomes the object of a sub- sidiary debate. The underlying assumption of the dispute, if it is 'logical ', is that it is governed by the common purpose of reaching agreement. So far as this is not in fact the case the discussion is not a dispute in the logical sense; but a struggle for the mastery between combatants, and the state- ments they make have an 'emotive' purpose, at least in one sense of that most ambiguous term. It should be evident from this that there is no proper analogy between the grammarian's sentences and the logician's propositions. The 'sentence' is properly contrasted with the 'meaning' which it serves to 'convey'; and the grammarian is concerned to analyse the structure of the medium which makes possible its use for communication. The 'proposition' is contrasted with the 'evidence ' which is adduced for and against its accept- ance; the logician is concerned with the formal relations between propos- itions and their grounds. Since propositions and their grounds are in fact statements, the discovery and expression of these relations is properly described, in this sense, as an analysis of language. This use of the term ' proposition ' is traditional in geometry. In Euclid's Elements, a proposition is 'quod est demonstrandum'. The statements which follow constitute the proof of the proposition. It is regrettable that these 'demonstrations' became for so long ideals and type-forms for logic, because they are so far from being typical, and indeed present a highly special case. Not only is the subject-matter itself formal, but the ' objects ' of the demonstrations-triangles, circles and the rest-are created by their definitions, and no evidence against the acceptance of the propositions is present or indeed possible. Moreover, the fact that these demonstrations</page><page sequence="17">THE ANALYSIS OF LANGUAGE 335 became the means whereby generation after generation of students had the results of earlier geometrical discoveries communicated to them engendered the belief that the deductive process so clearly visible in the proof of the propositions was the form of the process of their discovery, and by a natural if illegitimate extension, of the discovery of all truth. Let us consider a more typical example. I have to introduce a discussion for a philosophical society, and the choice of topic is left to me. I choose to offer for discussion a simple and clearly defined position which I myself hold, but on which there is likely to be disagreement. Suppose that I write a paper which will take twenty minutes to read. How I write it will, of course, depend to a considerable extent on the character of my audience. I shall write differently for professional philosophers and for young students; differently again if I know that my hearers will have only a lay interest in the subject. But in any case, I may conclude my paper by saying : 'The proposition, then, which I offer for your discussion is that p'. In saying this I am expressing the fact that my paper as a whole is to be regarded as stating a single proposition, and that this proposition is the one that I have expressed finally in a single sentence. If this is so, why could I not state my proposition in a sentence and leave it at that ? What is the function of the multiplicity of sentences which lead up to the final formulation of the proposition ? It might be said that the rest of the paper sets out the grounds on which I assert the proposition; that it is evidential in character. This is indeed likely to be part of the answer. I shall at least have written it in such a way as to make the proposition seem plausible and worthy of serious discussion. But I may have deliberately avoided any argument in favour of my proposition in order not to anticipate the dis- cussion which is to follow. We may grant, however, that a logical analysis of the structure of my paper will yield as one of its products a content which is related to the proposition as evidence. But two other elements at least will come to light. One will function in relation to the proposition as defining with precision the Object about which the proposition is made. I introduced this in order that when discussion begins all who take part will talk about the same thing. The other element will function as determining the precise meaning of the statement which formulates the proposition. It will not, of course, be possible to divide the paper into three parts, each of which performs one of these functions in the general purpose of the communication. There will be many sentences which perform two or even all three of these functions. If the result of this logical analysis is to be set out as a com- munication, the paper will have to be taken to pieces and re-expressed in some fashion that approximately represents the three elements and their relation to the proposition in separation from one another. However care- fully this may be done, the result will be crude and diagrammatic in com- parison with the original and in no sense a substitute for it. The more mechanically it is performed, in accordance with some preassumed logical form, the more misleading it is likely to be. At some points it may provide a valuable clarification; but at others it is certain to do the opposite.</page><page sequence="18">336 JOHN MACMURRAY Moreover, unless it is undertaken by the author himself, the analysis is liable to error at every point. For it depends upon a complete and accurate understanding of the original as well as upon competence in logical analysis. The schematic representation which is produced has no claim to be called the analysis of my paper. For it is only the communication of the results of an analysis, subject to all the dangers of error in communication; and it is not an analysis of the paper, but of what its producer understood or mis- understood the author of the paper to mean. The logical analysis of such a paper would then consist in the attempt to answer three questions: 'What is the author of the proposition talking about ? '; ' What is the meaning of what is stated about it in the propos- ition ? '; and 'What evidence bearing upon the validity of the proposition is adduced ? ' To this there may be added an estimate of the weight to be attached to the evidence adduced in the paper. But this is rather a contri- bution to the debate about the validity of the proposition than a logical analysis of the paper itself. What emerges from this is that the general purpose of the paper as a whole is to provide a context in which the meaning of the statement which formulates the proposition it offers for debate can be precisely and clearly interpreted by those who are to discuss its validity. Apart from this context it is no longer my proposition. Apart from any context it has no meaning at all; it is a mere sentence. Moreover, the sentences which express the context must be taken together, for it is only in their togetherness that they constitute a context. This wholeness of the context must escape through the meshes of the analyst's net. It can be communicated only emotively- in another sense of that ambiguous term. In the living use of language, no statement of any seriousness or of any length can be made without conveying an emotional attitude. And though this 'emotive meaning' is irrelevant to the validity of the proposition it asserts, it is not irrelevant to its under- standing. What I say is inseparable from how I say it, and the more stren- uously I seek to suppress this emotive element in my communication, the more forcibly do I communicate the disposition which motivates my effort of concealment. For all true communication is self-communication, and the attempt to avoid this only produces the impression of one who conceals himself behind a barricade of words. If the quest for a pure objectivity in statement could succeed, it would achieve a pure meaninglessness. A purely objective statement would have to be made by nobody to nobody. What conceals this conclusion is the fact that there are ranges of experi- ence within which the explicit provision of a context is unnecessary because it is already common ground to the parties concerned. Sensory experience provides such a context for a wide variety of statements. A body of scien- tific theory does the same for communication between all those familiar with it; and many similar examples will occur to anyone. For the most part we confine our communications within the limits of such common contexts, because in other cases the way to a common understanding is slow, laborious and difficult. Yet even within a common context misunder-</page><page sequence="19">THE ANALYSIS OF LANGUAGE 337 standing frequently arises because the statement fails to indicate to the listener the elements of the context which are relevant to its interpretation. To carry these reflections farther would take us outside the limits of our present purpose. This purpose cannot be formulated in conclusion as a proposition for debate. It has been an effort to provide the outlines of a context within which propositions about the nature and function of logic, as an analysis of language, might be understood, as a preliminary to their discussion. The general intention of the paper, however, might be summed up in the following fashion. It is indeed true that in our thinking and communicating, in writing and in reading what others write, we are always liable to be misled, into misunderstanding and into error, by the use of words. It is important to find means by which we can avoid the pitfalls of language. Two courses are open to us. The first is to attempt to make language fool-proof; to fix the meanings of all its symbols and to provide and master efficient techniques for their manipulation. We may try to make the use of language as like as possible to the use of mathematical symbolisms. Such an effort seems to me misguided. It points towards the arid orthodoxy of a new scholasticism. The other course open to us is to concentrate our attention continually not upon the words we use but upon the actual experience which they report and to which they refer, and let the words take care of themselves. Words are the wise man's counters and the fool's coin. If we wish to see the landscape through the window, it is fatal to focus our eyes upon the window-pane.
