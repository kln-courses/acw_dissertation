<plain_text><page sequence="1">LEAF'S THEORY OF THE GODS IN THE MENIS AND EXPANSIONS OF THE ILIAD By JAMES DUFFY Washington University The question of the authorship of the Homeric poems has a long history. The student of the problem is amazed at the number and the variety of the theories that have been propounded to explain the origin of the poems. Both the "Unitarians" and even those in the last fifty years who have opposed the theory of unity have rejected almost all the early destructive methods of Homeric criticism which related to the supposed interpolations and incon- gruous elements in the Iliad and Odyssey. He who peruses the literature on the Homeric question quickly learns from it that a great number of Homeric scholars approached the study of the poems with a preconceived theory and that whatever was incon- sistent with that theory they arbitrarily rejected as late and un- Homeric. At the beginning of the last quarter of the nineteenth century the consensus of opinion of the "Separatists" was that the Iliad consisted of an original "kernel" which was expanded and en- larged by different poets from 1000 to 600 B.c. Each successive age was supposed to have lent its color to the poem, which was sub- sequently arranged into our present Iliad. Leaf is one of the chief exponents of this view. He states that there are three strata easily discernible in the poem. The oldest, the Menis, is the original Iliad of Homer which underwent additions and expansions from 1000 to 600 B.c. Leaf's Menis, which consists of about 3185 lines com- piled from nine books of the Iliad, and his second, and third strata are as follows: Menis or First Stratum: I; 11, 1-53, 443-483; xI, 56-805, omitting 4</page><page sequence="2">LEAF'S THEORY OF THE GODS 5 665-762; xv, 592-746; xvI; xix, 356-424; xx, 353-503; xxI, 34-138, 540-611; xxii, 1-404.1 Second Stratum: II (not the Catalogue of Ships); III-vii (to vs. 312); the Aristeia of Idomeneus, which occupies a great part of xIII and perhaps the Aristeia of Menelaus over the body of Patro- clus in xvII. Third Stratum: This part consists of the following books or parts of books: vIII, a piece of connecting narrative introductory to Ix; xII, capture of the wall; xIv and xv, A pate; xvIII, making of the shield of Achilles; xxIII, funeral of Patroclus and the games; xxIv, ransom of Hector; x, the story of Dolon; xxI, the fight with the river and the battle with the gods; II (to end of the Catalogue of Ships). Small portions of xIx and xx belong to the original Menis. Book vi is part of those first extensive additions by which the original Menis was first expanded. Leaf states that in his Menis a noteworthy fact must be men- tioned, namely, that the interest of the story from beginning to end is purely human. The interference of the gods, he says, is such as becomes the rulers of the world, not partisans of the battle. He goes on to say that they nowhere take any part in the fighting and that they seldom appear on the earthly stage: Apollo, invis- ible, stuns Patroclus, and Athena appears for a moment in order to bring Hector to a stand before Achilles. In other words, Leaf states, the gods show themselves in the Menis just so much as to let us know what are the powers which control mankind from heaven; but none the less it is purely human motive and human action which guide the plot. Speaking of the wounding of Aphro- dite and Ares by Diomedes in Book viII of the Iliad, Leaf says that these gods enter the story only at a later period, and not 1 For comparison with Leaf it is interesting to note how other scholars have compiled the original Iliad. Fick's consists of 2260 verses from I to xxII (to vs. 393). Bechtel's consists of 2146 verses from seventeen books ending at xxII, 212. Bethe's consists of 1500 verses composed of the kernel of I and of five or six other books. Bethe's original Iliad is tragic in character. Wilamowitz' original Iliad consists of I-vII (to vs. 321); xI-xxIII (to vs. 256); and a concluding portion, which has been lost. Grote's original Achilleid consists of I, viii xI-xxii inclusive. Jebb's primary Iliad is I, xI, xvI-xxII. Leaf's Menis is set forth in his Iliad, Vols. I, II, Introduction and the introductions to the individual books, and in his Companion to the Iliad: London, The Macmillan Co. (1892), 33-49.</page><page sequence="3">6 THE CLASSICAL JOURNAL earlier than the second expansions, when the gods of Olympus were treated with far scanter respect than in the older days, and that the introduction of the gods as essential actors in the story is a chief mark of the second expansion.2 An effort will be made to adduce evidence from the Iliad as a whole to show that the theory of Leaf is not correct. First, a word must be said about Olympus. Leaf gives one the impression that the conception of divinity in the Menis is more spiritual than in the expansions. If this is true, we must conclude that the abode of the gods was more ideally conceived by the poet of the Menis. Almost all the critics, beginning with the Alexandrian scholars, agree that the poet's conception of Olympus is the concrete one in all parts of the Iliad. Aristarchus came to the conclusion that the concrete Olympus is uniformly meant by Homer in both poems as the home of the gods.3 Eustathius and the scholiasts also regarded the physical Olympus as the abode of the deities. The Roman poets were of the same opinion as the Alexandrian com- mentators.4 Modern critics also agree that there is no difference in the poet's presentation of the city of the gods in any part of the Iliad.5 Not only in the Menis but in all parts of the Iliad in which Olympus is mentioned there is a definite descriptive adjective or epithet which unequivocally shows that the poet had the concrete conception of Olympus in view.6 Finsler,7 however, says that the abode of gods was an invention introduced into the poem at the end of the eighth century B.c. and that in the earlier parts of the 2 Cf.

Nilsson8 shows that Finsler's theory is not correct. It would appear, then, that the conception of Olympus is the same in the Menis as in the rest of the Iliad. If the conception of the gods in the Menis is on a higher level than that of the expansions, as Leaf believes, it is strange that we have not a higher conception of their abode also expressed in the older part. Finsler's theory that the gods are dif- ferent in the older parts of the poem has something in common with Leaf's. If, as Nilsson states, Finsler's theory is incorrect, it must follow that Leaf's is also untenable. Mention will now be made of the functions and activities of the chief gods, Zeus, Athena, and Apollo, in the Menis and in the first and second expansions, so that the r1les which the divinities play in these different parts of the poem may be compared. Leaf states that in the Menis the gods nowhere take any part in the fighting; indeed, he says, they seldom appear at all on the earthly stage. This statement must be considered, and the r61e of Zeus in the contest in the Menis must be compared with that of the expansions to note the god's relationship to the contestants in the different parts of the poem. It is strange that Leaf says that Zeus takes no part in the fighting in the Menis when there are two instances of his participation. Zeus draws Hector from the darts and dust (xI, 163) and urges the hero on with his strong hand (xv, 695). With the exception of these two passages, Zeus nowhere in the Iliad takes a physical part in the struggle; consequently, we need not assume from these two passages that Zeus actually appeared on the earthly stage. In the opening book of the Menis the poet's conception of the relation of Zeus to the outcome of the struggle is clearly shown. He states that the god has in his hands the sacking of Troy (I, 128). We are informed of this power of Zeus early in the story-a fact which may serve to show the part that the god is to play in the struggle. When Thetis came to Zeus (I, 503-510) and begged him to avenge the dishonor done her son by Agamemnon and to grant victory to the Greeks, Zeus said that he would take thought for 8 Mycenaean Origin of Greek Mythology: Berkeley, University of California Press (1932), 223-231.</page><page sequence="5">8 THE CLASSICAL JOURNAL these things and fulfil them (I, 523). The promise which he makes to Thetis in this book is later fulfilled when Hector with the assistance of the deity leads the Trojans to the Greek ships. The fulfilment of this promise by the intervention of Zeus in the battle conflicts with Leaf's theory that the action of the Menis is entirely under human control and guidance. We are also told in the open- ing book that Zeus gives glory (I, 279). Rarely does a hero gain renown in the Iliad unless by his military prowess. In the eleventh book, which is a part of the Menis, Zeus's interference in the action is well illustrated by Homer. In this book the poet represents Hector as having refrained from the battle in obedience to the order of the god (xI, 186-194). The deity sent his messenger, Iris, to the hero (186) and bade her command him to hold back while Agamemnon ranged amongst the fighters, and in addition to order the rest of the host to engage in battle. When Agamemnon retired wounded to the ships, Zeus promised to give strength to Hector to slay till he came to the ships (xI, 208). Later when Agamemnon was wounded and retired from the struggle (xI, 252), Hector en- gaged in the fight (xI, 284). Throughout the remainder of the elev- enth book Hector and the Trojans are aided by Zeus. To them he gave renown and victory in battle (298, 300, 318). The god as he looked down from Ida stretched the line of battle level for the combatants, and they kept slaying each other (336). Odysseus realized that Zeus was scattering the Danaans in flight and had left him alone in his struggle with the Trojans (xI, 406). It was by the intervention of Zeus that Agamemnon left the battle (xI, 278). Hector was under the especial care of Zeus in the eleventh book as he was in the battles around the wall and at the ships.' When the hero was in danger of falling in with Ajax, the deity roused dread in Ajax (xI, 544), as a result of which he cast away his shield and retired before Hector. Does not the promise given to Hector by Zeus in this part of the Menis and its fulfilment with the god's assistance show that the divine intervention is every- where uniformly present from the eleventh to the fifteenth book? In other parts of the Menis also Zeus intervened in the action. The poet tells us that the Trojans rushed to the ships, fulfilling 9 Cf. xII, 37-39, 174, 437; xIII, 1 674; xv, 231, 461.</page><page sequence="6">LEAF'S THEORY OF THE GODS 9 the behests of Zeus, who was ever rousing their great wrath, and .he took away the glory of the Argives; for Zeus was set on giving glory to Hector (xv, 594). Zeus transferred the victory from Ajax to the Trojans (xvi, 121). He enveloped the struggle of the combatants with dark night (xvi, 567). Many victims fell in battle when "Kronion" made fierce the fight (xvi, 661 f.). Zeus hung out his scales to decide whether Hector or Achilles should die (xxII, 219). He gave Hector to Achilles to be foully treated (xxii, 403). In the second stratum there are fewer instances of Zeus's active participation in the fight similar to those cited from the Menis. He is regarded as the dispenser of the battles of men (Iv, 84) and gives victory (v, 225). It is he who puts fury into the fight (vii, 210). In the third stratum we find the deity active in the struggle in a manner resembling that in the Menis. He balanced his scales to decide the fate of the combatants (viii, 69). He gave victory to Hector and destroyed the Greeks (viii, 175 f.; Ix, 118). He aroused the Trojans to battle (viii, 335) and forbade help to the Argives (viii, 414). The Greeks were subdued by Zeus (xII, 37). Hector was revived by him (xv, 242) and returned to battle (xv, 293). He urged the Trojans on to battle (xv, 567) and later dealt evil- ly with them (xviii, 292). Not only does Zeus take an active part in the battle in the Menis and in the expansions, but his attributes and functions are similarly expressed in all parts of the Iliad. Zeus was originally a sky god, as his epithets in the Iliad unmistakably show. These epithets are uniformly spread throughout the poem; for always Zeus is the supreme and practically the sole god in the physical world. The spiritual conception of the deity is also expressed by the poet in every book of the Iliad. The epithets that indicate Zeus as a sky god are not confined to the Menis or to any other part of the Iliad. These epithets10 are used twenty-four times in the Menis, seven times in the second stratum, and seventeen times in the third stratum. If the number of crude physical epi- thets applied to Zeus in the different parts of the poem is any 10 Such are craTEpor7T7s, pipYLKWpavvos, Eptope.LAT7s Eply0Vrog, KEXaLJveo', voeX?-yoEpkra, cTEpor?7yEppra, rEp~rLKopauvvo, Lp/EPEL77sr .</page><page sequence="7">10 THE CLASSICAL JOURNAL index to Homer's conception of the deity, we must conclude that Zeus is not viewed by the poet in a more exalted manner in the old part than in the second and third strata. It seems strange that Geddes" portrays Zeus in the Achilleid, which comprises some of Leaf's Menis, as crude and primitive,-a view which is contrary to that of Leaf. Zeus also has complete control of weather phenomena in all parts of the Iliad. In the Menis it is he who sends the thunder (xvI, 121), clouds (xvi, 298), mist (xvI, 365), rain (xI, 493; xvI, 385 f.), and night (xvi, 567). He sits on Mount Ida with a thunder- bolt in his hand (xI, 184). We find that Zeus is also the weather god in the secondl2 and third"3 strata. He is also the counselor in all parts of the poem. The epithet ti~r7Lra is applied to him in the Menis14 as well as in the second15 and third strata.16 There is no need to mention other characteristics of Zeus, as they, too, are common to all parts of the Iliad. We shall next inquire whether Athena takes part in the battle in the Menis and whether she appears on the earthly stage. Leaf tells us17 that the intervention of Athena in the first book of the Iliad (198) is a phenomenon visible to Achilles alone, as though to let us know that this is the way in which the gods speak to the mind of man. He suggests that this manner of appearance of a god to man occurs only in the Menis. We find, however, that in the Odyssey (xvI, 161) Athena appeared to Odysseus in the same way. The poet tells us that Telemachus did not see Athena before him, as she appeared to Odysseus alone, for the gods do not appear visible to all,-words almost identical with those used in the first book of the Iliad.'s This is not the way the gods act on the mind of man, as Leaf would have us believe. They guide men's minds in the 11 The Problem of the Homeric Poems: London, The Macmillan Co.

The advice which she gave Achilles had a far-reaching effect on the development of the action of the poem. She advised Achilles to revile Agamemnon and to hold himself aloof from the battle (I, 210 f.)-advice which, if followed as Achilles said, would bring longing for him on the sons of the Achaeans one and all. Despite what Leaf says, Athena became a participant in the battle in the Menis. She saved Odysseus from the spear thrust of Socus (xi, 438). When she was not an active participant in the combat, she was occupied with the outcome of the contest and kept urging against Hector the day of destiny at the hands of Achilles (xv, 613 f.). She interfered in the battle at the ships by lifting the cloud of mist and letting the light come from all sides upon the combatants (xv, 668). In the Menis we find her actually appearing on the earthly stage and taking an active part in the fight. She bore the aegis and passed dazzlingly through the ranks of the Achaeans, arousing them to battle (11, 446-451). In book xxii Athena darted down from heaven and became a participant in the contest between Hector and Achilles. Leaf says20 that she appeared for a moment to bring Hector to a stand before Achilles. In reality she remained until Hector was slain. She came and stood beside Achilles (xxii, 214-223) and advised him to stand and take breath until she persuaded Hector to confront him in fight. She next ap- peared to Hector in the likeness of Deiphobus and treacherously persuaded him to fight with Achilles. When the combatants en- gaged in fight and Achilles hurled his spear over Hector's head, Athena caught it up and gave it back to Achilles (xxii, 276 f.). It was Athena who slew Hector by the hand of Achilles. This is one of the most repulsive acts in the poems. Is this an instance of the 19 Hera put a thought into the mind of Achilles (1, 55) and of Agamemnon (viii, 218). The gods breathe the joy of battle into the hearts of warriors (xIII, 82. Cf. Ix, 703; xiii, 55). Zeus gives an excellent understanding to men (xIII, 732). Zeus's will revived Hector (xv, 242). 20 Iliad, iI, xii.</page><page sequence="9">12 THE CLASSICAL JOURNAL appearance of a god "to let us know what are the powers which control mankind from heaven"? The action in this part of the Menis is not purely human, as Leaf says. It is engineered more evidently than any other action in the whole Iliad by the super- natural interference of Athena. As Jebb says, The supernatural agency is an organic part of the Iliad; the Homeric Achilles slays Hector with the aid of Athena; we are not logically justified in eliminat- ing Athena and still affirming as a fact that a Greek hero named Achilles slew a Trojan hero named Hector.21 It was the interference of Athena that made the pursuit of Hector possible.22 In the second stratum Athena took the likeness of Laodocus as she had taken the likeness of Deiphobus in the Menis and per- suaded Pandarus to break the truce (Iv, 87). She urged the Greeks to fight against the Trojans (Iv, 439; viI, 17). She guided the weap- on of Diomedes to the face of Pandarus (v, 290). She communed with Apollo how they might bring the battle to an end (viI, 33). In the third stratum she armed herself for battle to help the Greeks (vIII, 384 f.). She put the aegis around Achilles' shoulders (xvIII, 203) and kindled a blazing fire about his head (xvIII, 227). In the likeness of a man, as in the Menis and the second stratum, she assisted Achilles in his fight with the river (xxI, 284 f., 304). There is little doubt that the character of Athena is uniformly presented in all parts of the Iliad. We do not find in any part of the poem anything of a primitive character attached to her. Her worship was universal in the Greek world long before Homer's time. In the Iliad she is the goddess of war but is never associated with the cruel lust of battle as Ares is. Nowhere in the poem does she appear to have anything to do with morality, nor is there any profound or religious thought attached to her. Her character in the Menis is the same as in the rest of the poem. At her very first appearance in the Iliad we find her giving advice to Achilles which is morally wrong. She urged him to revile Agamemnon and prom- ised that he would receive gifts for his anger. At her suggestion 21 Classical Greek Poetry: New York, Houghton, Mifflin and Co. (1893), 41. 22 Cf. S. E. Bassett, Transactions of the American Philological Association, LXI (1930), 138.</page><page sequence="10">LEAF'S THEORY OF THE GODS 13 Pandarus broke the truce. The two most reprehensible acts of the poem, the slaying of Dolon and Hector, are to be attributed to her. She showed an extreme partisanship for the Greeks in her every act throughout the Iliad. In the Menis she rebuked Zeus for his intention of saving Hector, whose death had been long be- fore decreed (xxII, 177-181).As a result of her rebuke Zeus entrust- ed the fate of Hector to her and bade her not to draw back. He gave her her own way, and was kind to her (xxII, 184). Zeus did not mention the fulfilment of Hector's destiny. Athena cannot be re- garded here as representing the divine will, as the deities of the Homeric Greeks were definitely anthropomorphic and their per- sonalities were individually defined.23 The goddess never slays an enemy in any part of the poem; her customary method is to breathe might and power into others and use them for accomplish- ing her ends. Everywhere in the poem she is represented as a counselor, friend, and enemy. In no part of the Iliad is anyone compared with her. Women are compared with Aphrodite and Artemis for beauty, but never with Athena. What has been said of the activities of Zeus and Athena in the Menis may also be said of those of Apollo. This god plays a very active part in the battle in the Menis. He sent a plague amongst the Greeks in answer to the prayers of his priest. This plague and its consequences not only intensified the quarrel between Aga- memnon and Achilles but was attended with evil results for the whole Greek army. Apollo appears on the earthly stage in the Menis and takes part in the battle. He saved Hector when he was knocked down by Diomedes (xI, 364). He healed Glaucus' wound (xvi, 528) and put courage into the warrior's heart so that he returned again to the fight. He was chiefly instrumental in the saving of Troy from the Greeks (xvi, 700). He stood on the walls of Troy and prevented Patroclus from storming it. In the form of Asius he exhorted Hector to battle (xvi, 716). Having done this, he passed amongst the combatants and inspired the Argives with dread, but gave renown to the Trojans and Hector (xvi, 730). Perhaps he was still in the form of Asius and hidden in a mist when he struck and stunned Patroclus (xvI, 788). The god loosed 23 Cf. W. F. Otto, Die Altgriechische Gdttersidee: Berlin (1926), 10.</page><page sequence="11">14 THE CLASSICAL JOURNAL Patroclus' corslet (xvi, 804) so that Euphorbus might strike him with his spear. In another part of the Menis he appeared on the earthly stage and warned Hector not to challenge Achilles to fight (xx, 375). Later when Hector was wounded by Achilles, Apollo picked him up and hid him in a thick mist (xx, 443 f.). He again prevented the capture of Troy by inspiring Agenor with strength to defend the city (xxI, 545). The god, concealed in a mist, re- mained near at hand to ward off death from Agenor, and when Agenor was wounded by Achilles, he shrouded him in a mist and took his place before Achilles (xxI, 596 f.). In the second stratum Apollo interferes in the fight in a similar manner. He was ever ready to help the Trojans (Iv, 507-513). He saved Aeneas from Diomedes (v, 344, 433), as he saved Agenor from Achilles in the Menis, and made a wraith like Aeneas over which the Trojans and Greek fought (v, 449). The same god as- sisted Hector when wounded by Ajax (vii, 272). In the third stra- tum of the Iliad we do not find his concern for the Trojans differ- ing from that of the Menis and second stratum. He was ever anxious for the safety and success of Hector and his men (xv, 243, 360; xxIII, 188; xxIv, 18). It may accordingly be said that Apollo, contrary to Leaf, takes just as active a part in the Menis as in the second and third strata. Apollo is the god of prophecy in all parts of the Iliad. He trans- mits the will of Zeus to men by such external signs as the flight and cries of birds. These are the principal methods of divination with which the poem is acquainted and they are ordinarly associ- ated with Apollo 24 The poem knows also of places in which the oracles of the gods were given.25 Other means of communicating the divine will through Apollo in the Iliad are by augurs,2 interpre- tation of dreams,27 and soothsaying.28 There is no doubt that the Iliad in all its parts is acquainted with oracular deliverances, as the expression Oeorpoort' means the inspired sayings of some seer or 24 Cf., however, F. C. Welcker [Griechische Gotterlehre: Gbttingen, Dieterich (1857- 72), II, 11], who cites II.

The meaning of this epithet is not clearly known. Its connection with oa0os is doubtful.32 There is no indication in Homer that Apollo was considered the god of light. Paean is another epithet that is applied to Apollo. It was, according to Nilsson, at first associated with the god of healing, Paieon, a deity distinct from Apollo.33 The significance of the word Paieon as 'physician' cannot be separated from its other meaning 'song,' for the art of healing consisted in magical ceremonies, puri- fications, and incantations which in early times were called paeans. Homer speaks of the god of healing, Paieon (II. v, 401, 899), who takes his name from these functions.34 In Homer paean, mean- ing 'song,' is mentioned in connection with Apollo and must have arisen in some sort of association with the god.35 In the Iliad the Achaeans sing two types of paeans, the paean of thanskgiving and the battle paean (I, 473, xxii, 391). Apollo throughout the Iliad is a fully developed god and is the most idealistic creation of Greek polytheism. The bow, which may be reminiscent of very early times, is his constant attribute in the poem. His most prominent function is that of a war god. He is also the god of music (I, 603). Leaf's statement that Apollo does not appear on the earthly stage in the Menis is not true, nor 29 I, 84, 87, 109, 385; II, 322; vi, 438; xi, 794; xvi, 36, 50. 30o I, 106; v 150; xii, 244; xxIv, 220. 31 I, 443; xv, 221; xx, 68. 32 Perhaps Phoibos was an ancient divinity whose worship Apollo took over.

The three divinities whose functions and powers have been dis- cussed play the most active r6les in the Iliad. The other gods per- form almost negligible parts in the poem. Some of the Homeric pantheon, such as Ares, Aphrodite, and Hephaestus, are crude and undeveloped, and are concerned with nothing in the Iliad outside of their own especial provinces. Ares, the god of war, participates in the battles (Iv, 439). He is always treated by the poet with the utmost disrespect. His name is sometimes used for the word "war." He is called a curse and a bane to mortals by the poet in the Menis (xI, 295) just as in the rest of the poem. The warriors killed in the conflict are said to satiate Ares with blood (xxII, 267). The poet's conception of Ares is expressed at the end of the fifth book of the Iliad, where Zeus tells him that he is the most hateful to him of all the gods who dwell in Olympus, and that he ever loves strife and wars and battles. The poet also shows that he is almost completely lacking in divine power by representing him as being imprisoned in a bronze vessel for thirteen months (v, 385 f.). He is elsewhere in the poem treated with the same disre- spect by the poet, as when Athena caught up a large stone and hit him on the neck and knocked him to the ground (xxI, 406). Aphrodite is not treated much better by the poet. We see from the Iliad that she has little divine power. She is much less active than Ares in the struggle, but does take part in it.36 Homer calls her a cowardly goddess. He says that she is no Athena or waster of cities (v, 333). She is the goddess of love. Zeus tells her to hold aloof from the battle and to attend to her own tasks of wedlock (v, 427-429). The poet is here expressing the conception of the goddess of his own time. His disrespect for Ares and Aphrodite is again shown when in the fifth book of the Iliad he represents them as being wounded in battle by Diomedes. When Aphrodite led Ares out of the battle (xxi, 431), Athena attacked her and smote her with her stout hand. The poet had this association of Ares and Aphrodite in mind when he placed them in the ignominious situa- tion in which we find them in the Odyssey. Leaf calls these two 36 III 380; v, 312, xIv, 188-192; xx, 40.</page><page sequence="14">LEAF'S THEORY OF THE GODS 17 gods the great powers of heaven.37 As a matter of fact, the contrary seems to be true. Of all the members of the Olympian pantheon, possibly excepting Artemis, Ares and Aphrodite seem to have least divine power. According to the same critic, these gods enter the action of the poem not earlier than the second expansions, when the gods of Olympus were treated with less respect than in the old part of the poem.38 No proof can be found in the Iliad that the gods are treated with more respect in one part of it than in another. We are told that the free handling of things divine in the twenty- first book of the Iliad is pushed into the region of burlesque.39 This burlesque treatment of the gods is not common to the ex- pansions alone. It is to be found in the Menis as well.40 Disaffec- tion and plotting against Zeus by the other gods are to be found in the Menis (I, 400), for which parallels can be found in the third stratum (viii, 351-380; xIII, 351). There are examples of the exag- gerated and of the hyperbolic in every part of the Iliad. When Zeus waves his locks, Olympus shakes (I, 528-530). He is able to dislodge all the other divinities from their seats (I, 580). Hephaes- tus falls from Olympus for a whole day (I, 592). Zeus boasts that he can draw all the gods and earth into the heavens (vIII, 23 f.). Olym- pus quakes when Hera stirs upon her throne (viii, 199). Poseidon roars as loud as nine or ten thousand cry in battle (xIv, 148). He goes with swift steps from the ships and makes the hills tremble and the woodland, and with four strides reaches Aigae (xIII, 18 f.).41 These examples from all parts of the Iliad show that there is very little difference in the theological conceptions of the poet in the supposed earlier and later portions of the poem. It is difficult to understand what Leaf means when he says that the interference of the gods in the Menis is such as becomes the rulers of the world. It cannot be interpreted in any other way than that the gods in the Menis are on a higher plane than in the second and third strata. Contrary to this theory, we find in the 7 Iliad, II, xiii. 38 Ibid. 39 Leaf, Iliad, ii, xiv. 40 Cf. II. I, 531-611; xIv, 153-350; xv, 1-148; xviII, 369-617; xxI, 385-514; Od. Iv, 351-570; viii, 255-369; xII, 374-390. Cf. Nestle, "Anflinge einer G6tterburlesque bei Homer," Neue Jahrb. far Philog., xv, 161-182. 41 Cf. v, 744, 770, 859-861; xIv, 272; xv, 19.</page><page sequence="15">18 THE CLASSICAL JOURNAL Menis that Zeus is represented as being capricious and cruel. He assisted Hector against his enemies and gave him fame, glory, and every assurance of victory, yet finally gave Athena permission to kill him at the hands of Achilles, and after his death gave him to Achilles to be foully treated. This is surely not a higher conception of the deity than that of the rest of the poem, from which similar examples may be cited. Not only is it true that Zeus is a partisan in the battles in the Menis, but he is even more busily engaged in the action of this part of the poem than in the second stratum; and in proportion to the length of the Menis and the third stratum his activities in the battle are greater in the former than in the latter part of the poem. Contrary to Leaf's theory, a careful study of the Iliad shows that the activities and functions of the gods are the same in all parts of the poem. The gods appear on the earthly stage and take part in the action in the Menis as well as in the expansions. It would seem that there is no justification for Leaf's three divisions of the Iliad.</page></plain_text>
