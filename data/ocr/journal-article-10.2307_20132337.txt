PROCESS STATEMENT "Ode: Salute to the New York School" is a cento, a late Roman verse form made up of lines from other sources. First, I put together a chronological bibliography of over one hun dred books published by NewYork poets from 1950 to 1970. Many of these books are deeply out of print so I had to do some real digging. Then I extracted one line from each book to compose the cento. Happily, Clark Coolidge and Larry Fagin supplied the lines from the books I couldn't find. The cento also works as an index to the bibliography. The combined bib liography and cento form the libretto to a musical work for the composer Richard Alan Applebaum. My intention was to make what I call a "performing bibliography." Since this is, in effect, what most of us do on a daily basis-referring to or 126 - MississiPPi REVIEW FALL 2003</page><page sequence="17">performing what we've read it seemed a useful metaphor to describe how we enact our reading practice. My idea was that a simple accompaniment to a series of bibliographic en tries could generate both scholarly information and an emo tive effect. I wanted to express the latent desire for lists and order, and to create a texture to accommodate the eros in herent in research. What I learned along the way is that liter ary movements survive primarily in the ruins of the texts they leave behind rather than in the unified literary histories that we create for them after the fact.
