<plain_text><page sequence="1">The name 'Hermathena' by L. J. D. Richardson There can hardly be a scintilla of doubt but that the name of the new journal was of R. Y. Tyrrell's choosing. Of the four members of the initial Hermathena Committee Tyrrell was the youngest, having won his Fellowship in 1868; but it was, significantly, to Tyrrell that would-be contributors were directed to address their communi cations. Tyrrell had, in 1871, at an unusually early age, become the second to hold the then recently established Professorship of Latin, and his first contribution to the first Part of the first Volume of Hermathena begins with the word 'Hermathena'. His paper was also, incidentally, the beginning of his long line of articles on Cicero's Letters (which culminated later, in partnership with L. C. Purser, in the great Dublin edition of Cicero's Correspondence). But to return to the circumstances of Tyrrell's first article. It opens with a quotation from a letter of Cicero (traditionally num bered 1.1.) in which he thanks his wealthy friend Atticus for sending him the gift of a Hermathena. In a previous letter (1.4) Cicero had warmly welcomed Atticus' offer and his promised intention to send him this gift to adorn his library. And now, the promise fulfilled, Cicero writes what becomes Tyrrell's first cited Letter, beginning with the key-word 'Hermathena', (1.1) 'Hermathena tua valde me delectat', a phrase which could also be aptly adopted nineteen and a half centuries later to convey a symbolic salutation to the newly launched periodical named 'Hermathena'. But what is this Ciceronian Hermathena? In Greek literature we often find mention of what appear at first blush to be busts of two gods, with a composite name, standing on the one rectangular pedestal, e.g. Hermanubis, Hermeros, Hermares, Hermeracles, Hermopan, Hermaphroditus. But the god Hermes may not come into all these combinations or in time may have ceased to be rele vant in some. Hermes' original role was as a tutelary deity of bound ary marks, consisting usually of cairns of piled up stones (see e.g. 13</page><page sequence="2">L. J. D. Richardson W. K. C. Guthrie, The Greeks and their gods, pp. 8yf: M. P. Nilsson, 'he of the stone heap'). These landmarks later became more regularly compact as upright, and often anthropomorphic, columns of stone and were called 'Hermae' after the god. The Herma-part of Herma thena would thus be the pedestal, supporting a single head above, that of Athena. Even without this explanation, it may be that a verbal contamination arose between 'Hermes' and the quite unre lated Greek word £pMa, a 'prop' or 'support'. Most scholars now, I think, believe that, at least by the time of Cicero, a Hermathena is no more than a bust of the goddess Athena on a quadrangular pillar (herma). They are probably right. But at the same time, in view of Cicero's use, in connection with his Tusculan Villa, of the words 'Palaestra' and 'Gymnasium', in addition to 'Academy', for what we have above loosely called his 'Library', it is hard, after Athena's intellectual and literary influence as a prominent feature in his Villa has been given full play, not to admit the likelihood of a reminiscent aura of Hermes intruding as well, to preside over the more physical and athletic activities. I do not know how the name or word 'Hermathena' fared in the Dark Ages of Latin, but with the new Ciceronianism of the late fourteenth sixteenth centuries it comes into view again. For instance one Achille Bocchi, in his Symbolicarum quaestionum de universo genere quas serio ludebat libri quinque (Bononiae, 1555), adopted it as an emblem for his Academy and in some mysterious way linked it with the proverb festina lente. Vicenzo Cartari, in his book Le imagini (Venice, 1556), which treats of i dei de gli antichi, naturally included 'Herma thena'. This work must have been very popular, for it went through many editions and reprintings down to 1674, with also editions in French under the title Les images des dieux from 1610 to 1699. The same can be said of Marsilio Ficino, whose first collection of works, entitled Opera, et quae hactenus exstitere, et quae in lucem nunc primum prodiere omnia (Basle, 1576), and a second... operum, in quibus comprehenduntur ea quae ex Graeco in Latinum sermonem . . . transtulit, exemptis Platone et Plotino (Paris, 1641) contain references to Herma thena. Adamus Machovius is said to have published a Hermathena (Frankfurt, 1673), but the details are obscure. There was much perverse learning shown in this period. Perhaps the worst example of this is provided by a Brabander Jan van Gorp, Latinised as Ioannes Goropius Becanus. Pie published his main work in 1567 under the comprehensive name Origines Antwerpiae, a book containing 14</page><page sequence="3">The name ' Hcrmathena ' ten separate titles. After his death in 1580 his friend Laevinus Torren tius (Lieven van der Beken, Bishop of Antwerp) published post humously Becanus' Opera hactenus in lucem non edita, which consisted of six works, named seriatim as Hermathena, Hieroglyphica, Vertumnus, Gallica, Francica and Hispanica. All of these seem to be concerned with etymologies, mainly the deriving of Dutch words from Latin or Greek. Yet this array of scholarship is completely deceptive and nugatory, as is shown when in his Hermathena (p. 224) Becanus makes the common Greek word for leaf—tpOAAov (phyll-on) 'by anagram to give' the Dutch ioof' (= English 'leaf'). Not only is this nonsense, but the anagram is not a true one, or at least not an exact one. As a pleasing contrast to these futilities is the Hermathena Papyrii Gemini Eleatis (seu Eloquentiae Victoria). This is an Allegory dedi cated to Richard Pace, chief secretary to King Henry VIII, and dated 3 February 1522. The theme is the ultimate victory of Wisdom (Jupiter's daughter) and her child Eloquence who had been captured and kept in bondage by Sloth. Eloquence escapes and with the help of Persuasion manages to win Jupiter and other gods to their side. Sloth's allies are such other abstractions as Negligence, Obstinacy, Opinion, Accidie together with certain nobles, women, philosophers, sophists and lawyers. There are legal battles and some very lively debates. Julius Caesar, Cicero and Servius Sulpicius (viz. Rufus) intervene with speeches. In the end Wisdom is released and brought by her daughter Eloquence to Britain. She is welcomed there by 'the most blessed Prince' (Henry VIII) and is again held in great reverence among the people. This Hermathena makes good, though difficult, reading, and it has fortuitous contacts with Ireland in its later history. That history may be found even more interesting than the Hermathena itself. It was a very early publication of the Cambridge University Press, from which it was issued on 8 December 1522 (title page, ex praeclara Cantabrigia: cum gracia et privilegio; and the final imprint, impressum in alma Cantabrigia per me loannes Siberch: Anno Domini M.D. XXII. viij. Decembris; with printer's emblem as colophon). The Allegory must have been already known (? in manuscript or in petto) and held in high esteem in Cambridge, for the university had brought the Italian printer Siberch to Cambridge to do the printing; it was in the press for the greater part of 1522. Possibly some political motive lay behind this zeal. (Henry VIII's later benefactions to Cambridge must be remembered, e.g. his 15</page><page sequence="4">L. J. D. Richardson establishment of five regius professorships and the founding of Trinity College itself.) Very few persons indeed would be now acquainted with the Hermathena of Geminus had it not been for the expert interest of that great bibliophile Henry Bradshaw. Being a keen student of early printing he sought examples of primitive methods of correcting proofs for the press and in this pursuit he found small variations in type and lay-out in the Hermathena. This led him in 1886 to publish a reproduction in exact facsimile of the well-preserved copy in the Library of St John's College, Cambridge. He found three successive states of the first sheet, and includes further facsimiles, with notes, of two title-pages in different proofs (in addition to the variant title-page of his main reproduction). This volume of facsimiles and comments thereon was printed under the original title by the Clays of Cambridge, for Alexander Macmillan and Robert Bowes, book sellers, and is now itself a rare item. My copy is numbered 88 (out of 150). The library of T.C.D. also possesses a copy. It is interesting to note that Bradshaw's illustration of the third state of the title page, which was reproduced from the copy printed on vellum in the then Duke of Devonshire's library, had previously visited Ireland. Two former owners had inscribed their names on it. At the top of the page, left, is written 'S. Geo: Clogher 3s gd' (see illustration). This is St George Ashe, Fellow of T.C.D. 1679, Provost 1692, Bishop consecutively of Cloyne 1695, Clogher 1697, Derry 1716.1 The other signature is lower down and across the page. 'William Brereton' possibly one of the three William Breretons listed, all at feasible dates, in Burtchaell and Sadleir's Alumni Dublinenses. I know of only five copies of the original Hermathena of Papyrius Geminus, respectively in the British Museum (in the Catalogue entered under Geminus and described as 'imperfect, wanting the last leaf containing the colophon and a woodcut; without pagination; title-page and other portions of the book mutilated'), in St John's College, Cambridge, in fine condition, title-page in second state, and, now of unknown locus, Bradshaw's own copy, first state of title-page, and the copy of St George Ashe (and later of the ninth Duke of Devonshire), third state. There is also a copy, very recently reported to me, to my chagrin in absence from Ireland, in Marsh's Library, Dublin. Mention of Henry Bradshaw leads me to advertise a correction which concerns him and Hermathena. In Hermathena, No 31 (1905) I. George Berkeley was ordained by Ashe, and later accompanied his son on an educational continental tour, 1716-20. i6</page><page sequence="5">The name ' Hermathena' rfi Uv PAPYRII GEMINI ELEATIS HERMATHENA, D« Eloquence Vufloria, AD LECTOREM Non mihiMufapares,genitor no dulc/s Apollo, Ruraq3Cecropidum,ncc raoenia celfa Quirini.

Richardson there are ten pages of very important, but unhappily posthumous, letters from Henry Bradshaw on 'Irish (that is, the native language) typography'. But these may easily escape notice, not merely because in J. G. Smyly's valuable Index of Contributors the last word in that title was misprinted 'Topography', but much more so because Bradshaw does not appear in his alphabetical place in that Index, but under the name of T. K. Abbott. Abbott had waited for fifteen years before he received permission from executors to publish these letters. This delay therefore was not Abbott's fault; but again it is unfortunate that in the table of contents of Hermathena, No 31 Abbott's name did not appear (though the position is made clear in the sub-title on p. 515). Finally, a use has been made of the title 'Hermathena' in modern times by the Dutch publishing and book-selling firm Menno Hertz berger and Co. (Eemnesserweg 81, Baarn). The head of the firm has kindly informed me that he issued, between August i960 and February 1968, nine numbers of a 'Bulletin for book collectors' under the name 'Hermathena'. I wish to express my thanks to Professor Stanford for making several helpful suggestions. For further information about Becanus (Goropius) see the article and bibliography by Dr E. F. Frederickx in Hermeneus, forty-third year (1971-1972): No 3, January 1972, on which I have myself gratefully drawn. i8</page><page sequence="7"></page><page sequence="8"></page><page sequence="9"></page></plain_text>
