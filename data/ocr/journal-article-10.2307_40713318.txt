<plain_text><page sequence="1">DECIPHERING ETOWAH'S MOUND C: THE CONSTRUCTION HISTORY AND MORTUARY RECORD OF A MISSISSIPPIAN BURIAL MOUND Adam King When Lewis H. Larson, Jr. began work on Etowah's Mound C in 1954, he was faced with a mound remnant. The summits and part of the inner core had been removed by the unsystematic digging of previous excavators. Despite the difficult conditions, Larson's careful excavations recorded invaluable information about Mound C and its now famous mortuary record, which lay largely undisturbed along the flanks and base of the mound. In this paper, I use data collected primarily by Larson to present the construction history of Mound C and discuss the implications of the dating and distributions of copper plates and shell gorgets within the mound. The Etowah site (Figure 1), along with Mound ville and Cahokia, is often considered one of the "big three" Mississippian mound centers - those large and impor- tant places that have figured prominently in our understanding of Mississippian chiefdoms. Not being on the same scale as Moundville and Cahokia, Etowah qualifies for inclusion in this group because of Mound C and its contents. Three separate excavation projects spanning 78 years removed some 366 burials from Mound C, along with one of the most impressive col- lections of Southeastern Ceremonial Complex (SECC) goods ever found. This collection has played and con- tinues to play a key role in our ever-changing undertand- ing of Mississippian elites, ranking systems, prestige goods exchange, and artistic expression. Lewis H. Larson, Jr. directed the most recent and thorough of the Mound C excavations (Larson 1971, 1989, 1993, this issue; see also Brain and Phillips 1996 and King 2003). Larson's exacting work anchors the earlier and less detailed investigations to modern archaeology, and makes the entire Mound C data set accessible to modern scholars. I use that data set to re- construct the burial and building history of Mound C as well as discuss the implications of the dating and dis- tribution of a limited set of the SECC goods interred in the mound - copper ornaments and shell gorgets. The interpretations I present also serve to highlight the importance of the contributions of Lewis H. Larson, Jr. to chiefdom studies in the Southeast. Excavations at Mound C As anyone who has ever listened to George Stuart or Dan and Phyllis Morse talk about their experiences working at Mound C knows, the history of the Mound C excavations alone makes a fascinating story (Editor's note: see papers by Stuart, and Morse and Morse in this issue). Besides making a great story, that history also highlights just how important Lewis Larson's contribu- tion has been to Southeastern archaeology. Excavations at Mound C began in 1884 with the work of John Rogan (Thomas 1894). Rogan focused on a small area of the mound's summit and recovered 11 burials accom- panied by copper plates and other elaborate grave goods. As might be expected, Rogan's recording and recovery techniques left a lot to be desired. Between 1925 and 1927, Warren K. Moorehead (1932) conducted more extensive excavations at the mound, using recording and recovery techniques only marginally better than his predecessor. Still focusing on the summits of the mound, Moorehead recovered somewhere around 111 more burials and associated SECC goods (see also Brain and Phillips 1996). By the time young Lewis Larson returned to the mound in 1954, the popular conception was that most of the burials had been removed (see Moorehead 1932:87). Larson's task was to clean up the mess left by Rogan and Moorehead so that Mound C could be reconstructed as part of a new state park. Of course, it did not take long before the archaeological community discovered that there was a great deal left in Mound C. Between 1954 and 1961, Larson's crews recorded an additional 244 burials, many with SECC goods (see Brain and Phillips 1996; Larson 1971; King 1996). When Larson began his work at Mound C, he was faced with a remnant with the summits and part of the inner core removed by the unsystematic digging of Moorehead and Rogan. Despite the difficult conditions, Larson's careful excavations recorded invaluable in- formation about Mound C and its now famous mortuary record, which lay largely undisturbed along the flanks and base of the mound. The careful work done by Larson makes it possible to reconstruct the history of Mound C and begin to make sense of its mortuary record. Construction and Burial Sequence Based on my examination of Larson's excavation records, I have argued that Mound C was built in seven 153</page><page sequence="2">SOUTHEASTERN ARCHAEOLOGY 23(2) WINTER 2004 Figure 1. Plan map of the Etowah site. construction stages (King 1996).1 The first three date to the Early Wilbanks phase (A.D. 1250-1325) and the last four were built during the Late Wilbanks phase (A.D. 1325-1375) (Figure 2). Each of the first three stages were built and used with a remarkable degree of consistency. In each case, a mound stage was constructed, its flanks and summit were used for burial, and a palisade wall surrounded the entire set of features. The fourth stage was a departure from the regularity of the first three. It began with the placement of three burials on the northern periphery of Stage 3. These three graves, including the elaborate Burial 57, were then covered with a small lobe of earth appended to the northern edge of Mound C. The existing palisade line was extended to incorporate this new addition. The fifth stage represented a return to the pattern seen in Stages 1 to 3. A new mantle of earth was placed over the entire surface of Mound C, including the lobe, and burials were placed along the flanks and at the base. As before, a palisade wall surrounded the entire set of features. Sometime after the completion of the palisade wall, another elaborate burial was placed along the northern periphery of Mound C. This was Larson's Burial 38, which contained the remains of five individuals, each with impressive burial goods. Over Burial 38 another lobe was built, and the same fill was placed along the flanks of the mound as well. The lobe and associated flank fills represent Stage 6. Like before, a palisade wall enclosed Mound C, and its flanks and base were used for burial. Eventually, the lobe over Burial 38 and other burials along the base of the mound again were covered by a new construction effort - Stage 7. After this addition, a palisade line once again surrounded the entire mound. With the completion of Stage 7, mortuary activities at Mound C all but ceased. Only one burial, Larson's Burial 15, containing the stone statues, was interred after Stage 7 was built. While this general construction sequence seems fairly clear, it has proven difficult to associate all burials with individual construction stages. This problem has thwarted efforts to fully analyze the Mound C mortuary record, and it can be attributed directly to the recording and recovery techniques used by Rogan and Moorehead. Despite this problem, Larson collected enough informa- tion to distinguish Early from Late Wilbanks graves in Mound C, both in terms of space and burial form. 154</page><page sequence="3">DECIPHERING ETOWAH'S MOUND C Early Wilbanks Phase Stage 1 Stage 2 Stage 3 Late Wilbanks Phase Stage4 ""• '*' : : : ; Stage 5 Stage B 6 '" o *' B o Stage 7 Wall-Trench Palisade Single-Set Post Palisade Figure 2. Proposed construction stages of Mound C. The plan map of Larson's Mound C excavations clearly shows that the flank burials occur in two spatially discrete rings (Figure 3). The innermost of the two rings is associated spatially and stratigraphically with the first three construction stages, which were built during Early Wilbanks times. The outermost ring is connected strati- graphically to the last four, Late Wilbanks stages. The situation with the burials that were placed into the summits of Mound C, and encountered by Rogan and Moorehead, is somewhat more complex. Many of these summit burials had elaborate sets of grave goods that were similar in some respects to assemblages found in the outer ring of the flank burials. This led Brain and Phillips (1996) to argue that those elaborate summit burials were contemporary with the Late Wilbanks burials on the flanks of Mound C. A composite profile of the excavations of Rogan and Moorehead (Figure 4), created by Brain and Phillips, shows that all the summit burials were recorded about 3 to 4 meters from the final summit surface. This depth suggests to me that those burials actually were associ- ated with the earlier Early Wilbanks construction stages. While deep burial pits are not unknown, it is difficult to imagine that the builders of Mound C consistently exca- vated burial pits some 3 to 4 m into the summit surface, especially when it is remembered that those burials con- tained not only elaborate sets of grave goods but also large limestone slabs. The assignment of the summit burials to the Early Wilbanks phase becomes more compelling when it is combined with information on burial form. The inner ring of flank burials includes both simple pits and graves lined with limestone slabs. The outer ring contains either simple pits or log-lined graves. The presence of only simple pits and stone-lined graves on the summit suggests, like the inner ring of flank burials, that they are associated with the first three Early Wilbanks phase construction stages. Based on this information, it appears that both the flanks and summit of Mound C were used for burial during the Early Wilbanks phase, but by the Late Wilbanks, graves were not placed in the mound's summit. Instead, the richest burials were interred along the northern edge of the mound and were covered by small lobes or terraces. Artifact Distributions and Patterning This general dating scheme makes it possible to begin to explore the Mound C mortuary data for patterns. For this paper, I have attempted only to look for patterns in the distribution of shell gorgets and copper ornaments. An important point to keep in the mind is that many of the burials containing copper ornaments and shell gorgets also contained a wide variety of other items 155</page><page sequence="4">SOUTHEASTERN ARCHAEOLOGY 23(2) WINTER 2004 Figure 3. Plan map of Larson's excavations. (see Larson 1971; Moorehead 1932; Thomas 1894). Analysis of these items undoubtedly will make the picture presented below more complicated. Also important to bear in mind is the fact that information about the provenience of the shell gorgets and copper ornaments discussed below is taken from a secondary published source, Brain and Phillips (1996), not the original excavation records. Those records do exist for all three excavations, but their completeness and quality vary. Larson's documentation is the most complete, and there also is a substantial amount of information contained in notes and photos from Moorehead's work. Unfortunately, little remains of Rogan's efforts, except for some artifacts and the published description of the excavations. Although I did not consult these sources, such an effort will be critical to any complete examination of the Mound C mortuary record. Finally, age and sex identifications for the material excavated by Larson were compiled by Blakely (1995), while the same information for the remains exca- vated by Moorehead was determined by Erickson (1996) as part of a master's thesis. In the absence of more recent analyses, as with all of the material excavated by Rogan and a small number of burials investigated by Moorehead, I have used the identifications presented in the published reports (Moorehead 1932; Thomas 1894). Those identifications were limited to differentiating 156</page><page sequence="5">DECIPHERING ETOWAH'S MOUND C Figure 4. Composite profile from excavations of Rogan and Moorehead (From page 166 of Jeffrey P. Brain and Phillip Phillips, Shell Gorgets: Styles of the Late Prehistoric and Protohistoric Southeast.

The Map The map of Mound C burials I use to examine artifact distributions is a composite of the plans published by Rogan (Thomas 1894:Figure 185), Moorehead (1932: Figure 40), and Larson (1971:Figure 2; see also Brain and Phillips 1996:144). This composite is based on the one published by Brain and Phillips (Figure 5) but includes some improvements. Those improvements come mainly in more accurately orienting each of the grids relative to one another. In the Brain and Phillips version, all three excavation grids are aligned using Larson's grid north. The published versions imply that the grids used by Rogan and Moorehead, as imperfect as they are, were estab- lished using magnetic north. However, documents from Larson's excavations indicate that his grid north was established some 29.85 degrees west of north. By orienting all three grids to Larson's north, Brain and Phillips inadvertently rotated Rogan and Moorehead to the west. Also, while Brain and Phillips indicate that they used Moorehead' s placement of one of Rogan' s burials on his grid to link those two excavations (see Moorehead 1932:82-83), they do not make it clear how they linked Moorehead to Larson. In the Mound C documents collec- tion there is a map that places several of Moorehead's burials onto Larson's grid. It seems apparent that this is not what Brain and Phillips used. Although the fit between the unpublished Larson map and Moorehead's published excavation plan is not perfect, the burial placements do seem to link the two excavations reasonably well (Figure 6). The test of this match comes in looking at the distribution of burials in the southeastern corner of the mound excavations. On Larson's published map (Lar- son 1971:60 and Figure 3 in this paper), which we have every reason to believe is the most accurate, the outer part of the southeastern corner of the mound is identified as being excavated by Moorehead. Moore- head's profiles clearly indicate that he dug burials at the 157</page><page sequence="6">SOUTHEASTERN ARCHAEOLOGY 23(2) WINTER 2004 Figure 5. Composite of Mound C burial locations (From page 167 of Jeffrey P. Brain and Phillip Phillips, Shell Gorgets: Styles of the Late Prehistoric and Protohistoric Southeast. Peabody Museum Press. Copyright 1996 by the President and Fellows of Harvard College. Used by permission.) base of the last mound stage in this area (Figure 4). In the Brain and Phillips composite (Figure 5), that area where Moorehead apparently excavated and found burials is empty. In the new composite presented here, those burials that Moorehead's profiles indicate he dug at the southeastern corner of the mound actually appear there (Figure 6). While I feel like these changes improve the Mound C composite map, I labor under no illusion that this is the most accurate map that can be produced. However, I suspect that most of the improvements yet to come will not dramatically alter the patterns I identify in this paper. As work continues on the map, those improve- ments are likely to be made. For example, the Brain and Phillips composite actually only contains about half of the total number of burials excavated by Larson. I have no doubt that Brain and Phillips were aware of this limitation. A more complete map of Larson's excava- tions is being created, but is not ready for publication. While I do not think these omissions will impact my exploration of artifact patterns, largely because most of the burials left off the map had few if any artifacts, their absence presents a false picture of burial distributions in the mound. Shell Gorgets A total of 33 gorgets representing 11 different themes were recovered from 26 Mound C graves (Figure 7). The overwhelming majority of gorgets were recovered from Early Wilbanks phase burials. Just over three quarters of the graves with gorgets in Mound C contained adults, and the sex of those individuals is fairly evenly divided between men and women. 158</page><page sequence="7">DECIPHERING ETOWAH'S MOUND C Figure 6. Revised composite of Mound C burials. 159</page><page sequence="8">SOUTHEASTERN ARCHAEOLOGY 23(2) WINTER 2004 Figure 7. Age, sex, and phase association for all Mound C gorgets. When the distribution of particular themes is examined within Mound C, some interesting patterns emerge. The appreciation of these patterns requires the recognition of some spatial patterning apparent in the Late Wilbanks burials. Larson (1971) and later Brain and Phillips (1996:169-170) have noted that the final ring of burials at Mound C seems to contain discrete groupings or at least gaps that suggest the presence of groupings. Brain and Phillips argue that distinct clusters of burials were positioned at each of the corners of Mound C as well as in the two lobes appended to its northern side (Figure 6). Only three sets of gorgets were represented by enough individual pieces to allow for a meaningful interpreta- tion of their distribution. The first of these is the turkey cock theme of the Hightower style defined by Müller (1989) (Figure 8). Eight of these gorgets were recovered from five burials. The majority of these were found with women and children, and none were found with adult men. All came from Early Wilbanks contexts. When burials containing these gorgets are plotted, it becomes clear that they cluster (with one exception) along the northern quadrant of Mound C (Figure 9). The second set of gorgets I will consider consists of three different themes: annular, cruciform, and the triskele (Figure 10). I treat these as a group because they each co-occur with one another in burials in such a way as to suggest that they were linked. This group is represented by seven gorgets found in four burials, all of which date to the Early Wilbanks phase. Three of the four burials contained adult males, while the fourth contained an adult female. As a group, these gorgets cluster in the southern quadrant of Mound C (Figure 9). The third grouping I will consider is representative of the anthropomorphic theme of the Hightower style (Müller 1989), or what Brain and Phillips (1996) iden- tified as the Big Toco style (Figure 11). Eleven of these gorgets were found in eleven burials, all but two of which date to the Early Wilbanks phase. These gorgets are found primarily with adults, although one was buried Figure 8. Age, sex, and phase association for turkey cock gorgets. with a child, and are fairly evenly distributed between men and women. Rather than clustering in one quadrant of the mound, they seem to be more randomly dis- tributed throughout it (Figure 9). The first two sets of gorgets seem to hint that the same kind of clustering apparent in the Late Wilbanks burial set may be present in the Early Wilbanks burials. It is no doubt meaningful that one set is more closely associated with men, while the second set is more closely associated with women and children. Their distribution in space and across age and sex categories suggests that these gorgets may have been associated with specific statuses and /or specific corporate groups in Etowah's society. The third set, consisting of the anthropomorphic Hightower gorgets, does not cluster. Instead, those gorgets are found in each of the quadrants of the mound. Also, unlike the other two sets, these are more evenly distributed across age and sex categories. I suspect the anthropomorphic gorgets are symbols asso- ciated with another kind of status category that crosscuts other groupings present in the mound. Copper Headdresses In terms of copper ornaments, I limit my study to copper plates and other so-called copper cut-outs that Larson (1959, 1971) has shown were parts of elaborate headdresses interred with individual elites in Mound C. When decorated, copper plates exhibited four main themes: anthropomorphic, avian, the ogee, and the piasa. The cut-outs took the form of bi-lobed arrows, batons, maces, and bird parts such as talons, plumes, and wings. The occurrence of copper headdress elements remains fairly consistent from the Early to Late Wilbanks phases. The number of burials containing such artifacts de- creased with time from 19 in the Early Wilbanks to 16 in the Late Wilbanks phase. Because several graves containing multiple individuals were found in Late Wilbanks contexts, the number of people buried with copper headdress elements actually increased from 19 to 20 individuals. During both the Early and Late 160</page><page sequence="9">DECIPHERING ETOWAH'S MOUND C °cfàd CL la* Gorget Types A Annular-Cruciform-Triskele ■ Anthropomorphic • Turkey Cock N 0 10 20 30 feet ^L Figure 9.

Age, sex, and phase association for annular, cruciform, and triskele gorgets. Wilbanks phases, headdress elements were buried with adults and children, and men and women (Figure 12). Particular kinds of headdresses appear to be associ- ated with differing age and sex categories. Because there are few differences between the Early and Late Wilbanks burials here, I treat them as a group. During both phases, headdresses containing copper plates are associated with adult males and, to a lesser extent, children, but clearly not women (Figure 13). But headdresses contain- ing only cut-outs may be somewhat more closely associated with adult women (Figure 14). Headdresses containing the bi-lobed arrow seem to shift through time (Figure 15). During the Early Wilbanks, those headdresses are associated with women and children. By the Late Wilbanks, the bi-lobed arrow is combined with other elements and is clearly associated with adult males. It is tempting to suggest that a formerly female symbol was somehow co-opted by males. As Larson (1971) has argued, these headdresses appear to be parts of regalia owned by individual elites. I previously operated under the assumption that these were symbols of specific offices held largely by in- dividual men. Instead, these headdresses were found with men, women, and children, suggesting that they represent a more inclusive category whose members Figure 11. Age, sex, and phase association for anthropomor- phic hightower gorgets. Figure 12. Age and sex associations for copper headdress elements. were born with the right to belong. Rather than chartering the status of an individual, these headdresses seem to be used as symbols of a shared status. From the Early to Late Wilbanks phases, there also seems to be a shift in terms of the thematic content of decorated plates (Figure 16). During Early Wilbanks times, copper plates contained either anthropomorphic or avian depictions. By Late Wilbanks, the ogee all but replaces anthropomorphic representations and the piasa is added to the themes present. These all seem to be references to elements of the supernatural world. For example, Kent Reilly (2002) argues that the ogee is a portal leading from one world to another. Particularly prominent in the symbolism on Etowah's copper orna- ments is the "Birdman" or "Falcon Dancer" depicted on the anthropomorphic plates. James Brown (in press) makes the case that the Birdman thematically is connected to Red Horn or Morningstar, a supernatural character featured in a set of myths collected among the Osage and Omaha in the nineteenth century. This character is most clearly captured in the anthropomor- phic plates depicting the Birdman, but the mythology surrounding him also is closely associated with the bi-lobed arrow and birds of prey like the falcon. From the Early to Late Wilbanks phases, direct representations of the birdman on copper plates all but disappear, while references to portals to other Figure 13. Age and sex associations for copper plates. 162</page><page sequence="11">DECIPHERING ETOWAH'S MOUND C Figure 14. Age and sex associations for copper cut-outs. worlds come into vogue. This trend is reflected in the gorgets as well. All but two of the anthropomorphic Hightower gorgets, which likely depict the Birdman theme, were buried during the Early Wilbanks phase. I do not pretend to understand what this pattern means. It may represent a shift in the myths chartering elite status. It may represent some change in the ruling lineage at Etowah. Whatever it means, it clearly is significant to the history of Mound C and the social or political ranking structures at Etowah. Few of the really clear patterns apparent in the gorget data can be seen when burials containing headdresses with copper elements are plotted (Figure 17). In the Early Wilbanks burials, copper headdresses are distributed across all four quadrants. It seems likely that, like the gorgets, the headdresses were symbols of some social status the crosscut what I presume to be kin-based groupings. There is only one instance in which an individual was buried with both a copper headdress and an anthropomorphic Hightower gorget. The two sets of artifacts apparently represent different statuses or roles. In the Late Wilbanks ring of burials, one or two individuals in each of the spatial clusters have a head- dress with copper elements. This pattern seems to confirm the presence of discrete, somewhat redundant groupings. Again, headdresses with copper elements seem to be symbols of some social status that crosscut other kinds of social groupings. Observations A great deal of information is contained just in the distributions of copper ornaments and shell gorgets in Mound C burials. I am sure that most of that information will make a lot more sense once it is viewed in the context of a complete study of all aspects of Mound C's mortuary record. In the meantime, there are several observations I would like to offer. First, the use of space and distribution of artifacts in Mound C clearly is the result of a very complex web of Figure 15. Age, sex, and phase associations for headdresses with the bi-lobed arrow. social relationships. Some of those relationships may express hierarchy, but others likely refer to member- ship in kinship groupings, secret societies, and other sodalities. Mound C offers a glimpse into the social organization of elite status at Etowah, but that organi- zation is likely to be very complicated. Second, there are some clear thematic shifts in the symbolism used from the Early to Late Wilbanks phases. One of those shifts is the disappearance of the Birdman theme, both in shell and copper, and its replacement by the Ogee on copper plates. Another is the shift in asso- ciation of the bi-lobed arrow from women in the Early Wilbanks to men in the Late Wilbanks phase. As we learn more about what those symbols mean and how they were used, the importance of these shifts will become clearer. Finally, the distributions of graves, gorgets, and copper plates all suggest that there is some spatial patterning in the Mound C burials. During the Late Wilbanks, there may have been five discrete groupings of burials - one at each of the corners of the mound and a fifth centered on the lobe burials on the northern side. A similar situation likely existed during the Early Wilbanks, with four groupings located in each quadrant of the mound. I think an argument that these clusters represent kin-based groupings like lineages is not too speculative. Those familiar with recent interpretations of Mound- ville will note a similarity between the burial distribu- Figure 16. Themes represented in the copper plates. 163</page><page sequence="12">SOUTHEASTERN ARCHAEOLOGY 23(2) WINTER 2004 Figure 17. Distribution of copper headdress elements in Mound C.</page><page sequence="13">DECIPHERING ETOWAH'S MOUND C tions in Mound C and the arrangement of mounds at the Mound ville site. Several authors (Knight 1998; Peebles 1971) have argued that the paired mounds ringing Moundville's plaza were facilities associated with distinct corporate groups of the larger Moundville chief dom. Knight (1998) has argued that the size and layout of the mounds at Moundville mirror social relationships and that the plan of Moundville literally was a diagram of the chief dom' s social organization. It should come as no great surprise that the use of space in Etowah' s Mound C also mapped out social relationships and in some sense a world order (see Lewis and Stout 1998). Most of the details of that diagram, however, will be revealed only through a more thorough study of the Mound C mortuary record. Conclusion The Mound C mortuary data set is rich and very complex, and it clearly contains a wealth of informa- tion about Mississippian ranking structures and the production and consumption of SECC goods. Anyone familiar with the excavation of Mound C knows that the construction history of the mound itself is also very complex, and the field methods used by Rogan and Moorehead made its interpretation more difficult. Without Lewis Larson's careful excavation, recovery, and recording techniques, we would not be able to make sense of that complex construction history. Without an understanding of the context in which Mound C's famous SECC goods were found, it would not be possible to continue to learn from one of the Southeast's most significant data sets for a fuller understanding of Mississippian societies. Notes 1 In an unpublished manuscript in the author's possession, Larson argues that there were five construction stages. One difference lies in Larson's identification of the lobe over Burial 57 (Stage 4 in this paper) as part of Stage 3. The other stems from the fact that Larson does not recognize Stage 7 identified in this paper as a construction effort.
