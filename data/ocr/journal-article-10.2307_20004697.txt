<plain_text><page sequence="1">Rel. Stud. 3, pp. 499-512 . CHARLES E. SCOTT Professor of Philosophy, Vanderbilt University SCHLEIERMACHER AND THE PROBLEM OF DIVINE IMMEDIACY A problem which was widely recognised during Schleiermacher's life, and one which I think is not yet satisfactorily solved, concerned the integration of feeling' and concepts within human consciousness. Within the domain of philosophy of religion it may be phrased as follows: How does religious feeling relate to rational reflection such that each complements and enriches the other? Schleiermacher was convinced that religion never originates in human understanding or autonomy and that one's understanding of the world is not necessarily dependent on religious faith.2 But he was equally convinced that reflection and religion ought to enjoy a harmony which reflects the harmony of the universe, and this ideal motivated his con tinuous attempt to construct a complementary philosophy and theology. His hope was to show that 'understanding and feeling . . . remain distinct, but they touch each other and form a galvanic pile.... The innermost life of the spirit consists in the galvanic action thus produced in the feeling of the understanding and the understanding of the feeling, during which, however, the two poles always remain deflected from each other.'3 In order to effect this harmony between the immediacy of religious feeling and the mediation of thought, Schleiermacher, on his terms, had to show that the point of harmony, man's consciousness, is necessarily dependent on God. Thereby he could argue that all meaningful connections are dependent on God and that this dependence is an essential part of the conscious order. The side of his task on which I want to focus is the way in which he argues that man is necessarily dependent on God, and that means that I want to centre attention on his concept of immediacy, his ideas on how man is immediately present to himself and how God is immediately present to man. The content of these ideas, as well as their function in his philosophy of religion, are of prime importance, since on them hinge his success in avoiding a thoroughly humanistic anthropomorphism in religion 1 I use feeling as Schleiermacher developed the term in its non-emotive sense. This use should become clear as the discussion progresses. 2 The Life of Schleiermacher as Unfolded in His Autobiography and Letters, Vol. II, tr. F. Rowan, Smith, Elder and Co., i86o, p. 282.

After considering his understanding of these problems, I will argue that he was unable to achieve the kind of unity he wanted because he understood the feeling of absolute dependence to be, in the last analysis, independent of human action. As a result, his account makes impossible the kind of religious certainty which he projected as characteristic of religious people. I will also indicate a direction we can take which appreciates the importance of what I am calling the 'problem of divine immediacy' and which at the same time avoids the dilemma involved in Schleiermacher's own solution to the problem. I. FEELING AS A MODE OF IMMEDIATE ENCOUNTER Schleiermacher developed a philosophical, systematic demand for divine presence by arguing that the unity of human consciousness, by virtue of its limitedness, is not adequate by itself to explain the unlimited harmony of the universe. Further, the very recognition of our own conditionedness would be impossible, he contended, on the sole basis of the world and reason, since that recognition presupposes the difference between the conditioned and the Unconditioned which is not apparent within the world as we know it. The unlimited harmony of the universe and our recognition of it, given human limitations and lack of perfect harmony, point out that the world and human consciousness are grounded in a Perfection which trans cends all finite realities. His contention is that man, the world, and religious experiences cannot be adequately understood on philosophical terms if man cannot be shown to relate to God in a necessary and immediate way. No finite reality is self-explanatory, reason does not have the power for reliable induction from finite reality to the Unconditioned, and man, world, and religious experiences do not account fully for their finite totality and harmony. Without God's necessary presence to man, these phenomena lose not only their conditionedness, but also their meaning for religious self-consciousness.' Schleiermacher's systematic demand for divine presence, given his strictures concerning the possibility for a natural theology or a purely rational knowledge of God, places extraordinary emphasis upon his view of the immediacy of divine presence. He consistently denied that we can reason inductively to God's presence. In the first place our rational activity is not divine, as we have seen, and thus cannot grasp divine presence. Secondly, God cannot be known properly as a conceived object, since thereby he would lose his transcendence and would be conditioned by the 1 In order to proceed with the objective of this paper I will not develop Schleiermacher's extensive and often difficult statements supporting the summary points in this paragraph. The first part of the Dialektik, i.e. the Transcendental Deduction, as well as the following pages of Sdmmtliche Werke, System der Sittenlehre, may be referred to for material elucidating his contentions: pp. IO ff., 25-26, 47, 56, 72, 98, 125, 127</page><page sequence="3">SCHLEIERMACHER AND PROBLEM OF DIVINE IMMEDIACY 50I limitations of our reason. For example, on purely conceptual grounds one might think of God as a conditioned part of a system of thought, and thereby lose his unconditionedness; or one might incorporate the polar char acteristics of human knowing into God's being, thereby making him finite. Rather, from the point of view of philosophy, God can be conceived properly only as the possibility for systematic unity in such a way that the conditioned ness of knowledge is grounded and completed, in principle, in the uncon ditionedness of divine presence, and also in such fashion that the idea of God does not contradict what is known to be the case in the world.' A philosophical God-consciousness is not, then, a direct apprehension of God,2 and the burden on Schleiermacher is to show in what way we have an access to God that does not compromise his transcendence while also preserving his effective presence to man. In order to see clearly the nature of God's presence to man,3 we must first see how man relates immediately to himself and how this self-relation gives rise to a unique feeling. Fichte had argued that one is aware of himself only in the immediate intuitions which accompany his own actions. One's access to his transcendence and 'essence' is by means of those acts which originate not in the affairs of the market place or in some external influence, but in his own creativity which transcends both the market place and the objective domain of his understanding. One is aware of himself in his creative acts. Thus one's access to himself is in his own immediacy. If one begins with himself as he is viewed publicly or as he views himself in his public activity, one begins with his own product, not with his capacity for creating (or 'positing') himself. When he is distracted from his own imme diacy he is always at least once removed from the creative source of his own appearances. And any philosophy founded on appearances, and not on 'intuitions', will not be in a position to appreciate human freedom or the reality of creativity. Schleiermacher was impressed with Fichte's claims. But he was also aware of the difficulty of finding a meaningful access to the intuitions specified by Fichte. How can one relate to himself in such fashion that the immediate encounter is not destroyed? Further, he was keenly aware of the historical dimension of human existence, and he separated himself from all tendencies to conceive of immediate encounter as an a-historical domain. Immediate encounter, rather, must come within the life of human conscious ness in such a way that immediacy and mediation shed light on each other. Put into other terms, all immediate encounters are rational because they 1 See Dialektik, pp. 322, 328, 428. 2 Schleiermacher's Sendschreiben an Lucke, pp. 2I-22. 3 Although the philosopher of religion cannot legitimately speak of God, but only of the un conditioned, unless he speaks from piety, on Schleiermacher's terms, I use 'God', 'Unconditioned', and 'Infinite' interchangeably, since Schleiermacher speaks on the basis of Christian piety in his philosophy of religion. Where I deal with his strictly systematic position, I will usually not use 'God' in order to indicate that no purely religious claim is intended.</page><page sequence="4">502 CHARLES E. SCOTT are always integral to one's activities of coming to grips with himself and his world in conditioned, creative, imaginative, form-giving ways. Further, how one understands himself and his world, according to Schleiermacher, is dependent on the range of his sensitivity to his immediate encounters. If I think of myself solely in terms of what I want to do and how I want to act, I will not take account of my own capacity for intending, and my self-understanding as well as my view of the world will reflect this narrowed perspective. What I do and think will not be well integrated with my capacity for thinking and acting, and consequently what I do will be disproportionate to the state of affairs presupposed by my activity. Fichte himself was in an analogous situation because he ignored man's dependence on history. He developed a theory of man which left out the historicity of human transcendence. As a result he lacked an adequate appreciation for the relativity of man's place and time, and he had a one-sided view of man's independence and autonomy. Man's 'feeling of freedom" originates, according to Schleiermacher, in the finite unity of consciousness. We have an immediate awareness of ourselves as we unify and give organic meaning to the various aspects of our world, i.e. as we receive and amalgamate the plethora of perceptions, reactions, ideas, influences, etc. which make up the many sides and dimen sions of our consciousness. There is always some measure of unity in a man's consciousness. He always sees things from some perspective which gives direction and meaning to what he finds. His consciousness will be limited, as we have seen. It will exclude some things and include others in, perhaps, a bewildering way, but the very possibility of selectivity and relativity means that there is a tendency toward unity which keeps the mass of givens in some kind of organon, and that tendency may be understood as an over arching set of principles, inclinations, and interests which give one's consciousness an ineradicable stamp of individuality within a given historical context. One's consciousness is his own in a unique way, then, and that means that one is always active in giving unity to all that he receives. Man's primordial awareness of his unity and his unifying action is named the feeling of freedom by Schleiermacher, the feeling given with consciousness as one acts on and interrelates with what he finds. This feeling is the basis for one's specific consciousness of his own capacity to initiate, select, and create. The feeling is given in the sense that it does not rely on any particular set of ideas, but accompanies human activity in all cases. It can be ignored or overlooked, but it cannot be eliminated from human existence. Since the feeling of freedom originates with man's consciousness, and since human consciousness is always limited, it is always a feeling of man's limited autonomy.2 That is, if one is sensitive to this feeling, if he responds to it consciously and thus consciously relates to himself in terms of it, he 1 The Christian Faith, Sec. 3; Sendschreiben, p. I5. 2 Sittenlhere, p. 140.</page><page sequence="5">SCHLEIERMACHER AND PROBLEM OF DIVINE IMMEDIACY 503 will be conscious of his finite autonomy. The feeling, by virtue of its immediacy, transcends man's response to it and is distinct from his recog nition of it and conscious attention to it. But it also accompanies his con sciousness of it, providing as it were an effective tone which is now apparent and which is an harmonic base for the relevant themes of consciousness. Hence, its transcendence of consciousness is not an escape from the finitude of consciousness, but is the subjective expression of the free autonomy of one's finitude. It escapes consciousness only in the sense that it always accompanies conscious acts whether it is recognised or not. Its presence is not conditional on its being an object of consciousness. Hence, we could say that the feeling of freedom transcends conscious recognition because its presence is not dependent on recognition.' Clearly this immediacy of the self to itself is not an adequate basis for religious statements. The feeling of freedom does not transcend man's finitude, and all human actions are unable to capture or even behold what is infinite or unconditioned. Hence, the feeling of absolute dependence must, for Schleiermacher, be a bridge between man's finite creativity and the unconditioned creativity upon which he depends necessarily, and at the same time it must be a conditioned part of his own existence. The way Schleiermacher makes his way through these unmoveable claims, which we shall now consider, might be called an argument for unprovable certainty. The clue indicating the harmony of the universe for Schleiermacher is the harmony of human consciousness. An unharmonious universe is a contradiction and is inconceivable. As he puts it in his On Religion, 'The sense of the Whole must be first found, chiefly within our own minds, and from thence transferred to corporeal nature. . . . The Universe portrays itself in the inner life, and then the corporeal is comprehensible from the spiritual.'2 Religion, in this early work, is described as 'just the acceptance of each separate thing as a part of the Whole, of each limited thing as an exhibition of the Infinite'.3 But how is one to justify this kind of leap? While there is no inductive chain from finite to infinite, presupposing the sufficiency of reason to see into the unseen and to grasp the unconditioned, there is none the less a leap from the limited harmony of human consciousness to the unconditionedness of the infinite. To argue, as Schleiermacher does,4 that nature is accessible to man's drive for harmony does not eliminate the leap. That tells us something about man, as Schleiermacher saw, and perhaps something about the universe, but nothing about the infinite 1 The ramifications of Schleiermacher's concept of man's immediacy to himself are much more far reaching that I can indicate for the purposes of this article. R. R. Niebuhr's discussion of this topic in Schleiermacher on Christ and Religion, Scribners, 1964, Ch. II, sec. 5, is excellent and should be referred to by anyone interested in following Schleiermacher's thoughts through his many discussions of the self vis-2-vis feeling. 2 P. 7. 3 P. 279. 4Sittenlehre, pp. 175 ff.</page><page sequence="6">504 CHARLES E. SCOTT itself.' How, then, are we to come to believe that man is dependent upon what he cannot know without making the unknowable known? The feeling of freedom is a mode of awareness which involves the full range of our particular heritage and situation. It relates intrinsically to the unity of a person, his finite relationships, his particularity, and his communal bonds, and it always originates in one's situation in the world.2 As such it originates in the unity of consciousness-the important condition being that that unity always involves multiplicity in human consciousness.3 This feeling thus indicates to man his finitude and his part within the whole of things as he relates to them. It does not disclose his history to him, or the laws of nature, or the nature of reason. He will have to discover through other means what these factors are like. But the feeling of freedom, when recognised, does give man an overwhelming conviction that this unity in multiplicity is a reliable indication that all things enjoy an essential unity with his own actions, that harmony' is an essential characteristic of the universe. Schleiermacher can bolster his point by discussing in greater detail the nature of consciousness and autonomy, but he cannot go beyond the suggestiveness of this situation, as disclosed through feeling, in making claims about the universe.4 Wissen is Schleiermacher's term for the unified state of insight, knowledge, and conviction which best expresses the organon of human consciousness. In Wissen the suggestiveness of the organic nature of human consciousness gains the weight of conviction and is thus taken as an insight into the nature of things.5 Schleiermacher's statements about the feeling of absolute dependence sound at times as though he has broken with his earlier convictions and claimed that one at this level has an insight into the existence and nature of God. The feeling of absolute dependence 'is an awareness of the existence of God as the absolute undivided unity',6 but the issue continues to hinge on how he understands awareness, whether it is an insight into God's existence or an insight which makes certain religious assertions eminently meaningful. The keystone of Schleiermacher's position for our purposes is his consistent claim that feeling is a mode of immediate awareness. 7 The feeling of absolute dependence reveals something about man, viz. that he is absolutely depen dent. Man cannot feel absolutely dependent on finite objects or situations, because he is always active as a creating and ordering subject in relation to everything finite.8 That is, the feeling of absolute dependence cannot arise ' Sittenlehre, p. i66. 2 Ibid. pp. 138-39. 3 Ibid. 4 Both the Dialektik and the Sittenlehre carry out the task of discussing the nature of organic unity. In part they may thus be considered suggestive in nature, since they reflect what Schleiermacher considers to be the key to understanding the nature of all relations. 5 See Sittenlehre, pp. I3-I6, 27, 3I, 129-30; also Dialektik, pp. 130 ff. I do not know how self conscious Schleiermacher was when he made claims about the universe on the suggestive basis of the model of consciousness. My point is that these claims are based on the suggestiveness of human consciousness even though Schleiermacher does not always acknowledge that fact. 6 The Christian Faith, p. I32. 7 Ibid. pp. 5-6. 8 Ibid. p. i6.</page><page sequence="7">SCHLEIERMACHER AND PROBLEM OF DIVINE IMMEDIACY 505 out of man's relation to the world, culture, etc. That feeling, as we have already seen, is the feeling of freedom, and it is qualitatively different from the feeling of absolute dependence. Man feels absolutely dependent, rather, by virtue of his depending on what lies beyond human creativity, by virtue of his having to have a relationship which is independent of all his actions.' Human being has a dimension of complete receptivity in which one relies totally on something beyond his power of comprehension and influence, and this is the point of origin for religion. He is a dependent part of the whole of the universe, and he is sustained beyond all his efforts and willful acts. He is thereby effected by what exceeds all finite bounds and which may be called, at least by virtue of what it is not, infinite and unconditioned. Nothing that man knows or does effects that upon which he depends at this level, and thus his dependence is absolute. Since the feeling of absolute dependence is immediate it becomes meaning ful for man only as he responds to it.2 It itself is not a cognition or a mode of knowing, but is the given possibility for religious emotions and knowledge. That is, one is religious when he self-consciously relates to himself and his world in terms of his absolute dependence. It is at this level of self-conscious response that one finds religion and religious knowledge. Hence, Schleier macher can say descriptively that the feeling of absolute dependence is 'in itself a co-existence of God in the self-consciousness',3 but that insight presupposes that one has recognised the existence of the feeling and come to terms with it in a specifiable, conditioned way. As Schleiermacher pointed out to Dr Lucke, consciousness of God is not God himself, but is man's consciousness of God's presence to man.4 This feeling which arises because of this presence is itself neither the presence of God nor a religious state of mind. The feeling of absolute dependence, then, arises out of the presence of the unconditioned to man in relation to which man is totally dependent. It is the ontological possibility for God-consciousness, although it by itself does not constitute that consciousness. This feeling is witness to the presence of the unconditioned, and when it is recognised, Schleiermacher thinks that uncertainty concerning the presence of the unconditioned becomes impossible. Further, recognition in this context must be understood as a sympathetic attending to the feeling of absolute dependence. One harmonises his other feelings and interests with this feeling so that his consciousness is informed at every point by his relation to the unconditioned. His per spectives, social actions, understanding of nature, etc. are all held in the 1 The Christian Faith, pp. 8, i6. 2 The feeling of absolute dependence is universal for all men. The Christian Faith, sec. 33. Self consciousness, on the other hand, is historically, communally, and individually determined. Thus, while the feeling of absolute dependence is a mode of pre-cognitive awareness, it is not a form of self-consciousness. The individual must act upon it or in conscious terms of it before it gains direct relevance for self-consciousness. 3 The Christian Faith, p. I 26. Sendschreiben, pp. 2I-22.</page><page sequence="8">506 CHARLES E. SCOTT light of this dimension of human existence so that the presence of the unconditioned becomes real for man at every level of consciousness. The concomitant certainty is unproved. It does not rest on rational demon stration of any sort, but accompanies one's consciousness of himself and his world as absolutely dependent. This state of mind constitutes religious certainty and suggests that the unconditioned is in fact the Lord of the universe. Although Schleiermacher cannot deduce from the feeling of absolute dependence that the unconditioned is God as he wants to under stand him, he can construct a case for saying that in light of one's conformity' to this feeling, i.e. in light of Christian piety, the unconditioned is to be understood as loving, creative, etc. The certainty of self-consciousness, however, is infected with conditions and relativities. If the feeling of absolute dependence were self-conscious certainty of God, that certainty would have to be perfect because only the unconditioned is active in this relationship. And that would mean that self-consciousness becomes identical with man's purely passive relation to the unconditioned at this point. Such a contention would contradict a considerable portion of Schleiermacher's view of human consciousness as well as belie the testimony of the feeling of freedom. The feeling of absolute dependence arises because of the presence of the unconditioned, but our apprehension of this situation is thoroughly conditioned and hence oblique and subject to error. Stated in other terms, the feeling of absolute dependence transcends and is thus not identical with one's conscious apprehension of it because this feeling does not arise from human action of any kind, but arises solely from the unconditioned's presence to man. Thus, what we say about the feeling of absolute dependence is not only once removed from the feeling, but is twice removed from the nature of the unconditioned: the unconditioned is immediate to man only in man's absolute dependence on it; its nature is not apparent. And the feeling of absolute dependence is immediate to man only in the feeling and not in one's self-conscious appro priation of it. This feeling is infallible concerning man's dependence on the unconditioned, but its infallibility would appear to be destroyed in self consciousness. One's self-consciousness would be perfect in this regard only if one succeeded in perfectly conforming his entire consciousness to the feeling of absolute dependence such that to be conscious and to feel absolutely dependent were the same thing. But such a perfection of insight is impossible, as we have seen.2 Rather than clear consciousness, we have in the feeling of absolute dependence another harmonic accompaniment, but this time the harmony does not originate with man's actions at all, and consequently it I This conformity is possible according to Schleiermacher only through the redemption of Christ. 2 Jesus of Nazareth enjoyed this perfection, but Schleiermacher does not expect a repetition of his sinless perfection. Hence, we are reliant, historically, on him in order to see what such a unity would be like. I am unclear how this unity of passive feeling and conscious action is possible at all in a human being on Schleiermacher's terms.</page><page sequence="9">SCHLEIERMACHER AND PROBLEM OF DIVINE IMMEDIACY 507 stands apart from the thematic movement in a kind of separateness which raises difficulties which we shall look at shortly. Ironically, then, we have only limited conscious access to the certainty of the feeling of absolute dependence. Wefeel certain, but we cannot act with equal certainty. One's task is to approximate the certainty of feeling as best one can. This means that the feeling of absolute dependence is mysterious to us, because we cannot understand it fully, although it is compelling because we are the ones who feel that way. This situation in which the unconditioned is not immediate to our self consciousness opens to question Schleiermacher's explanation of how the feeling of absolute dependence arises. Since the criterion for religious truth is conformity to the presence of the unconditioned, as witnessed through the feeling of absolute dependence, and since all attempts at this conformity are fragmented, Schleiermacher cannot, I believe, go beyond the claim that things make sense if one follows his system. He never claimed absolute truth for this system, but he did claim repeatedly that all systems relate to God's presence, whether consciously or not. And that, as it turns out, is a systematic claim. Any conscious act is fragmented enough to lack absolute certainty, and since religion is a mode of self-consciousness, religion, as well as thought about religion, will have uncertainty built into it. On Schleiermacher's terms this would not be the case only if religion were restricted solely to the feeling of absolute dependence. This pinpoints, I believe, a persistent difficulty which Schleiermacher wanted to avoid. He thought that religion has a kind of certainty not available to reflection, and he understood religion to be a matter of feeling rather than of thought. But the only religious feeling which can be charac terised by unmitigated certainty is the feeling of absolute dependence; and although it is present in a polar way with all states of consciousness, it cannot be amalgamated into self-consciousness without being relativised and historicised. Hence, not only his explanation of this feeling, but all responses to it, i.e. all consciousness of it, lack clear and unrefracted certainty. From a self-conscious perspective we appear, then, to feel perfectly certain of God's sustaining presence, and religion is the form this appearance takes. Religion, like reflection, is finite and subject to error even at the level of religious certainty. Schleiermacher's philosophy of religion clearly does not interpret religion as anthropocentric. He contends that man is unable to originate his capacity for religion; his religious inclinations originate in God's presence to man. But the problem centres on the nature of presence. Schleiermacher wanted to illumine the nature of God's presence through Christian self-consciousness. This self-consciousness originates historically in Jesus of Nazareth and the community of believers, because Jesus was perfectly attuned to the presence of God, the same God upon whom man depends absolutely. The difference</page><page sequence="10">5o8 CHARLES E. SCOTT between Jesus and other men is that Jesus was perfectly obedient to God's presence. Hence, his entire consciousness became transparent to God, and the world and society were seen without distortion in the light of God's necessary presence.' He thereby reveals that the unconditioned is actually a loving God, and the veil separating us and him is our inability to apprehend his presence clearly. Once we experience the redemption of Christ, however, we come to see who this God really is and that he was there all the time. I do not think that Schleiermacher's concept of consciousness will support adequately this set of contentions because his philosophy excludes in principle the possibility that God can be revealed immediately to specific states of self-consciousness. On the one hand he argued that a self-conscious conformity to the feeling of absolute dependence illumines the One who is present to man. The gap between this feeling, however, and self-conscious acts initiated by finite man calls into question the possibility of such con formity because his position also entails that God's immediacy to man in the feeling of absolute dependence is always mediated for religion by self consciousness, by finite, truncated apprehensions. That is why God's presence cannot be the sum total of worldly relations or identical with the movement of self-consciousness. Unless God's presence to man is seeable in self-conscious acts, however, there is no way in which religious self-consciousness can confirm itselJ in its source. Indeed, how can one conform himself to what is not clearly present to him? And how can God be clearly present to man in a comformable way and yet twice removed from self-consciousness and thus always seen in distortion? Man can never grasp the multiplicity and variety of the world adequately enough to have a perfect picture of the world in light of God's presence. But how is it possible on Schleiermacher's terms to have an undistorted view of God's presence such that either the adequacy of Christ's revelation or the inadequacy of our insights are apparent? Schleiermacher's solution is that once we have seen ourselves and the world in a redeemed self-consciousness, God's presence is apparent. But what is the vehicle of this apparentness? By means of what are we, once redeemed, able to intuit God? Schleiermacher's answer that man's relation to God is given transparency in Christ seems to me impossible to support adequately on the grounds of his philosophy, because he was unable to show how God can be present undistorted to human consciousness, and thus Schleiermacher does not show how religious meanings can be confirmed in God's presence instead of in human acts. In order to have unproved self-conscious certainty, man must have some conscious access to God's presence. 1 Jesus' religious self-consciousness seems to me to exceed the possibility of human consciousness as Schleiermacher has defined it and thus this argument appears to call into question his full humanity.</page><page sequence="11">SCHLEIERMACHER AND PROBLEM OF DIVINE IMMEDIACY 509 2. SCHLEIERMACHER S DILEMMA I think that Schleiermacher would prefer to have the certainty of Christian belief regardless of its philosophical cost, and I would expect him to argue that if his philosophy is not adequate at this point he will simply have to take another look at the structure of human consciousness in the light of the experience of redemption. This second look, in my estimation, would need to involve a considerable re-evaluation of his view of the historicity of consciousness. The dimension of divine presence cannot function simply as a polar opposite to human mediatory action without making impossible a conscious union of these poles, because divine presence is lost if it is invested with finite relativities. The feeling of absolute dependence, which accompanies all modes of consciousness, loses its religious clarity, as we have seen, when it becomes a translated part of self-consciousness. God's presence, if he is present, is what is obscured. Hegel scorned Schleiermacher's position because he found only darkness and 'empty weaving' in the immediacy of feeling.' Schleiermacher, on the other hand, could not understand God as absolute if God takes up the finitude of consciousness into his being. Schleiermacher was unable to accept the choice between making human wisdom absolute and making religion only a matter of anti-rational feelings. He thus found both Hegel and Jacobi unwarranted in their answers to the problem of divine immediacy. He wanted, rather, to hold both knowing and feeling in a productive tension within the organon of human conscious ness. But he ended by excluding divine presence from human consciousness for all practical purposes because he wanted to preserve complete human autonomy and finitude in all conscious acts and at the same time to preserve God's unconditionedness in relation to the feeling of absolute dependence. To get the unity he desired, he would have had to provide a point of clear insight into God's presence so that one's self-consciousness involved an unambiguous certainty of God's presence instead of simply the mediated and ambiguous certainty which results from the interaction of self-conscious ness and the feeling of absolute dependence. To that end, either Schleier macher needed to show adequately how the feeling of absolute dependence is conscious, or he needed to show that human consciousness is sufficient to move with certainty from piety to divinity. In either case natural theology would become possible, and in the latter case consciousness would have a power of religious illumination which transcends historical conditions. Schleiermacher thought that these options raised insurmountable problems. The dilemma he could not solve, however, is that religious certainty is not only unproved, but also fragmented and dependent on human assertion at the point where, within his framework, there should be complete dependence on divine presence. I Encyclopaedia, sec. 446.</page><page sequence="12">5IO CHARLES E. SCOTT 3. A RESPONSE TO THE DILEMMA: THE PRIMACY OF CONSCIOUS MEDIATION Schleiermacher was deeply influenced by Plato and the Platonic view of contemplation. It seemed evident to him that one sees the most profound dimensiolls of his being when he recognises the various poles which con stitute the outer limits of his consciousness. When he sees, for example, both his own finiteness and his absolute dependence on the infinite he is able to contemplate, in a limited way, the totality of his being in the light of both his divine and profane moorings. Contemplation or insight is the moment of union between these poles. But, in distinction to Plato, he understood the contemplative moment to be polar and subject to historical limitations. His understanding of contemplative unity thus clashes with his expectation of religious certainty founded in the feeling of absolute dependence. This divergence occurs, I believe, because he thought that religious certainty originates in a purely passive feeling. That is, he thought that at this level of feeling man totally transcends his language and meanings and, by virtue of this transcendence, escapes the uncertainty of historical perspectives. He did not see clearly that both the certainty of the feeling of absolute dependence and the certainty of contemplation involve a rich network of meanings without which certainty either in feeling or in thought is impossible. The prereflective is operative only to the extent that it is structured by the language and meanings which make up the given base of consciousness. Reflective consciousness and contemplation in this case articulate imagin atively these meanings, give articulation to the inherited language in such fashion that reflectively conscious certainty is founded in the meanings which are dimly apprehended and applied in feeling. Schleiermacher, however, separated the feeling of absolute dependence from meaning and language by understanding its origin solely in terms of divine presence which is unstructured by human meaning and language. Thus he could not join effectively this feeling and religious consciousness because the certainty of this feeling depended on its transcendence of meaning. As a result, contemplation lost a measure of religious certainty by virtue of its historically conditioned, meaningful structure. If on the other hand Schleiermacher had viewed the feeling of absolute dependence as meaning ful, as founded in language and history, as well as in divine presence, and thus as meaningful even in its origin, he would have been able to effect the contemplative and religious union he sought. That would mean, however, that man is imaginative and creative even in his feeling of dependence on God, and Schleiermacher was not able to think that man's existence in all cases depends in this way on his own freedom. Schleiermacher's difficulty with the problem of divine immediacy results from his inability to think of man as dependent even at the level of the feeling of absolute dependence</page><page sequence="13">SCHLEIERMACHER AND PROBLEM OF DIVINE IMMEDIACY 5II such that he feels what is speakable because what he feels has been spoken, at least in part. Schleiermacher wanted perfect religious certainty within finite, human consciousness, an unattainable goal because finite consciousness excludes the possibility of perfect certainty concerning the presence of the Perfection of Being. Although the limits of this paper make impossible a thorough development of the implications of my criticisms of Schleiermacher's position, I shall outline several ideas which underlie my critique and which indicate the direction an alternative to Schleiermacher's interpretation of religious experience might take. (I) Schleiermacher worked on the assumption that feeling transcends meaning and consciousness. One major thrust of my criticism suggests that a conscious dialectic is present in feeling as well as in rational reflection. Feeling is one way in which the self relates to itself and its world. Otherwise it is irrelevant and inaccessible to consciousness. Religious certainty, even when founded in feeling, involves some kind of recognition and means something. It must be understood as dependent on the language, history, and personal experiences characteristic of the religious man. The immediacy of this situation is not adequately described as God's creative presence to passive man. It is an experience with religious meaning for man, which means that man is also active. Otherwise there could be no meaningful conscious ness. The feeling of absolute dependence must thus be understood as involving a man's relation to himself and his world. This feeling constitutes a conscious ness in which man finds himself and his finite situation dependent on more than his own self- and world-relations. Hence, this feeling of dependence is an experience which is possible in part because of the way a man sees himself. A person with a very different self-understanding might not have this feeling. (2) One does not feel or see beyond his consciousness. He experiences everything within his domain of consciousness in which he as agent con tributes always to its content. His religious feeling as well as his religious concepts are thus conditioned not only by his finiteness, but also by the particularity of his history. His feeling has meaning for him because it is within the context of his consciousness, even though he is not the sole origination of it. Otherwise he could not name one feeling religious and another profane. Where the self is not active at all there is no possibility for recognition or even reception, much less for designation. (3) Religious certainty comes in self-relations. Whereas Schleiermacher contended that in the feeling of absolute dependence God is his own witness, I am suggesting that certainty comes only in particular kinds of experiences in which the contribution of the finite self is essential. If the activity of the self is not essential to religious feeling, one cannot be conscious in feeling certain, and in that case religious certainty, qua certainty, is not</page><page sequence="14">5I2 CHARLES E. SCOTT experienceable in any meaningful way. If, on the other hand, the self alone is active in this experience, if religious certainty is explicable totally by reference to human activity, then it constitutes a certainty only about a human relationship. (4) A disclosure of any transcendent being is never received apart from a conditioning context of experiences. It is meaningful by virtue of its occurrence in this context, by its conditioning and being conditioned by the meanings and structures which constitute the identity of the particular individual. This situation holds for both specific disclosures and 'general' ones which are given with human existence. (5) Religious contemplation is a process of providing conscious unity for one's experiences in terms of some religious meaning or set of meanings. It presupposes the religious meanings and thus is a means of discovering the meanings' relevance and significance, but is not a means of discovering new (i.e. previously unrevealed) religious realities. Such contemplation further presupposes the fundamental unity of consciousness. It integrates one's consciousness around a religious focal point, but it does not activate a purely passive state, in which only God is active, with the activity of consciousness. It rather interrelates various kinds of conscious activity. I am suggesting in short that religious disclosures to man, like all others, are found within a finite, loosely unified context of experiences and meanings, that man is always active in his intuitions and insights, and that even his feelings are meaningful to the extent that they presuppose and involve his most fundamental interests, needs, and symbols.</page></plain_text>
