It would be hard to imagine a more interesting pair of volumes for the reader interested in new approaches to the scientific study of child development. It is a common belief that the most rewarding portion of a scientific meeting is the informal discussion that goes on outside the formal sessions, in hallways, hotel rooms, and bars. The meetings reported in these volumes were centered about formal papers, but an extremely skilful job of editing creates the impression of listening in on an informal discussion. Best of all, the participants are witty, intelligent people, each exceedingly well informed in his own field but naive enough in other areas to be fascinated by what the others have to say. The charm of the books lies as much in the participants' personalities, as revealed by the discussions as it does in the content of the discussions themselves. The WHO Study Group consists of 14 people, whose</page><page sequence="2">178 THE QUARTERLY REVIEW OF BIOLOGY backgrounds are in such diverse fields as psychiatry, psychoanalysis, psychology, anthropology, ethology, electrophysiology, and human biology. To each meeting there are invited a few guests who, along with selected members of the group, present papers. A half day is devoted to the presentation and discussion of each paper. In these 2 volumes are thus included papers on physical anthropology, ethology, electroencephalog- raphy, developmental psychology, animal behavior, cultural anthropology, and electronic models of human behavior. The group seldom permits a speaker to complete his presentation without questions for clarification, chal- lenges of data, disagreements of interpretation, and just plain digressions. All of this makes fascinating reading, because the participants are keenly critical and seldom let the speaker get away with fuzzy ambiguous statements. The discussions are informative because many of the comments are based upon not yet published research, unpublished details of earlier studies, or upon pertinent anecdotal material. The discussions are illuminating also because they reveal how naive each of us can be outside of his own specialty. Careful physiologists can make the most outlandish anthropomorphic interpretations of be- havioral data; excellent psychologists can ask physio- logical questions that the biologist clearly thinks is nonsense. Cultural anthropologists can let their bias against heredity lead them almost to deny species differences among animals, and specialists in animal behavior seem prone to find species differences in cul- tural diversity. So the books make good reading. What else they accomplish is more difficult to say. Since the papers were prepared for oral presentation, they do not have the scholarly documentation of written articles. The comments in the discussion frequently refer to sources that are not identified in the bibliography. The function of these volumes, however, is stimulation rather than information. If research workers and students in child development read them, they will not find a systematic coverage of any of the fields discussed, but they should be stimulated by the potential contributions of research areas generally neglected in textbooks of child develop- ment. If the volumes accomplish this result, they are eminently worthwhile, but even if they do not, one can hardly wait to find out what the group is going to talk about next time. ALFRED L.
