<plain_text><page sequence="1">"The Tell-Tale Heart" and the "Evil Eye" B. D. Tucker Poe's tale, "The Tell-Tale Heart," is one of his most perfectly con structed stories, and a very skillful study of madness. In such a tale it is futile to look for logical motivation, but an author as acute as Poe would, nevertheless, not choose a completely arbitrary point on which the madman's rage would be focused. Yet the tale itself seems to give no clue. The insane narrator specifically says: "Object there was none. Passion there was none. I loved the old man. He had never wronged me. He had never given me insult. For his gold I had no desire. I think it was his eye!"1 What was it that caused the eye of the old man to become a fixa tion, a monomania for the madman, just as Berenice's teeth has been for Egaeus? Since we know hardly anything about the madman himself, we are forced to ask why the author chose precisely this object on which to fix the rage in the character of his creation. Eyes obviously had a certain fascination for Poe, as we see in the 1 ' 'The Tell-Tale Heart, ' ' in Collected Works of Edgar Allan Poe.

According to John Ingram, "Ligeia" was first suggested "by a dream in which a woman's eyes in spired him with the intense emotions which he described in the fourth paragraph of the tale."2 Marie Bonaparte states that "the eyes which he saw in his dreams ... are those which, in the miniature of Eliza beth Arnold, turn their strange wide gaze upon us and were to make their adorer, Edgar, a fetishist of eyes."3 But there were other eyes: not those of a beautiful woman; not those of his adored but forever lost mother, that fascinated Poe, not with adoration but with fear and terror. In one of his earliest poems, "Sonnet-To Science," Poe writes of the "peering eyes" of Science, which is a vulture preying "upon the poet's heart"(I, 91). In "the Tell-Tale Heart" the narrator tells us how he opened his lantern slightly so that "a single dim ray, like the thread of the spider, shot from out the crevice and fell full upon the vulture eye" (III, 794). He also states that the old man "had the eye of a vulture?a pale blue eye, with a film over it. Whenever it fell upon me, my blood ran cold; and so by degrees?very gradually?I made up my mind to take the life of the old man, and thus rid myself of the eye forever" (III, 792). Besides the vulture eye, Poe elsewhere gives us the horse's eye which frightens young Metzengerstein, and?most fearful of all?the solitary eye of "The Black Cat." Superstitions about "the Evil Eye" are, as Mabbott notes (III, 789), widespread, but it does not seem to be superstition that preys upon the mind of the narrator. Although he does refer to it once as "his Evil Eye, ' ' he does not seem to fear it or suppose that any evil will come to him as a result of it. It seems to be hatred rather than fear that he feels. The equating of "the Evil Eye" with "the evil T " of the narrator has been noted by several critics and cannot have escaped Poe's atten tion. Like William Wilson, the madman is killing his own dop pelganger, and the further identification with his victim is found in his feeling the old man's terror as if it were his own, and his fantasy that he can actually hear the old man's heart in his own heartbeat. Guilt is a major theme of the tale, and the attack on the objectification of the self fits in well. 2 John H. Ingram, Edgar Allan Poe, His Life, Letters and Opinions (London: W.H.

(The quotation from Ingram quoted above is also found in a note on this page.)</page><page sequence="3">94 THE SOUTHERN LITERARYJOURNAL It should be noted that Poe speaks only of a single eye. In Griswold's edition there is the sentence, "One of his eyes resembled that of a vulture," but in the original version in Lowell's Pioneer (January, 1843), and in Poe's Broadway Journal (August 23, 1845), this reads, "He had the eye of a vulture" (III, 792). 4 Now it is poetic convention to speak of "the eye" when we mean "the eyes," and we immediately recall, in this connection, Coleridge's Ancient Mariner. It is an ancient Mariner And he stoppeth one of three. "By thy long grey beard and glittering eye, Now wherefore stopp'st thou me?" . . . He holds him with his glittering eye? The Wedding-Guest stood still, And listens like a three-years' child The Mariner hath his will. Yet, while there is no suggestion that the ancient mariner had only one eye, the reader is left with the impression that Poe's old man may indeed have been a one-eyed specter. When we search for one-eyed prototypes, the Cyclops comes at once to mind, and the extinction of his one eye through the fearful deed of Odysseus is, of course, a kind of parallel. But the resemblance between the frail old man and the Homeric giant is too remote to make this parallel very suggestive. One-eyed Odin is seen as a possible forerun ner of the old-man by Marie Bonaparte and Daniel Hoffman,5 but again there is little to make the connection between the two. For the narrator, who says that he loved the old man, the vulture eye seems to have an existence of its own apart from the old man. There is another image of a single eye with which Poe must have been familiar. It is on the reverse side of the Great Seal of the United States, and is most frequently seen by Americans today on the one dollar bill in current use. To many people it may seem to have a strange, disturbing, surrealistic appearance. William Barton of Philadelphia is given credit for this design which was adopted in 1782. The face of the seal shows the familiar American eagle displayed, in a rather fierce pose, facing left, so that only one eye 4 On page 791, Mabbott mistakenly gives the date in Broadway Journal as 1855, in stead of 1845; presumably a misprint. 5 Bonaparte, op. cit., pp. 500-01; and Daniel Hoffman.

It is rather the reverse side which holds the attention with its mysterious design. A truncated pyramid, consisting of thirteen courses of stone, represent ing the thirteen original states, is surmounted by an eye, enclosed in a triangle, surrounded by a glory proper. Above the design are the words, " Annuit Coeptis" (He/She has approved our undertaking), and below it "Novus Ordo Seclorum" (A new order of the ages). The eye represents, of course, the watchful Eye of Providence, and the triangle is a traditional symbol of the Triune God. What gives this a rather disturbing appearance is that the eye is not merely a sym bolical representation of heraldry, but an exceedingly realistic por trayal of a real eye which seems to be looking out with a penetrating and searching stare. One could imagine that for a mentally or emo tionally unbalanced person this specter might be frightening, and even terrifying, suggesting a vindictive and avenging judge or father, from whom there is no escape. The idea of an all-seeing eye, peering at one, even during one's most secret moments, is indeed disturbing. Like the narrator of this tale, Poe wished to be the seer, not the seen. If there were exhibitionist tendencies, they were usually suppressed or disguised, although "the Imp of the Perverse," which caused many of his characters to betray themselves, as in this tale, may itself be thought of as a form of exhibi tionism. There is something like the voyeur in Dupin, who boasted, "with a low chuckling laugh, that most men, in respect to himself, wore windows in their bosoms"(II, 521-74). Certainly the narrator of "The Tell-Tale Heart" shows himself a voyeur and a secret listener, and his lantern with its lid and single ray it itself a symbolic eye. But this voyeur-narrator did not wish to be seen or heard in the dark, and he goes to insane lengths to conceal himself from the old man, whose vulture eye, nevertheless, poses a threat. The power of this orb is suggested in the extraordinary statement that ' ' no human eye?not even his?could have detected any wrong." Granted this is a negative statement, it still implies that the old man's eye had exceptional penetration to discover secret sin; and note that this asser tion is made after his corpse has been dismembered and all traces of the crime removed. Though no human eye could see the traces of the crime, there was an eye which could. It was the Eye of God, depicted in strange and disembodied aspect on the Great Seal, from whose all-judging surveillance there is no escape. This thought would have been par</page><page sequence="5">96 THE SOUTHERN LITERARY JOURNAL ticularly distressing to the narrator and his secret ways. And if the im age of the triangle enclosing the all-seeing eye had also come to his mind, it also would have seemed to have had a mysterious and threatening significance. The number three had already been associated with a powerful eye in the first verse of ' 'The Ancient Mariner, ' ' a poem which Poe echoed repeatedly in "MS Found in a Bottle," and Arthur Gordon Pym, and in the seemingly old man who tells the tale of " A Descent into the Maelstrom." Three also plays an important part in "The Tell-Tale Heart." It is about midnight when the narrator goes to the old man's room. After the cry goes up,?"Who's there?"?he tells us, "for a whole hour I did not move a muscle. ' ' At length ' 'The old man's hour had come! With a loud yell, I threw open the lantern and leaped into the room. He shrieked once, once only ... .1 then smiled gaily, to find the deed so far done." After the victim is dead and his heart has ceased to beat, the narrator can finally say with relief, "His eye would trouble me no more." Three planks are removed to conceal the dis membered corpse, and all this must have taken about three hours, for it was four o'clock when the three men knock and are admitted into the house. There is another story of three men who come to a place where an old man dwells, in this case, Abraham?a story with which Poe must have been familiar from his childhood. It is in Genesis 18. And the LORD [Yahweh] appeared unto him [Abraham] in the plains of Mamre: and he sat in the tent door in the heat of the day; And he lift up his eyes and looked, and lo, three men stood by him: and when he saw them, he ran to meet them from the tent door, and bowed himself toward the ground, and said, My Lord, if now I have found favour in thy sight, pass not away, I pray thee, from thy servant: Let a little water, I pray you, be fetched, and wash your feet, and rest yourselves under the tree: and I will fetch a morsel of bread, and comfort ye your hearts; after that ye shall pass on: for therefore are ye come to your servant. And they said, So do, as thou hast said. (Genesis 18:1-5) Now it is noteworthy that although three men appear suddenly before Abraham, he addresses them in the singular ?"My Lord, if now I have found favor in thy sight..." ?in one sentence, and then in the plural in the next. Ancient scholars had several explanations for this. The Masoretes, or Jewish scribes who compiled notes on the</page><page sequence="6">THE TELL-TALE HEART 97 sacred texts, generally concluded that the Lord appeared with two angel guards. But at times all three speak at once, and if only one were the Lord, the presumption of the other two would be as strange as the idea of the Lord appearing in all three at once. It is true that in verse 22, "the men turned their faces from thence, and went toward Sodom: but Abraham stood yet before the LORD," but it may be too simple just to say that two men departed to reappear at Sodom as "two angels" in 19:1, while Yahweh remained to argue with Abraham about the impending destruction of "the cities of the plain" (Genesis 18:23-33). A few early Christians seized upon this text as a reference to the Ho ly Trinity, but almost no biblical scholars would accept this today. In stead it is most likely that there is here a conflation of two or more sources, but the various strands are so closely woven that it is difficult to separate them with certainty. In one version probably Yahweh ap peared to Abraham alone, and in another it was three messengers (or angels) from God, thus avoiding the anthropomorphism of which this story is one of the most notable examples.6 It is highly doubtful, however, that Poe would have been aware of all these possible interpretations, and it is more likely that he would have remembered only the mysterious ambivalence of the one and the three. Somehow Abraham recognized these three men as God and ad dressed them as "My Lord." He then hastened into the tent to tell Sarah, his wife, to make some cakes, and told his herdsmen to prepare a calf for the feast. AH these preparations must have taken considerable time for what Abraham had called "a morsel of bread," but in the biblical narrative the elapsed space seems but a moment. While the deity deigns to par take of this mortal fare, Abraham stands respectfully to the side to wait on them. The men then ask, "Where is Sarah thy wife?" The reader suspects that they knew very well where she was and everything else about her. There then follows the prediction of Isaac's birth. The narrator tells us parenthetically that Abraham and Sarah were "well stricken in age," and comments delicately that it had "ceased to be with Sarah after the manner of women." Sarah had been listening within the tent and 6 See Gerhard Von Rad, Genesis: A Commentary, translated by John H. Marks (Philadelphia: The Westminster Press, 1961), pp. 198-210.</page><page sequence="7">98 THE SOUTHERN LITERARYJOURNAL laughed within herself, thinking, "After I waxed old shall I have pleasure, my lord being old also?" And now Yahweh asks reprovingly why Sarah had laughed: "Is anything too hard for the Lord?" Sarah, hiding in the darkness of the tent, is dismayed at being found out and comes forth in confusion and terror to try to deny the charge. But God is not deceived. He sees even our secret thoughts, and sternly rebukes her. All this may sound very remote from Poe's tale, but in dreams and in the minds of mentally unbalanced persons very strange associations are sometimes made. There are several similarities in Poe's tale to be noted here: the three men who come and search out the secret fault; the narrator's smiles and chuckles at his own cleverness; his certainty that ' 'They heard! ? they suspected! ? they knew\ ' ' Despite his hav ing, as he thought, destroyed the "Evil Eye" and having concealed all the evidence of the crime, he cannot rid himself of the fear that these three men know his secret deed, that their ears have heard the throb bing heart, and that their eye has penetrated through the darkness of the night to find him out. When the narrator shines his single ray "precisely upon the damned spot,"7 he "could see nothing else of the old man's face or person." Is this not exactly the case of the mysterious eye within the triangle? And is this not the eye which could not only peer within the darkness of Abraham's tent and detect the hidden thought and derisive laugh of Sarah, but could also see the secret sins of the night, synonymous with the very names of Sodom and Gomorrah, upon which the fierce destruction was soon to fall in fearful judgment? The narrator at first imagined that the old man did not even "dream of my secret deeds or thoughts. I fairly chuckled at the idea." But in the end, in his madness, he imagines that the three men know, hear, and see all, even the deepest secrets of his heart. And he almost shrieks to himself: "Was it possible they heard not? Almighty God! ?no, no!" For it is his own heart, his tell-tale heart, his conscience, which cannot hide from the all-seeing eye of God, which betrays him. 7 Poe could hardly have written these words without being conscious of Macbeth, V, 1, 38, where Lady Macbeth, in her mad sleep-walk, says, "Out, damned spot! out, I say!" There are many parallels with Macbeth: Lady Macbeth's early confidence ("A little water clears us of this deed. How easy it is then!" II, iii, 67-68); Macbeth's guilt in con trast (II, iii, 60-64); the knocking at the door after the crime; the innocence of the vic tim; the three witches; and the sleep-walk with a light and eyes open.</page></plain_text>
