It seems to have been in an undisturbed layer, yet at the same time it is only one sherd. The writer has proposed elsewhere that Sanctuary A must belong in EB II B, comparable to Periode 5 of de Vaux, but the combined evidence of the Khirbet Kerak sherd, pottery correlations to Jericho Early Bronze Phase D (unpub- lished), and Egyptian imports dating to the end of the Third Dynasty seems to support an EB III A dating of Sanctuary A, that is, about 2500 B.

The proposed program was to excavate, over a period of perhaps five years, a fortified second millennium site in the Sinjar plain (Fig. 1), and simultaneously to conduct an area study of the ancient populations in relation to the climate and geography of the region.

Other than this, the territory was a virgin area for our archaeological expedi- tion. Headquarters were established in the town of Tell 'Afar, sixty- five kilometers west of Mosul; Tell al-Rimah is situated thirteen kilo- meters due south of Tell 'Afar. Judging by the visible number of mounds, the Sinjar plain held a position of considerable agricultural importance in antiquity. The eroded peaks of the Sinjar Hills are responsible for adequate rainfall to either side. Nevertheless, with the exception of the thirty thousand residents of Tell 'Afar, the district today is sparsely inhabited. 1Seton Lloyd, "Some Ancient Sites in the Sinjar District," IRAQ 5 (1938), pp. 123-142. 41</page><page sequence="3">Bulletin of the American Schools of Oriental Research Among the hundreds of tells available, less than ten were of the type with enclosure walls. The site was carefully selected during the course of another informal survey by Mr. David Oates. Mr. Oates, who is joint director of the British School of Archaeology in Iraq and a Tutor at Trinity College, Cambridge, postulated that Tell al-Rimah would have been in a most advantageous position during the second millennium for commercial caravans passing between A''ur to the south and the trade centers of northern Syria and eastern Anatolia. Furthermore, if the surface sherds were indicative, we should find ourselves in an his- torical period heavily documented at other Mesopotamian sites; viz., the Old Babylonian period and later. The initial season lasted from the first of March until the middle of May. Direction was by Mr. Oates and the author. Miss Barbara Parker served as Epigraphist. Field Assistants were Mr. Nicholas Kindersley and Mr. Julian Reade, Fellows of the British School of Archaeology in Iraq, and Mr. David Crownover, Executive Secretary of the University Museum, Philadelphia. We were aided for varying lengths of time by the following: Prof. Jorgen Laessoe of the University of Copenhagen; Mr. Jeffrey Orchard, Secretary-Librarian of the British School of Archaeology in Iraq; Miss Nan Shaw and Miss Ann Searight, Fellows of the British School. Mr. David H. French of the British Institute of Archaeology in Ankara conducted a prehistoric mound survey and Mr. Mogens Tr0lle-Larsen of the University of Copenhagen was with us for a short time. Sayid Tariq al-Naimi was our excellent representative from the Directorate General of Antiquities. We were greatly honoured in April by a visit from Dr. Feisal el-Wailly, Director General of Antiquities, and Sayid Fuad Safar, Inspector General of Excavations. In the Bagh- dad Museum, Sayid Mohammed Ali Mustafa and Sayid Faraj Basmachi implemented our plans with the utmost cooperation. To all of the above we express our gratitude. Since the final publication of Tell al-Rimah is not to be produced for some years, we plan to publish annual preliminary reports on both sides of the Atlantic. Mr. Oates will deal principally with the architecture and his reports will appear in Iraq. The author's reports will concern primarily the objects found.2 The city walls of Tell al-Rimah (Fig. 2) form a rounded rectangle,3 enclosing an area of ca. forty-five acres. The most prominent feature within is the temple mound (Site A) rising almost vertically from the plain on its west side, where it reaches a height of some thirty meters. On the east, the mound profile is broken in three places. Below the summit cone, two protuberances flank the main access to the top. A low broad apron fanning out to the front and sides forms the bottom stage. 2 More popular accounts may be found from time to time in EXPEDITION (Uni- versity Museum, Philadelphia). Cf. T. H.

Another mound worthy of comment is a somewhat elevated regularly formed rectangle built into the city wall on the northwest side. A very 43</page><page sequence="5">Bulletin of the American Schools of Oriental Research small conical mound flanks one side of what appears to be a centrally located approach. This complex was left for future investigation. More than a half-dozen gaps are distributed around the circumference of the city wall. We have yet to discover which of these were original passages. An intermittent wadi curves round the walls on the north and east, thus adding to the height of the wall and protection of the city on those sides. On a clear day it is possible to see nearly a hundred tells of different sizes scattered across the once fertile plain. Rainfall decreases sharply south toward the Euphrates. SITE A Excavations began with an L-shaped trench on the temple mound, on the northern protuberance of the middle stage. Gradually the area was enlarged to include the whole northeast segment of the mound's upper stages, and the greater part of the central access. The protuber- ance to the south of the access was occupied by an Arab grave and hence impossible to excavate. Operations of the first season gave evidence for three main levels, subdivided into smaller phases of occupation. Level 1 constitutes the Middle Assyrian period (ca. 1400-1200 B. C.); Level 2 is the so-called " Nuzi" or " Hurrian " period (ca. 1500 B. C.); Level 3 should be Old Assyrian (ca. 1800-1650 B. C.), but is represented only by finds surviving or reused in later levels. At the present Level 3 is not architecturally demonstrable in Site A. Level 1: The Middle Assyrian architecture consists of a series of linked domestic structures covering the middle and upper stages of the mound. 1) Pottery A quantitative and qualitative analysis awaits another season's work. Suffice it to say that the types noted have a general correspondence to Tell Billa, Stratum 2, which the excavators dated roughly in the time of Shalmaneser I. One coarse jar sherd was decorated with crudely incised anthropomorphic figures. 2) Terracotta A small terracotta wheel, unmarked by any trace of use, belonged either to a toy or wheeled temple furniture of an earlier period. 3) Tablets One of the domestic structures near the summit of the mound produced a jar containing more than thirty tablets at a depth of 1 m. from the surface. Because the tablets had been packed very tightly together and then subjected to continuous action of soil chemicals, they were extremely difficult to extract. Only a few were recovered without damage. Without detailed study,4 it is evident that these were the 4The inscribed material of the 1964 season was initially studied in the field by Miss B. Parker and Prof. J. Laessoe. The tablets were then removed to the Uni- versity of Pennsylvania where they were baked and cleaned by Mr. Eric A. Parkinson. A final study and publication of the tablets has been graciously undertaken by 44</page><page sequence="6">Number 178 April, 1965 records of a merchant, or perhaps even brother merchants. Some of the legible limu-names are known from Tell Billa tablets and date to Shal- maneser I (ca. 1973-1244). Among the commodities mentioned are copper, tin, and grain. The presence of these metals on our merchants' lists suggests that Tell al-Rimah remained on the A'vur-Anatolia caravan route well towards the end of the Second Millennium. Level 2: The interpretation of the architectural sequence in the temple within Level 9 and between Levels 1 and 9 is somewhat complicated. Different parts of the complex have been destroyed by fire. The shrine and its own fagade may have undergone an initial restoration at the beginning of the period and then endured later repairs. The rooms around the courtyard on the second stage or middle terrace of the mound were not maintained exclusively for religious functions. They were instead con- verted to domestic use. Certain stratigraphical and architectural indica- tions led the excavators to catalogue a large group of objects as belonging to an intermediate Level Ic rather than Level 9. This material culturally and historically is a part of our Level 9 and will be considered here as such. Level 2 was locally referred to as the " Nuzi period" because there was a great similarity to material at that site. For purposes of this discussion it is to be taken as mid-Second Millennium (ca. 1650- 1350 B.C.). As noted above, the temple plan I of this period is a restoration, presumably of the temple which existed in Level 3. The plan (Fig. 3) of the restored Level 2 temple bears some resemblance to a temple of Shamshi-Adad I at Ailur. The outer courtyard of the second stage was flanked by several large rooms on either side. All of the courtyards and facades-both external and internal-were decorated elaborately with half-columns and rebated niches (Fig. 4). Objects were scattered throughout the complex, although heavier deposits were concentrated in rooms closer to the actual shrine. One small room contained numerous strings of glass, quartz faience, shell, and stone beads, hastily abandoned, and covered with burnt debris. A) Pottery and Terracotta Sherds were profuse in all levels and await further analysis. A few fragments of light-on-dark decorated " Mitannian " ware goblets were noted. 1. Only complete or nearly complete pots were catalogued. There are vague resemblances to Billa shapes among 50% of them, but strati- graphic correspondences are so far unsatisfactory. 2.

These s were from different locations, but both stratified in Level 2, apparently dating to Shalmaneser I, and thus somewhat later 9 than those from Nuzi and Rimah. Pottery and terracotta theriomorphic cult vessels are known to us in Mesopotamia in extant form 10 and in functional illustration" in the Protoliterate period. Certainly this religious tradition must have survived in some form, but few extant vessels of this type are known in the Third Millennium. In the 18th century B. C. a naturalistic type of animal vase, much resembling the old-fashioned Mesopotamian variety with a spout in the back, appears at Kiiltepe and other Anatolian sites.' From the excavations at Babylon, a similar type of theriomorphic vase 13 emerged. This vessel was clearly mounted on wheels, and the position occupied by the mouth on the Rimah jar was sealed with a knob. A tail was only slightly indicated. The piece was excavated from the Neo-Babylonian level. The quantity of pottery wheels of many sizes found at Tell al-Rimah suggests that there may have been a goodly number of animals and vessels on wheels. 4. Two unjoined portions of an anthropomorphic pottery vessel. A crudely modelled head of a bearded man forms the neck of the vessel. The prominent nose is modelled, the eyes are applied and oval, as are the ears. The beard is of the spade type beginning at a point above the corners of the eyes, and extending stiffly out from the face. Although roughly executed, the overall style of the head is clearly Syrian. The lower section, also hollow, is complete from the belly down, except for the male organ. 5. Anthropomorphic Spout A robed man wears a familiar round hat with a rolled edge. There are traces of red paint on his hat and hair. The entire figure is hollow, suggesting the function of a spout; a lead-off tube inserted through his back is made secure with a blob of bitumen, which also seems to form his beard.

C) Frit (Quartz Faience) The quantity and variety of frit objects in this level is astonishing. Even the amount of items recovered in our first campaign would be sufficient to warrant a detailed study, and there is every reason to believe this group will be augmented in future seasons. Hence a few preliminary remarks as to the nature of the material are in order.'5 It is possible to glaze successfully the raw materials quartz, steatite, and clay (the last when it has a high siliceous content). An easier and more frequent practice is to powder either of the two mineral bases, combine a simple chemical compound with cloying attributes, and form the desired shape under heat. The final glazing need not be complicated. This product is called either quartz faience or steatite faience. Both types are known in Northern Mesopotamia by the Fourth Millennium B. C.16 That material termed "frit " or " quartz-frit" in the Tell al-Rimah excavations is actually quartz-faience, although the final glazing in many instances has decayed considerably. 1.

Each is a hollow container, none over 5 cm. in length, with either a pointed or flat bottom. There are usually perforations for suspension on either side of the top or through external and internal lugs; several of the capsules were accompanied by disc lids with matching perfora- tions. The exteriors are decorated either with facsimiles of contemporary ,,sm 9.?Ae :,6,0 ... ....... ... . .. . .. .. FIG. 5.

The function is by no means certain, but the containers were excavated with groups of personal orna- ments. Since they were found in an anteroom of the temple, it is likely they were dedicatory items, which possibly had never been used. a. White with green glaze (Fig. 5). The design, both in subject and elaborate style, belongs in the Mitannian glyptic repertoire. Anti- thetical stags on either side of a tree face out and turn their heads back. Between them are four human figures wearing tall headdresses and marching toward an altar. The rounded tip of the capsule is covered by a five-petalled rosette. b. White with green glaze. The body is decorated with four bands of guilloche pattern and vertical incisions. The rounded tip carries an eight-petalled rosette.

The body is encircled with three registers of cross-hatched design, and the rounded tip is decorated with a four- petalled rosette. e. Greenish-blue glaze.

Grooved eyebrows are connected above the nose bridge. The gigantic surviving right ear is pierced by three holes, vertically ranged. The nose and mouth are feminine and carefully modelled. An extended rectangular cut in the neck suggests an inlaid necklace, now missing. The piece has distinct charm and beauty and is perhaps the most aesthetically pleasing of the season's finds. Similar masks are known from Assyrian graves 18 at Mari; the contents of these graves are not dated much more precisely than the latter half of the Second Millennium. Associated Egyptian scarabs may be related to Ramses II. We find a nearly identical parallel among the unpub- lished material from Tell Billa.19 The latter mask is of white faience and was found in Level I-A, which is dated by the excavators after 1000 B.

Among them were serrated chrysanthe- mum-like disks, " melon" globes, incised biconoids, and segmented and crosshatched cylindrical beads. 7. Vessels a. The duck vessel is a quartz-faience sculpture in very fragmentary condition. Decoration is elaborately patterned in tan, black, cream, and yellow. The remains of two curved projections which rise from the back may have formed a basket handle, not uncommon in this type of vessel. It is probably a completely unique piece and will be published as such when it is fully restored. b. A fragment of a rather small plain vessel with a rounded body glazed yellow. D) Glass As mentioned above, the products of the glazing industry at Tell al- Rimah eventually may prove to be the chief motivating factor in our excavation of the site. The collection of glazed objects excavated in the first season is provocative, widely varied, and partially unique. True glass uses basically the same components as quartz-faience, but in different proportions.24 In Mesopotamia proper, the earliest extant occurrence of this material is in the form of a pale green glass cylinder at Tell Asmar in the Early Dynastic period 25 and a block of pure blue glass from Eridu.26 Glass beads are not uncommon in Neo-Sumerian and Isin-Larsa graves at Ur,27 and were found even under the Old Assyrian ziggurat at A''ur.28 If the manufacture of glass in ancient Mesopotamia requires confirmation, the cuneiform text from Tell 'Umar (Seleucia on the Tigris) provides a practicable explanation of glass- working techniques of the 17th century B. C.29 In this first season at Tell al-Rimah we do not have evidence for glass earlier than the mid-Second Millennium. These levels produced sub- stantial fragments of piriform sand-core vessels with polychrome zig-zag and festooned decoration. The same type of bottle 30 is known at an approximately equivalent date from Nuzi, A'vur, Ur, and Alalakh. Among the amulets and miniatures were a round-faced female mask with fluted hair or cap, several naked goddess plaques, all molded in blue glass,31 and a tiny hedgehog amulet; the female mask (Fig. 8) appears to be entirely original. 24 J.

It is possible that the small glass cylinders were packed tightly together in the desired pattern and heated slightly until some cohesion occurred. The design in this case is a zigzag. There are two similar pieces known. One is a cylindrical vase from Marlik in Iran with green, white, red, and blue pegs arranged in a diamond pattern.33 There is no real agreement as to the precise dating of the various Marlik finds; the glass vase is likely to belong somewhere in the latter half of the Second Millennium B. C. The other potential mosaic relations are to be found at 'Aqar Qfif,34 the residence of the Kassite king Kurigalzu II. The best known example consists of a greenish-black glass plaque with white paste inlays of astral bodies and a bird (eagle ?). The additional mosaic fragments are probably more similar to the Rimah ones, and seem to come from ring base bowls. A substantial section of glass tile or base was found on the floor of the temple anteroom. All surfaces were a rather decayed lime-green, but the core was a beautifully pure, opaque, and vitreous aquamarine. Numerous glass beads were found in conjunction with the quartz- faience ones. The types were paralleled in both media. E. Shells The shells found at Tell al-Rimah also give evidence for material and cultural interrelations in the mid-millennium. That is to say, the quanti- tative distribution is about evenly divided into species from the Mediter- ranean and species from the Persian Gulf. Our site is near enough to the Tigris River to have made possible water connections to the south. The overland links to the Levantine coasts may have run via Mari and the Upper Euphrates. The shells were probably carried incidentally by merchants engaged in more serious commercial transactions. Most of the specimens are perforated by drilling and undoubtedly were body ornaments. Almost invariably they were found in deposits of other jewellery. The following species were identified: 35 Land Snail Margarya sp. (Fresh water mollusk) Persian Gulf or Red Sea Conus sp.

Stone We recovered stone wheels in various qualities of stone and of different sizes. They exhibit no trace of wear and their function is completely unknown. A wide range of semi-precious stones were fashioned into beads. At the right of the entrance to the presumed inner shrine was a crude squat seated male statuette of oolitic limestone. The statuette is aston- ishingly small to have been placed in a prominent position at the jamb of the chamber entrance. A considerably superior piece, but clearly a companion, was excavated in a plastered shrine incorporated into the " palace " (Mound C). The latter statuette is a female of approximately the same size and properly in situ on a raised bench at one end of the room. LEVEL 3 A. Clay and Terracotta 1. Clay label.

Above a cup (?) on the extended hand is a peculiarly organized group of eight globes. The whole is executed in the drill-hole style. B. Stone 1. Hematite cylinder seal. In this much abraded scene, the goddess Lama wearing flounced robe and horned crown raises her hands before a male deity clad in a short tunic and dangling a mace. Another figure behind the deity may carry an offering. The drill-hole technique should place the seal at the end of the Old Babylonian dynasty. 2. Bearded male torso. A traditional statuette has been carved from an inferior local stone (for a photograph, see Expedition 7 (1964), p. 39). Many of the facial details of the original portrait are now missing as the more porous parts of the stone have been chipped and worn away. The bareheaded and bare-shouldered man has a neatly-fashioned seven- strand beard, familiar to us from Old Babylonian representations. The statuette was broken diagonally from the right shoulder; dowel holes with traces of bitumen remaining indicate that an attempt was made to repair the break in antiquity. 3. Grotesque stone mask. We found at the north side of the entrance to the inner temple courtyard of Level 2 a rectangular stone archi- tectural block, some 1.10 meters in length. A life-sized demonic face (Fig. 10) is carved on one end of the block. The block was in an obvi- ously reused position and several architectural problems are involved, which must for the time being remain unanswered. At any rate, the face has been neatly bisected vertically and only one half remains. The significant features are the broad spirals which terminate under the chin, and the highly individualized grooved hair form. Oblong eyes emphasized by heavy grooving accentuate the exotic aspect of the face. There seem to be no extant parallels earlier than the Old Babylonian period for precisely this facial type. Small terracotta masks, which are almost all unstratified, at Nippur, Ur, Sippar, and Kish may survive from the First Dynasty of Babylon. Exactly the same type of face appears on groups of Old Babylonian seals. It is more than likely that even earlier a similar representation had been established as Humbaba, the dragon of the great cedar forest described in both Sumerian and Akkadian versions of the Gilgamesh epic. In the British Museum, a terracotta 38 dated epigraphically to the 7th century B. C. is inscribed on the reverse as follows: "If the entrails (resemble) the face of Huwawa, it is the omen of Sargon, who ruled the land. If ...... , the house of a man will extend. Hand of Ardi-Nannar, the seer, son of Kubburum, the seer." 39 This terracotta and an associated group are omen guides employed 38 Sidney Smith, "The Face of Humbaba," Univ. of Liverpool Annals of Archae- ology and Anthropology 11 (1924), pp. 107-114 and pl. 13 (BM 116624). 8 Ibid., p. 113. 59</page><page sequence="21">Bulletin of the American Schools of Oriental Research by priests in their interpretation of entrails. The earlier grooves and ridges of the Humbaba face have evolved to the point that they actually resemble coiled intestines, used in a clever schematic way to outline the features of the face. The manner in which Humbaba's roles and repre- sentations develop concurrently will be the subject of another article. FIG. 10. Bisected stone face of Humbaba at entrance to temple antechamber. Suffice it to say here that this is the first representation of Humbaba in Northern Mesopotamia, by far the largest ever known, and completely unique in the medium of stone sculpture. Humbaba at Tell al-Rimah was probably placed, for a protective or apotropaic purpose, at the entrance to the temple. 60</page><page sequence="22">Number 178 April, 1965 SITE B An exploratory trench located on the northeast corner of the spreading apron flanking the temple mound revealed the only traces of Late Assyrian habitation at Rimah. Several respectable domestic structures contained circular storage bins, plastered sleeping platforms, and shallow plastered troughs. The sampling of ceramic material recovered com- pares with the pottery at Nimrud of the 9th to 7th centuries B. C. SITE C The initial trenching of this area was an attempt to locate the major limiting walls on the west and south of the site. Neither of these could be clearly established for the upper levels, and we then proceeded with a more penetrating investigation of the interior of the mound. We hoped to clear a large share of at least the second level plan in the central part; the method was to work from the limits of our original L-shaped trench toward the center and highest area of the tell. In addition three rather sizable deep sondages were planned in hopes of acquiring some notion of the total occupational depth. The successful sondage continued through nine floors to a depth greater than eight meters. In the case of a principally secular mound such as this, one expects a greater number of architectural floors. It is only tentatively possible to suggests a corre- lation between the levels of Sites A and C. Eventually a complete ceramic analysis should lend precision to the proposed scheme. Site A Level I a. Jar of 30 tablets; limu Abi-ilu (reign of Shalmaneser I) Level II a. Tablet fragments in "Nuzi type script " b. Mitannian style cylinder seals Level III a.

Levels I and II The seals, pottery, and other material in the fill above the first floors were no later than Middle Assyrian, and could not generally be dis- tinguished from that between Floor 1 and Floor 2. Therefore we shall consider these together as a single cultural stratum. In most instances the walls framing the rooms were used continuously. 61</page><page sequence="23">Bulletin of the American Schools of Oriental Research We were able to excavate eleven rooms, both square and rectangular, ranging from two to five meters on a side; the rooms were all inter- connected, often on all four sides. Interior features, where they occurred, were predominantly domestic and consisted of raised or sunken ovens, plastered vats, and benches. An average brick size for the level is .34 X .34 X .11 M. A.

Functional items in bronze consisted of needles, awls, pins, and a javelin point. 2. A portion of a simple bronze ring was the only trace of jewellery recovered. G. Stone 1. Beads were present in the following materials: Steatite; agate; carnelian. Shapes were either round or cylindrical. 2. A small trapezoidal basalt dish was one of our few stone vessels. 3. Steatite whetstones and a diorite loom weight complete the list. LEVEL 3 In the area originally called Sondage I and the later expansion of this trench we cleared through Levels 3 and 4 to Level 5; each was architecturally distinct. The same sequence was evident in Sondage 2. In Sondage 3 we find architecture and a built grave of Level 3, but Levels 4 and 5 are not well-defined. The first floor in " North Area" corresponds in depth to Level 3 throughout the mound and consists of fill from the surface down to this first floor. Consequently we do not know enough yet of Levels 4 and 5 to make any refined chronological distinctions. For the moment, we must be content with a broad stratum because the material from all three levels corresponds in general to the period of Sau''atar at Nuzi. 40 Cf. above and footnote 30. 63</page><page sequence="25">Bulletin of the American Schools of Oriental Research The area of Sondage I was occupied with regular rooms, oriented much like those above them. Scattered pottery drain sections were in evidence. Brick sizes varied between .32 X .32 X .10 and .38 X .38 X .10 m. One side of the scarp in Sondage 3 presented the inside wall of a room with a carefully bonded-in doorway surmounted by a true arch. The arch had continued in use in upper levels, but the sill then was raised and the back filled in to form a niche. A grave was cut into the surface of Floor 3 just to the left of the arched doorway. The " North Area " consisted of a complex of rooms separated from the other rooms in the building by an open court. A plastered shrine room was the chief focus of the unit. Walls of the Level 3 shrine appeared to be based on a predecessor in Level 4. Within Level 3 there were four phases of building. The earliest Level 3 shrine was a simple rectangular room with an entrance on one long side near the western end. In the next phase three rooms were added around the courtyard, but the shrine remained an entity and the room built against the east end did not share a wall. Additional walls were constructed in the court in the third phase, and finally the two adjoining magazines were roofed with pitched brick barrel vaults. The shrine itself was remarkable for several extraordinary raised bulg- ing features covered with plaster. On the plastered bench in the north- east corner, a female statuette was discovered in situ. A. Burial Evidence 1. A red-painted jar almost half a meter tall was set into the uneven floor of a much-disturbed room at a forty-five degree angle. The jar was two-thirds filled with smashed human bones; half of these were badly burned and some fossilized. About three-quarters of the fragments were identifiable; among them were portions of three skulls and seven femoral epiphyses of large adults. Thus we have partial remains of at least four individuals. A curious feature was the fact that there were no teeth present. 2. A grave was cut into the plastered floor of Sondage 3 just to the north of the arched doorway. The rectangular form of the grave is framed on the outside by two courses of mud-bricks. The skeleton is extended, prone, and in a poor state of preservation. He was probably a male of about twenty-five years; his only equipment consisted of a thin bronze ring. The two halves of an enormous pithos were used to cover the skeleton. 3. Indication of another type of burial emerged as we passed from Level 3 to Level 4 in Sondage I. A doorsill, when lifted, proved to be one of the longer sides of a pottery sarcophagus of the short type, ca. 80 cm. long. Thus we have three of the wide variety of existent second millennium burial forms represented at Tell al-Rimah. B. Pottery and Terracotta 1. The drinking cup statistics referred to in previous levels indicate 64</page><page sequence="26">Number 178 April, 1965 a preponderance of ring bases, and a lesser number of pedestal bases among the cups in Level 3. 2. Additional terracotta wheels were recovered, of which one was 24 cm. in diameter with concentric circle decoration. 3. Pottery wall nails A total of nine wall nails or portions thereof were excavated in an area of disturbed fill of Sondage I above Floor 3. The tenth nail is quite different, having a short shank, and was actually found in Level 2 outside of Room 5. The general form is a giant peg with a convex disk head; this head is separated from the shank by a collar flange. The shank tapers to an end which may be either pointed or blunt. Shanks are both square and round in section and often have finger indentations along their length. Many are pierced through vertically. All are covered with bitumen on disk and neck, either as decoration or waterproofing; this is perhaps dependent upon whether they decorated the outside or inside of a building. The largest has a total length of 29.5 cm., which is greater than any others extant from Mesopotamian sites. This class of objects is represented at Tell Fakhariyah,41 Nuzi,42 Assur,43 and Tepe Gawra.44 The examples most similar in appearance all date to around the middle of the Second Millennium and somewhat later. Only at Nuzi were several of a more elaborate glazed variety found in situ, fastened in the wall at about head level, and inserted up to the flange.45 They were apparently decorative, forming a horizontal band around the interior of the room. Miss Kantor points out in her summary 46 that all known wall pegs of the flanged type are associated with temples or palace chapels. There- fore the discovery of this group in a Rimah building, already determined as monumental in its earlier periods, gives us our strongest support for calling it a palace. C. Frit 4 1. Several frit beads of types known from Site A turned up in the fill. D. Bronze Metal was sparsely represented in this level by a pin, a needle, and a disk. E. Stone 1. Black steatite cylinder seal.

Across the upper part of the seal is a band of concentric circles. 2. White limestone feline couchant. More than one-half of the jar lid containing the animal's hind-quarters is missing. The couchant carved feline crosses his forepaws and turns his head left. The body is covered with small drill-holes which contain no trace of pigment. The sculpting is fairly well executed, but not remarkable. This piece has been carefully described as a feline because the form of the animal's head is unquestionably leonine; however the punctuations suggest only a leopard. One must conclude that the artist was personally acquainted with neither beast. The gesture of a lion crossing his forepaws before him is not familiar in the corpus of Mesopotamian art.48 However, much larger representa- tions of Egyptian lions perform this way in the 18th Dynasty and later.49 In the time of Tutankhamun a lion behaves in a similar manner,50 recumbent on the lid of a cylindrical cosmetic jar. The carving of the Rimah lion, although essentially in the same spirit, is not technically comparable. Our Rimah lid manifesting Egyptian influence, fashioned of an indifferent near-marble, was very probably carved by a coastal Syrian or Phoenician craftsman who was generally familiar with the subject of lions, but had not actually seen either lion or leopard.51 3. Calcite statuette of a seated female. This is by far the better of the two stone statuettes found this year. " Mosul marble" is a much harder and more compact stone than oolitic limestone and hence a likelier raw material for the sculptor. The basic form is an elongated cube, some 25 cm. high, from which the angles have not been eliminated. Details of the arms are indicated in relief, beginning with the shoulders on the sides and terminating in fists on the front of the stone. The surface of the face is flat and ovoid in contour; slight depressions mark the features. Breasts, shoulder blades, and buttocks are marked by undercutting and relief; the rest of the body is absorbed into the block upon which she is seated. A tapering queue extends down her back below the waistline and the terminus is incised. The two Rimah statuettes must have some connection with cult prac- tises. We might well have considered the location of the small male statuette at the temple entrance as fortuitous, had we not found the 4 I am very grateful to Prof. Edith Porada for this observation. ,* Mr. David O'Connor, Assistant Curator of the Egyptian Section, University of Pennsylvania Museum, graciously pursued this subject and provided me with refer- ences: Ursula Schweitzer, Li6we und Sphinx im alten Agypten, Agyptologische Forschungen, Heft 15 (Gliickstadt u.

The calcite lion is markedly similar in conception, inasmuch as the lid dimensions are nearly the same, his head is turned, and he reclines with crossed forepaws on the lid of a cosmetic jar. The Tutankhamun lion is decorated with incision and paint. 51 The convention of crossed forepaws was certainly known in the Levant by Early Ptolemaic times. Cf.

Other examples of this class of objects were found at Tepe Gawra.-2 A 25 cm. high limestone figurine is described as bell-shaped, rectangular in cross-section, and surmounted by an ovoid head. Of the three statuettes discovered, none was found in a significant context. The illustrated statuette comes from Stratum 3 (17th century and later) as does one other; the third was in a wall of Level 4. There are at least six unpublished statuettes belonging in the same category from Tell Billa distributed in Strata 1, 2, and 3.53 This group is really closer in spirit and execution than any of the others. Certain resemblances in style and technique for the whole class can be noted in the 34 cm. high stone statuettes from Tell al-Fakhariyah.54 It has heretofore been difficult for excavators to consider these semi- comical figurines as a serious sculptural division. As more are found in valid context, and as the quantity increases, we shall endeavor to reappraise the matter. LEVEL 4 This is an elusive, and not yet well defined level. Walls are in different alignment than those above. On the south side of the mound are sections of paved platforms constructed in Period 5. One room has a plastered floor. Objects consist of a wall nail fragment and a bronze arrow point. LEVEL 5 This level is considerably more complicated, involving three building phases, and consisting of a greater deposit. It is necessary to take account of these multiple phases; otherwise the relationship of built drains to the walls above them is inexplicable. There are three sloped drains running under two major walls and the paved platform already discussed. Also evident are two walls and two doorways of a rather small room containing an oven and a jar with plastic rope decoration set into the ground. A pentagonal mud-brick oven is located outside of the room in the latest phase. The most interesting object recovered was a fragmentary light buff jar ca. 22 cm. high painted with reddish-brown horizontal bands. The body tapers upward into a cylindrical form from a low carination. It has not been possible to find any close parallels, although the writer suspects it may be a version of "Habur ware." 55 LEVEL 6 This level is evident only in Sondages 2 and 3.

Enormous walls seemed to be constructed parallel to one another, with passages 75 cm. wide between. The facades were well finished and consistently stepped. We conjectured that this could be a section of magazines, although nothing remained within. LEVELS 7-9 Our knowledge of the last three floors or levels is based entirely upon evidence from Sondage 2. Virgin soil, resembling closely that from the bottom of the wadi bordering the city wall, was reached at a depth of 8.40 m. Twenty cm. above the virgin soil the foundations of a mud-brick wall begin. This wall is mostly concealed by the scarp, but rises nearly two meters, so that the top of it forms part of the surface of Floor 7. The facade of this wall also is thrice-stepped. Floor 9 occurs at the first setback and Floor 8 at the second. The bricks of Levels 8 and 9 measure .40 X .40 X .09 m. and those of Level 10, .41 X .41 X .10 m. Fragments of three Old Babylonian tablets were found loose in the fill between Floors 8 and 9 at a depth of ca. 7.50 m. from the surface. The tablets, as initially read, contain both Hurrian and Amorite names. One is a letter concerning a judicial case, another a list of personal names, and the third a list of rations which may be fruits. TOWARD AN HISTORICAL AND CULTURAL INTERPRETATION Of the Old Assyrian period at Rimah we list tablets, seal impressions, and an architectural Humbaba among the finds. As one would expect, the population appears to be mixed, and strong cultural ties with southern Mesopotamia are obvious. If we take into consideration the fact that a life-size demon mask (of an Old Babylonian Humbaba) is carefully carved on a large architectural member, we are justified in concluding that the temple of 1800 B. C. is a religious building of some importance. Because the Mound C tablets are found very close to virgin soil, the founding of the town is likely to have been contempor- aneous with the Old Babylonian period. In the " Mitannian " or "Nuzi " phase, the bulk of our material is drawn from temple storerooms. The finest contributions are of glass or glazed objects, some of-which are unique; Rimah may prove to be a pioneering center of glazing. Numerous object parallels with Tell Billa, Nuzi, and Tepe Gawra exist here. Influences from Mari, North Syria, and the Levant have been noted. Art styles and the presence of Mediter- ranean sea shells support the theory of links to the west. Because the Kassites controlled southern Mesopotamia at this time, one usually assumes little in the way of cultural radiation from that direction; never- theless the quantity of Persian Gulf sea shells indicate that certain contacts were maintained. By Middle Assyrian times the temple mound had diminished con- siderably in importance; less than prosperous domestic structures occu- pied the former temple courtyards. The fortunate recovery of a jar of thirteenth century tablets contributes valuable information regarding the trade items then in circulation. The proportion of metal was of particular 68</page><page sequence="30">Number 178 April, 1965 interest because Rimah may be a commercial connection between Assur and the Anatolian cities to the north. The squat crude statuary relates to a strong local (i. e., the Mosul area) tradition with North Syrian affinities. Late Assyrian material was evident only in Site B, and the discoveries there were not historically informative.</page></plain_text>
