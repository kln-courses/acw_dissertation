<plain_text><page sequence="1">Shaul Magid THE SPINOZISTIC SPIRIT IN MORDECAI KAPLAN'S REVALUATION OF JUDAISM Biblical criticism can only ruin a faith that has already been weakened.1 -Emmanuel Levinas, "The Spinoza Case" Mordecai Kaplan, radical Jew and architect of the only indigenous movement in American Jewry, Reconstructionism, rarely mentions Spi- noza in his voluminous writings.2 He is primarily influenced by the philosophical pragmatism of John Dewey, William James, and the nineteenth-century American transcendentalists.3 In fact, at first glance Kaplan's functionalist utilitarian program shares little with Spinoza's highly idealistic and rigorous method and doctrine.4 Moreover, Kap- lan's explicit intent to reconstruct rather than deconstruct Judaism it- self seems quite anti-Spinozistic.5 However, the more we distance our- selves from Spinoza's highly critical engagement with Judaism and the more we look for the roots of Kaplan's constructive program, the more Spinoza's ideas can be seen to resonate in Kaplan's thinking.6 Unlike Spinoza, Kaplan does not scrutinize the biblical tradition and its classical interpreters (rabbinic and medieval) in an attempt to un- veil the ways in which the biblical message has been misrepresented in the Jewish tradition. Rather he begins his project by deconstructing modern interpretations ofJudaism, embodied in twentieth-century Jew- ish denominations, in an attempt to exhibit how modern Judaism has thus far failed to meet the needs of modern Jewish civilization.7 As a Jewish "insider," Kaplan's goal is to reconstruct Judaism for twentieth- century America. His numerous attempts at reconstruction, however, al- most always begin with a deconstructive prelude and utilize what I will argue are Spinozistic premises as the foundation of his religious critique.8 I will attempt to demonstrate this claim in three distinct ways. First, by reviewing the already well documented claim that Spinoza's critique of traditional religion in his Tractatus Theologico-Politicus was intended to lay the groundwork for the freedom of philosophical inquiry by di- Modern Judaism 20 (2000): 159-180 ? 2000 by Oxford University Press</page><page sequence="2">160 Shaul Magid vorcing religion from philosophy, the former being the model of piety and obedience and the latter the model for the pursuit of (philosophi- cal) truth. Kaplan adopts Spinoza's basic position that the Bible (and Judaism) is not concerned with questions of philosophical truth. How- ever, Kaplan uses this bifurcation of piety and philosophy for very dif- ferent ends. His concern for the survival of Jewish civilization, as op- posed to Spinoza's concern for free philosophical inquiry, leads him to conclude that Judaism needs to be reconstructed from the ashes of the Spinozistic critique in order to serve as the ideological foundation for Jewish survival. Second, Spinoza's critique of biblical, rabbinic, and medieval stances toward the transcendent and supernatural idea of God will be juxtaposed with Kaplan's adaptation and reformulation of Spinoza's immanentism and the exaltation of nature common in many transcendentalist and sci- entific interpretations ofSpinoza's doctrine.9 Kaplan's God idea, which he called transnaturalism, is presented as an alternative to the idealized God of liberal Judaism and the radically transcendent God of Lithuanian and German Orthodoxy. '0Although it is not clear whether Kaplan's transnat- uralism constitutes a new chapter in Jewish theological reflection, he claimed that it offered an antidote to the outdated models in both the lib- eral and traditional camps of early-twentieth-century Judaism." Finally, I will touch upon Spinoza and Kaplan's idea of the sacred in Judaism and upon the ways in which Kaplan adopts Spinoza's rela- tivization of the sacred in order to represent the source of sacrality in the people rather than in the object of worship. Although Kaplan schol- ars have often viewed his idea of the sacred as emerging from socio- logical theories of religion from Durkheim to Eliade, Spinoza also plays an important role in Kaplan's understanding of holiness and its place in a reconstructed Judaism. Most interpretations of Spinoza's critique of traditional religion share the assumption that Spinoza sought to devalue the sacred status of the Bible as transmitting absolute (i.e., philosophical) truth. In other words, he sought to refute the common medieval assumption that phi- losophy is the handmaiden of theology. This underlies Spinoza's state- ment that "he who makes reason and philosophy ancillary to theology has to accept as divinely inspired utterances and prejudices of a com- mon people of long ago, which will gain hold on his understanding and darken it."'12 His devaluation of scripture and its premodern philo- sophical interpretation, beginning perhaps with Philo and reaching its apex in Moses Maimonides, is an attempt to free philosophy from the clutches of both the biblical and the medieval philosophical world view.13 For Spinoza the synthetic program of medieval Jewish philoso- phy was largely an attempt to conceal the inherent flaws in biblical re- ligion by offering interpretations that intentionally manipulated the</page><page sequence="3">The Spinozistic Spirit in Kaplan 161 biblical text.14 Included in this attempt is the philosophical defense of revelation, miracles, and the personal providential God who acts in his- tory.1'5 Spinoza's devaluation ofJudaism was intended to make room for something new and unprecedented, i.e., a free-thinking, humanistic society liberated from the obligation to conform to the traditional norms of piety and superstition and from the mistaken belief that scrip- tural religion is the carrier of philosophical truth.16 Kaplan's devaluation of the current forms of Judaism (exhibited most prominently in his critique of American Jewish denominations) attempted to usurp what he called the "transvaluation" of Judaism in the modern era. This term surfaces often in Kaplan's depiction of mod- ern Judaism and serves as the backbone of his critique of tradition. In evaluating the trends in contemporary Judaism we need to know as accu- rately as possible what pre-modern Judaism had to say concerning God, the Jewish People, the Torah, and the destiny of human life. We have to re-capture as much of the original spirit as possible. All too often tradition is invoked to validate as authentic whatever derives its authoritative character from its con- nection with the past. It is then that appeal to tradition is popular, intended to lead us into believing that nothing really catastrophic has happened to sever that connection. We are lured into assuming that we can go about our business as of old, without having to resort to any drastic measures to set things right. That is why we should be on our guard against forming a distorted picture of TraditionalJudaism. Such a distorted picture would minimize the effort which has to be exerted in rendering Traditional Judaism relevant to the spiritual needs ofJews today.'7 Transvaluation, which underlies the above quotation, is synonymous with deception, usually but not always calculated, intended simultane- ously to subvert modern sensibilities about tradition and to reify the contextual meaning of tradition. Spinoza makes a similar claim with very different objectives: [W]e see most people endeavoring to hawk about their own commentaries as the word of God, and giving their best efforts, under the guise of religion, to compelling others to think as they do: we generally see, I say, theologians anx- ious to learn how to wring their inventions and sayings out of the sacred text, and to fortify them with divine authority. s18 Kaplan defines transvaluation in a similar manner, as a subversive move "[to] introduce radically new values under the guise of ancient tradition."'9 For Kaplan this is not only true in Orthodoxy but in liberal Judaism as well. The Reform attempt to argue its position as rooted in the deep recesses of the prophetic tradition is as transvaluative as Or- thodoxy's attempt to justify halakah as an inherent part ofJudaism be- fore the rabbinic period. Because all interpretation is contextual, any attempt to claim that interpretation is synonymous with what is being interpreted is transvaluative.</page><page sequence="4">162 Shaul Magid Kaplan's transvaluation reflects Spinoza's critique of the medieval project by which philosophical ideas foreign to scripture were used to interpret the intention of scripture.20 Revealing the deception of rab- binic and medieval exegesis by stating that "Scripture must be sought by Scripture alone," Spinoza claimed to understand the Bible for what it was and not for what the tradition (either rabbinic or philosophic) wanted it to be.21 Kaplan, contra Spinoza, did not think this deception was wrong in any absolute or philosophical sense. A functionalist thinker, Kaplan believed the worth of any religious ideology to be inextricably tied to its ability to inspire its constituency. Transvaluation was wrong for Kaplan simply because it prevented Jewish civilization from main- taining an intimate and inspired relationship to Judaism. Transvalued Judaism, therefore, needed to be exposed for what it was and then re- constructed.22 Reconstruction is a philosophical term Kaplan borrows from John Dewey. Dewey defined the reconstruction of philosophy as "the at- tempt to state..,. causes and results (i.e., the perennial questions of re- ligion) in a way freed from incompatible inherited factors... [It] is... the endeavor to undo the entanglement [of the past]..,. to come to a free and unhindered expression."23 In Kaplan's mind undoing the en- tanglement of the past requires demythologizing Judaism and then re- presenting it as viable only in light of its exposed limitations. Only then can the "perennial questions" of Jews about Judaism be addressed without layers of apologetic garb presented as tradition. "[E]very one of the modern trends in Judaism ... cannot possibly be the original Ju- daism of tradition. It can only be an adaptation of it to the spirit of the times, whether that fact is recognized or not."24 Kaplan maintained that the creative impulse of reconstruction must follow devaluation. As represented by Spinoza and Dewey, this impulse necessitated the historicization of biblical and rabbinic tradi- tion in order to allow a reappraisal of Judaism unhindered by trap- pings of tradition. However, and this is crucial for Kaplan, reconstruc- tion begins with a search of the historicized tradition for eternal ideas or core values that could be reformulated as the foundation for a re- constructed modern religion.2" On this point Kaplan is highly critical of positive-historical Judaism (and later Conservative Judaism), which he claims never offered any revaluation of the historicized tradition other than a romanticized notion that we should adhere to Jewish ritual and law because it has served our people through the ages.26 According to Kaplan, conservative Judaism succeeded at only half the project (de- valuation) and never provided a viable alternative that could inspire those Jews alienated from tradition by adopting Conservative Judaism's historicism. Reconstructionism attempts to complete this modern project. Its</page><page sequence="5">The Spinozistic Spirit in Kaplan 163 methodology is rooted in functional exegesis, an interpretive scheme whose sole goal is to serve the vitality of the religious community.27 This interpretive turn became necessary in a postmythical (post-traditionalist) and posthistoricist (post-Wissenschaft) world where the biblical narrative had become devalued and no longer spoke to the soteriological needs of most Jewish people. For Kaplan, Jews are not carriers of the tradition; they are architects of the tradition to serve their salvific needs. Underlying Kaplan's entire project is the assumption that religion is re-created in every civilization to meet the needs of the civilization it serves. Com- mon in all cultures, he calls this need the collective soterical impulse of survival. Spinoza's reading of biblical religion was not intended to ascertain eternal truths that could be formulated into a new religious ideology. He had no intention of following his devaluation of tradition with re- construction. In fact, his devaluation of biblical religion is intended to achieve the opposite result: to initiate free thinking that could serve as the foundation of a new humanistic society based on philosophical truth and not superstition (tradition). Kaplan utilized Spinoza's basic bifur- cation of philosophy and religion to free religion from philosophy. But this bifurcation became the foundation for Kaplan's reconstruction of Judaism. It can hardly be coincidental that the three layers Kaplan viewed as in need of revaluation; i.e., the Bible, the Second Commonwealth, and the rabbinic period, loosely correspond to the three layers of the Israelite/Jewish religion devalued (i.e., historicized and diminished in truth value) in Spinoza's Tractatus.28 It is also important to note the torturous relationship of both Spinoza and Kaplan to Moses Mai- monides, the prototypic synthesizer of tradition and philosophy.29 Whereas Spinoza preferred medieval exegetes like R. Abraham Ibn Ezra, whose exegetical program was largely inner-biblical3o and philo- sophical, Kaplan preferred Jewish pietists like the eighteenth-century Italian, R. Moses Luzzato, whose Mesilat Yesharim incorporated little philosophical analysis.31 Both preferred those who maintained the dis- tinction between truth and piety, Spinoza opting for the former, Kaplan for the latter. Kaplan's pragmatism and functional approach to the Bible focused on truth only insofar as it yielded a framework for social identity and deepened the understanding of historical destiny. Therefore, Kaplan's Spinozistic conclusion that the Bible is soteriological, being primarily concerned with human salvation, does not carry the negative message Spinoza may have intended in the Tractatus. The innate human need to believe in the possibility of salvation, which Kaplan considered self- fulfillment, is the foundation of Kaplan's understanding of belief in God. Kaplan states that "demythologizing the Hebrew Bible transposes its</page><page sequence="6">164 Shaul Magid theology from the key of supernaturalism and what man means to God into the key of religious humanism and what God means to man."32 De- mythologizing the tradition has a particular meaning for Kaplan. It was not about historical reconstruction nor about unveiling the flaws of the tradition. Rather, it was always about creating a context in which reli- gion can be reconfigured. Seeing the Bible in its historical context and stripping away the garments of apologetic interpretation allowed Ka- plan to posit what he felt were the core eternal values ofJudaism that lie beneath the contextual surface. The purpose of Kaplan's critical methodology was to expose and disable transvaluation, which he viewed as a dishonest approach to reading religion. It is a first step in ajourney that ends only when the community once again feels inspired by the bib- lical message. Kaplan's adaptation of Spinoza's bifurcation of philosophy and re- ligion requires further clarification.33 Distinguishing religion from phi- losophy is not new in Spinoza. The debate over the viability of philos- ophy in interpreting religion was one of the most heated in medieval Jewish philosophy. Beginning with Sa'adia Gaon and Judah Ha-Levi, and climaxing in Hasdei Crescas's critique of Maimonides, Jews through- out the medieval period argued against using philosophy and philo- sophical analysis to understand religion."34 Can we not see in these clas- sical medieval figures the precedent for Kaplan's claim that the Bible should not be read philosophically? The answer, I think, is twofold. First, Ha-Levi and Crescas' separa- tion of philosophy from religion was largely antiphilosophical and polem- ical.35 Maintaining that revelation was the sole arbiter of truth, these medieval thinkers questioned the ability of human reason to determine this truth via philosophy. Kaplan is not antiphilosophical in that way. He believed that philosophy had a very important function in society and that it could determine truth (which, of course, was very different from his medieval predecessors). Kaplan only believed that interpret- ing the Bible philosophically was dishonest (i.e., transvaluative) because the Bible makes no philosophical claims.36 Medieval thinkers rejected philosophical interpretation of the Bible to defend the truth claims of the Bible that were weakened by exposure to philosophical (i.e., ra- tional) analysis. Kaplan, on the other hand, rejects philosophical exe- gesis in order to expose the weaknesses of biblical truth claims (revela- tion, miracle, and election) and then reconstruct Judaism differently. In this regard Kaplan's adaptation is closer to Spinoza's bifurcation than to his medieval ancestors'. Unlike Spinoza, though, Kaplan had no inter- est in using his critique to forge a new path in philosophical thinking. He merely felt that the biblical world view, as is the case with any world view, is contextual and thus limited. Medieval thinkers defended in the face of philosophical question-</page><page sequence="7">The Spinozistic Spirit in Kaplan 165 ing the biblical claims of a personal, transcendent God. Kaplan, follow- ing Spinoza, denied God's transcendance, denied miracles as described in the Bible, and denied the biblical claim of election.37 While he de- fended the Bible as a living testament to piety, Kaplan denied many of its most fundamental theological claims. This, too, reflects Spinoza's as- sessment of the Bible to some degree, although Kaplan, unlike Spi- noza, maintained that piety required a ritualistic foundation. Spinozism is thus a more viable antecedent for Kaplan's bifurcation of philosophy and religion, because Kaplan's division allows both to remain intact (it is not polemical or apologetic), even as he rejects basic biblical ideas. Kaplan sometimes unveils his Spinozistic tendencies in quite ex- plicit fashion. In Judaism as a Civilization he asserts that "[the] concep- tion of God [in the Bible] should not interest us for what it seeks to tell concerning the metaphysical nature of the Diety [i.e., philosophical truth], but the difference it made in the behavior of the Jew."38 Com- pare this with Spinoza's comments in the Tractatus: Scriptural doctrine contains no lofty speculations nor philosophical reasoning, but only very simple matters, such as could be understood by the slowest in- telligence. ... [I]t follows that no knowledge is commended in the Bible save that which is necessary for enabling all men to obey God in the manner stated, and without which they would become rebellious, or without the discipline of obe- dience. .. [T]he aim of Scripture is only to teach obedience.39 Kaplan apparently accepts Spinoza's bifurcation of religion and philos- ophy, distinguishing as he does between philosophical truth, which Kap- lan called metaphysics or cosmology, and human behavior, which is based on the innate human need for salvation and which both Kaplan and Spinoza call piety.40 Spinoza and Kaplan differ in regard to the ul- timate goal of such a division. Spinoza sought to free philosophical thinking from the confines of religious superstition. Kaplan sought to free religion from the clutches of theological reflection that left its con- stituency uninspired or unable to believe in religion's inherent value. Kaplan, living in a society deeply affected by Spinoza's call for secular humanism, used Spinoza's demythologization of the Bible (arguably a cornerstone of twentieth-century secularism) to construct a new Ju- daism, free of metaphysics and focused on the innate human need for fulfillment (Kaplan's secularized version of salvation). Amid the throes of America's melting pot ideology, Kaplan knew that Jewish survival could no longer be accomplished by secular uni- versalism but that it required a nonhierarchical particularism. In this sense Kaplan envisioned in the 1920s and '30s what would later be called multiculturalism. One of the pillars of Kaplan's nonhierarchical particularism was liberation from the Bible as the embodiment of eter-</page><page sequence="8">166 Shaul Magid nal truths. He argued, however, that the Bible did embody eternal val- ues (piety) that could be ascertained only when the Bible was seen for what it was, a product ofa historical period, necessarily flawed yet con- taining the seeds of renewal. Though raised in a traditional Jewish environment, Kaplan un- derstood the extent to which "free thinking" endangered the survival ofJudaism. But as a believer in free thinking and a devoted disciple of the modern project, he was unwilling to respond with a return to tra- dition. Kaplan felt that liberation from traditional modes of thought and behavior had produced a society that, to a large degree, could not maintain the ethical and pious standards of traditional religion. Con- versely, he saw that a return to traditional religious ideas, a transvalued ethos, could never occur in modern American Judaism. His alternative had to be pietistic but not transvaluative. II Spinozistic premises lurk behind Kaplan's reconstruction of Judaism in the God idea Kaplan called transnaturalism. Kaplan attempts to correct what he determined were three failed ideas of God: 1) the traditional idea of God as transcendent, coupled with the belief in a personal God who acts in history; 2) naturalism, which Kaplan under- stood as a God idea that contained no salvific meaning; and 3) exisen- tialism, which Kaplan viewed as a form of secular supernaturalism. While nineteenth-century American transcendentalists with whom Kaplan was familiar may have used Spinoza's pantheistic, quasi- mystical secular religiosity to bolster their spiritual critique of church- sanctioned religion, Kaplan was also familiar with early-twentieth-century "East SideJews" like Morris Cohen, Walter Lippman, and Horace Kallen, who used Spinozism as a way out ofJudaism altogether.4' Spinoza's God- intoxicated immanentism had become, for many university-educated first-generation American Jews, a transition from religion to science or, in Kaplanian parlance, a pure naturalism void of any soteriolog- ical purpose. Kaplan, quite aware of the danger of secularism yet un- wavering in his vow never to return to the outdated ideological mod- els of traditional Judaism, expressed his concern in the following manner. A good deal of the contemporary religious thinking is merely a groping toward this transnaturalist position. Most of that thinking goes by the name of reli- gious existentialism. Unfortunately, it is still weighted down by a nostalgic han- kering after the outlived supernaturalism. It is so fascinated by the element of absurdity or paradox in traditional doctrine as to discern in it nothing less than divine revelation.42</page><page sequence="9">The Spinozistic Spirit in Kaplan 167 If followed through to its logical conclusion, secularism has to adopt one of two courses-either, by resorting to the principle of reductionism, it reduces mind to matter and sheer physical energy, and thus robs human life of all direction, meaning and purpose [i.e., salvation-my addition], or it accepts these values of human life as no less objective than the objects of the senses.43 Kaplan assumes that the desire for salvation is an innate, healthy hu- man reflex.44 Religion is the way civilizations exercise that reflex, both the individuals in the community and the collective as a whole. Kaplan felt that the modern secular solution to this dilemma emerged as either existentialism or scientism. He considered existentialism to be secular supernaturalism in that it still focused on the principle of the unknown or on the paradox of existence as the matrix for human meaning and purpose. Kaplan understood scientism, which he viewed as a kind of nonpietistic Spinozism, as a naturalism void of soteriological meaning. For Kaplan, then, both Jewish existentialism and scientism were, for different reasons, products of late modernity's failure to produce an ad- equate reconstructed Judaism.45 Kaplan, who utilized the Spinozistic bifurcation of faith and phi- losophy, always viewed the quest for salvation as a basic human need not to be excluded from theological discourse. Salvation for Kaplan is sought in both philosophy and religion. He seems to have realized early in life that salvation required an integration of the individual's emotional life unprovided by many interpreters of Spinozistic secular- ism. Thus it was no surprise to Kaplan that late modern civilization, groping for a secular understanding of salvation, turned to religious existentialism that, in Kaplan's view, drew a sharp and unnatural dis- tinction between the perception of external order in nature and the hu- man need to find meaning in that order. For Kaplan, transnaturalism addressed this need46 and thereby became the cornerstone of his entire project of reconstruction. He believed that without transnaturalism late modern civilization would be doomed to the meaninglessness of scien- tism, which made no significant connection between nature and hu- man experience, or of existentialism, which never really overcame su- pernaturalism. Existentialism simply circumvented nature as the matrix of the human need for salvation. In short, Kaplan maintained through- out his long life that salvific meaning could only be attained via human understanding of the divine presence in nature.47 With the help of God, the Cosmic spirit that impels man ever to transcend him- self, man might learn to utilize the forces of nature for his salvation instead of for his annihilation.... Since the Torah upholds the natural order of which man's experience is a part, the spirit ofJewish tradition confirms the role of nature in man's quest fore the knowledge of God. Thus naturalism might well serve as a source of morality .... Re- jecting the belief that God revealed Himself through the spoken word, or through human incarnation, modern-minded men can arrive at a demythol-</page><page sequence="10">168 Shaul Magid ogized conception of God. That conception derives from those laws of nature or world order which impel man to make the most creative use of his life and world.48 It is not insignificant that Kaplan states specifically that "Torah," and not "Judaism,";' upholds the sanctity of the natural order as part of man's experience. The platonic bifurcation of world and soul that flows beneath so much Jewish pietism in the Middle Ages does not lend itself to Kaplan's assumption that naturalism might serve as a source for morality.49 Only in rare cases did supernatural conceps of God allow for nature to serve as such a source, even if nature was seen as imbued with divinity. This was because morality was largely determined by revela- tion, itself rooted outside nature.50 Nature may have been viewed as the consequence of God's actions (pe'ulot Elohim) but not divine in and of it- self. However, Kaplan argues, once "modern-minded men" stop be- lieving in this supernatural God, nature can become the focus of de- termining morality as divine will.51 A critical difference between Kaplan's and earlier theories of natural law in Judaism is Kaplan's ar- gument that only when we are liberated from the biblical God can we approach nature as a source for theological reflection. One important consequence of Kaplan's correlation of God and na- ture is his firm belief that civilization and the God idea must emerge solely from empirical observation of the organism and the natural or- der. Truth cannot be determined via revelation, which then filters down into the world, but must arise from our empirical observation of nature. This may reflect a superficial yet theologically significant un- derstanding of Spinoza's position that "God is the indwelling and not transient cause of all things."52 That is, God is not separate from the world. He is not a cause that passes into the world (via revelation, for example). God is a cause that was, is, and will remain in and of the world. This belief in nature as the source of our understanding or, in Kaplan's terms, our experience of God,53 presupposes a belief in the in- herent divinity of the natural order. This claim is quite conventional and has been advocated by philosophers and mystics throughout Jew- ish history. But Kaplan goes further. In the wake of his unequivocal re- jection of the transcendent God, Kaplan argues that the inherent di- vinity of the natural order (i.e., the power behind nature) is the only way human beings can access the experience of God and thereby acheive salvation. This is not because nature is the catalyst that facili- tates knowledge or experience of God, an idea with roots in Jewish the- ology from Maimonides to R. Moses Cordovero and later to Hasidism.54 By rejecting supernaturalism, Kaplan, unlike his predecessors, becomes an unabashed pantheist, a label others could never readily accept. Kaplan's belief in nature as the divine matrix in the human pursuit of meaning (i.e., soteriology) is also the source of his belief in the via-</page><page sequence="11">The Spinozistic Spirit in Kaplan 169 bility and even necessity of organic change of external forms of reli- gion. He views religious change and development within the scientific categories of survival and extinction.55 Just as the uniform operation of the natural law under ever-changing condi- tions eventuates in the conception of creative evolution, so the naturalist con- ception of God which underlies ethical religion can vouchsafe creative human development and save mankind from extinction.56 Organisms survive only by adapting to environmental change; extinc- tion is failure to adapt. If we take Kaplan at his word and identify nat- ural law with divinity, then emulating God would amount to emulating the natural process of change and evolution. According to Kaplan's view of God, traditional Judaism, which he claimed is guilty of stagna- tion and inflexibility, not only is no longer viable, but it is antireligious. It is not a manifestation of imitatio dei, i.e., emulating the natural processes of evolution and change. Kaplan states, "Organicity, or or- ganic reciprocity, operates as the wisdom of nature, of the body and of culture .... The cosmic process of organicity... is the source of the Godhood or the superpersonal force in man.""' He also uses this model to illustrate his antipathy toward atheism, which he sees as the extinc- tion of the God idea resulting from, among other things, the traditional unwillingness to adapt to new ideological circumstances. In a highly suggestive and provocative comment about atheism, he states, [w]hen we study the historical development of the God idea, we realize to what extent the mental habit of hypostasis (the tendency to treat qualities, attributes, relationships as though they had a separate existence) has been responsible for the contradictions and ambiguities that have discredited the conception of God and driven many to atheism.58 Elsewhere he argues that agnostics can no longer be authentic be- cause "[r]ejecting the anthropomorphic idea of God, [the agnostic] has become not merely an agnostic, but an ignostic. He does not know what the word 'God' means.""59 Kaplan here implies that agnosticism is the organic extinction of the God idea in human civilization, a result of so- ciety's inability to revalue the critical devaluation of traditional religion in the early modern period. However, Kaplan maintained that science need not yield to atheism: The modern Jew, even if the scientific view of the world has led to his placing reliance on the orderly processes of nature rather than on the possibility of their being suspended, can keep up his courage, in faith that the persistent and patient application of human intelligence to life's problems will release the creativity to solve them.o60 Modern Jewish civilization, for Kaplan, was a community in crisis. Modern life presented challenges to a traditional lifestyle, and tradi-</page><page sequence="12">170 Shaul Magid tional beliefs could no longer be maintained. Modernity also shook the foundations of the very instinct to survive, previously bolstered by re- ligious ideas about God and Israel's covenant with Him. Even though modern Judaism participated in the extinction of various forms of these ideas, the idea itself need not become extinct. Science can be used as a tool to reconfigure the God idea and to reconstruct religion around it. This is the foundation of Kaplan's transnatural God idea. The holy vo- cation for Kaplan was the application of human intelligence to form a new God idea out of the "orderly processes of nature." Transnaturalism was an attempt to counter the vulnerability of the scientific world view while adopting its basic principles. Kaplan sug- gests that the creative force that underlies the natural order has the ability to inspire the modern Jew to believe in the possibility of resolu- tion, i.e., to save God from extinction. This very act was the salvific in- stinct at its best. One need not, according to Kaplan, revert to outdated supernatural categories (i.e., the suspension of the orderly processes of nature) to maintain a belief in salvation. Ironically, Spinozistic imma- nentism, viewed as heretical by the traditional Judaism of his day, be- came the only way for Kaplan to prevent the extinction of the Jewish God idea and subsequently of the Jewish people. Whereas most of post- Spinoza Judaism (excluding secular Zionism), both liberal and tradi- tional, rallied against Spinoza and held that his critique could not be in- tegrated into any viable Jewish ideology, Kaplan implied that only through Spinoza's critique could Judaism survive. The spirituality of Kaplan's naturalistic empiricism had three dis- tinct goals.61 First, Kaplan sought to redeem the pantheistic position of radical immanence from the clutches of twentieth-century scientism, which he viewed as unable to meet the soteriological needs of modern civilization. Second, he sought to liberate the God idea from the tradi- tionalists who, guilty of transvaluation, were not legitimate interpreters of a modern Judaism. Finally, Kaplan wished to offer an alternative to existentialism, which he believed had provided the modern person nothing more than a refabricated supernaturalism. III The final example of the Spinozistc spirit in Kaplan's ideology emerges in Kaplan and Spinoza's understanding of the sacred, which follows closely on the heels of Kaplan's thinking on the God idea and its rela- tion to the natural world. Anthropologists, in their attempt to unearth the sources of sacrality in a religious culture, often turn to the religious communities rituals and ceremonies. This is even more fruitful if there is literature on the nature of these rituals and their function and pur-</page><page sequence="13">The Spinozistic Spirit in Kaplan 171 pose in the communities' overall religious ideology. Spinoza spent a great deal of time trying to understand the rituals of ancient Judaism, and he described in the Tractatus what he believed were its ideological flaws. His discussion also moves to the idea of the sacred, how it func- tioned in biblical Israel, and its place in his own ideas about religion. Spinoza begins with what one might call a contextualization of the sacred, limiting the realm of the sacred to the Bible. A thing is called sacred and divine when its purpose is to foster piety and reli- gion, and it is sacred only as long as men use it in a religious way. If men cease to be pious, the thing will likewise cease to be sacred; if it is devoted to impi- ous uses, then that which before was sacred will become unclean and pro- fane.62 Spinoza held that the holiness of any religious object, including Scrip- ture itself, consisted of the orientation and intention with regard to it. The object itself had no intrinsic holy value, although he does acknowl- edge that objects specified for religious practice in the Bible carried a particular potential for holiness because they were designated for these purposes. The worshipper defines the holy object through his or her relationship to that object. But if these words [i.e., Holy Writ] at a later time fall into disuse so as to be- come meaningless, or if the book falls into utter neglect, whether from malice or because men no longer feel the need of it, then both words and book will be without value and without sanctity. Thus it follows that nothing is sacred or profane or impure in an absolute sense apart from the mind, but only in rela- tion to the mind.63 Holiness is thus the religious expression of piety and obedience, ex- pressing such traits as justice and compassion. An object becomes sacred when used to invoke these and other ethical qualities in the wor- shipper. In the remainder of this chapter of the Tractatus, Spinoza argues that the Bible referred to religious objects in a similar fashion; he cites the Holy Ark, the Temple of Solomon, and the First Tablets as objects that became dispensable or, in Spinoza's reading, profaned when they were no longer catalysts of pious behavior. Kaplan takes a similar approach when he says that "[t]he distinc- tion between the holy and the profane, the sacred and the secular, is es- sentially the same as the distinction between the valuable and the worthless, the important and the trivial, the significant and the mean- ingless."64 For Spinoza, holiness in the Bible is that which fosters the in- tended goal of piety and obedience. For Kaplan, holiness is determined by the way in which the object or ritual enhances the value of the indi- vidual's life, or the community's value of itself, because only life, in all its forms, was truly holy. "The unity of Jewish religion must henceforth be based not on uniformity of theological belief or ritual practice but on a</page><page sequence="14">172 Shaul Magid common purpose to sanctify Jewish life."65 The Jewish notion of the sa- cred was that which incited the creative impulse in Jews toward self- and communal fulfillment. "The more that civilization functions as a way of salvation, the more intense will be the individual's sense of identification with it, and the realization of its worth, or its holiness."66 In different ways, Spinoza and Kaplan held that holiness was de- termined by the worshipper and his or her relation to the act or object of worship. For Kaplan in particular, kavannah as "intended meaning" actually created holiness by giving the ritual a salvific purpose. In many traditional Jewish approaches to the sacred, the act itself is holy because it is commanded, and the object is holy because it is distinguished (muk- dash) by divine decree. Thus ritual is holy because it is an affirmative re- sponse to divine will. Kaplan seeks to maintain a correlation between ritual and holiness without the notion of commandedness, that is, with- out the notion of the supernatural God who commands. Connecting ritual and holiness (santa) through meaning, he states, When sancta become meaningless, they cease..,. to be sancta. .. . To keep a re- ligion vital religious thought must be free [of past authority, my addition]. It is a sad commentary on the intellectual level of religious thought that a few- thinker is identified in the popular mind as an atheist .... A vitalized Jewish re- ligion must discountenance the use of ritual for the purpose of influencing the course of events in any other way than by its influence on the mind and heart of the worshipper. Nor should any ritual that is morally or aesthetically offen- sive be retained because in an earlier state of Jewish religion it was legally en- joined.67 For Kaplan, ritual is never intrinsically holy; it becomes holy only when it serves to deepen the mind and heart of the worshipper. The will that is served is the holy will of the individual, which seeks salvation. The underlying assumption of this reconfiguration of the relationship be- tween ritual and holiness begins in Kaplan's demythologization of the Bible as revealed text and in the biblical idea of God as commander. Spinoza and Kaplan denied both conventional renditions of reve- lation as they apply to the Bible and perceptions of any act in the Bible as inherently holy simply because it appeared in the Bible. The need to reconfigure the holy emerges organically from their rejection of the Bible as the product of revelation and their rejection of the idea of a God who commands. Both also rejected the "philistinism" of rabbinic Judaism for its attempt to create a dogmatic and irreconcilable di- chotomy between the sacred and profane, thereby solidifying the in- flexibility of Jewish ritual innovation unless dictated by rabbinic au- thority.68 David Novak notes, "Spinoza is very harsh with the Jews' insistence on perpetuating their unique ceremonial practices, and he accuses them of profaning what was originally sacred, thus severing it from any relation to God at all."69 This assessment of Spinoza would ap-</page><page sequence="15">The Spinozistic Spirit in Kaplan 173 ply to Kaplan as well, except for the fact that Kaplan did not support rejection of all rituals, only those rituals that do not carry any meaning. It should be noted that Spinoza's critique of traditional readings of the Bible and Judaism in general is only one small part of his philo- sophical project.70 Ultimately the Bible did not occupy a central place in Spinoza's thinking. For Kaplan, the Bible, both its rituals and doc- trines, was indispensable as a starting point of reconstruction.71 The Bible, however, could only serve this function if it was shown for what it is, a historically contextual expression of ancient Israel's struggle to forge an identity. Contra Spinoza, Judaism could not be marginalized and serve an ancillary role. Therefore, Kaplan had to show the ways in which the demythologized Bible, and only the demythologized Bible, could serve the salvific needs of the Jewish people. As a reconstructionist, Kaplan needed both to protect the biblical (Jewish) models of holiness and to interpret their relevance to the mod- ern Jew in order to secure the survival of Judaism as the way in which Jews live out their historical identity as a civilization. An antitraditional- ist, he did not seek to retain dogmatic or static, ritualistic forms of rab- binic Judaism.72 He refused to define any particular ritualistic form as holy-holiness was only the ability of that form to elicit salvific meaning. Yet rituals, though opposed by liberal Judaism, stood at the center of what Judaism was all about.7" Collective identity and historic destiny could only survive through the performance and relevance of religious ritual. Kaplan needed to argue that rituals, which were not intrinsically holy, could foster a life of holiness. To accomplish this he introduced the notion of memory as the primary function of religious ritual. Using the work of Emile Durkheim and other observers of religious ritual and ceremonies, Kaplan argued that one of the primary entrances to the realm of the holy is through the experience of historical destiny, the way one feels when participating in an activity that is uniquely Jew- ish. This consciousness of historical destiny is elicited by memory. Mem- ory is not nostalgia, which Kaplan sees as romantic and superfluous. Nostalgia is about "affording a sheltered retreat" from contemporary problems and, in its most negative valence, hoping for a return to a by- gone era.74 I understand memory, for Kaplan, to be something close to historical consciousness, a reminding, as it were, of one's individual pur- pose and relationship to the fate of the collective. As opposed to nostal- gia's backward trajectory, the trajectory of memory is inward. Memory transforms an act from the mundane to the holy by connecting it to a larger scheme of historical destiny. Ritual performance is vital in that, according to Kaplan, the quasi-mystical act elicits this memory from the practitioner. Kaplan attempts to fuse memory with tradition by claiming that tra- dition functions in a society the way memory functions in an individ-</page><page sequence="16">174 Shaul Magid ual.75 Both are used by human beings to maintain the relevance of an event or practice that is threatened by obsolescence. Mindfulness of this destiny constitutes the core of sacrality. That which elicits this mindful- ness is a sacred act. Kaplan argued civilization's unequivocal need for the sacred and the embodiment of the sacred in rituals particular to that community. His critique of classical Reform Judaism, which he sees as "religion turned ethics" fails miserably in this regard. Its universaliza- tion of the Jewish message destroys the particularistic memory of his- torical destiny.76 Thus, paradoxically, Kaplan manages to simultane- ously reject divine election yet argue for a highly charged Jewish particularity. Universalism is an unnatural state for human civilization precisely because it does not cater to a particular community's collective survival instinct. This unique rejection of both election and universal- ism, though beyond the scope of this essay, is an important topic that arises from Kaplan's attempt to reconfigure the holy in a religion no longer bound by outdated models of particularism or the secular call for cosmopolitanism.77 I have tried to show the extent to which many of the premises of Ka- plan's Reconstructionism are consonant with Spinozistic ideas. Spinoza's rejection of the supernatural God, his demythologizing of the Bible, his contextualizing of biblical rituals and ideas, and his battle against divine election each play a role in his deconstruction of Judaism and ironically emerge in Kaplan's reconstruction of Judaism. Spinoza's correlation of God and nature in the Ethics, his claim that the Bible is not interested in philosophical truth, and his particular understanding of the bifurcation of philosophy and religion also play important roles in Kaplan's thought. Kaplan understood the Spinozistic liberation of the Bible from philoso- phy to mean that the biblical narrative and proscriptions were not em- bodiments of absolute truth. He also believed, like Spinoza, that the Bible and at least some of its interpretations contain the seeds of piety and healthy obedience. Yet, unlike Spinoza, he holds both that healthy civi- lizations have to be ritually based and that piety requires tradition. Hence the Reconstructionist Jew needs first to be involved in the "sacred" act of determining core values from the demythologized biblical text. He or she then needs to create new ritual forms to enable contemporary Jews to use Judaism as a source for its intuitive need to survive. Kaplan was an athe- istic pietist, an anomaly to many, whose experience of God in nature fed his dedication to the rituals of historic Judaism. Baruch Spinoza and Mordecai Kaplan seem an unlikely pair. While it may be true that Kaplan was an important thinker and Spinoza a great one, it may also be true that Spinoza's continued influence on Judaism may partially be attrib- uted to the radical Judaism of Moredecai Kaplan.

Nowhere in this work does Kaplan come clean about his own feelings toward Spinoza. See pp. 408, 411, 418, 229, 280, 281, and 252. 3. See Alan Lazeroff, "Kaplan and John Dewey" in The American Judaism of Mordecai Kaplan, ed. Emanuel Goldsmith and Mel Scult (New York, 1990), pp. 173-96; and Mel Scult, "The Value of Open-mindedness: Kaplan and Emerson," The Reconstructionist (Fall 1995), pp. 85-88. 4. For Kaplan's definition offunctionalism regarding the idea of God, see The Religion of Ethical Nationhood (New York, 1970): "Since its main concern in un- derstanding reality is to improve it, functionalism deals with the relation of means to ends and sheds light upon the purpose and meaning of human expe- rience" (p. 4). Cf. pp. 287f. 5. This decision to leave Orthodoxy yet remain within Judaism is made explicit in the first chapter of Kaplan's The Religion of Ethical Nationhood: "'I left religion during college' wrote Susanne K. Langer, the author of Philoso- phy in a New Key. 'When I began to have faith in my mind and my feeling of insecurity disappeared, religion became untenable, and therefore dispensa- ble' (the New Yorker, December 3, 1960). Although my [Kaplan's] experience as a young Orthodox rabbi was similar, my conclusion was different. While ministering to my congregation, I began to have faith more in my own mind than in the Orthodox tradition in which I had been educated. But I decided to leave the Orthodox rabbinate, not Judaism. Following the dictates of rea- son, I conceived ofJudaism as the evolving religious civilization of the Jewish people. And ever since I have sought ideological validation of the Jewish peo- ple's will to resume its historic role as a 'light to the nations' " (p. 1). 6. This is particularly true regarding divine election. Kaplan was perhaps the first Jewish thinker (if Spinoza is excluded) to openly deny the notion of di- vine election. Spinoza does not deny election as much as he empties it of any ontological (i.e., truthful) foundation. He affirms election as an idea contrived in ancient Israel for political advantage and therefore perhaps "meaningful." Based on Spinoza's de-ontology of election, Kaplan argues that it is a damaging idea for Jews and should be abandoned. See Kaplan, Judaism as a Civilization (Philadelphia, 1981), pp. 257ff; and The Religion of Ethical Nationhood, pp. 154f. For a recent discussion of Spinoza's view of divine election, see David Novak, The Election of Israel (Cambridge, 1995), pp. 22-49. 7. This topic begins Kaplan'sJudaism as a Civilization, pp. 91-172. 8. Most of Kaplan's major works start with an appraisal of contemporary Jewish approaches and their shortcomings. In addition to Judaism as a Civiliza- tion, see The Meaning of God in Modern Jewish Religion (New York, 1962), pp. 1-40; The Purpose and Meaning of Jewish Existence (Philadelphia, 1964), pp. 3-60; and, most prominently, The Greater Judaism in the Making, which is de- voted almost entirely to a sustained critique of contemporary Jewish alternatives.</page><page sequence="18">176 Shaul Magid 9. For a recent discussion questioning the radical immanence of Spinoza, see Jean Axelrad Cahan, "Spinoza's Theory of Immanence Reconsidered" in Journal ofJewish Thought and Philosophy, Vol. 5, No. 1 (1995), pp. 81-99. 10. I intentionally exclude Hasidism from Kaplan's critique because I think Kaplan's negativity toward Hasidism was more cultural than ideological. His in- frequent references to Hasidism and Hasidic spirituality indicate that his ex- posure to Hasidic literature and life was largely adapted from Martin Buber's highly romanticized presentation. Kaplan's respect for but strong disagreement with Buber is well known. See Kaplan, "A Modern Esoteric Rationale" in The Purpose and Meaning ofJewish Existence, pp. 255-86, Kaplan, "Buber's Evalua- tion of Philosophic Thought and Religious Tradition" in The Philosophy of Mar- tin Buber, ed. Paul Arthur Schilpp and Maurice Friedman (La Salle, 1967), pp. 249-72; and Meir Ben-Horin, "Kaplan and Buber-Tensions and Har- monies" in Jewish Civilization: Essays and Studies, ed. Ronald A. Brauner (Philadel- phia, 1979), pp. 227-84. I maintain that Kaplan's transnaturalism shares some important elements with the pantheism of early Hasidism. Some of this is taken up in Jack Cohen's comparative study of Kaplan and Rabbi Abraham Isaac Ha- Kohen Kook in Morim l'Zeman Navok: Studies in the Thought ofAbraham Ha-Kohen Kook and Mordecai Kaplan [Hebrew] (Tel Aviv, 1993). Cf. Kaplan, The Greater Ju- daism in the Making, pp. 139-43. 11. For a critical evaluation of this point, see Eliezer Berkowitz, "Recon- structionist Theology: A Critical Evaluation" in Major Themes in the Modern Philosophies ofJudaism (New York, 1974), pp. 169-78. Although I disagree with Berkowitz's sharp critique, he raises important questions of whether Kaplan's transnaturalism contributes anything new to the discussion of pantheism. 12. Baruch Spinoza, Tractatus Theologico-Politicus, trans. S. Shirely (Leiden, 1989), p. 228. All references to the Tractatus are from this edition. 13. Here I am largely adopting Leo Strauss' reading of Spinoza in Spinoza's Critique of Religion (New York, 1965), esp. pp. 11-146; and "How to Study Spi- noza's Theologico-Political Treatise" in Persecution and the Art of Writing (Chicago, 1980), pp.142-202. Strauss argued that Spinoza's separation of philosophy (rea- son) from theology (faith/piety/Bible) was hierarchical. That is, Spinoza sought to make the Bible necessary for the masses and irrelevant for the elite. Thus Spi- noza's modern Averroist program reflects Strauss' reading of Maimonides. This reading of Spinoza has been recently challenged by Brayton Polka in two essays. Polka's postmodern reading of Spinoza argues that Spinoza (contra Maimonides) wanted sovereignty for both philosophy and theology in order to show that both were simultaneously corrupt and incorruptible. See Brayton Polka, "Spinoza and the Separation Between Philosophy and Theology," Journal of Religious Studies, Vol. 16, Nos. 1-2 (1990), pp. 91-119; and "Spinoza's Concept of Biblical Inter- pretation'," Journal ofJewish Thought and Philosophy, Vol. 2 (1992), pp. 19-44. 14. See Spinoza, Tractatus, pp. 124-39; and Strauss, Spinoza's Critique of Re- ligion, pp. 185-92. 15. Spinoza makes these agenda quite clear in the preface to the Tractatus. See also pp. 54-57. Cf. Strauss, "How to Study Spinoza's Theologico-Political Treatise" in Persecution and the Art of Writing: "Moreover Spinoza's aim is to lib- erate philosophy from the theological domination which culminates in the per- secution by theologians and their disciplines" (p. 163).</page><page sequence="19">The Spinozistic Spirit in Kaplan 177 16. This is not to say that the Bible became a useless outdated document for Spinoza. On the contrary, the Bible served Spinoza as a guidebook for justice, piety, and a righteous society. As a guidebook, however, its status has been low- ered from the carrier of truth to the most sophisticated directive for proper hu- man behavior. The conventional belief that Spinoza viewed Torah as children's stories and superstition is unwarranted and exhibits a very superficial reading of Spinoza and a misunderstanding of his project. Any close reader of Spinoza will immediately see his love for Scripture in even his most critical statements. See Tractatus, pp. 205-19. To some extent Martin Buber carried this attitude into twentieth-century Jewish thought. See Buber, Two Types of Faith, trans. N. P. Gold- hawk (New York, 1951), pp. 56-78; and "The Faith of Judaism" in Mamre: Es- says in Religion, trans. Greta Horn (Westport, 1970). Kaplan's formulation of rit- ual and halakha as folkways may to a certain extent reflect Spinoza's piety model dressed in Durkheimean terminology. However, Kaplan sought to imbue his folkways with sacred meaning via Durkheim's theory of ritual in primitive reli- gious societies.

Sleinis, Nietzsche's Revaluation of Values (Urbana, 1994): "Revaluation is re- quired to eliminate from the system those artificial value constructs and those modes of organizing and directing life that have been taken to embody genuine values, but that in fact operate to diminish real value overall" (p. 12). There is a highly functionalist and pragmatic tenor in the definition of Nietzsche's ap- proach that is in concert with Kaplan's project. The identification of the terms obsolete and falsehood is implicit in much of Kaplan's thinking 20. See, for example, Spinoza's comments about Maimonides as biblical ex- egete in Tractatus, pp. 156-58. 21. Spinoza, Tractatus, p. 142. This type of biblical interpretation has prece- dent in exegetes like R. Abraham Ibn Ezra, whose Bible commentary rarely cites rabbinic passages. A cursory comparison of Ibn Ezra and Rashi, for ex- ample, on any chapter of scripture will bring Ibn Ezra's unconventional method into relief. On Spinoza's use of Ibn Ezra and its influence on modern Jewish scholarship, see Jay Harris, "Ibn Ezra in Modern Jewish Perspective," Rabbi Abraham Ibn Ezra: Studies in the Writings of a Twelfth Century Polymath, ed. I. Twer- sky and J. Harris (Cambridge, Ma., 1993), pp. 130-34. 22. This observation underlies Daniel Breslauer's thesis that Kaplan's Re- constructionism shares a great deal with postmodernism; see Breslauer, Morde- cai Kaplan's Thought in a Postmodern Age (Atlanta, 1994), esp. pp. 3-36. 23. John Dewey, Reconstruction in Philosophy (Boston, 1948), p. 61. 24. Kaplan, The Greater Judaism in the Making, p. 5. 25. To a certain extent, Kaplan shares the impulse of revaluation with Franz Rosenzweig. In his "Neue Denken" Rosenzweig confronts the same issue of accepting the Nietzschean critique of traditional religion but does not want to fall into the nihilistic trap of pure subjectivity. See Rosenzweig's "Atheistic Theology" in Klienere Schriften (Berlin, 1937), pp. 278-290. A Hebrew trans- lation of "Atheistic Theology" appeared in Naharayim, trans.

Martin Heidegger also viewed devaluation as a preliminary stage in his philosophical project of "demolishing a world that has grown old and of re- building it authentically new" (Introduction to Metaphysics, trans. R. Manheim [New Haven, 1959], p. 126). 26. Kaplan, The Greater Judaism in the Making, pp. 369-80. Cf. Judaism as a Civilization, pp. 126-32. 27.

The notion of "inner-biblical" exegesis as a way of understanding the composition of the Bible has become an important critical tool in contemporary studies. See, for example, Michael Fishbane, "Inner-Biblical Exegesis: Types and Strategies of Interpretation in Ancient Israel" in The Garments of Torah: Essays in Biblical Hermeneutics (Bloomington, 1990), pp. 3-18. 31. See Kaplan's translation of Luzzato's Mesilat Yesharim: Path of the Upright (Philadelphia, 1936), with introductory essay, notes, and commentary. For Spinoza on Ibn Ezra, see Harris cited in note 21. 32. Kaplan, The Religion of Ethical Nationhood, p. 17. 33. The irrelevance of theism and metaphysics was an ongoing debate among students of Kaplan. Cf. Milton Steinberg's critique of Kaplan's position in "A Critique of the 'The Attributes of God Interpreted,'" The Reconstructionist, Vol. 7, No. 2 (March 1941), pp. 7-8. 34. Hava Tirsoh-Rothschild has recently argued that the entire Jewish me- dieval project can be seen as existing between Maimonides and Crescas, subse- quent thinkers lining up behind one or the other. See her "Jewish Philosophy on the Eve of Modernity" in History of Philosophy II:Jewish Philosophy, ed. D. Frank and O. Leaman (New York, 1997), pp. 500-3. 35. This question in both Ha-Levi and Crescas is complicated. On Ha-Levi, see Yohanan Sillman, Philosopher and Prophet (Albany, 1995), pp. 119-31 and 389-410. On Crescas, see the general discussion in Julius Guttman, Philosophies ofJudaism (New York, 1964), pp. 224-41; and Isaac Husik, A History of Medieval Jewish Philosophy (Philadelphia, 1941), pp. 388-405. Both authors give overviews of the general thrust of Crescas' critique of Maimonides and its impact on sub- sequent Jewish thought. 36. In this regard Kaplan comes quite close to Ha-Levi, although his con- clusions are different. Ha-Levi denounced philosophical interpretation to pro- tect Torah from corruption; Kaplan denounced philosophical interpretation to transform Torah and save it from extinction. 37. On Kaplan and divine election, see David Novak, "Mordecai Kaplan and Divine Election" Modern Judaism, Vol. 15, No. 1 (1995), pp. 1-19. 38. Kaplan,Judaism as a Civilization, p. 391.

See Lewis Feuer, "Spinoza's Thought and Modern Perplexities: Its Amer- ican Career," Spinoza: A Tercentenary Perspective, ed. Barry Kogan, (Cincinnati, 1979), pp. 57-64 and notes 66-77. Cf. S. Hessing (ed.), Spinoza: Dreihundert Jahre Ewigkeit (The Hague, 1962), which contains essays from other modern Jewish ideologues such as David Ben-Gurion and Joseph Klausner in their attempts to revitalize Spinoza's theories for modern secular Zionism. 42.

Either Kaplan viewed it as dishonest and disingenuous or he really believed the categories were untrue in a more absolute sense. The latter would be difficult to prove in that he claimed to have rejected any theory of absolutism. It is more likely that he felt traditional categories were not viable in the modern world and that those who adhered to these beliefs were being dishonest to themselves. 44. On this assumption, see Shulweis in The American Judaism of Mordecai Kap- lan, pp. 257-70; and Breslauer, Mordecai Kaplan's Thought in a Postmodern Age, pp. 271-76. 45. See Kaplan, The Purpose and Meaning ofJewish Existence, pp. 257-86. 46. Ibid., pp. 27-33. 47.

Kaplan, The Religion of Ethical Nationhood, pp. 8 and 58-59 (Kaplan's emphasis). 49. We do, of course, have an entire body of literature on natural law theo- ries in Judaism, but Kaplan is interested in nature as the sole source of moral- ity precisely because we can no longer believe in anything divine outside na- ture. See David Novak'sJudaism and Natural Law, (Cambridge, 1998). 50. A case in point would be Rabbi Abraham Isaac Ha-Kohen Kook, whose pantheistic mysticism shares some characteristics with Kaplan's rationalistic ap- proach. See, for example, Ya'akov (Jack) Cohen, "Mystical Rationalist and Ra- tionalist Mystic" [Hebrew] in Morim l'Zeman Navok, pp. 47-70. Cf. Breslauer, Mordecai Kaplan's Thought, pp. 305-21; and "Mordecai Kaplan's Approach to Jewish Mysticism" in Journal of Jewish Thought and Philosophy, Vol. 4, No. 1 (1994), pp. 39-54. 51.

For Kaplan, it is the experience rather than merely the understanding of God that is essential. See "God Felt as Presence" in The Meaning of God, pp. 243-64. 54. See, for example, Joseph Ben-Shlomo's Torat Ha-Elohut shel R. Moshe Cor- dovero [Hebrew] (Jerusalem, 1986), pp. 295-306; and "Gershom Sholem's</page><page sequence="22">180 Shaul Magid Work on Pantheism in Kabbala" [Hebrew] in Gershom Scholem: The Man and His Work (Jerusalem, 1993), pp. 17-31. See also Mark Verman, "Pantheism and Acosmism in the Kabbala," Studia Mystica, Vol. 10, No. 2 (1987), pp. 25-37. 55. The correlation of nature and civilization was common in the early twen- tieth century. It was popularized by Oswald Spengler in The Decline of the West, ed. Helmut Werner, trans. C.E Atkinson (New York, 1962). It was adopted by Arthur Toynbee in A Historian's Approach to Religion (London, 1957). Toynbee used the natural progression of birth, maturation, and decline as a model for civilization. The Jewish people's failure to adhere to this naturalistic model (i.e., the fact that Jews still exist) is discussed by Toynbee as highly problematic. The anti-Semitic tenor of his work received a great deal of attention among Jewish scholars. Kaplan's model of religious adaptation and progression as a means of saving the Jewish religion and people may have been influenced by Toynbee's critique, which has roots in some classical Christian attitudes toward the Jewish people. 56.

Kaplan,Judaism as a Civilization, pp. 109-10. 73. Ibid., pp. 104-5 74. See Kaplan, The Greater Judaism in the Making, p. 370. 75. Kaplan, The Meaning of God. pp. 97-98. 76. This may improve understanding of Kaplan's commitment to democ- racy and rejection of communism. See Rebecca Trachtenberg Alpert, "The Quest for Economic Justice: Kaplan's Response to the Challenge of Commu- nism, 1929-1940" in The American Judaism of Mordecai Kaplan, pp. 388-97. 77. This is treated somewhat in Breslauer's Mordecai Kaplan's Thought in a Postmodern Age, pp. 201ff. See the important discussion in Novak, "Mordecai Kaplan and Divine Election."</page></plain_text>
