<plain_text><page sequence="1">NOTES ON BYZANTINE ICONOCLASM IN THE EIGHTH CENTUBT* The following remarks will be divided into three parts : first, some observations on the source material available for studying the history of the early iconoclastic movement ; second, the problem of the ideology of the iconoclasts, in particular their christology and eucharistie theology ; third, the question of the origins of the iconoclastic movement, and its relationship to other contemporary movements and ideologies. Attention will be restricted primarily to icono- clasm in the eighth century, under the emperors Leo III and Constantine V, with only occasional mention of the ninth- century "second iconoclasm". I The Byzantine chronicles (of Theophanes, Nicephorus, George the Monk, etc.) are of course indispensible sources, but one must keep in mind that they were written and trans- mitted by zealous iconophiles. Though much valuable in- formation can also be gained from Byzantine hagiographical and theological works, as yet inadequately exploited by historians of the iconoclastic period, the even more neglected oriental sources - in Syriac, Armenian, Georgian, and Arabic (of both Christian and Muslim authorship) - which were not passed through the sieve of consistent iconophile bias and (*) This paper was originally intended to be delivered, in an ab- breviated form, at the December, 1973 meeting of the American Historical Association in San Francisco.

GERO censorship, deserve close attention in order to supplement and correct the Byzantine material C). For instance the Syrian origin of Leo, in particular the fact that his birthplace was Maťaš (Germanicia), though known from some Greek sources (2) was displaced almost entirely already in the ninth century by the tradition that Leo came from Isauria, a province in southeast Asia Minor. The critical analysis of the Byzantine sources, which indicates that the "Isaurian" tradition is secondary (3), gains striking confirma- tion from the oriental sources : the Syriac chronicle of pseudo- Dionysius of Tell-Mahrë (8th cent.), the Muslim historian al-Mas'ūdī (10th cent.), and the anonymous Muslim chronicle called Kitāb al-Uyūn (10th-13th cent.) all state that Leo came from Maťaš (4). The last two even yield the information, unknown to the Byzantine tradition, that Leo's father was called Qustantin (Constantine) (5). Leo's iconoclasm is not mentioned ; the tone of the remarks is rather favorable. Thus, according to pseudo-Dionysius, Leo was a bold, strong, and pugnacious man ; the Kitāb al-'Uyūn states that in Maťaš an existing church was named after Leo - clearly a famous native son. This is hardly material which would have been transmitted by the anti-iconoclastic Byzantine chronicles. (1) On this and other points frequent reference will be made to my recent book, Byzantine Iconoclasm During the Reign of Leo III, With Particular Attention to the Oriental Sources ( Corpus Scriptorum Christianorum Orientalium, Vol. 346 ( Subsidia , Tom. 41), Louvain, 1973), henceforth abbreviated as BI.

Since in his undoubtedly genuine work Photius refers to the "Isaurian" error of the iconoclasts (BI, p. 5, note 15 (end)), the discrepancy seems to provide a new argument in favor of the pseudonymity of the Arfyr]oiç (maintained by N.

The Christian Arabic chronicler Eutychius of Alexandria (10th cent.) states that Artavasdus, Leo's son- in-law and the future rival of Constantine V, came from Mar'aš (x). The long, Slavonic version of the famous Life of Stephen of Surož (extant in a hitherto quite unexploited Armenian version also !) says that the first iconoclastic pa- triarch, Anastasius, was Syrian by origin (2). Leo, Artavasdus, Anastasius - was iconoclasm a Syrian conspiracy in the beginning ? Armenian chronicles (Stephen of Tarõn (11th cent.), Ghe- vond, Mxitar of Ayrivank0 (14th cent.), etc. give a curious story about Leo and the Arab siege of Constantinople in 717 : Leo is depicted as a kind of Moses redivivus, who strikes the waves of the sea with a cross, prays, and conjurs the elements, stirring up a storm which destroys the Arab fleet (3). Is this a piece of early iconoclastic propaganda, which of course would not have been preserved in the iconophile Byzantine sources? The Armenian chronicle of Vardan (13th cent.) tells about an otherwise unattested diplomatic mission sent by Leo to protect the rights of the non-monophysite Greeks in Armenia (4). The "Georgian Chronicle" ( Kartlis Chovrebay) gives the text of two supposed letters of Leo to local rulers, in which the idea of the holy war against the Muslims "for the sake of the service of the Cross" is clearly expressed (5). In the same connection, several oriental sources - the Christian Arabic chronicler Agapius of Manbij (10th cent.), the Arme- nian chronicler Thomas Arcruni (10th cent.), and the Muslim writer al-Mubarrad (9th cent.) - mention or summarize Leo's trenchant reply to the letter of the caliph 'Umar II, who exhorted the emperor to convert to Islam (6). Thus, Agapius says : "Leo ... overcame his arguments, expounded to him the (1) BI, p. 29, n. 17. (2) surianin rodom. BI, p. 29, n. 17.

GERO incorrectness of his statements, and elucidated to him the light of Christianity, by means of arguments from the revealed books, compared with reason and... the Qur'ân" (^.By contrast, Theophanes, the major Byzantine source, mentions 'Umar's letter, but does not say that Leo answered it - rather, seeming- ly he wants to convey the impression that Leo, as later un- masked by his iconoclastic actions, has been converted by "his teachers, the Arabs". Of course I should register here the caution that much of the oriental material is of dubious value or clearly non-authentic : for instance, the so-called "letter of Leo to Omar", a long anti-Muslim polemical text (featuring a moderate defense of images !), which is incorporated in the 8th century chronicle of Ghevond can be shown, on grounds of language and content, to be an llth-13th century original Armenian composition, not the translation of an early 8th century Byzantine document (2). The destruction of images from 725/26 onward is well attested by the oriental as well as the Byzantine sources, though the somewhat imprecise language of the oriental texts do not enable one to say with certainty that a legal edict is necessarily referred to (*). The oriental sources lend no support to Theophanes' contention that Leo attacked the cult of the Virgin and the saints, as well as the worship of relics (4). Iconoclastic relic burning is attested for Leo's reign in one of the works of the Patriarch Germanus(5), and, according to the account of Constantine of Tios (end of the 8th century !), (1) Ed. A. A. Vasiliev, Patrologia Orientalis, 8 (1912), p. 503, lines 2-3. (2) BI, Appendix 2 (pp. 162-171). (3) BI, pp. 94 ff ; Appendix 4A (pp. 199-205) ; Appendix 5B (pp. 212-217). M. V. Anastos has recently reopened the question of the number of edicts, and adduces important evidence from good Latin sources (the Liber Pontificalis in particular) to support the case for an edict in 726 ( Leo Ill's Edict Against the Images in the Year 726-7 and Italo-Byzantine Relations Between 726 and 730, in Byzan- tinische Forschungen, 3 (1968), pp. 5-41).

(At any rate the relics miraculously floated to the island of Lemnos, so no harm was done). The singling out of monks as objects of persecution, well attested for the reign of Constantine V, is not asserted in either oriental or Byzantine accounts of Leo's iconoclastic campaign (with the apparent exception of one minor 11th century Byzantine chronicle) (3). II What were some of the ideological views of the early icono- clasts, of Leo himself in particular? For the most part, even very close reading of the sources yields only a simple reitera- tion of the second commandment, with none of the later more sophisticated christological and philosophical argu- ments (4). The traditional cult of the plain cross (5) is main- tained, even in a heightened form, as attested in particular by certain iconoclastic poems quoted in extenso by Theodore of Studios (6). As far as Leo himself is concerned, the so- called letters of Pope Gregory to Leo, which purport to quote (1) Ed. F. Halkin, Euphémie de Chalcédoíne: Légendes byzantines (Subsidia Hagiographica, no. 41, Bruxelles, 1965), pp. 88-89. (2) Ed. de Boor, p. 439, lines 26-31.

GERO the emperor at several points, have been quite conclusively been demonstrated to be apocryphal by the recent exhaustive study of J. Gouillard (x). The one text which emanates from the emperor with some assurance is the Ecloga, a legal code ; though it does not mention images, the preface and some of the provisions may give significant insight into Leo's reli- gious attitudes (2). The anti-idolatry statements attributed to Leo in the various saints' lives are interesting, but have slight documentary value ; many of these depend on the statements of the chronicles (3). Constantine V prepared the ground carefully for the new onslaught of iconoclasm (4). There is some genuine icono- clastic material which dates from his reign : e.g., the second part of the NovOeola, wherein a bishop Cosmas supposedly echoes the emperor's views (5), Constantine's own two nev- aeiç, "inquiries", fragments of which are quoted in the first two Antirrhetici of the Patriarch Nicephorus (6), and, of course, the horos of the iconoclastic council of 754. I shall here restrict myself to some observations on Constantine's n evaeig, which antedate and provided material for the horos of 754. The first nevaiç makes christological definitions, using the traditional terminology of the one prosopon, one hypostasis, and two natures of Christ ; it enunciates for the first time the famous dilemma that the image maker necessarily either divides or confuses the two natures of Christ ; it states (1) Aux origines de l'iconoclasme : le témoignage de Grégoire 111, in Travaux et Mémoires, 3 (1968), pp. 243-307.

The supposed fragments of a third n evatç in H. Hennephof, Textus byzantiniad iconomachiam pertinentes (Leiden, 1969), though reflecting 9th century iconoclastic views, are not quotations from Constantine's work, as the reading of the context clearly shows.</page><page sequence="7">NOTES ON BYZANTINE ICONOCLASM 29 unequivocally that the image is "homo-ousios", consubstantial with the one being depicted (x). Though a monophysite flavor has been professedly detected in the lack of the explicit formula "in (rather than 'of' or «out of5) two natures" (2), in fact the Chalcedonian terminology is present (3). The preference for prosopon instead of hypostasis , which prima facie has a Nesto - rian flavor, can also be justified on the basis of the stated equivalence of the two in the Chalcedonian creed (4). Of more consequence is the doctrine of the second nevoiç that only the eucharist is the true image of Christ - a non- figurative, hence non-idolatrous image, duly sanctioned by Christ, and - unlike ordinary icons - efficaciously brought, by means of the priestly consecration, from the domain of "that which is made with hands" (ró %eiQonoíriTov) to the domain of "that made without hands" (to âxetQOTcoírjrov) (5).

J. Meyendorff views the iconoclastic arguments as at- tempting to express fully a "Chalcedonian apophaticism" (which defines the hypostatic union in negative terms) though in fact ending up with a monophy site-type emphasis (Le Christ dans la théologie byzantine (Paris, 1969), p. 246.) (5) P.G. y 100, 337CD (Fragment 22, Ostrogorsky). The last state- ment is perhaps explicit polemic against the false "acheiropoiēta", the popular miraculous images of Christ. The Armenian practices of consecrating and anointing with oil crosses and images so that "divine power enters into them", and the stated illegitimacy of worshipping these "void of divine power" (John Õjneçi, early 8th century) seem to be almost a direct reply to such iconoclastic com- plaints (For texts see S. Der Nersessian, Image Worship in Armenia and. Its Opponents , in Armenian Quarterly , 1 (1946), p. 72). By con- trast, the iconophiles of the Council of 787 reasserted that no special consecration is necessary. (Mansi XIII, 268de).</page><page sequence="8">30 S. GERO The proposition that the eucharist is an slxáv of Christ is well documented in the earlier patristic sources (*). The explicit statement that the eucharist is "homo-ousios" with Christ is absent from the fragments of the nsvaiç, though one would expect it to follow from the "consubstantial icon" definition in the first nevoiç. Rather, Constantine describes the bread and the wine as truly Christ's body, by (non-essential ?) partici- pation (èx /xeroxy?) and convention («at ôéoet ) (2). Coupled with the aforementioned emphasis on the prosopic union, this has an intriguing resemblance to the eucharistie proposi- tions in a recently published Syriac Nestorian text (3), which deserves to be quoted in extenso. In a dialogue, attributed (probably falsely) to Isaac of Nineveh (7th cent.), both the "orthodox" and the "heretical" protagonists agree that "the bread of the eucharist is the body of Christ" (4), though Christ and the bread are "two in the hypostasis ( qnomã ) and in the nature ( kyãnã )" (5). Then an extended parallel is drawn between the assumption of the human nature by Christ, and the relation of the eucharistie bread and His natural body : "Thus we also think of the man of our Lord (as) one with the Son who took him, they being two in nature and in hypostasis, like the bread and the body, in that this (the man) also administers the mystery ('rāzā) of the Son" (")• Though the natures are two, "we call the nature of his manhood "Son" (1) E.g. The Dialogue of Adamantius, Eusebius, Procopius of Gaza, Ephrem the Syrian, etc., Ephrem actually contrasts the true eucharistic image with false idols. See my article The Eucharistie Doctrine of the Byzantine Iconoclasts and Its Sources, in B.Z., 1974 (to appear). (2) P.G., 100, 333B (Fragment 19, Ostrogorsky). One should recall that later Theodore of Studios viewed the relation between Christ and the anthropomorphic icon in terms of a hypostatic, personal union (e.g. P.G., 99, 424D : xará rò fiovaòixòv rfjç önoora- ztxrjç âfíotáaemç).

But as one Son we worship the image of the Son (salmeh dbara) with his examplar, as the bread with the natural body of Christ, as one body" (x). Then the union of the manhood with the divinity is explicitly decla- red to exist by grace ( taybãthã ), not by nature ( kyãnã ) or (false) imagination ( sbirūthā ) (2). Thus, we see, the eucharistie image (ęalma) is a body by grace, by adoption, a "thetic" icon, as in Constantine's second nevaiç. However, I don't claim that Constantine is consciously Nestorian in his thinking here, though the similarity is striking. "Image" language for the eucharist is well-attested in both medieval monophysite and Nestorian authors (3). For the historian of ideas the charac- terization of iconoclastic Christology in terms of the older Chalcedonian categories poses greater difficulties than has hitherto been admitted (4). The rapid historical development of iconoclastic thought itself should not be lost from sight either : the council of 754 repeats the concept of the bread as a "thetic" image, but couples it with the notion of the indwelling of the Spirit (nvetíparoç ém&lt;poÍTr¡oig), and passes in silence over the homo-ousios concept altogether (5). In the ninth century Theodore of Studios already records the iconoclastic objection that since the original exists naturally, &lt;pvaei, and the image, only by convention, Béaei, and since they do not exist to- gether, they do not receive the same worship (8) - a view (1) Vol. I, p. 88, lines 12-16 ; Vol. II, p. 52, lines 7-10. (2) Vol. I, p. 89, line 6 - p. 90, line 2 ; Vol. II, p. 52, lines 21-38. (3) See the article mentioned on p. 30, n. 1. (4) As possibly relevant here, we shall note the later Armenian heretical group, known as the XaxÇtvTÇáQioi (= "servants of the Cross"), who venerated the cross, rejected images, and supposedly had an extreme "Nestorian" christology - there were two persons in Christ, one of whom suffered on the cross while the other watched 1 Philippus Solitarius, P.G., 127, 881-884B. (Cf. S. Der Nersessian, Image Worship in Armenia and Its opponents, in Armenian Quart- erly, 1 (1946), p. 71, n. 16a). (5) This point is elaborated in the article cited on p. 30, n. 1. (6) P.G., 99, 428D-429A. This passage is discussed in P. J. Alex- ander, The Patriarch Nicephorus of Constantinople: Ecclesiastical Policy and Image Worship in the Byzantine Empire (Oxford, 1958), p. 194.</page><page sequence="10">32 S. GERO which can hardly be reconciled with the proposition that the eucharist is a valid "thetic" image, worthy of adoration. Ill Finally we come to the question of the influences, the supposedly necessary external "push", which set Byzantine iconoclasm in motion. (1) The first explanation which comes to mind, in view of the Syrian origin of Leo III and some of his associates, as well as the presence of Armenians in his entourage, is of course the possibility of monophysite influence. Leo's home town Germanicia, though in fact the birthplace of Nestorius himself, was firmly within the monophysite orbit in the seventh and eighth centuries (J). It is well known that the great mono- physite theologians Severus and Philoxenus are described in the Byzantine literature as active iconoclasts (2). There is material, however, in a non-polemical context, from the chronicle of Michael the Syrian (12th cent.) which shows that some monophysites in the late seventh century were just as ardent worshippers of images and relics as the Chalcedo- nians (3). (There is also much oriental documentary evidence for the Nestorian use of images) (4). Leo himself has a uni- formly Chalcedonian reputation in the oriental sources (Stephen Örbelean, Vardan, Michael the Syrian, Agapius, al-Makrīzl) - unlike Constantine V and Leo IV, to both of whom Michael attributes monophysite sympathies (6). Such is the evidence (1) BI, pp. 25-31. (2) See, e.g., E. Kitzinger, The Cult of Images in the Age Before Iconoclasm, in Dumbarton Oaks Papers, 8 (1954), pp. 131. On Severus' aversion to representing the Holy Spirit by effigies of doves made of precious metals, see F.

Of course conversely one can also reason that a "Nestorianizing" emphasis on the prosopic union justifies the depiction of the human nature (2). However such abstract considerations are of little value to the modern historian ; of much more consequence is Michael the Syrian's specific claim that, inter alios, the council of 754 condemned the partisans of Maximus the Confessor and his diophysite doctrines (3). It is not impossible that some such propagandistic distortion of the proceedings may have been spread by Constantine's agents in monophysite Syria. In the Novdeoia, which reflects early Constantinian propaganda, the iconoclastic bishop Cosmas appeals to the work of the monophysite Severus of Antioch (4). But iconoclasm during the reign of Leo III has no demonstrable monophysite overtones, except for perhaps the unguarded statement in one of the iconoclastic iambic poems that Christ is not to be depicted because he is wholly divine, ôXoç deóç, without the custo- mary rider ô'Aoç avdqomoç (5). And, again, despite his quite likely monophysite antecedents (Germanicia had only mono- physite bishops from the 6th century onward) Leo himself, to judge from the oriental sources, was a faithful Chalcedo- nian and is consistently presented as the protector of the Chalcedonian party outside the empire (6).

This poses the question of specific Armenian and/or Paulician (2) influence (though we shall leave aside the problem of the ethnic affiliations of eighth-century Paulicianism) (3)š There is seventh century evidence for ascetic Armenian iconoclasts who nevertheless venerated the cross (4). The Paulicians, who were possibly joined by remnants of this group (5), rejected the veneration of the cross, as well as other aspects of the ecclesiastic cultus such as baptism and the eucharist ; specifically, according to John Öjneci (8th century Armenian catholicos), they rejected icons as well as the cross (6). In an examination of the Pauli- cian heresiarch Gegnesius, ordered by Leo III, and carried out by an unnamed patriarch (either Germanus or Anasta- sius), the heretic, before he was released, had to give his adherence to the veneration of the cross, as he hypocritically did (7). The problem of the sources for Paulician history is (!) BI, Appendix lc (pp. 143-149). (2) For an introduction to the problem of the Paulicians, see N. G.

Though Con- stantine V did not, at least judging from the silence of the sources, persecute the Paulicians, the ninth-century iconoclastic emperors Leo V and Theophilus did. (See M. Loos, Le mouvement paulicien à Byzance , in By zantinos lavica, 24 (1963), pp. 276, 280 and Garsoïan, Paulician Heresy, pp. 124-125).</page><page sequence="13">NOTES ON BYZANTINE ICONOCLASM 35 of course sharply debated by the specialists (x) ; however, the rejection of the cult of the cross is definitely part of the Paulician repertoire, in this respect quite divergent from the Byzantine iconoclasts'. It is only the Slavonic version of the Vita of Stephen of Surož (and not the parallel Armenian version !) which states that Leo, under Jewish influence, was persuaded to destroy crosses as well as images (2). This detail is of course contradicted by the Gegnesius episode, as well as previously cited evidence. N. Garsoïan has argued recently that the iconoclastic notion of the eucharist as the only true image is related to the purely spiritual Paulician conception that the words of the Logos are the true images (3). Now, of course a "spiritual icon" concept is part and parcel of the patristic and iconoclastic arsenal (4), but I can see no relation to the iconoclasts' material eucharistie image. The suggestion, put forth by the same author earlier, that the Paulicians were branded "Manichean" because their iconoclastic tendencies connected them with the Byzantine iconoclasts, who were, in turn, according to the iconophile opposition, Manichean despisers of matter (5), I frankly find also quite unconvincing. "Manichean", like "Jew" and "pa- gan", was simply a standard and indiscriminate term of abuse. The related suggestion, that an extreme docetic iconoclasm actually formed the middle term of transition between the primitive adoptionistic Christology of the early Paulicians, and a later dualistic, aberrant mysticism (6), is also, to my mind, quite undemonstrable ; in particular, it operates with a notion of "docetic iconoclasm" which, as far as I can see, (1) P.

If the thesis "the divinity should not be depicted" implies docetism, then we arrive at the reductio ad absurdum that all ante-Nicene Christia- nity was docetic. That there were Paulician soldiers or units in the armies of Constantine V is of little consequence ; the heretics also on occasion joined the Muslim raiders, and eventually went into business on their own, so to speak. (3) The question of Muslim influence should of course be discussed, especially since the possibility is maintained by some outstanding modern scholars (x). Leo did spend part of his youth in Muslim-ruled Maťaš, had extensive contacts with the Arabs before attaining the imperial dignity, and there is evidence (Kitāb al-'Uyūn ; al-Mubarrad) that he had a mastery of the Arabic language (2). The caliph Yazld II's campaign against all figurative representation (and, according to the Armenian sources, crosses as well) (3) definitely preceded the outbreak of Byzantine iconoclasm in 726 (4). But, though ninth-century Byzantine sources do claim a connection be- tween Yazld's and Leo's iconoclastic campaigns, the con- nection does not occur in the oriental sources before the 12th century (6). Detailed analysis (which cannot be reproduced here) shows that the introduction of various intermediaries between Yazld and Leo - migrating Jewish soothsayers, Leo's confidant Beser (a former Muslim captive), the Phrygian bishop Constantine of Nacolia - is only a series of literary attempts to provide a causal link between two disparate and unrelated historical events (6). In fact, it cannot be proved that eighth-century Islam was solidly iconoclastic, though such tendencies were doubtless present. As is well known, the Qur'an offers no directives on images, and the earliest perti- (1) E.g. A. Grabar, L' iconoclasme byzantin : Dossier archéologique (Paris, 1957), pp. 111-112 ; E.

The Muslim dominions were a haven for iconophile refugees ; the earliest Christian evidence for Muslim opposition to Christian image worship is given by the bishop Theodore Abu Qurra (late 8th cent.) (2). Iconoclastic cross veneration squarely mili- tates against the thesis of Muslim influence ; the specific Muslim injunctions for mutilating representations of living beings (e.g., decapitating an image, or making a large enough hole in its abdomen to "kill" it) (3) plainly do not correspond to iconoclastic practices. (Incidentally, scratching out the eyes of an image was not enough, according to the medieval legal experts, to render the image harmless) (4). (4) Now we shall briefly discuss the related question of contemporary Jewish influence on Byzantine iconoclasm. The Jews' antipathy to Christian images was often asserted in 7th and 8th century Byzantine literature (5), though the Jewish literary and archeological evidence is much less con- clusive than one would desire (6). At any rate the epithet "Jewish-minded" provided a convenient accusation against the iconoclasts ; both Yazïd and Leo are said to have acted under the influence of Jewish magicians and soothsayers. This charge however is completely absent from the oriental sources ; detailed analysis of the Byzantine material, which again cannot be repeated here, shows that the account of (1) R.

One should recall that Leo's reign is in fact marked by the forced baptism of Jews - a persecution well attested by both Byzantine and oriental sources (2). (5) Lastly I shall note a theory recently put forth by Peter Brown, the well-known British historian of Late Antiquity (3). At the risk of oversimplifying a well-written and original article, I shall quickly summarize some of its main points, as far as these directly concern us now. The icons, Brown says, were foci of local patriotism ; they represented an urban style of political life, and their power derived from being a substitute for the local "holy man" (4). Holy men, like the Stylites, and the concomitant growth of icon worship also provided, in Brown's words, "unvested, inarticulate power" (5). The delicate equilibrium of the civic cult of the icon and the private worship of holy men and icons was disrupted by the Muslim invasions. With the destruction of the cities "the centrifugal, the ascetic, and the non-collective and (1) Bl, pp. 60-74, 193-198. Neither Leo III nor Byzantine icono- clasm is mentioned in the medieval Jewish sources, to my knowledge. But perhaps it is noteworthy that, according to a recent editor, the medieval Chronicle of Ahimaaz (ed. and tr. M. Salzman (N.Y., 1924), calls the emperor Basil I, who persecuted the Jews, "an idol worshipper", "paH YlV (text p. 6, line 5 from end ; translation p. 72). However the expression for "idol" here, hamman, is a rare one. The unique manuscript in fact reads ļlaSI ; perhaps one could refrain from emendation and simply translate the expression as "a servant of Haman", i.e., one like the wicked Haman (Esther 3 : Iff) or else emend ■pan to unrighteousness • The account at âny rate would only mention image worship in the epithet ; it is not presented as part of Basil's persecuting policy.

It became brutally plain for the first time that either the bishop or the holy man must be the moral arbiter of Byzantium" (x). In nuce, iconoclasm was government and secular clergy working together against the holy man "of monastic background" in order to break his power in Byzantine society, "both as a principal bulwark of the power of the icon, and so, one might suggest, the icon itself" (2). Brown does not even shrink from saying "Icono- machy in action is monachomachy" (3). Iconoclasm was a centralizing attempt in disguise, directed against the holy man-monk cum icon, the representatives of an anarchistic, or at least too strictly "local", spirituality (4). Brown's thesis is interesting and well-argued, but unfortuna- tely it runs aground on the facts. The association of icon- worship and decentralization is highly questionable - one should simply recall the role played by icons in Heraclius' holy war against Persia. Then, even granting for the sake of argument the partial validity of the same, it had in fact been shown in much detail in a recent book by S. Vryonis that the collapse of the urban culture of Asia Minor simply did not take place in the seventh and eighth centuries, but only during the Turkish invasions of the eleventh century and later (5). Was iconoclasm a campaign against monks? Surely not in the beginning - Constantine V undertook his antimonastic measures as late as the 760's, some forty years after the outbreak of iconoclasm. An ascetic, "holy" temper could well co-exist with iconoclasm - we have early patristic (1) Ibid. (2) Ibid. (3) Op. cit., p. 30. (4) This is a partial revival at least of G. Ladner's older "caesa- ropapist" explanation, that "iconoclasm was from its beginning an attack upon the visible representation of the civiias Dei on earth" (Origin and Significance of the Byzantine Iconoclastic Controversy, in Medieval Studies, 2 (1940), pp. 127-149, statement quoted, p. 134).

GERO evidence, the Armenian iconoclasts of the seventh century, perhaps the Paulicians, and of course the reiterated claim at the iconoclastic councils of 754 and 815 that the imitation of the virtues of the saints is the true painting of their images. In the iconoclastic period proper we know that there were iconoclastic monks and monasteries ; in particular there is the case of the iconoclastic monk-prophet Sabbatios - a "holy man" by Brown's definition - and the cult of his relics in the ninth century i1). Brown's attempt to apply a psychological (2) and sociological (3) approach to iconoclasm does not, in my view, succeed, because it does not take into account - or is not entirely aware of - the involved history of the period, and the various groupings within the iconoclastic party. The highly dramatized encounter of Constantine V with the iconophile monk-saint, Stephen of Mount Auxentius, simply does not tell the whole story. After all the foregoing negative conclusions it could be legitimately asked by the reader what, if any, alternative explanation can I offer for the genesis of the iconoclastic movement. The answer is that, to my mind, the key should be sought in the one authentic surviving piece of Leo's legis- lation, the Ecloga of 726, in particular the programmatic preamble (4). Therein the rulers' dependence on biblical, (1) See J. Gouillard, L'hérésie dans l'empire byzantin des origines au XIIe siècle, in Travaux et Mémoires, 1 (1965), p. 311. (2) One of Brown's favorite expressions is "anxiety". Though of course there is nothing wrong with using a scientific-sounding modern terminology, Brown's actual manipulation of this particular concept is singularly unconvincing. "The savage and raw mood of the Icono- clasts, and the determination with which they attacked images as idolatrous, owes most to their ability to verbalize their anxiety " (p. 24, italics mine). According to Brown, this "ability to verbalize" came from a newfound sense of being the "true Israel", and the influence of the Old Testament (ibid.). But, surely, the mystique of the verus Israel was not peculiar to 8th century Byzantium, and Eusebius and Epiphanius earlier had no difficulty in verbalizing their anxiety about images. (3) E.g., "the holy man ... was but one figure in the tangled skein of alternative and conflicting power structures" (p. 32). (4) BI, pp. 48-58.</page><page sequence="19">NOTES ON BYZANTINE IGONOGLASM 41 prophetic standards of righteousness (x) is repeatedly enuncia- ted ; it is highly likely that the preface reflects Leo's own sentiments, though of course much of the language is stereo- typed (2). "He handed the power of sovereignity to us ... commanded us ... to tend the faithful flock ... we are occupied with such cares, directing our ever vigilant concern to those matters which please God" (3). The Leo of the Ecloga is an individual who is serenely convinced of divine guidance in his task, who sees no need for an ecclesiastical hierarchy to interpret for him the divine directives - directives which for Leo could, one may surmise, include the forced baptism of the Jews as well as the destruction of idolatrous images (4). The influence of the iconoclastic bishops of Asia Minor known to us from some of Germanus' letters has been unduly exaggerated ; in particular there is no evidence for contact between them and the emperor prior to 726 (5). There is no proof for any attempt on the part of the emperors to gain, by iconoclastic policies, the allegiance of the Asia Minor provinces, as has been claimed recently (6), or specifically of the armies stationed there (7). The ninth-century iconophile biographer of Nicetas of Medicium, in a sober mood, empha- (1) However, Brown's flat assertion that "the post-Justinianic law was presented, by Leo III in the preface to the Ecloga , as no more than an elaborate implementation of the law of Moses" (A Dark- Age crisis ..., p. 24) is not borne out by the text.

GERO sizes that iconoclasm, unlike other heresies which grew out of ecclesiastical disputes, was indeed a uniquely imperial heresy. Theosterictus says : "The other heresies had their origin from bishops and lower clergy, but this one from the rulers' themselves the other heresies were strengthened little by little, but this one [gained strength at once] from the imperial power" í1). I find it difficult to disagree with this judgment. Christian opposition to the cult of images is well attested prior to the eighth century. But without the support of the "secular arm" conservative church fathers like Euse- bius and Epiphanius could do little else than to write against the cult, and to confiscate or destroy the occasional icon. It is indeed but an accident of history that in the eighth century the opponents of image worship came to count among their number the autocratic rulers of the empire themselves, who, unlike anyone else, could, and did, put into execution drastic measures against this cult - though, to be sure, without any lasting success. If one is willing to take seriously the deep religiosity which characterized the era and the tremendous power possessed by a victorious soldier-emperor, then the conclusion that Leo viewed himself in the role of a new Moses or a new Josiah, appointed to bring back the ancient purity of Christian worship, and acted out on the stage of empire, gains great plausibility and provides an adequate explanation for the origin of Byzantine iconoclasm proper (2).
