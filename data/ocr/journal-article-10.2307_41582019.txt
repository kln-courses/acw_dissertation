<plain_text><page sequence="1">John Steinbeck and the Perfectibility OF Man (Louis Owens Essay Prize Winner) Matthew Langione On October 25™, 1962, John Steinbeck turned on the television set at his Sag Harbor home in order to learn about the most recent political developments. Three days earlier, President Kennedy had informed the world that the Soviet Union was building secret missile bases in Cuba, a mere ninety miles off the coast of Florida. The Cuban Missile Crisis, as it was called, had dominated media outlets for over seventy-two hours. Yet the phrase that issued first from Steinbeck's television set that day was different, and to him, unforeseen: "John Steinbeck has been awarded the Nobel Prize for Literature" (After 261 ).* Less than two months later, still beneath the shadow of global fear, Steinbeck delivered his Nobel Prize acceptance speech to the Swedish Academy. Having long and painstakingly ruminated on a number of topics, Steinbeck chose finally to speak about the great duty of humankind to ensure its perpetuation by seeking "perfection"- a fitting choice given the conspicuous human frailty at the time. Steinbeck warned, "Humanity has been passing through a gray and desolate time of confusion. . . . With [its] long, proud history of standing firm against all of its natural enemies, sometimes in the face of almost certain defeat and extinction, we would be cowardly and stupid to leave the field on the eve of our greatest potential victory" ( America 172-3 ). The victory against "weakness and despair"- the battle for human perfection- would be won, Steinbeck maintained, only if humankind, in all of its reaches and occupations, believed in the possibility of perfectibility. Of his own craft, he spoke explicitly: "I hold that a writer who does not 87 w &gt; Vi Ì4 u W co g M H c r&gt;</page><page sequence="2">Steinbeck Review wo s to í/5 W passionately believe in the perfectibility of man has no dedication nor any membership in literature" (173). For Steinbeck, however, this belief in the human potential for perfection did not imply either that human beings could attain perfection in the span of a lifetime or that society could advance to an ideal state, as Plato proposed in The Republic. Rather, he held that the pursuit of perfection, as an autotelic practice, was the most effective method of assuring the progress both of the individual and of society. His wife, Elaine, remembers his saying, "You believe in the perfectibility of man. Man will never be perfect, but he has to strive for it" (After 271). Essentially, Steinbeck used the rhetoric of perfectibility as a psychological strategy to encourage human beings to strive towards perfection, finding it a more motivating goal than merely to strive for improvement. Steinbeck believed that the human pursuit of perfection, even if never attained, would effect the best of societal and individual achievement, a theory influenced by Emerson's evocation of the "unattained but attainable self" and reaching even further back to Jonathan Edwards's vision of humankind floating on toward an ever-receding Godhead. His belief does not, however, align with the popular nineteenth-century philosophy of human progress, an optimistic view of evolution that held nature to be the perfecting organism of the human species. The thinkers who propounded this philosophy believed that nature would lead humankind to perfection despite any support or resistance. Throughout his writings, by contrast, Steinbeck sets forth a theory of action, holding in the main that an advanced society can be achieved only through the pervasive faith of its citizens. Many of Steinbeck's novels assert interdependence- humankind as the savior of fellow humankind. Looking closely at an early novel, The Grapes of Wrath , beside a major later novel, The Winter of Our Discontent , we may readily observe this dynamic theory of human perfectibility. First, however, it would be well to acknowledge a philosophical tension between perfectionism and a holistic concept that Steinbeck cultivated early in his career on a sea-faring expedition with his best friend, marine biologist Ed Ricketts. In his travel journal, Sea of Cortez , Steinbeck explains that a purer understanding of the environment is achieved by what he terms "non-teleological" or "is" thinking- in other words, the suppression of the tendency to impute cause-and-effect rationale to perception.2 Steinbeck and Ricketts observe an inherent danger in relying on the 88</page><page sequence="3">Steinbeck Review "purposiveness of events." Considering the example of the poor, 2 Steinbeck notes that teleological interpretation renders them 3 "deserving" of their poverty by presuming a direct causality. g Teleology infuses the individual with the idea that he is capable of Ç determining what "should be," whereas such notions are rarely | more than "subjective" or "anthropomorphic" projections. § In his words, "it presumes the bettering of conditions, often, unfortunately, without achieving more than a most superficial understanding of those conditions" (Log 112). Non-teleological thinking, on the other hand, seems to deny the possibility of human perfection, because it regards history neither as a development, nor as a faithful projection of the future.3 Steinbeck elucidates the distinction well: "Non-teleological thinking concerns itself primarily not with what should be, or could be, or might be, but rather with what actually 'is' - attempting at most to answer the already sufficiently difficult questions what or how , instead of why " (112). This refutation of the interconnectedness or linearity of events has been enough for some to conclude that the author rejected human progress and therefore human perfectibility. Yet neither this view, nor its antithesis places Steinbeck in his proper context. In the pages to come, I will argue that Steinbeck was, at the very least, an exponent of the practical benefit of perfectionist ideology- a notion that should inform our interpretation of his novels, particularly Of Mice and Men , The Winter of Our Discontent , and The Grapes of Wrath , which have been subjected to interpretations confusing non-teleology with nihilism. Steinbeck himself was clear. In Sea of Cortez , he remarks that metaphysicians (specifically Emerson) will inevitably always "run into the brick wall of the impossibility of perfection while at the same time insisting on the validity of perfection" (Log 124). Though perfection itself may be an unattainable goal, the survival and progress of humankind depends upon a collective effort to attain it.4 This evinces the claim of one previous Steinbeck scholar, that the "species-characteristics [Steinbeck] was most intrigued and concerned with could not be measured or explained in scientific terms" (Lieber 262). In his Nobel Prize acceptance speech, Steinbeck implies that hope for humankind is "with Men." A close examination of a few well-known moments in two of Steinbeck's novels explains the implications of this statement as it relates to perfectionism. By the phrase "with Men," Steinbeck refers to the unscientific concepts of generosity 89</page><page sequence="4">Steinbeck Review jg and interdependence, which he considered the greatest hope for ¿3 human salvation. Nowhere is he more explicit than in the final scene of The Grapes of Wrath , which tells the tale, with heartbreaking poignancy, of the Joad family's eviction from their Oklahoma farm and their ensuing migration to the "promised land" of the California labor fields. In the opening pages, we are introduced to the first oppressive force of the novel: nature. The winds and drought have ravaged what was once fertile land, rendering it practically uninhabitable. Steinbeck writes, "Men and women huddled in their houses, and they tied handkerchiefs over their noses when they went out, and wore goggles to protect their eyes" (Grapes 5). 5 Shifting from this introductory background to the primary narrative that begins in the second chapter, Tom, paroled from prison, catches up with his family, who have been evicted from their farm, and they set out on the road to California. Here they are introduced to the novel's second, and most severe oppressive force: large-scale agribusiness. The road to California is filled with death- literally Grandpa and Grandma Joad, but also the abandoned trucks and spirits of men. Steinbeck's novel is so critical of the self-interested practices of California agribusiness that it provoked Senator La Follette to report on labor conditions, which ultimately detailed the "shocking degree of human misery" among migrant workers and charged the Associated Farmers with "the most flagrant and violent infringement of civil liberties" (qtd. in Morsberger 29). Yet, despite the indefatigably grim labor "THE ROAD TO CALI" situation in the novel, FORNIA IS FILLED WITH The Grapes of Wrath , DEATH - LITERAL LY as Donald V. Coers GRANDPA AND GRAND* remarks, "still holds MA JOAD, BUT ALSO THE out hope for human ABANDONED TRUCKS advancement" (Grapes AND SPIRITS OF MEN." xiv). It does so through the assertion that people can transcend physical boundaries through interpersonal unity and community. Steinbeck writes, "... man, unlike any other thing organic or inorganic in the universe, grows beyond his work, walks up the stairs of his concepts, emerges ahead of his accomplishments" (Grapes 205). Steinbeck portrays a clear 90</page><page sequence="5">Steinbeck Review championship of the democratic principle: "... two men are not as lonely and perplexed as one. And from this first 'we' there grows a still more dangerous thing: 'I have a little food' plus 'I have none.' If from this problem the sum is 'We have a little food,' the thing is on its way, the movement has direction. Only a little multiplication now, and this land, this tractor are ours" (206). Steinbeck shifts quickly here from companionship as a means of allaying loneliness to companionship as a means of escaping miserable labor conditions. Throughout the novel, however, there is a larger concept- the concept of a universal soul- that takes precedence. Before leaving his family, Tom Joad relates his conversation with Preacher Casy to his mother: "Says one time [Casy] went out in the wilderness to find his own soul, an' he foun' he didn' have no soul that was his'n. Says he foun' he jus' got a little piece of a great big soul. Says a wilderness ain't no good, 'cause his little piece of a soul wasn't no good 'less it was with the rest, an' was whole" (570). First, this passage suggests that an individual's connectedness with other individuals triumphs over all else, even connectedness with the land ("wilderness"), though the latter too is established as a strong connection throughout the novel. Second, it summarizes Steinbeck's deeply democratic philosophy that all of humankind shares one soul, that the great labor of humanity is to work toward the unity of the soul. This philosophy leads directly to Tom Joad's final appearance in the novel, the midnight escape during which he announces his democratic quest. To Ma Joad's concern that he may be killed, he responds that if everyone shares "one big soul" : Then it don't matter. Then I'll be all aroun' in the dark. I'll be e ver 'where- wherever you look. Wherever they's a fight so hungry people can eat, I'll be there. Wherever they'se a cop beatin' up a guy, I'll be there. If Casy knowed, why, I'll be in the way guys yell when they're mad an'- I'll be in the way kids laugh when they're hungry an' they know supper's ready. An' when our folks eat the stuff they raise an' live in the houses they build- why, I'll be there. (572) Through Tom Joad's words, Steinbeck's philosophy is made clear. Human freedom will be won only through the interdependability and interdependence of humankind. The final scene in the novel is an essential and symbolic example. When 91 2 § r &gt; 2: a o 2; m</page><page sequence="6">Steinbeck Review the Joads discover a young boy and his starving father huddled in a barn where they seek shelter from a tumultuous rain, with Ma Joad's approval Rose of Sharon, one of the daughters, who had just delivered a stillborn baby, offers the starving man the only sustenance the family has- the milk from her breast. No final passage could be more direct: the source of human salvation is literally within the human being. Evidence suggests that Steinbeck maintained this philosophy throughout his life. The Nobel Prize acceptance speech, for example, shows that his belief in the need for perfectibility was still with him as late as six years before his death. Further evidence abounds in his last work of fiction, The Winter of Our Discontent , which, like The Grapes of Wrath , concludes with an eloquent assertion of the necessity of human interdependence. The works are united by a common technique. In both novels, Steinbeck examines a single family as the representation of a larger group, and ultimately mankind. In The Grapes of Wrath , the Joads represent the oppressed migrant workers of California. In The Winter of Our Discontent , the Hawleys represent the Every American faced with an era of moral decline. Likewise, both novels' final scenes raise poignant criticism of contemporary values, while offering proscriptive hope for self and societal amelioration. The Winter of Our Discontent opens with Ethan Hawley in the "Abel" manifestation of what many critics have referred to as his syncretic "Cain- Abel" role.6 Ethan's eventual duality is foreshadowed by his polar ancestry: pirates on one side, Puritans on the other. At the beginning of the novel, we learn that his passivity and moral conscience have never made him much of a businessman in New Baytown, which was founded by his ancestors. Ethan works as a clerk at the grocery store that once belonged to his family before it was purchased by Marullo, a foreigner whose principle, "business is money," does not appeal to him ( Winter 23). At the outset of the novel, he does not seem to mind his diminished position. His loyalty to Marullo is evident when Biggers, a salesman from a local warehouse, tries to bait Ethan into operating a cost-cutting scheme. When Ethen objects, Biggers tries to rationalize the treachery: "Who's double-crossed? He don't lose anything and you make a buck. Everybody's got a right to make a buck" (25). Introducing imagery that will become symbolic throughout the novel, Ethan replies, "It's a dark day" and refuses to take the bait (25). 92 1/5 5 C/5 1/5</page><page sequence="7">Steinbeck Review Ethan's treatment of his figurative brother in the Cain-Abel structure, Danny Taylor, is equally character revealing. They had been best friends as boys, "blood brothers," before Danny dropped out of the U.S. Naval Academy and became an alcoholic.7 Ethan regrets that Danny has become a "shuffling sorrow" about the streets of his hometown, stating, "I should be able to help him. I've tried, but he won't let me. Danny is as near a brother as I ever had, same age and growing up, same weight and strength. Maybe the guilt comes because I am my brother's keeper and I have not saved him" (41). Throughout the first half of the novel, Ethan is a paragon of scrupulous standards in a world polluted by sin, a world in which the bank is the "holiest of holies," and money, the "Great God" (150). Ethan's shift to a Cain figure is signaled by his deceit and betrayal of Danny, who trusts him. Swayed by his wife and children's materialistic desires, Ethan makes his first morally reprehensible business venture. Alert to the need for level ground for an airport, Ethan knows that Danny's family land, Taylor Meadow, is the only potential building site. With duplicitous intent, he warns Danny that the land will be taken away from him if he doesn't sober up, that it is highly valuable, and that, for the sake of family pride, he ought to keep it for himself rather than selling it. Despite his drunkenness, Danny sees through Ethan's offer to give him money for a rehabilitation clinic, responding, "You're betting I'll put up my meadow as collateral. And you're betting that a thousand dollars' worth of booze will kill me, and there you'll be with an airport in your lap." ( Winter 120) A moment later, remembering Ethan as a boy, Danny rescinds his skepticism: "Do you think I don't remember you? You're the kid with the built-in judge. Okay. I'm getting dry. The bottle's empty. I'm going out. My price is one thousand bucks" (120). By the end of the novel, Ethan's money does kill Danny, and Ethan ironically makes a "killing" off the profits from Taylor Meadow. His moral decay and resulting financial gain do not stop there. Gaining back the Hawley grocery store by contriving to have Marullo deported, he plans to rob the town bank. Convincing himself that these acts are acceptable business practice in the modern world, Ethan observes that it is easy to "raise a moral reason for doing what [he] wanted to do anyway" and concludes that such crimes are minor because they were not "against men, only against money" (201, 241). At his most destructive, he employs a line of thinking so often employed to 93 S § r &gt; 2: o o 2; m</page><page sequence="8">Steinbeck Review justify depravity: "It has to be faced in business and in politics a man must carve and maul his way through men to get to be King of the Mountain. Once there, he can be good and kind- but he must get there first" (207). That Ethan himself must come to terms with his sins is obvious. But Steinbeck goes a step further, depicting a society that ignorantly accepts and cherishes the new pragmatism that Ethan has embraced. When his wife, Mary, finds that Marnilo has been deported, leaving the store to Ethan, her wispy façade of concern is betrayed by an expression of joy: "You're not a clerk! Not a clerk!" (238) More tellingly, Ethan is urged to run for the position of "town manager." Mr. Baker, whose bank Ethan had intended to rob, urges: "You're the man. Good family, reliable, property-owner, businessman, respected. You don't have an enemy in town. Of course you're the man" (250). At Ethan's first intimation of doubt, Baker says "it's the perfect way," before Ethan muses, "from grocery clerk to town manager" (250). Steinbeck thus exposes the moral degradation of New Baytown, where the perfect way to achieve the American rags- to-riches ideal (or worse yet, the rags-to-respectability ideal) is to steal, manipulate, and murder. If it ended here, The Winter of Our Discontent would keep as its final message the nihilistic perception of American society as irreconcilably corrupt.8 But in the final few pages, Ethan manages to find reconciliation for his sins, while Steinbeck finds reconciliation for his philosophy of hope. The turning point is Ethan's discovery that his son, Allen, has plagiarized in his submission to a national essay contest. The television publicist offers compensation if Ethan will keep the matter quiet and conceal it from the public, suggesting a bargain: "We could work something out. Scholarship or like that- something dignified" (272). Yet Ethan is outraged: "I know how you feel. What you can cover up doesn't exist. . . . Has sin gone on strike for a wage raise?" (272). When Ethan asks his son whether or not he knows plagiarism is wrong, Allen responds, "Who cares? Everybody does it. . . . Don't you read the papers? Everybody right up to the top- just read the papers. You get to feeling holy, just read the papers. I bet you took some in your time, because they all do" (273). This moment, in the final pages, is the anagnorisis of The Winter of Our Discontent , the moment in which Ethan recognizes the true gravity and consequence of his recent actions. Like generations of Hawley fathers before him, his example of immorality has led his son to sin. Symbolically, f/5 £ I S) C/5 94</page><page sequence="9">Steinbeck Review Allen signs the plagiarized essay with his full name, "Ethan Allen Hawley II" rather than "Allen Hawley," - emblematic of his moral resemblance to his father. In despair, Ethan determines to kill himself. His daughter, Ellen, fearful of his motive, tries to prevent him from leaving the house. Unsuccessful, she hugs him, surreptitiously slipping the family talisman into his pocket.9 As Ethan sets out for the seashore, he muses, "It's so much darker when a light goes out than it would have been if it had never shone. The world is full of dark derelicts" (275). At the nadir of his despair, he fears that there is no community upon which he can depend, that each person stands alone. He laments, "It isn't true that there's a community of light, a bonfire of the world. Everyone carries his own, his lonely own" (275). In diametric contrast, the final articulation of Steinbeck's philosophy in The Grapes of Wrath , portrays a dependable and depending community. But Ethan's despair does not win out. When he discovers the family talisman that Ellen had slipped into his pocket, he abandons his plans to commit suicide, realizing that he "had to get back- had to return the talisman to its new owner. Else another light might go out" (276). 95 2 m &gt; Z O S z m</page><page sequence="10">Steinbeck Review The light is now Ellen's. Ethan has, after all, conceded that his own is long extinguished. But in keeping his daughter's moral spirit alive, his own life assumes a transcendent purpose, his decision deepening the Cain- Abel storyline, which centers around the choice between brotherhood and selfhood. In Steinbeck's depiction, the former leads to survival and progress; the latter to death and degeneration. Steinbeck's retelling of the Cain-Abel story renders it in a significantly felicitous light. Though Ethan cannot restore the life of his friend, Danny, and cannot undo the moral damage that he has brought upon his family and his community, Steinbeck implies that through the regeneration of moral choices, Cain-figures have the potential to recast themselves as productive citizens of society. While he is brought to near defeat and death by his son's moral downfall, Ethan is brought to redemption by his daughter's sense of morality. Steinbeck believed that children carry the potential to avoid the faults of their parents. In The Acts of King Arthur and His Noble Knights , he asserted that "any man. . . when he comes to maturity has a very deep sense that he will not win the Quest .... The self-character cannot win the Quest, but his son can, his spotless son, the son of his seed and his blood who has his virtues but has not his faults" (364). In Ethan's case, his daughter, Ellen, has become the "light-bearer"- the hope of turning the Hawley legacy, and by extension, American culture, into a source of pride for coming generations. Like The Grapes of Wrath , The Winter of Our Discontent stands as a dialectic fitting neither into the non-teleological framework of Steinbeck's early philosophy nor into the Darwinian ideology of progress. Like Emerson, Steinbeck maintains that human progress requires individual action and striving for self- betterment. Tom Joad must strike out on his altruistic mission; Ethan must return to his. But unlike Emerson's call for self-reliance, Steinbeck's call is for a mutual reliance- an interdependence among human beings. He regarded human beings as capable of growth, capable of setting goals that aimed for perfection. This perfection, he believed, lies in community, a fellowship of human beings, rather than nature. As Ethan's parental gift of the talisman assured the continuity of family values and as Rose of Sharon's milk offered the gift of life to a starving stranger, Steinbeck proffers the written word as his contribution to the human community. In his Nobel Prize speech, he underscores the significance of such a gift, stating that the writer "is charged with s «o w 96</page><page sequence="11">Steinbeck Review exposing our many grievous faults and failures, with dredging 2 up to the light our dark and dangerous dreams for the purpose | of self-improvement" ( America 173). For Steinbeck, human ^ beings in a natural state were, if left solitary, desultory and static £ creatures. The only hope for their perfectibility was to be found | in a dependable and supporting community. § tn Notes 1 Steinbeck had little reason to suspect that he had even been considered for the award. Though he had been among the finalists in 1945, criticism of his subsequent work had been, in large part, unfavorable. On October 25th, the letter from the Academy lay still unread in the mail slot of his New York City apartment. 2Although there exists some evidence that Ricketts wrote the chapter on non-teleological thinking prior to the expedition, I refer to Steinbeck as the writer because the prose is in his voice, suggesting either rewriting or heavy revision and, no doubt, approval. Nonetheless, though I acknowledge that inklings of non-teleological thinking surface as early as 1933 in To j God Unknown , it should be noted that accepting the philosophical unity of Steinbeck and Ricketts is imprudent. Richard Astro has effectively dispelled this myth of unison, arguing that whatever influence Ricketts had on the author's philosophy, he had little on his fiction. See Richard Astro, John Steinbeck and Edward F. Ricketts : The Shaping of a Novelist (Minneapolis: U of Minnesota P, 1973). 3However, in a somewhat contradictory turn, Steinbeck claims that "Non-teleological ideas derive through 'is' thinking, associated with natural selection as Darwin seems to have understood it" ( Log 112). The invocation of Darwin here is eccentric, perhaps referring to Darwin's later qualifying statements. Darwin, in the context of class, certainly did, after all, believe in history as a record of progress and as a projection of the future, though he always allowed the possibility of chance and chaos. He wrote: "As all living forms of life are lineal descendants of those which lived long before the Silurian epoch, we may feel certain that the ordinary succession by generation has never once been broken, and that no cataclysm has desolated the whole world. Hence we may look with some confidence to a secure future of equally inappreciable 97</page><page sequence="12">Steinbeck Review length. And as natural selection works solely by and for the good of pq each being, all corporeal and mental endowments will tend to progress toward perfection" (459). Perfection is unattainable according to Steinbeck because humans, he believes, will advance at an ever-diminishing rate, ever frustrated by infinite anomalies, each individually manageable, but multiplying at a rate exponential to the rate of human comprehension. He writes, "Anomalies. . . are the commonest intellectual vehicles for breaking through; all are solvable in the sense that any one is understandable, but that one leads with the power n to still more and deeper anomalies" (Log 124). 5 Scarcely any critics have maintained that Steinbeck exaggerates the physical oppressiveness of the climate. As leading Dust Bowl historian Donald Worster writes, "In no other instance was there greater or more sustained damage to the American land, and there have been few times when so much tragedy was visited upon its inhabitants. . . [I]n the decade of the 1930s the dust storms of the plains were an unqualified disaster" (16). 6Most lucid in the expression of this view is Michael J. Meyer. See "Citizen Cain: Ethan Hawley's Double Identity in The Winter of Our Discontent ." After The Grapes of Wrath: Essays on John Steinbeck (Athens: Ohio UP, 1995) 197-21 3. _ Symbolically, we find later that Ethan and Danny cut heart-shaped tattoos into their arms with razor-blades when they were young. 8 Steinbeck was explicit in relating the microcosm, New Bay town, to the macrocosm, America and the rest of the world. He wrote, "This year of i960 was a year of change, a year when secret fears come into the open, when discontent stops being dormant and changes gradually to anger. It wasn't only in me or in New Baytown. . . and it wasn't only the nation; the whole world stirred with restlessness and uneasiness as discontent moved to anger and anger tried to find an outlet in action" (249)- 9Textual evidence supports this inference. In the penultimate chapter, Ethan gives his daughter the talisman and tells her to look up the meaning of the word, after which the talisman is not mentioned again until the end of the same chapter, once the publicist leaves: "I thought to go to the cabinet and take the talisman in my hand- had stood up to get it" (272). He is interrupted, however, by the scuffle upstairs in which Allen attacks 98 *</page><page sequence="13">Steinbeck Review Ellen. After mediating the dispute, as he is about to leave the house, 2 &gt; Ellen races to grab hold of Ethan. In his own words, "She grappled me h again and her hands caressed and stroked my arms, my sides, dug her § balled fists into my side pockets so that I was afraid she might find the &gt; razor blades" (274). It seems likely, given the meaning that Ellen would 2 have found for the word talisman in the dictionary (protection), that the § talisman is within one of her "balled fists." When he discovers it in his pocket, he remarks: "... I felt the lump. Then in wonder I remembered the caressing, stroking hands of the light-bearer" (276). Works Cited Coers, Donald V., Paul D.
