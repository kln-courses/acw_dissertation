Paul Getty Museum, 13 November 2001-6 February 2002, Getty Research Institute, 2001, 416 pp., 77 col. and 67 b. &amp; w. ills., $39.95. 'Devices of Wonder' was by all accounts and from the evi- dence of this catalogue an enchanting exhibition, bringing together a great variety of things devised, over several cen- turies, to delight the eye and other senses. It displayed, writes Barbara Maria Stafford, 'some of the key strange and uncanny optical instruments humans have used to perceive the world and some of the powerful images they generated or inspired'. The nearly 400 exhibits were not just optical, however, but a plethora including mirrors and lenses, scien- tific instruments and nursery toys, dolls' houses and lode- stones, shadow shows and automata, magic lanterns and camerae obscurae, panoramas and dioramas, sand boxes and oysters, telescopes and microscopes, stereoscopes and stereograms, anamorphoses and metamorphoses, peep- shows and moving picture machines, films and lunar pho- tographs, Old Master paintings and works by contemporary conceptual artists whose relevance was sometimes vague. In terms of print, there were the astounding engraved illustrations to pioneering scientific books like Scheiner's Pantographica (1631), Nicéron's La Perspective Curieuse (1663), Hooke's Micrographie (1665), Kircher's Ars Magna Lucis et Umbrae (1671), Leder müller's Amusement microscopique (1764-68) or Johann Jakob Scheuchzer's Physica Sacra (1732-37). There was a veritable grand tour of vues d'optique , the extensive series of modest but colourful scenic prints issued by various publishers in France, England, Germany and Italy for the delectation of the later eighteenth-century tourist (actual or armchair), together with a variety of instru- ments for viewing them to achieve the best perspective effects. There was a selection of the miniature 'theatrical dioramas' - sets of cut-out wings and backdrops to be set up in special viewing boxes - published at much the same peri- od by Martin Engelbrecht in Augsburg, together with the various devices, with or without lenses, in which they were displayed. The Engelbrecht tradition was continued in the nineteenth-century 'concertina'-form peep-shows, which were also on display, along with jigsaw puzzles, myrioramas (create your own landscape out of ever-changeable scenic elements), anthropomorphic landscapes, and a conjuror's 'blow-book' whose contents could be seemingly transformed by slyly fingering the ingenious notching of the page edges. Clearly those who devised the exhibition were seduced, as they in turn seduced the visitors, with this marvellous het- erogeneity of objects and experiences. Not surprisingly, then, the primary inspiration, celebrated in the introductory section of the show, was the 'cabinet of curiosities', the 'Wunderkammer' and the 'Wunderschrank' - those rooms or cabinets that wealthy seventeenth- and eighteenth-centu- ry amateurs filled with marvels of scientific discovery or the natural world, for contemplation, study, and ostentation. Prints reveal the character of such gentlemen's cabinets: lofty rooms are shelved to the ceiling, stacked with jars and specimens, shells and minerals. Elegant visitors (looking for all the world like viewers at an auction house) crush around tables to study trays of coins and medals. From the ceilings hang the indispensable stuffed crocodiles and splayed- winged birds. Did identificatory enthusiasm for the Wunderschranken lead the curators into a degree of over-interpretation? The prize piece of this part of the show was a superb early sev- enteenth-century cabinet, richly inlaid" with exotic woods, ivory, marble, semi-precious stones and tortoiseshell, with elaborate enamelling and carving, from thé Getty Museum itself. Such cabinets were essential articles of utility and dis- play for noble folk from the time of Henry VIII, who had one 'full of drawer boxes lyned with red and green sarcynet to put in stores of divers sorts'. His daughter, Queen Elizabeth, had two such to keep her papers in and use as writing boxes (see Ralph Edwards, The Shorter Dictionary of English Furniture , 1964). Although their owners vied for the splendour of the decoration of their cabinets, they seem to have been used to contain articles of convenience (for liter- ary or toilet use), rather than of curiosity. But the Getty cabinet has inspired curatorial leaps of association. Thus (they suppose) it was probably made in Augsburg, although the carvings are by the Dutch Albert Vinckenbrinck. That given, 'it looks very much like the work of Ulrich Baumgartner, one of the great cabinet makers active in Augsburg'. Leaping ahead from this again, they find that Baumgartner^ most ambitious works were created under the direction of Philipp Hainhofer . . . who commissioned several elaborate cabinets that he filled with novel and exotic objects for sale to aristocratic buyers . . . Although there is no evidence that Hainhofer commissioned the Getty's display cabinet ... his cabinets are the best guide to understanding the Getty display cabinet. Ergo, 'Even though the Getty's cabinet has long been sep- arated from its contents, a sense of what it would have con- tained can be gleaned from contents of the largest and most extravagant cabinet built and stocked under Hainhofer's decision'. But that cabinet, made as a gift for the King of Sweden, stood almost three times as high, had more than six times the cubic volume and contained museum-scale collec- tions of coins, medals, minerals, specimens, instruments, curiosities, antiquities and useful toilet requisites.

To complete its metamor- phosis, it was displayed in the exhibition surmounted by an absurd pyramidal hat of shells confected for the purpose by a young contemporary artist, Sumiya Swoboda Nichols. Many visitors must have been confused. Perhaps it is an undefined academic guilt, a sense that the exhibition with all its delights was too playful and pleasur- able, that sometimes leads the catalogue's authors into what might seem like comparable over-interpretation of other objects. A bewitching painting by Joseph Wright of Derby shows two boys blowing up a bladder, illuminated by candle- light. Their faces are both distorted by the exertions of blow- ing and lit by nervous anticipation of the imminent explo- sion. 'Contemporary audiences were probably charmed by its suggestion that the boys had assumed the rôles of novice scientific investigators', writes Frances Terpak, but reprov- ingly puts us right on the matter: 'Today this painting is usu- ally read as an allegory of vanitas (vanity), as a reminder of the inevitability of death and the transience of worldly pleasures.' A charming pair of paintings by Chardin 'can be connected to Isaac Newton's innovative scientific theories'. Thus the solemn youth blowing soap bubbles to amuse his little brother 'could be studying the bubble's iridescent diaphanous surface for the complex succession of colours recorded by Newton'. Likewise, the companion picture, showing a girl throwing knucklebones, 'may refer to this Newtonian system [of gravitation] . . . the girl stares at the ball with a calculating gaze. Her gaze is interrupted by the realization that the same force that governs the mighty plan- ets also acts upon her tiny ball'. It's a heavy responsibility to lay on the poor child. Anxious to assert the relevance of this antique technology to our times, both Barbara Maria Stafford and Frances Terpak seize every possible analogy to the digital present. Sometimes they seem to fetch their conceits excessively far. Thus, moveable Renaissance boxes outfitted with writing tools and scribal surfaces can be understood as crude prede- cessors of the laptop computer. Their evolved form - the cabinets of curiosities with their encyclopaedic collections - can be associated with the Internet. Both employ the visual as the primary mode of interaction and, more important, both 'collect' and link far-flung and disparate ideas in new and ever-changing configuration. The continuity, surely, is not in the devices, but in the fundamental and persistent human quests they incidentally serve. Allowing for this enthusiasm for 'significance', the texts are carefully researched, with very few and very slight iden- tifiable errors of fact (although for some reason not justified by the DNB, Joseph Priestley is consistently spelt 'Priestly'). Barbara Maria Stafford's introduction often provides origi- nal insights into the interactions of technology and aesthet- ics. She likes words a lot, particularly in long lists: a polished metallic surface does not so much reflect, as offer 'halluci- natory occasions for glimpsing the ephemeral emanations rebounding from a lustrous ambient'. Sometimes an appar- ently lucid sentence defies disentangling (for this reader at least): Protean devices embodied the shifty human capacity to metamorphose natural and doctrinal truths into mon- strosities, while virtualizing lenses, taking the viewer out of her body, not only falsely conflated phenomena belonging to separate spheres but, like the sacrament of the Mass, materialized the unmaterial to enrapture an unwitting audience. The sentence exemplifies another singularity of Stafford's essay: viewers and spectators are consistently identified as 'she', which, while perhaps conforming to 1960s feminist politics, somewhat skews our image of the predominantly male public for shows and science in the seventeenth to nineteenth centuries. But if the ladies sometimes protest their academic status and concern a shade too much, it is easily forgiven in the light of the unconcealed pleasure that they share with us in the exhibition's happy display of several centuries of erudi- tion, ingenuity and wit.</page></plain_text>
