<plain_text><page sequence="1">CATHERINE BECKER NOT YOUR AVERAGE BOAR: THE COLOSSAL VAR?HA AT ER?N, AN ICONOGRAPHIC INNOVATION Omf Victorious is the god (Vishnu), who has the form of a Boar - who, in the act of lifting up the earth ( out of the waters), caused the mountains to tremble with the blows of (his) hard snout; (and) who is the pillar (for the support) of the great house which is the three worlds!1 In January 2000, when I had the opportunity to visit the site of Er?n in Madhya Pradesh with Joanna Williams in preparation for my M.A. thesis on the colossal theriomorphic, image of Var?ha there, I was struck by the boar's formal charisma (fig. 1). At first glance, the image in question, a monolithic sculpture of the god Visnu in the form of his boar avatar, Var?ha, appears to be a somewhat blocky form. Its very size and solidity dominate the viewer. Indeed the thrashing of its broad snout might cause mountains to tremble, as the opening lines of the image's inscription proclaim. Upon further inspection, the mighty Er?n Var?ha also entices with its visual suggestion of heroism, dynamic power, and a hint of puppyish sweetness. As the shrine that once surrounded the boar is now reduced to its foundations, the boar stands starkly and somewhat majestically exposed to the elements.2 Its right front leg seems to move forward in space, as if the animal were about to stride off its platform. The boar tri umphantly raises its snout upward, revealing the effortlessness with which it supports the weight of Prthv?, the earth goddess clinging to the boar's right tusk. Beneath the boar's feet the badly damaged bodies of intertwined serpents suggest the watery depths from which the boar retrieved the earth god dess, and the presence of several pairs of knees - remnants of kneeling figures ? indicate that grateful devotees may have once witnessed the boar's heroism. The body of the boar is covered with rows of sages who were also saved by the god's benevolence. While the unknown artists have represented this savior of the earth and her inhabitants as a mas sive lumbering animal, the boar also appears to be slightly tender, even anthropomorphized. For exam ple, the boar's mouth is not the snaggletoothed and ferocious maw of an actual wild boar but is John Faithfull Fleet, Inscriptions of the Early Gupta Kings and Their Successors, Corpus Inscriptionum Indicarum III, 2nd ed. (Varanasi: Indological Bookhouse, 1963), 160. 2 The exact nature of the boar's shrine has been the subject of scholarly debate. The first to excavate the site, Alexander Cunningham, proposed that a rectangular temple with a two-columned portico originally housed the boar. Certainly, such a small, windowless structure seems consistent with other Gupta shrines such as Sa?c? Shrine 17 (c. 400 CE) and the temple at Tigowa (c. 445-470 CE); however, given the special physicality of the large theriomorphic boar, per haps a somewhat more open shrine, such as the much later mandapa that houses the theriomorphic Var?ha at Khaju raho, might have been more appropriate for such a colossal image. See Alexander Cunningham, Archaeological Survey of India Reports, vol. 10 (1880; reprint, Varanasi: Indological Bookhouse, 1966), 83. 123</page><page sequence="2">equipped with two neat rows of dainty, square, and humanlike teeth. The boar's tongue emerges from its mouth as if to give a gentle lick to the female figure delicately perched on its tip (fig. 2). Thin, arch ing eyebrows frame the eyes of the boar. Although an informal review of photographs of boars reveals that these animals do indeed have a fold of skin above their eyes, the artist of the Er?n Var?ha has ren dered this feature with a refinement that might be more appropriate on a representation of the per fected face of an anthropomorphic deity. With its combination of heft and heroism, human and ani mal qualities, the Er?n Var?ha is, in short, no ordinary boar. As is well known, the Er?n theriomorphic Var?ha is something of a watershed image, marking not only an iconographie development in the representation of Var?ha but also the disintegration of Gupta political sway in the Malwa region. The colossal Er?n Var?ha is one of the earliest representations of the god to be depicted solely as a boar. Although the theriomorphic Var?ha from nearby R?mtek may be earlier than the Er?n Var?ha, that somewhat smaller boar lacks the rich sculptural program that adorns the surface of the Er?n Var?ha. The Er?n Var?ha's inscription reveals this image's patron to be Dhanyavisnu, a local ruler who, along with his elder brother, had previously commissioned a pillar dedicated to Garuda at the site. While earlier inscriptions at Er?n refer to various Gupta rulers, the Var?ha's inscription cites a date of year one of the reign of the H?na ruler Toram?na, thus attesting to the displacement of Gupta authority and the rise of a new political power in central India. Through analysis of this image and its inscription, this paper will trace the ways in which the Er?n Var?ha represents a meaningful iconographie innovation - one that seems designed to meet the per sonal and political exigencies of the image's patron, Dhanyavisnu, and to create a fitting tribute not only to the compassionate nature of Visnu, but also to Dhanyavisnu's deceased family members while employing a visual vocabulary that resonates with the broader cultural environment from which the new H?na overlords emerged. By carefully examining the Er?n Var?ha's formal qualities alongside the historical information provided by its inscription, I hope this paper will itself be a fitting tribute to Joanna Williams, whose pioneering work on the art of Gupta India and whose generosity as a scholar have informed my approach to this image and shaped my career as an art historian. Since one of the cornerstones of this paper's argument is that the Er?n Var?ha represents an icono graphie innovation, a first step in analyzing this innovation seems to be to trace the visual and textual sources from which this image might both draw and depart. Some of this work has been done by Haripriya Rangarajan, who examines the Er?n Var?ha alongside a wide range of visual and textual rep resentations of Var?ha as part of her thorough study of images of Var?ha from Madhya Pradesh.3 Rather than repeat the wide-ranging analysis Rangarajan has already undertaken, it will be more fruitful to take a more focused approach. First I will analyze carefully a few of the Var?ha images that may have informed the creation of the Er?n theriomorphic Var?ha before turning to examine briefly some of the textual sources that describe Var?ha and illuminate the iconography of the Er?n Var?ha. I then exam ine the image's inscription and the stated concerns of its patron, Dhanyavisnu. I conclude with a con sideration of the possible religious beliefs and the broader visual culture in which the H?nas, who were briefly overlords of Malwa, participated. 3 Haripriya Rangarajan, Varaba Images in Madbya Pradesh: An Iconographie Study (Mumbai: Somaiya Publications, 1997). 124</page><page sequence="3">ANTECEDENT IMAGES The depiction of the Er?n Var?ha's dual attributes of brute animalism and heroic humanity must have presented something of a challenge to an artist charged with the representation of the theriomorphic form of the deity - after all, wild boars seem to be clever, fierce, and brave animals, but are not per haps typically associated with benevolence or compassion. The artist of the Er?n Var?ha may have turned to earlier images of Var?ha for solutions to this challenge. Both of the earlier images of Var?ha considered here are representations of Nr-Var?ha, that is, Var?ha with the head of a boar affixed to the body of a man. For example, a Nr-Var?ha also found at Er?n is, in contrast to the colossal scale of the pure boar, much more human in size and affect (fig. 3).4 The man-boar's humble inscription includes only two names : Mahesvaradatta and Var?hadatta. As these individuals are otherwise unknown, Joanna Williams suggests they may be two donors of relatively minor importance in the Er?n political scene.5 Pointing to the stylistic similarities between the man-boar Var?ha and the Garuda pillar capital also at Er?n, Williams offers a date of 470-485 CE for the Nr-Var?ha.6 Standing in a dynamic ?lidh?sana, with one leg raised and squared-off snout lifted high, the Er?n Nr-Var?ha exudes power and confi dence. The swelling and rounded treatment of the figure's muscles alludes to Var?ha's great strength and corresponds to the smooth flesh and "plumpened" forms extolled in Gupta-period literary sources.7 The diminutive earth goddess dangles from his tusk, her tiny body dwarfed by the massive size of her rescuer. The use of a boar's head atop a human body, albeit one that is inflated and superhuman in its appearance, clearly delineates the duality of Var?ha's animalistic power and divine compassion. There is no mistaking this image for that of a common boar; the theriocephalic form immediately signals that this is a supernatural being. Moreover, in addition to regal bracelets and a necklace, the Er?n Nr Var?ha wears the vana-m?la, the long flowery garland that dramatically sweeps across the man-boar's body, plunging from the left shoulder to just below his straight knee and then snaking around the meaty bicep of Var?ha's right arm. The vana-m?la, an attribute of Visnu, reminds the viewer that this heroic man-boar is none other than the god Visnu himself. The artist includes a jaunty lotus blossom cap atop the boar's head, which lends a touch of insouciance while also, in a sense, crowning the deity. The Er?n Nr-Var?ha hints at the larger narrative that climaxes with the god's compassionate res cue of the earth goddess. Tracing the stem of the Er?n Nr-Var?ha's flowery cap as it creeps down the back of the deity reveals a small female figure clutching the end of the stem and peering around Var?ha's right leg. Rangarajan suggests that this might be Laksm?, Visnu's consort and frequent companion.8 Yet the woman behind Var?ha's leg and the earth goddess on his tusk share a similar curvaceous body with no iconographie markings to distinguish them, suggesting that Laksm? and the earth goddess are indistinguishable, even interchangeable. Perhaps the goddess is depicted here twice - once as 4 As of January 2000, this sculpture, which is a modest 189 centimeters high, was housed at Sagar University. 5 Joanna Williams, The Art of Gupta India: Empire and Province (Princeton, N.J. : Princeton University Press, 1982), 91. 6 Ibid. 7 Here i borrow the word "plumpened" from Daud Ali, who uses it in his discussion of the refined courtly bodies described in Gupta-period epigraphic and literary sources. See "Beauty and Refinement," in Courtly Culture and Polit ical Life in Early Medieval India (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 2004), 143-82. 8 Rangarajan, Var?ha Images, 134. 125</page><page sequence="4">Laksm? beneath the water's surface, clinging to the lotus stalk for support, and then again as Prthv? on Var?ha's tusk - in the enactment of a triumphant narrative that starts with the earth's initial plight and resolves in her salvation. Although the base of the sculpture remains uncarved, perhaps unfinished, the rough chisel marks between Var?ha's legs and beneath the feet of the small female figure clinging to the lotus stalk may depict the eddies and currents of the Cosmic Ocean from which the earth must be saved. This representation of Var?ha seems to emphasize not only the physical prowess of this figure, but also the resolution of the narrative - the rescue that reveals Var?ha's compassion for the otherwise helpless goddess. The towering Nr-Var?ha at the nearby site of Udayagiri may have provided another inspiration for the theriomorphic Var?ha at Er?n, with the Udayagiri Nr-Var?ha assuming a colossal scale9 and participating in a dynamic narrative tableau (fig. 4). Dating to the early fifth century, the Var?ha image in Cave 5 at Udayagiri mirrors the basic iconography of the Er?n Nr-Var?ha: both figures are two-armed and assume a dramatic pose with legs apart and snout tipped up as if to inhale the aroma of the earth goddess hanging from the right tusk.10 The Udayagiri Nr-Var?ha also wears Visnu's vana m?la, which here is a thick, undulating plait woven with a variety of flowers and foliage. Although the rounded fleshiness of both the Er?n and Udayagiri Nr-Var?has and the similarities of their poses sug gest that the slightly later Er?n Nr-Var?ha was sculpted with an awareness of the Udayagiri relief, the Udayagiri version is surrounded by a lively backdrop of figures that much more clearly enacts the scene of Var?ha bringing the earth up from the ocean. Behind the Udayagiri Var?ha, an array of deities, sages, and figures in royal dress witness the great event. Striations carved into the rock suggest the rippling waves of the ocean. On the narrow sidewalls of the cave, two pairs of female figures represent the river goddesses Gang? and Yamun? standing on their makara and tortoise vehicles, respectively. Also on the sidewalls and on the main face of the tableau, a male figure, presumably Samudra/ Varuna, the god of the ocean, wades through the ripples while carrying a water pot. Dominating this watery realm with his immense proportions and assertive posture, Var?ha plants his left foot firmly on serpentine coils that culminate in the anthropomorphic upper body of a smiling N?gar?ja. Snakes with their hoods spread frame the serpent king's face as he respectfully holds his hands in a?jali mudr?.11 Though now badly damaged, a male figure, kneeling in profile amongst the blossoming lotuses and water lilies behind the N?gar?ja, sports bits of jewelry on his well-muscled chest (fig. 5). The scant remains of this figure's face suggest that the chin was slightly turned up, as if to gaze beyond the hoods of the N?gar?ja and towards the towering Var?ha. This figure also raises his right arm, which clutches a portion of his lower garment, in the direction of the deity. Unfortunately, this figure's left arm is now missing, and the small male attendant figure standing behind the kneeling man is also largely obliterated. Nonethe less, the kneeling posture, traces of jewelry, and remnants of a well-coiffed hairstyle hint that this figure may be a royal donor. 9 The panel is 6.705 meters in length and 3.86 meters in height. J. C. Harle, Gupta Sculpture (Oxford: Clarendon Press, 1974), 35? 10 The provocative possibility that the Udayagiri Var?ha in particular is smelling Prthv? is suggested by Debaia Mitra in "Var?ha-Cave of Udayagiri: An Iconographie Study?,"Journal of the Asiatic Society 5 (1963): 99. 11 Mitra, Williams, Rangarajan and others most commonly identify this N?ga as ?esa and not as a demonic foe subdued by Var?ha. 126</page><page sequence="5">The possibility of a royal patron and the colossal scale of the Udayagiri Var?ha have tempted many scholars to link this image and its narrative of the rescue of the earth with contemporaneous political events. Frederick Asher, for example, posits an allegorical reading of this image in which the deliver ance of the earth at the hands or, perhaps more appropriately, the tusk of the deity is likened to an earthly ruler's ability to protect and maintain the inhabitants of his domain.12 Moreover, a number of scholars interpret the kneeling donor figure as Candragupta II himself.13 Michael Willis has substan tially expanded our understanding of this image and the larger site of Udayagiri as key components in the enactment of Gupta imperial authority, suggesting that the relief functioned as a stage for gen erating Gupta power.14 By examining the archaeological remains at Udayagiri alongside a variety of inscriptional and tex tual sources, Willis argues for the interconnectedness of devotional imagery, ritual activity, and polit ical power during the Gupta period. Through annual rituals on astrologically significant days, the Gupta rulers performed their close relationship with the god Visnu. The colossal relief of Var?ha in Cave 5 was, according to Willis, the site of the annual ceremony for awakening the god from his period of slumber. On this occasion, a nearby tank would supply the cave with a shallow pool of water beneath the standing image of Var?ha for the staging of a reenactment of Visnu's rescue of the earth in which some of the parts were played by contemporary actors.15 Furthermore, by considering the figures included in the depiction of this event and the dedicatory inscription in nearby Cave 6, Willis sug gests that "the imagery has more than one meaning and the votive figure, and indeed also the Var?ha, can be read as several individuals simultaneously. "l6 Just as a melody may be orchestrated in a variety of ways, the shifting allegorical identities of the figures in the Var?ha tableau might be understood as "variations on a theme."17 Some of Willis's variations include identifying the damaged donor figure as the Sanak?nika prince, who ruled during the reign of Candragupta II, and as the prince's father. Similarly, the main image of Var?ha rescuing the earth and subduing the naga can simultaneously be read as Samudragupta, Candragupta II's father, whose name evokes a conqueror of the oceans and whose political triumphs include quelling an uprising of N?ga kings, and as Candragupta who, accord ing to Willis's interpretation of the closing eulogy in Vis?khadatta's Mudr?r?ksasa, sheltered the earth 12 Frederick Asher, "Historical and Political Allegory in Gupta Art," in Essays on Gupta Culture, ed. Bardwell Smith (Delhi: Motilal Banarsidass, 1983), 55-57. 13 K. P. Jayaswal seems to have been the first to point out the literary and visual parallels between Var?ha's rescue of the earth and Candragupta IFs earthly rule; he stops short, however, of identifying the donor figure in Udayagiri's Cave 5 as Candragupta. See K. P. Jayaswal "Candragupta and His Predecessor," The Journal of the Bihar and Orissa Research Society 18 (1932): 33-36. The identification of the donor figure as Candragupta seems to have been made first by V. S. Agrawala, who states that "At one end stands a royal figure who seems to be the Emperor himself, viz. Chandragupta, politically identified with Mah?var?ha... since he made the country free from foreign domination of the Sakas." Vasudeva Agrawala, Solar Symbolism of the Boar (Yajna-Var?ha: An Interpretation) (Varanasi : Prithivi Prakashan, 1963), 36. 14 As Willis has carefully outlined and systematically critiqued the arguments of previous scholars on the political con tent of the Udayagiri Var?ha tableau, it would be redundant to do so here. See Michael Willis, The Archaeology of Hindu Ritual (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 2009), 46-55. 15 Ibid., 42, 77. 16 Ibid., 57. 17 Ibid., 66. 127</page><page sequence="6">from "barbarian hordes," presumably the Western Ksatrapas, just as Var?ha once rescued the earth from the deluge.18 Yet, Willis continues, the donor figure might also be read as Candragupta, who positions himself as Var?ha's most ardent devotee. Willis further argues that the water that would have flooded the floor in front of this cave "is not only the cosmic water of Pur?nic myth but the unc tion fluid of the royal consecration or r?jas?ya. And because Var?ha is the embodiment of sacrifice, Var?ha is also a theistic vision of the r?jas?ya, one of the seven royal Soma sacrifices. "I9 I return to this relationship between Var?ha and the sacrifice later in this paper; however, to reduce Willis's nuanced arguments about the Udayagiri Var?ha to some of their most basic conclusions, we might understand his "variations" to all revolve around the theme of royal power enacted, in part, through the creation of imagery and the use of such imagery in the performance of rituals. This is not to say that the colossal Var?ha at Udayagiri simply " legitimates " the political authority of Candragupta II. Rather, as the stage for the performance of the ruler's close and ritually mediated relationship to the divine, the image becomes a tool employed in the very creation of Gupta imperial power. As thorough and compelling as Willis's analysis of the Udayagiri Var?ha may be, he does not address one question that is of some relevance to the study of the Er?n theriomorphic Var?ha. That is: why was this convention, an anthropomorphic body combined with the head of a boar, adopted for the Udayagiri image of Var?ha? A brief consideration of Visnu's avatar as Narasimha, an image of which is included in Willis's larger study, provides a relevant contrast. The Udayagiri Narasimha also appears with the body of a man, this time topped with the head of lion, but specific narrative circum stances necessitate this theriocephalic form. Narasimha is incarnated to defeat a powerful demon, Hiranyakasipu, who has received a boon that renders him safe from humans and demons, gods and ser pents.20 As neither god, human, nor animal, Visnu's incarnation as a man-lion is critical to overcom ing the particulars of Hiranyakasipu's boon. Such a narrative requirement does not pertain to repre sentations of Var?ha. In fact, the Pratim?laksana of the Wisnudharmottara, which provides a guide to the creation of images of the divine, gives no hint as to when the Nr-Var?ha or theriomorphic forms of the deity should be deployed and would suggest that artists and patrons were free to select their pre ferred form of Var?ha.21 The representation of Var?ha in a theriocephalic form at Er?n and Udayagiri seems to emphasize this figure's divine and royal aspects. This is neither feral pig nor normal human, but a manifestation of divine grace. These images also seem to emphasize the royal attributes of Var?ha: both depictions of the god strike a powerful pose while adorned with regal jewelry. Yet these two images of Nr-Var?ha indicate that the two sculptures were designed to meet quite different needs. The smaller, humbler, and thus perhaps more personal and approachable Er?n Nr-Var?ha was created by two local patrons whose motivations remain unknown but are not obviously tied to imperial politics. Rather, the Er?n Nr-Var?ha seems to emphasize the deity's intimate relationship with the earth goddess. The Udaya 18 Ibid., 59-60. 19 Ibid., 66. 20 The Pur?nic versions of this narrative, which provide a complete list of this demon's immunities, have been analyzed in Deborah Soifer, The Myths ofNarasimha and V?mana: Two Avatars in Cosmological Perspective (Albany, N.Y.: State University of New York Press, 1991). 21 D. C. Bhattacharya, Pratim?laksana of the \7imudharmottara (New Delhi: Harman Publishing House, 1991), 205. 128</page><page sequence="7">giri Nr-Var?ha, in contrast, with its great scale and the inclusion of so many narrative details, seems to function as part of an interactive environment in which the colossal Var?ha enacts in perpetuity the rescue of Prthv? along with a grateful coterie of ascetics. The expanded narrative content here reminds the viewer that the salvation of the earth goddess is the salvation of humanity at large. Moreover, the larger-than-life tableau quality of this relief casts visitors to this cave, likely members of the Gupta elite, as participants in the unfolding events. THE ER?N COLOSSAL VAR?HA EXAMINED A theatrical combination of scale and narrative detail also seems to have informed the creation of the theriomorphic Var?ha at Er?n, but further formal analysis of the big boar's body reveals the inclusion of new details and hints at a rather different function for this image. Rather than standing before a tableau, the Er?n Var?ha wears its narrative like a costume; from the nooks and crannies of the boar's body emerges a human, superhuman, animal, and vegetal menagerie.The earth goddess, her face calmly composed and her hair gathered into a tidy bun beneath a bejeweled turban, hangs stiffly from the boar's right tusk (fig. 6). The majority of the boar's lumpish body is covered with rows of standing male figures holding water jugs in their left hands and indicating either abhaya mudr? (reassurance) or vismaya mudr? (wonder) with their right hands. Dressed in thick, striated robes, with their hair piled into top-knots and pointy little beards on their faces, these figures seem to be forest-dwelling ascetics. In order to indicate the great multitude of sages on the boar's body, the artist depicts each row as a staggered line of bodies, with the figures in the front depicted from the knees up and only the heads of the figures in the back visible. Flying celestial figures flit about in each of the boar's ears (fig. 7),22 and a garland containing twenty-eight roundels encircles Var?ha's neck and shoulders.23 Additional iconography, not seen in the Udayagiri Var?ha, also adorns the front of the Er?n Var?ha, revealing both the boar's identity as an incarnation of Visnu and that the artists at Er?n were experi menting with new ways of rendering Var?ha. On the boar's broad snout, a fat, round tongue emerges from between two rows of square teeth, and a female figure - perhaps the goddess of speech, V?c - stands with her hands on her hips (fig. 2).24 The broad chest of the boar includes the image's inform ative inscription (fig. 8), the details of which are considered below. Just below the inscription appear additional rows of sages, which are interrupted by a larger, now badly damaged male figure. This frag mentary figure seems to have been an anthropomorphic representation of Visnu, a reminder of the mighty boar's underlying identity. Seven male figures, their calves and knees included, also appear on 22 Rangaraj an, Varaba Images, 49 ? 23 While twenty-seven of these circles contain male and female figures, which Rangarajan identifies as the twenty-seven stars of the Hindu zodiac, a scorpion is prominently depicted within the twenty-eighth circle, leading her to specu late that the image was dedicated "during the Vrscika Rasi period of the Hindu Zodiac (Scorpio) which is considered to be very auspicious. " Ibid. 24 Based on the appearance of the Sarasvat?, the goddess of knowledge, holding her vina on the snout of later, more elab orate images of Var?ha such as that at Khajuraho, Rangarajan identifies this rather nondescript and iconographically ambiguous female deity with her arms akimbo as the goddess of knowledge \Varaba Images, 49. However, Williams suggests that this figure may be V?c, the personification of speech; Ari of Gupta India, 130. 129</page><page sequence="8">the chest of the Var?ha (fig. 9). These figures are clearly differentiated from the sages by both costume and pose. The figure furthest to the left clasps two lotus flowers and wears a tunic and boots. The remaining six figures are all clean-shaven men wearing headdresses and holding water vessels. The sages wear course robes, but the diaphanous garments of these six figures reveal the contours of each man's legs. Williams identifies this group as the saptagrahas, or seven planets, which include S?rya, the sun god, in his characteristic tunic and boots.25 Stephen Markel asserts that this group on the chest of the Er?n Var?ha is the earliest extant depiction of the seven planets in India, the absence of R?hu and Ketu corresponding to the earliest textual accounts of the planets, which only mention seven deities.26 The inclusion of this early version of the planetary deities suggests that the artists and donors of the Er?n Var?ha were experimenting with new iconography. The enigmatic stump-like structure on top of the boar's back further suggests a spirit of experi mentation (fig. 10). The structure was originally carved on four sides, but the faces are now badly abraded and difficult to analyze and photograph. Three sides of this object are clearly carved with the figure of a rotund man seated in an awkward approximation of r?jalll?sana. In the worst state of preser vation, the east-facing fourth side retains only traces of sculpture to indicate that a similar seated figure was originally carved here. The relatively well-preserved south-facing side features a man with at least two faces seated above what Rangarajan argues are the hoods of a multiheaded n?ga. Most likely this figure originally had a third face, but the area above the right shoulder, where another head would be expected, is damaged. While a decapitated body remains on the west-facing side, the figure on the north side of the stump-like structure may have originally had three faces as well. One face peers over the figure's left shoulder, but damage and lichen obscure the other heads from view. Two stalks, one thick and serpentine and the other thin and vegetal, were carved to creep up the Var?ha's left leg. The thicker stalk passes beneath the north side of the mound and seems to reappear in the form of the ruffly hoods beneath the seated figure on the south side of the mound. Much like the flowery cap on the head of the man-boar from Er?n or the lotus hovering above the head of the Udayagiri Var?ha, the thinner stem climbs up the theriomorphic Var?ha's leg and blooms into the delicate lotus cap on top of the mighty boar's head. In addition to the damage and ambiguous iconography of these figures, the infre quent appearance of the mound on subsequent images of Var?ha compounds the mystery. After its first appearance on the Er?n Var?ha, no such stump-like structure appears on the back of theriomor phic images of Var?ha for several centuries.27 Rangarajan provides one interpretation of the mysterious stump, explaining that the niches "are occupied by a figure of Saumya Purusa (V?sudeva) on the west, a figure of Siva on the south, a figure of four-headed Brahm? on the north, and a figure of Visnu on the east."28 She further identifies these 25 Williams, Art of Gupta ?ndia, 130. Hovering above this goddess's head, the shallowly incised srvatsa (the auspicious floral motif that often adorns images of Visnu) may be later graffiti. 26 Stephen Markel, Origins of the Indian Planetary Deities, Studies in Asian Thought and Religion 16 (New York: Edwin Mellen Press, 1995), 87. 27 Rangarajan argues that this mound continues until the fourteenth century (p. 52); however, the only other example she discusses is an image of Var?ha in C?ndpur that dates to the twelfth century and features a boxlike structure with carved faces, rather than seated figures, on its back. Rangarajan, Var?ha Images, figs. 79-82. 28 Ibid., 52. I30</page><page sequence="9">figures as the four vy?has (emanations) of Supreme Being described in the Ahirbudhnya S ambita.19 She describes a four-headed image of Brahma as facing north and seated upon the seven hoods of Sesa. The figure on the north side does seem to have had multiple heads originally, but the south-facing figure, which Rangarajan identifies as ?iva, sits above the serpent hoods, while the figure on the north sits above what seems to be the body of the serpent. Rangarajan may have inadvertently mixed up which figure corresponds to which direction; however, this error raises a real question. If the figures on both the south and the north sides have multiple faces, how can we determine which is Brahma and which is Siva? Other scholars have advanced tentative identifications of the figures on the stump-like object on the back of the Er?n Var?ha. James Harle admits that no " convincing explanation has so far been given for the stump over the boar's shoulders (Fleet called it a small four-sided shrine) and it tends to dis appear in later periods,"30 but then suggests that one or more of these multiheaded figures might be Brahma and adds that the figure facing south sits atop an open tala leaf.31 However, not only do the gentle scallops of the protrusion fail to suggest the sharp fronds of a palm, but what, if any, signifi cance this sort of palm-leaf might have in connection with either Brahma or Var?ha is unclear.32 Based on the appearance of Brahm? above the head of the Udayagiri Nr-Var?ha, Williams suggests that the mound on the Er?n Var?ha's back is a manifestation of Brahm?.33 According to Williams, the mound might also be a sacrificial post, or yupa.34 As will be considered more fully below, Agrawala's transla tion of the Matsya Pur?na reveals that the head of Var?ha is compared to Brahm?, his shoulders are broad like the fire altar, and "the long y?pa with its curved top is similar to the projecting tusks of the boar. "35 Although this stump-like form itself does not seem to take the form of a yupa, the association between Var?ha and components of the sacrifice must be considered further. Comparisons of the Er?n theriomorphic Var?ha with later images of Var?ha suggest that the inclu sion of Brahm? may serve to remind the viewer that this colossal boar is none other than Visnu, whose incarnations maintain cosmic order. For example, both the ninth-century theriomorphic Var?ha from Badoh and the tenth-century theriomorphic Var?ha from Khajuraho sport an expanded array of more iconographically identifiable deities on their bodies. Both also include figures carved near the top of the boar's head that seem more clearly identifiable as Brahm?. The Khajuraho Var?ha includes an image of Brahm? seated on a lotus blossom and supported by four figures (fig. 11). Although a lotus 29 Ibid. 30 Harle, Gupta Sculpture, 38. 31 Ibid. 32 A comparison between the Er?n Var?ha and a later theriomorphic Var?ha, such as the ninth-century image from Badoh, lends some support to Rangarajan's contention that this form beneath the south face of the box is indeed ser pentine and not vegetal, as Harle suggests. Three figures, possibly manifestations of Brahm?, sit atop lotuses while the hoods of a serpent wrap around behind them. A separate lotus blossom cap also adorns the head of the Badoh boar. The body of the snake and the stem of the lotus follow the Var?ha's left front leg to the ground. On both the Er?n and Badoh Var?has an attempt seems to have been made to differentiate between a lotus stalk and the thicker body of a serpent. 33 Williams, Art of Gupta India, 130. 34 Ibid. 35 Agrawala, Solar Symbolism, 15-17. 131</page><page sequence="10">flower blossoms in this space on top of the Er?n Var?ha's head, perhaps the stump-like object near the head is a similar indication of Brahm?'s presence and the close relationship between Brahm?'s role as the architect of the universe and Visnu's function as its protector - a relationship made clear in roughly contemporaneous scenes of Visnu resting on his serpent, Sesa. In a well-known relief sculpture from the early-sixth-century Visnu temple at Deogarh, Visnu reclines peacefully while his personified weapons prepare to do battle with the demons Madhu and Kaitabha, who threaten to disrupt the cre ation of the universe. With this imminent threat contained, Brahm?, poised to bring the universe into being, placidly floats on a lotus flower emerging from Visnu's naval. In his discussion of other images of Visnu's avatars, John Irwin unintentionally provides another cosmogonically charged interpretation of the stump atop the Er?n Var?ha. Irwin examines a twelfth to thirteenth-century stone relief from Chamba of Visnu in his incarnation as Matsya, rendered as a theriomorphic fish.36 Irwin suggests that a flowery pillar in the relief conveys Matsya's role in the cre ation of the universe. "Clearly, this is a Cosmic Pillar, linking the Waters to the Sun.... The survival of the pure' form of the fish in Chamba... suggests that there had been some even older association of Visnu as a god of the Primeval waters. "37 The Er?n Var?ha, which is admittedly not only centuries ear lier in date but a giant object of worship, may similarly refer to the cosmic pillar. Perhaps this boxy structure represents the cosmic pillar as if emerging from the boar and thereby revealing the avatar's role not just as the earth's rescuer but more broadly in stabilizing the cosmic order and allowing for creation to occur. Indeed, the opening lines of the Er?n Var?ha's inscription announce that the boar "is the pillar (for the support) of the great house which is the three worlds."38 While this remains only a tentative suggestion for the form on the boar's back, the stubbornness with which this stump-like structure eludes identification points to the emergent nature of this iconographie form. TEXTUAL ANALOGIES Textual versions of the story of Var?ha's rescue of the earth reveal a few broad trends, specifically the development of Var?ha as an incarnation of Visnu and the connection between the body of the boar and the performance of sacrifices, that help further illuminate the Er?n Var?ha's iconography.39 The earliest connection between Visnu and a boar appears in the Rg Veda, with later versions of the story of Var?ha occurring, with a number of variations, in the R?m?yana, the Mah?bh?rata, and the Pur?nas. Maheswari Prasad explains that "there are two phases in the development of the Var?ha-katha, the first cosmogonical and the second avat?ra phase. "4? To summarize, the first phase deals with Var?ha as the creator of the universe: everywhere there is water, and, ever fond of burrowing and mucking 36 John Irwin, " Visnu in the Archaic Cosmogony, " Indian Art and Connoisseurs hip: Essays in Honor of Douglas Barrett, ed.

In the second phase, the "old cosmogonical myth began to transform itself under the classical doctrine of incarnation."41 In these versions of the tale, Visnu incarnates himself as Var?ha in order to subdue malevolent forces that have caused the earth to sink into the ocean.42 In some instances, in his quest to save the earth Var?ha must fight the demon Hirany?ksa, and "in the light of the Avat?ra concept, the Var?ha-kath? lost its cosmogonical con text."43 The Er?n theriomorphic Var?ha would seem to fall somewhere in between these two phases: the inclusion of the pillar-like structure on the image's back suggests the creation myth, and the depic tion of an anthropomorphic form of Visnu on the boar's chest reveals that the animal is an incarnation of the god. Other textual sources, such as the Matsya Pur?na44 shed light on the choice of a theriomorphic form of the colossal Er?n Var?ha in their introduction of the concept of Yaj?a Var?ha, a boar whose body is comprised of the components of a sacrifice. According to Vasudeva Agrawala's analysis of Yaj?a Var?ha, the boar's feet represent the Vedas, which are four in number, and the tongue is compared to Agni the god of fire, who conveys the sacrificial offering to the gods.45 Var?ha's bristles are like the kusa grass spread on the fire altar, his head is likened to Brahm?, and his nostrils drip with ghee, as his snout serves as the ladle for the clarified butter.46 This textual comparison between Var?ha's body and the elements of a sacrifice include almost every imaginable body part of a boar - even the animal's penis is likened to the offerings sprinkled into the fire.47 Moreover, this text seems to be describing Var?ha as an animal and not as a boar-headed human. For example, the feet are likened to the four Vedas, which assumes that the boar must have four feet and not two hands and two feet as seen in the Nr-Var?has. Yet the body of the Er?n boar lacks literal references to the sacrifice. The boar has four feet, as most boars do, but the feet are in no way marked to suggest they are like the Vedas. The boar has a prominent snout, but butter dripping from the nostrils has not been depicted. Likewise, the bris tles that resemble kusa grass, are absent from the Er?n Var?ha. The Er?n Var?ha is not a literal representation of the textual accounts of the Yaj?a Var?ha, but perhaps the very theriomorphic form of Var?ha alludes to the sacrificial act more generally. The iden tification of the boar as a sacrificial animal seems to be rooted in practices designed to ensure agricul tural fecundity. Jan Gonda explains that "[t]he Gonds immolate pigs to their god Busa Deo and the Hindus of the central parts of India sacrifice them to their deity Bhains?sur, or the buffalo demon, for the protection of the crops.... "4 Although Gonda neglects to establish the antiquity of these pig sac rifices,49 he seems to imply that these practices are connected to long-held rituals designed to harness 41 Ibid., 150. 42 Ibid. 43 Ibid., 151. 44 Agrawala, Solar Symbolism. 45 Ibid., 15-16. 46 Ibid., 16. 47 Ibid., 18. 48 J.

By Gupta time the cult of the divine boar was assimilated to Hi</page><page sequence="20">the regenerative power of the boar. Agrawala further argues for a cosmogonie understanding of the Yaj?a Var?ha, in which the boar as a fat-dripping sacrificial animal is linked to S?rya, the sun as a sym bol of the Cosmic Fire, the melting fat from which powers creation.50 Perhaps the lithic theriomor phic form of the Er?n Var?ha serves as a permanent surrogate for the actual sacrifice of a live boar,51 which ensures the stability of the universe, just as the rays of the sun eternally enact the cosmic fire. Yet Yaj?a Var?ha is not just a sacrificial animal; it is the embodiment of an entire sacrifice from start to finish. We might reasonably wonder: which sacrifice ? Willis, in his analysis of the colossal Nr Var?ha at Udayagiri, suggests that the sacrifice embodied by Yaj?a Var?ha is tied to the asvamedha sacrifice, the performance of which allows the ruler to possess the earth. As Willis argues, "the Gupta kings did indeed perform the horse sacrifice, but the same result could be achieved more efficiently and directly by engaging with Visnu - the living god, who in the form of Var?ha, was the theistic embodiment of sacrifice."52 Continuing, Willis explains that the colossal image of Var?ha at Udaya giri "advertised the king's intimacy with the god who possesses the earth and who is the embodiment of those rites that conferred legitimacy and possession of the earth. "53 Thus, for Willis, the Udayagiri Var?ha, with its clear narrative of rescuing the earth, and the performance of annual rituals at the larger site legitimized royal claims to landownership. Willis's suggestion that the Udayagiri Nr-Var?ha, in particular, embodies the sacrifice requires further consideration, as the Yaj?a Var?ha described in texts like the Matsya Pur?na seems to be more "boarish." The Yaj?a Var?ha has four feet and bristles, which would not be components of the anthro pomorphized representations of Nr-Var?ha. In fact, throughout her study of Var?ha images, Rangara jan refers only to theriomorphic images of the god as "Yaj?a Var?ha. " The all-boar form of the Er?n Var?ha resembles a sacrificial animal more directly than the much more regal-looking Udayagiri Nr Var?ha. I do not wish to suggest that Willis's understanding of the colossal Udayagiri Var?ha is incor rect. Indeed, his case for the manner in which this image and its sacrificial implications embody Gupta imperial claims - particularly to the possession of land - is persuasive. Rather, in the spirit of Willis's "variations on a theme," I wish to explore how the Er?n theriomorphic Var?ha, which refers to the Yaj?a Var?ha more overtly, might embody the sacrifice in ways that are slightly different from the claims of imperial landownership that Willis ties to the Udayagiri Nr-Var?ha. that of Visnu. " While Basham here hints at the antiquity of boar worship in India, he makes no mention of the nature of the worship of boars and whether or not it involved sacrifices. A. L. Basham, The Wonder That Was India (1954; reprint, Calcutta: Rupa &amp; Co., 1996), 298. 50 Agrawala, Solar Symbolism, ij. 51 How exactly the theriomorphic form of Var?ha was to be worshipped is unclear. It is difficult to imagine that Var?ha should be worshipped with actual sacrifices of boars. Jaiswal cites the Visnudharmottara as stating that gay?s?rsa and the sr?ddha ceremonies were appropriate rituals for honoring Var?ha. Suvira Jaiswal, The Origin and Development of Vaisnavism (New Delhi: Munshiram Manoharlal, 1981), 132. 52 Willis, Archaeology, 164. 53 Ibid., 165. 142</page><page sequence="21">INSCRIPTIONAL EVIDENCE The Er?n theriomorphic Var?ha's inscription (fig. 8) further reveals how the theriomorphic form of the Yaj?a Var?ha, with its emphasis on sacrifice, might express the personal and political goals of its patron, Dhanyavisnu. The opening lines of the inscription, which began this article, appropriately praise Visnu in his boar incarnation. However, we also learn that this image was created for "Dhanyav ishnu, - the younger brother, obedient to him (and) accepted with favor by him, of the Mah?r?ja M?trivishnu, who has gone to heaven. "54 The inscription is a panegyric to the king M?trvisnu, "who was possessed of unimpaired honor and wealth" and his lineage, as M?trvisnu is described as the great grandson of "Indravisnu, who was attentive to his duties, who celebrated sacrifices; who practised pri vate study (of the scriptures)', who as a Br?haman saint; (and) who was the most excellent (of the follow ers) of the Maitr?ymya. "55 M?trvisnu is also the grandson of "Varunavishnu, who imitated the virtu ous qualities of (his) father," and the son of "Harivishnu, who was the counterpart of (his) father in meritorious qualities. "56 The inscription specifies that the temple to N?r?yana in the form of the boar was created by Dhanyavisnu in accordance with the previous wishes of his now deceased brother "for the sake of increasing the religious merit" of their parents.57 Given that the Er?n Var?ha's inscription includes a tribute to M?trvisnu and is dedicated to the brothers' parents, the image seems intended to function as an offering to Visnu in order to ensure the well-being of Dhanyavisnu's deceased family members. The identification of Var?ha in his theriomorphic form as Yaj?a Var?ha seems all the more meaningful in light of this inscription, as the performance of sacrificial rites is described as part of the lineage, inaugurated by M?trvisnu's great-grandfather Indravisnu. This image of Yaj?a Var?ha, which memorializes M?trvisnu and the family's role as sacrificial officiants, may also refer to the monthly sr?ddha rites, which are intended to ensure the welfare of one's deceased ancestors. We might imag ine that the Yaj?a Var?ha, which embodies an entire Vedic sacrifice in perpetuity, is an appropriate form of the deity with which to honor and look after the deceased members of this family of learned Br?hmans who have become local rulers. When considered alongside the other remains at the site - specifically the earlier Garuda pillar dedicated by M?trvisnu and his younger brother, Dhanyavisnu - the Er?n Var?ha's inscription, which mentions the new ruler Toram?na, also suggests that the choice to install a colossal theriomorphic boar was inspired in part by a shift in the political landscape of the region. The inscription on the pillar reveals that the brothers had hoped to increase their parents' religious merit by honoring Visnu in the form of his v?hana, the bird Garuda.58 The inscription also records the dedication of the column dur ing the reign of King Buddhagupta in the year 165 of the Gupta era (c. 485 CE).59 The brothers honor Buddhagupta with the title " bh?patau, " 60 which literally means " ruler of the earth.

(Delhi: Motilal Banarsidass, 1998), 722. 143</page><page sequence="22">ital further mentions that Surasmichandra, who is described as a mah?r?ja, the same title M?trvisnu adopts for himself, is governing the region, seemingly as a feudatory of Buddhagupta and as Matrvisnu's overlord.62 After this brief mention of the political power structure in the region, the inscription praises Matrvisnu's wealth, fame, and victories in battle, and, much like the Er?n Var?ha's inscription, eulogizes M?trvisnu's illustrious forebears.63 By the time the theriomorphic boar was complete, however, the political climate in the area had changed sufficiently that Dhanyavisnu felt it prudent to have the date of the Var?ha recorded as "In the first year; while the Mah?r?j?dhir?ja, the glorious Toram?na of great fame (and) of great luster, is governing the earth. "64 Toram?na, a H?na ruler, had replaced the Guptas as the overlord of the region. Dhanyavisnu chose to honor the new H?na leader with the title "Mah?r?j?dhir?ja," literally "the king who is the foremost of the great kings. "65 This same title was used by Samudragupta on the Allahabad pillar inscription but was not used by the brothers in their mention of Buddhagupta on the Garuda pillar. Clearly, Dhanyavisnu did not take Toram?na's rule lightly. After the death of his elder brother and the change in power in the Malwa region in the early years of the sixth century, Dhanyavisnu may have faced something of a dilemma as he contemplated the cre ation of a suitable family memorial and offering to the divine. He and his elder brother were devout followers of Visnu, as evidenced by their patronage of the Garuda pillar; however, the installation of Vaisnavite imagery may have seemed like an endorsement of Gupta authority, as the Guptas them selves were followers of Visnu, as suggested by Samudragupta's adoption of the Garudadhvaja, or Garuda-standard, for his coins and as an emblem of the Gupta dynasty.66 Michael Willis further sug gests that the brothers' great-grandfather Indravisnu - who, according to both the Var?ha and Garuda pillar inscriptions, was a leader of the Maitr?yan?yas, a school of learned priests skilled in the perform ance of Vedic rituals - may have been called upon to act as an officiant at Candragupta's r?j?s?ya at Udayagiri,67 indicating a close association with the Guptas. Moreover, if we accept Willis's argument that the colossal Nr-Var?ha at Udayagiri was a key component in the production of Gupta imperial power, the creation of an image of Var?ha that extols the new H?na ruler, whose foreign origins mark him as the leader of the very sort of armies from which Candragupta II sheltered his people, seems somewhat perplexing. If Var?ha is so redolent with Gupta authority, how can this form of the deity be appropriate to mark the first year of the H?na ruler's claim over this region? Perhaps the choice to create an image of Var?ha in theriomorphic form allowed this image of Var?ha to be simultaneously a memorial to the patron's family and a monument less overtly laden with Gupta associations than a colossal Nr-Var?ha. In fact, the image of a colossal boar might have had relevance both to Dhanyavisnu and within a H?na imaginary. 62 S. R.

To understand how the theriomorphic Varaha might also have been meaningful - or at least not an affront - to a foreign ruler like Toram?na requires some consideration of the H?nas and the visual cul ture in which they participated. As a nomadic people, the H?nas left behind few records of their own, and attempts to uncover the origins of the H?nas have yielded confused, often racially stereotyped results. While the term "H?na" seems to be a Sanskritization of "Hun,"68 some scholars differentiate the tribes that invaded India from those Huns whose incursions into Europe culminated in Attila's conquests in the fifth century CE .6? While one branch of the Huns ravaged the Roman Empire, another group, known as the Hephthalites, invaded Persia and eventually northwest India.70 Numismatic evi dence suggests that by the late fifth century the H?nas had established a presence in Gandh?ra under their leader Thujina, Toram?na's father.71 While little is known about Toram?na's genealogy or how he rose to power, his barbarous reputation continued to be his legacy for much of the twentieth cen tury. Thakur perhaps somewhat facetiously offers a stereotypical and exaggerated description of the bloodthirsty H?nas' campaigns: Through conflagration and death, battles and the terrors, the reck [sic] and the cries, across heaps of corpses and to the accompaniment of the agonized curses of the innocent, dying civilians and the exultant shout of plundering soldiers rose Toram?na, a new star in the political firmament of India, whose only companion was his sword and whose only love was conquest and bloodshed.72 Toram?na took a long enough respite from fighting to father a son, his successor Mirhirakula, whose own reputation for vicious bloodlust surpasses even that of his father. Unfortunately, the history of the H?nas seems to be informed by the accounts of their enemies. The H?nas, specifically Toram?na and Mirhirakula, left behind little more than coinage and a few inscriptions and seals. While Toram?na's foreign origins seem clear, the nature of his supposed reign of terror is less sub stantiated. Although the name "Toram?na" is of Turkish derivation and means "rebel or insurgent," epigraphic evidence regarding Toram?na reveals a somewhat tolerant ruler.73 In addition to the Er?n Var?ha inscription, Toram?na is mentioned as Mah?r?j?dhir?ja on a copper plate that records the dona tion to a temple in Vadrap?li by a group of businessmen.74 Toram?na is also associated with an inscrip 68 Atreyi Biswas, The Political History of the Hunas in India (New Delhi: Munshiram Manoharlal, 1973), 26. 69 In his consideration of the " World of the Huns, " Maenchen-Helfen only examines the exploits of the Huns in Europe. See J. Otto Maenchen-Helfen, The World of the Huns, ed. Max Knight (Berkeley: University of California Press, 1973). 70 Yamada argues against this conflation of the Hephthalites and the Hunas; rather, Yamada suggests that the Heph thalites and the Hunas were two separate nomadic tribes that both entered India from the northwest. The Hephthalites ruled the region of Gandh?ra, while the Hunas, led by Toram?na and his son, conquered central India. Meiji Yamada, "H?na and Hephthal," Zinbun 23 (1989): 102. 71 Biswas, The Political History, 55. 72 Upendra Thakur, The Hunas in India (Varanasi: Chowkhamba Sanskrit Series Office, 1967), 95. 73 Ibid., 96. 74 R.

H5</page><page sequence="24">tion that commemorates the construction of a Buddhist monastery in Kura.75 As these inscriptions fail to reveal conclusively that Toram?na ruled with an iron fist, there may be little reason to assume that he was any more nefarious than his Gupta predecessors. Although the religious beliefs of Toram?na and the H?nas are difficult to determine, the best evi dence suggests that the H?nas were Zoroastrians and worshippers of fire and sun. The copper and sil ver coins associated with Toram?na and other H?na rulers featured a variety of imagery, including horse and rider figures, peacocks, solar discs, and fire altars.76 According to Thakur, "Toram?na's pref erence for solar worship is also evidenced by his building a temple to the Sun in Multan and by nam ing his son Mirhirakula or Mihiragula meaning the sun-flower. "77 Thakur concludes that Toram?na, "a shrewd statesman and foresighted administrator," tolerated the various religions of his subjects in order to maintain his authority as ruler.78 The Er?n theriomorphic Var?ha, associated with fire sac rifice and, hence, the creative power of the sun,79 might have been a suitable manifestation of Visnu with which to commemorate the start of the reign of a solar-worshipping H?na ruler such as Toram?na. Moreover, perhaps the inclusion of S?rya, dressed as a foreigner in his boots and tunic, on the chest of the boar makes the Er?n Var?ha's association with the sun even more explicit. The question still remains as to why this particular solar symbol - the giant boar - was chosen for a monument that marked Toram?na's new claim over Malwa. Although the wild boar is a potent sym bol in many cultures,80 boars do not appear on any of the coins associated with Toram?na. However, the boar motif was important to the contemporaneous Sassanian rulers of Iran. Spanning the third through the seventh centuries CE, the Sassanian empire interacted with various nomadic tribes such as the Kus?nas and the Hephthalites.81 While such tribes were often subject to the Sassanians, by 484 CE, Hephthalite forces had invaded Iran, killed the Sassanian king Peroz (r. 459-484), and made the Sassanian empire a tributary.82 Just as Toram?na and Mirhirakula's sovereignty over parts of India was 75 Thakur, The H?nas, 261. Other scholars, especially Yamada, question the identity of the Toram?na mentioned in the Kura inscription. Yamada argues that because Toram?na is described as "maharaja toram?na-sha[hi] jau-" - the frag ment jau referring to Jauvala, a Hephthalite place name - the Kura inscription must refer to a different Toram?na than the Toram?na described as mah?r?j?dhir?ja in other inscriptions. The existence of two Toram?nas may also explain why some of the coins associated with Toram?na follow Sassanian types and others resemble the coins of the Guptas. See Alexander Cunningham, Later Indo-Scythians (1893-94; reprint, Varanasi : Indological Bookhouse, 1962), 85. While this epigraphic and numismatic evidence may suggest the existence of two Toram?nas, it may also demon strate the manner in which a foreign ruler attempted to reign over a large region inhabited by a diverse population by harnessing the popularity of local deities. 76 See Robert Gobi, Dokumente zur Geschichte der Iranischen Hunnen in Baktrien und Indien, 4 vols.

Thus, Sassanian depictions of boars may have been known to the Hephthalites. The wild boar and scenes of the hunt seem to have been a potent symbol of royal authority for the Sassanians. For example, King Peroz is represented hunting boar in the stone reliefs from T?q-i-Bust?n. Dating to the fifth century, vivid hunting scenes enliven the sidewall of Cave at T?q-i-Bust?n. The relief of a boar hunt captures the drama of the chase (fig. 12), while also demonstrating the king's mas tery of the situation. As troops on elephants herd the boars, the frightened animals make a mad dash through a swampy thicket of reeds. To the melodic accompaniment of harp-playing musicians, the king, his heroic presence emphasized by the use of hierarchic scale, stands with bow and arrow aimed at the massive boar that has launched itself into an acrobatic dive towards the king's skiff (fig. 13). The king's hunting prowess is evident as the boar, its legs now crumpled, appears again tumbling and pre sumably dying. To the far right of the scene, the elephants depart with a cargo of dead boars, evidence of the king's successful hunting expedition. The Sassanians also separated boars from such narrative hunting scenes in order to depict the beasts alone as symbols of royal authority. Most likely worn as a pendant, a small gold boar, its body orna mented with an image of a lion killing its prey and a crescent moon motif, suggests to Roman Ghirsh man that " [t]his small object must have been a mascot owned by a member of a ruling House, for the boar, animal-incarnation of Verethragna, god of victory, was engraved on the royal seal affixed to edicts, treatises, and State papers. "83 The use of the boar as a heraldic symbol may explain the appear ance of framed boar heads in both stucco and textiles.84 A fifth- or sixth-century CE stucco from Damgh?n features the head of a bristly boar gnashing its fierce tusks in the center of a roundel.85 A fragmentary painting from a cave at B?miy?n also depicts a roundel surrounding a boar's head, its mouth agape as if prepared to bite a foe (fig. 14). In his discussion of the B?miy?n paintings, Rowland even suggests that the patron of this cave might have been a Hephthalite ruler emulating Sassanian models.86 None of these Sassanian-type boars can be linked to Toram?na directly, nor do these fierce, fiendish, and decidedly feral boars stylistically resemble the gentle giant at Er?n. However, this brief survey of "boarish" imagery from the fifth through the sixth century indicates the royal associations of this ani mal within West and Central Asia, the cultural environment in which the H?nas participated. The connection between boars and the Sassanian rulers seems especially relevant. The ferocity and cunning of the boar seem to have been attributes which the Sassanian rulers prized, so much so that the boar was the symbol of the house of King Chosroes II and the "title 'Boar of the Empire' Shahrvar?z was given to Sh?hen Vahmanza-dhagh?n, the most famous general of the armies of Chosroes II.

He would have been aware of the Sassanian respect for the boar and the association of the animal with victorious leaders. Thus, the Er?n Var?ha, by adopting the theriomorphic form, preserves the Vaisnavite narrative of Var?ha's rescue of the earth and emphasizes the sacrificial element of the Yaj?a Var?ha, which would have been meaningful to Dhanyavisnu and his family, while packaging this deity in the form of a boar, a symbol of political power within a larger visual culture that would be familiar to the region's new Huna ruler, Toram?na.88 CONCLUSIONS In the preceding pages, I have explored how the colossal image of Var?ha at the site of Er?n, one of the earliest representations of Var?ha in the form of a pure boar, might be understood as appropriate to shifting personal and political circumstances. This iconographie innovation builds on previous images of Nr-Var?ha, such as the Er?n and Udayagiri images, both of which despite their differences, depict the god Visnu as the powerful and compassionate savior of the earth. The colossal Udayagiri Nr-Var?ha in particular seems inextricably linked to claims of royal power - both in terms of the analogy between Var?ha's possession of the earth and the ruler's claim to landownership and, as Michael Willis has demonstrated, through the ritual performance of devotion to Visnu. The Er?n Var?ha also communicates the god's compassion and authority, but the theriomorphic form of the boar allows the image to resonate in additional ways. The Er?n Var?ha, in its all-boar form, seems to refer more directly to the Yaj?a Var?ha, an embodiment of a complete Vedic sacrifice that might have been especially meaningful given that this image is a memorial to the patron's recently deceased brother and their family. The image's inscription reveals that not only was the patron's brother, M?trvisnu, a powerful local ruler and ardent devotee of Visnu, but his great-grandfather was a learned, ritual specialist of the Maitr?yn?ya school. Thus, the Yaj?a Var?ha seems suited to the task of commemorating devotion to Visnu and the ritual authority of the brothers' lineage. Finally, per haps in recognition of the H?na Toram?na's rise to power in the Malwa region, the theriomorphic form of the Er?n Var?ha allows the image to participate in a larger visual culture of West and Central Asia, where boar imagery connotes royal authority. Yet we might wonder what Dhanyavisnu actually thought of the region's new foreign overlord, Toram?na. Given that the colossal Udayagiri Nr-Var?ha is overtly political and pro-Gupta, could the shift to the theriomorphic form of the Er?n Var?ha encode a subversive meaning beneath its appar ently diplomatic overtures? In her exploration of printed depictions of Var?ha from the early twenti eth century, Sumathi Ramaswamy explores an intriguing model for the political potential of icono 88 Fredrick Asher takes this argument even further, stating : " How can one fail to draw the connection when a statement about the boar's valorous deeds is followed immediately by a description of the strength of Toram?na and his allegedly mighty family - no doubt one whose importance needed to be established by such means as they were contemporaries of the vastly more heralded Guptas and whose alien heritage cast doubt on their right to sovereignty. Thus, the image serves as a visual metaphor and Var?ha's act as an allegory for Toram?na's usurpation of authority in Eran. " Asher, "Historical and Political Allegory," 58. 148</page><page sequence="27">graphic innovation.89 Whereas the ancient images of Var?ha considered here rescue an anthropomor phic earth goddess, the images Ramaswamy analyzes feature Var?ha lifting aloft the earth rendered as a globe with the geographic contours of the Indian subcontinent clearly visible. Ramaswamy argues that this new cartographically informed mode of depicting Var?ha harnesses the truth claims of sci entific endeavor, specifically the mapping of both the world and newly conceptualized national bound aries, not to suggest that colonial forms of knowledge have supplanted India's ancient legends but in order to legitimize the Hindu pantheon by equipping its deities with the trappings of scientifically verifiable reality. While recognizing not only the chasm of time between the Er?n Var?ha and the printed images of Var?ha that Ramaswamy considers, but also the different forms of address inherent in colossi and mass-produced imagery, we might wonder if the Er?n Var?ha adopts the theriomorphic form as a sort of ruse - one which avoids the overtly pro-Gupta sentiments of a colossal Nr-Var?ha, such as the Udayagiri image, but still calls upon Visnu for assistance. Could the Er?n Var?ha be something of a seditious act on the part of Dhanyavisnu - a monolithic plea for divine deliverance from the H?na overlord? While the motivations of the Er?n Var?ha's patron are likely to remain somewhat uncer tain, the colossal boar, in representing the god not with the heroic body of a man but with the lum bering bulk of a beast, nevertheless marks a meaningful innovation in Vaisnavite iconography. 89 Sumathi Ramaswamy, " Of Gods and Globes : The Terri totalization of Hindu Deities in Popular Visual Culture, " in India's Popular Culture: Iconic Spaces and Fluid Images, ed.
