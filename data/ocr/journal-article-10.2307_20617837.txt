Mobile phones, ATM machines, CAT scanners, GIS, satellite TV, ?Pods and DVDs are just some of the more commonplace pieces of tech that are used on a daily basis. Computer technology has brought many changes in the way we generate data, with consequent effects on and preferences for the way we absorb that information. Cutting, copying and pasting are useful tools but tend to be overused in certain quarters. Individual flair and communication skills seem to be taking a back seat in the maelstrom of activity that may be involved in archaeological research and excavation. Some time ago at a seminar I heard an archaeologist sounding the death-knell for the written word in terms of the presentation of artefacts to the public: three-dimensional graphics are to take over. One should be able to view artefacts across the internet, see them from any angle and magnification, and virtually hold them in one's hands. This was certainly an exciting idea but was being promoted at the expense of the written word?a seemingly deliberate degradation of the value of words in favour of graphics. This is reminiscent of the art that festoons the great passage tombs at Br? na B?inne and elsewhere. We can see what it is but we do not know what it means. For some reason the import of this art, with its cryptic designs and its lack of any obvious anthropomorphic or zoomorphic shapes, is enigmatic to say the least. Many have looked for meaning in such art, but the sense and purpose of the squiggles, spirals and lozenges seems certain to elude us for a long time to come. It is unlikely that a Rosetta Stone for this stuff will ever come to light. The discipline of archaeology brings us various recording techniques?some that have been around for a long time and others that struggle to keep up with new technological methods. Drawing, photography, and three-dimensional rendering and representations of artefacts and sites are common tools used in research. While these recording and illustrative techniques have to be recognised as essential in archaeological publications, they cannot replace the words, the vocabulary, the ideas and the philosophies that we use to express our interpretation of the remains of the past. For that reason, and for that reason alone, it is essential that archaeologists produce not just the grey literature and technical reports that characterise so much of today's archaeological output. For without interpretation and contextualisation of ancient evidence the result will be just another * *** -]-0*AA!M Tom Condit 3</page></plain_text>
