THE INVISIBLY INTEGRATED DESIGN OF URANIBORG: A LOOK AT SOME PHILOSOPHICAL ASPECTS OF THE GROUND PLAN OF TYCHO BRAHE'S HOUSE AND GARDEN, 1576-97 This paper investigates some philosophical aspects embedded within the first stage of the design of Uraniborg, a complex purposely built for Tycho Brahe on the island of Hven in the Danish sound in the sixteenth century in order to observe the stars and advance scientific study. His innovative scientific methods for measuring the positions of the stars provided the detailed and accurate observational data which enabled Johannes Kepler to formulate his theory of planetary motion. More than that, Brahe was a true Renaissance man, and it is aspects of that neo-Flatonic, Pythagorean philosophy that informed his cosmology and which were brought to bear on the design of his house and garden. This paper reports on a study of two images of an iconic design that present an integrated picture of Uraniborg, the house and garden created by the sixteenth-century astronomer Tycho Brahe (1546-1601) on the island of Hven, Denmark, for the purpose of observing the heavens.1 It is proposed that this integration goes beyond an architectural aesthetic and is based on philosophies which link the house and garden together in a dimensional world of functionality and belief. Brahe is known for his innovative astronomical observation techniques for which the greater part of his work was undertaken in Uraniborg, his 'Castle of the Heavens' (Figure l).2 What would become internationally famous as the Uraniborg estate extended over the whole island, and besides the house and garden, the complex consisted of an observatory with pioneering astronomical instruments, a paper mill and a printing press, farms, woods and fishponds. The house and garden became particularly distinguished for their symmetrical design. Whilst ahead of his time in some respects, Brahe was also a man of his time and throughout his career adhered as much to alchemy as he did to astronomy - the house contained an alchemical laboratory. If in today's science alchemy and astrology are wholly discredited, for Brahe and intellectuals like him these subjects were linked, the one informing the other.3 This helped to provide not only a diagnostic tool over a range of applications including medicinal requirements, but also a practical way of trying to understand a unified universe. It enabled investigation of a world of inter-relational dependencies where what happened above in the heavens impacted on the natural world in which man through his intelligence could read the signs and understand the mystery of meaning. Ownership of the island of Hven provided Brahe with an intellectual independence in which he was able to pursue not only astronomy and meteorology, but also other 23 Brackley Road, Heaton Chapel, Stockport, Cheshire SK4 2QT, UK</page><page sequence="2">ASPECTS OF TYCHO BRAHE'S HOUSE AND GARDEN, 1576-97 67 Figure 1.

His own printing press enabled him to disseminate his discoveries and thoughts. This independence would ultimately be one of several determining factors that forced him to flee from his beloved creation in 1597, which was demolished shortly after.4 The outline of the garden, however, remained visible as it was surrounded by large earth embankments.5 In recent years, there has been an increased momentum to commemorate Brahe and his work encouraged by a greater awareness of his role in astronomical history6 and his relationship with Johannes Kepler.7 This led to in-depth research with respect to the main building,8 while others investigated his garden.9 His nearby underground observatory was reconstructed in the 1980s and a new museum opened in 2005. Based on a project by the landscape architect Sven-Ingvar Anderson, work on the reconstruction of the gardens began in 1992.10 Previous interpretations of the design of the house and garden have often been centred within a modern and selective viewpoint of neo-Platonic or Paracelsian philosophy highlighting those aspects that favour modern understanding (such as harmony in nature) rather than the magical references which both include. Certainly in recent years there has appeared to be a drive towards regarding the house in Palladian terms, thereby ignoring other possibilities.11 This paper attempts to bridge this philosophical/ideological gap by taking advantage of modern scholarship in fields other than those traditionally exploited and thus interpret the design of the Uraniborg complex. To enable an analysis of the initial</page><page sequence="3">68 GARDEN HISTORY 38:1 design phase of the house and garden, it focuses specifically on fundamental aspects of Pythagorean mysticism which were common property during the sixteenth century. This geometry exercised 'an almost magical power'12 over architecture and architects at that time; Uraniborg will thus be presented from a different perspective - advocating another way of seeing.13 Perhaps in so doing it will provide a more balanced insight into another era, which in turn enables a back-to-basics and more empirical approach to unanswered questions regarding the design of Renaissance places. DAWN At sunrise on 8 August 1576, a foundation stone was laid on the island of Hven. The house that Brahe built, and the garden which surrounded it, are now known mainly from two contemporary woodcut illustrations (Figures 2 and 3),14 and although numerous archaeological investigations have taken place over the years, more questions remain than answers.15 Such remains as have been located suggest discrepancies between the reality of the construction and the ideal as depicted.16 Written in 1598 in exile, the illustrations of Uraniborg which Brahe included in his Astronomiae Instauratele Mechanica (1598)17 with a dedication to Rudolph II, Holy Roman Emperor, were symbolic on several levels and designed to be read and understood by his social and intellectual peers. Uraniborg was an expression and an extension of Brahe's natural philosophy, which included those hermetic beliefs which were: genuine attainments of a searching mind, operating not in a vacuum but within the web of a culture, tied to a vast network of related beliefs and hypotheses, limited by the store of his data and the scope of his view and fashioned by the beliefs of the time.18 In an age that predated the development of modern mathematics, intellectual exploration was an 'art' and ideas were expressed through painting, poetry and music, and in the scientific 'arts' through alchemy and astrology, all developed within a philosophy that was both relational and interconnected. In common with many of his scholarly contemporaries, Brahe was aware of 'occult' or hidden forces, such as those which heavenly bodies (for example, the Moon) exercised over the Earth (for example, the tides). It was these hidden forces that bound the universe together in a macrocosmic microcosmic relationship; to understand the world, it was necessary to try and interpret such hidden forces and, if at all possible, to harness and utilize them. This paper provides a context in which three aspects of the original Uraniborg design are discussed: firstly, it explores one of the many levels of meaning implicit within the initial design phase; secondly, the possibility of utilizing a back-to-basics approach to understanding the original first phase of the design, the ground plan of the house and garden; and thirdly, it considers the integrated nature of the relationship between the house and the garden. TYCHO BRAHE: A NEW STAR On 11 November 1572, Brahe observed a new, brilliant star in the constellation of Cassiopeia. His measurements showed that it really was a distant star and not any local phenomena. This was intriguing at that time, since the sphere of the stars was considered to be divine and perfect, hence no changes ought to take place there. Brahe observed its brightness regularly until it faded away the next year. He reported the event in his book De Stella Nova, which was published the following year, and which made him famous throughout Europe. This included in England, where Sir Thomas Smith, writing from</page><page sequence="4">ASPECTS OF TYCHO BRAHE'S HOUSE AND GARDEN, 1576-97 69 TOTIVS AMBITVS IT CAPACITATA O ELI NE ATI O Figure 2.

The Danish monarchy and aristocracy benefited from a period of prosperity, which affected the whole of Europe in the mid-sixteenth century.20 Frederick II was keen to reflect the status of the kingdom by</page><page sequence="5">70 GARDEN HISTORY 38:1 establishing a new building programme and promoting art, architecture and learning. By offering Brahe the island of Hven, he hoped to establish an institution of learning and discovery that would be at the forefront of scientific research. In terms of location, the island could provide separation from the world and the intrigues of the Danish Court which would allow Brahe to focus on his studies. EDUCATION AND ECLECTICISM Brahe was twenty-nine years old when he arrived on Hven. Educated at the University of Copenhagen, in his late teens he toured Europe,21 staying in university towns and attending lectures there. As a nobleman, it was his duty to return to Denmark and settle down as a courtier, but he had other and quite contrary ideas. He developed a passion for astronomy, which was matched by an interest in alchemy. Brahe was from a Lutheran background and as he travelled he would have seen the results of Reformation and Counter-Reformation politicking and knew the penalties for voicing opinions divergent to those prevailing. Opinions though are formed from an accumulation of many things, including education, observation and discussion with others and during Brahe's period, reading. The printing press was revolutionizing the spread of ideas and availability of information. Brahe himself was an avid collector of books, and his library was a source of pride, as well as knowledge.22 In the period during which Brahe was a student, the medieval curriculum of the trivium and quadrivium13 was becoming more flexible as interpretations of classic texts and commentaries appeared in print in Latin. The discipline of rhetoric required intensive training of the memory24 and that in turn demanded a broad intellectualism from which an argument could be constructed. The Phillipist interpretation of Lutheranism encouraged acquisition of knowledge as a way to progress the intellect (soul) towards the light of understanding.25 OCCULT/NATURAL PHILOSOPHY The sixteenth-century meaning of the word 'philosophy' included the love of wisdom, adeptness in occult science through alchemy, and an ability to predict the weather.26 The work of Christian hermeticists, neo-Platonists and alchemical philosophers suggested that the way to return to man's pre-lapserian state was through study, in particular through study of the Bible and scrutiny of Nature. Entwined within alchemical study was the use of astrology. Although it was Brahe's remit as Royal Astrologer to provide prognostication for the Danish Court, he himself regarded astrology as a method of interpreting the signs of a Creator. Brahe practised what is today termed iatro-chemistry or iatro-medicine27 and emphasis was laid on the Paracelsian nature of Brahe's alchemy.28 Whether this added to, or replaced, his Galenic knowledge is not known.29 Whatever the case may have been, astrology was a tool that facilitated his alchemy, the corresponding force which was believed to exist between the planets, mineralogy and human organs existed within plants as well. Based on past wisdom and observational rather than empirical study in a modern sense, a philosophy developed that sought to unify man within the natural world and a relationship which was perceived to exist between natural phenomena. The fundamental principles of this philosophy were supported by the study of cause and effect of matter in and on the world in which man was the central figure. Brahe's tour of Europe in the 1560s and early 1570s provided him with access to the latest humanist theories and the opportunity not only to discuss these with other scholars trained in the same educational disciplines as himself, but also with the chance to view some of the new building programmes which were springing up.30 It also provided the</page><page sequence="6">ASPECTS OF TYCHO BRAHE'S HOUSE AND GARDEN, 1576-97 71 opportunity to meet craftsmen,31 and perhaps to discuss the theory that lay behind the many architectural treatises that had been published and republished and those which were appearing. Philosophical considerations aside, when it came to the design of what would become Europe's first purpose-built, modern observatory, there were practical elements to be considered as well as the aesthetic concerns to extol the virtues of Denmark, Frederick II and himself. URANIBORG Fashion, too, played a mostly ornamental part in the design, both in the early version and to a greater extent in its later incarnation.32 It is probable that Brahe used the cubit as his basic form of measurement. Modern authors have translated the measurements that he provided into imperial feet or metres, and in so doing the mystical Pythagorean relationships that were behind the original calculations have been lost.33 These original 'numberforms' relate not only to proportion, but also to dimensions and the distribution of space.34 A precept of Pythagoreanism was that numbers were not abstract; they possessed qualities as well as quantities and had symbolic as well as geometric attributes. Reconstruction models have been made and articles written concerning the possible proportionality of the symmetrical Uraniborg, usually with reference to the later depiction.35 These viewpoints have often been expressed with hindsight. As J. L. E. Dreyer noted, 'it is always difficult to avoid judging the ideas of former ages by our own, instead of viewing them in connection with those which went before them, and from which they were developed'.36 Brahe's world was a musically modal, pre-diatonic, pre-Cartesian one. It was also one that was discovering new harmonies using notes which were always there but hidden. THE PYTHAGOREAN TETRAD: ONE POSSIBLE LEVEL OF MEANING This interpretation is based on the Pythagorean tetrad with its associated anthropomorphic and magical overtones. It is one of several levels of possible meaning as interpreted from written evidence that reflected an integral part of Brahe's cosmology and which found expression within the design of his 'Castle of the Heavens'. In true classical poetical terms, Brahe expressed his relationship to Urania his muse in the revelatory terms of a dream in which he is chosen by Apollo to do her bidding.37 Neo-Platonism was based on the rediscovery of the ancient Greek philosophies of Pythagoras, Plato and their followers. The hermetic tradition of arcane knowledge reached back to Egypt and the Cabala of mystical Judaism, which re-emerged in thirteenth-century Spain. In combination with magic, alchemy and astrology formed the ars magica of the Renaissance. They all advocated spiritual growth through the acquisition of greater insight: every human being, it was believed, had a divine spark and could find their way back to God through gnosis the illumination of knowledge. At a time when mysticism and science had not become dissociated, the harmonious world view of Pythagoras was hugely satisfying.38 Geometrically speaking, the number four provides the first solid body. One makes only a point, two makes only a straight line, three makes only a plane surface but four make a solid with volume and, therefore, is the proper number to represent the extended universe. The cruciality of four was its relationship with ten; essentially because for Pythagoreans this ideal number contained within itself the potentiality of perfection.39 The tetrad was the symbol of an all-embracing cosmology and the fundamental pattern existing throughout the universe. In consequence, there are four elements, four humours, four seasons, four corners of the world, four cardinal winds, four rivers of Paradise, four rivers of Hell, four archangels, four evangelists, four cardinal virtues, and so on.40</page><page sequence="7">72 GARDEN HISTORY 38:1 Based on the human form they express the relationship between the human figure and its geometrical offspring (Figure 4). Plato in the Timaeus explained that cosmic order and harmony are contained within certain numbers.41 This harmony could be found in the squares and cubes of the double and triple proportion starting from unity, which led him to two geometric progressions one, two, four, eight (as in the Uraniborg ground plan) and one, three, nine, twenty seven.42 The harmony of the world was expressed in these numbers embracing the secret rhythm in macrocosm and microcosm alike. The ratios between these numbers contain not only all the musical consonances, but also the inaudible music of the heavens and the structure of the human soul:43 'The cubit is formed from the square and the square in turn is formed from the man of perfect proportions.'44 In essence: 1 palm = 4 inches; 4 palms = 1 foot; 6 palms = 1 cubit; 4 cubits = 1 pace; 24 palms = 6 ft (ideal man's height). Although modern commentators have remarked on the small scale of Uraniborg, accounts by those who visited Brahe on the island do not remark on the size of the building. Brahe may have chosen the scale of his building because of economic factors and/or he may have based his ground plan on the height of the 'ideal man' and multiplied it by the ideal Pythagorean number ten to produce the dimensions of the central square upon which the design is founded. BACK TO BASICS Brahe, in common with many learned men of the sixteenth century, used astrology and alchemy as relational sciences to try to reveal the hidden forces which appeared to exist between man and his environment.45 To create his design he could have followed</page><page sequence="8">ASPECTS OF TYCHO BRAHE'S HOUSE AND GARDEN, 1576-97 73 the advice of Cesar Cesariano or Sebastiano Serlio46 or any of the many architectural treatises that had appeared before and since Daniele Barbaro's translation of Vitruvius (De architectural), the Latin version of which appeared in 1567. Such treatises advocated the use of a grid (tesserae)47 on which to construct the outline of the house and garden, which was conceived as an integrated whole and by using the relational Pythagorean measurements produce a design which generated its own ratio and thus was in tune with itself.48 Cesariano's commentaries on Vitruvius were republished in Antwerp in 1547, the same year as Serlio published Books I and II of his Architecttura. Either will serve as a basic model to draw up a ground plan. Starting with the point in the centre of a grid (the unity) produce a square 60 feet by 60 feet49 and working out symmetrically using the basic doubling proportion the result is a facsimile of the Uraniborg design (Figure 5). In sixteenth-century architectural terms the square is a generic feature in the ground plan of many buildings. For Serlio shapes were derived from the perfect square.50 In three dimensions it produces a cube and that is derived from the temple shape described by Vitruvius and featured in most of the well-known Italian architectural treatises that were influencing those being produced in France51 and Flanders.52 Brahe was a scholar and the likely author of the ground plan for the garden and building. The building was unique, particularly in terms of its function, and there are several architects known to have been involved,53 including Hans van der Paesschen54 and later Hans van Steenwinckel.55 These were experienced architects who had worked on buildings on the Danish mainland and in other parts of northern Europe.56 HOUSE AND GARDEN: AN INTEGRATED RELATIONSHIP In the ground plan the enclosed garden that surrounded 'Urania's hcmse' was integral to the design. It was linked to the unity point emanating from the naval of the 'ideal man', not only in terms of proportional relationships, but also by implicit connections: the diagonal axis created by the two prominent axes intersecting at the unity serve to focus the design on the house. However, certain factors, while being signature indicators of Italian Renaissance gardens, are not depicted in the original Uraniborg design.57 There are no obvious parterres, for example. A contemporary Renaissance garden was characterized as a geometric garden, the most fundamental ordering element within that space being compartmentalization.58 These elements are clearly shown in the later ^wfN Drawing: author Figure 5. Uraniborg, relational development: radius of circle, 60; inner square, 120; and outer square (inner wall), 240. Scale = 1:200.</page><page sequence="9">74 GARDEN HISTORY 38:1 depiction of Uraniborg where there are compartments subdivided by what may be lattice fencing or plant material.59 Most Italian gardens made a reference to antiquity through statues, topiary, labyrinths and grottoes, but these were not included in Brahe's original garden design. Antique references occur, but only as architectural ornamentation on the building. Although Uraniborg would include aviaries and arbours to encourage quiet contemplation, the original depiction does not display the ostentatious geometry of the later garden design. It was the human presence that distinguished Paradise from a garden, literally or through mythical references. The myth of Apollo and the Muses was the most widespread mythical reference represented, particularly in Italian Renaissance gardens.60 Uraniborg, however, was topped by a weather vane shaped in the image of Pegasus, his hoof striking Mount Helicon, bringing forth the Hippocrene spring in the form of a bronze automaton figure of Aquarius, which was located in the centre of the house and at the centre of the design at the unity point. This may also be an astrological reference since, in zodiacal terms, the fountain near the Pegasus constellation is that with which Aquarius feeds the fishes. The precise symmetry, the angular beds bisected by the four paths are the most prominent features of the garden design. The elements are mirrored on each side of the square. Viewed from above together with the house it presents a harmonic and hermetic reflection, the macrocosmic/microcosmic relationship of 'as above so below'.61 In practical terms this follows Leon Battista Alberti's decree that the same geometric figures should be employed in the garden as in the design of the building.62 At Uraniborg, the buildings at each corner of the site echo the central unit of the house. The diagonal axes that intersected the garden served to direct the view and link the individual units and seen from a higher position (the wall or the house, for example) ordered and unified the parts. From within the garden, however, the impression would have been of separate, enclosed spaces and the bi-axial nature of the garden encouraged movement along both the length and breadth of the space. The function of the axes was less about unifying the space and more to do with connecting the end points, physically and visually. In the early Uraniborg depiction (Figure 2) each path leads to a pergola within the central circle. In the area in front of the trees no detail is shown, but the accompanying key makes reference to herbaries and flower gardens. The wooded area is described, but whilst this is differentiated, the trees are not identifiable. In the absence of statues, fountains and other visual goals, the primary experience of the garden on entry through the gate was the house. Illustrations of the Pythagorean tetrad within the squared circle were abundant in hermetic writings.63 They brought together in diagrammatic form those elements discussed above. The early Pythagorean tetrads featured a dragon at the centre; the later theological versions were centralised on 'IHS', the symbol of Christ.64 At Uraniborg it focused on the acquisition of knowledge. GARDEN DESIGN In landscape terms what is shown in the earlier design of Uraniborg (Figure 2) has obvious cloistral overtones, a place for contemplation and the simple geometry reflects this.65 It is not known whether Brahe considered Alberti's suggestion that trees be planted with intertwined limbs to form geometric patterns. It may be that he decided to juxtapose regular and irregular forms with the tree planting left as 'natural' and the geometric compartments provided the ordered form. Francesco di Giorgio suggested that a garden be shaped in a circle, square or even a pentagon or a hexagon; the circle was considered the perfect geometric form because of its simplicity, uniformity and capabilities. It represented the perfection of the cosmos.66</page><page sequence="10">ASPECTS OF TYCHO BRAHE'S HOUSE AND GARDEN, 1576-97 75 It is likely, given Brahe's interest in iatro-chemistry, that there would have been a serious purpose to the garden - the sowing of herbs and plants for their medicinal as well as culinary qualities. Over the gateway to Uraniborg there was a sculpture illustrating alchemy akin to the impress characters used in Brahe's publications. Around the left arm of the figure the Aesculapian serpent is entwined, a symbol not only of the learning and analytical purpose of Uraniborg, but also its practical medicinal side.67 Above all, the original design of the Uraniborg garden would seem to fit with the Platonic garden described by Marsilio Ficino in his transcription of Ion: Tn the gardens of the Academy poets will hear Apollo singing beneath the laurels ... within the innermost sanctuary philosophers will recognise their Saturn as he contemplates the secrets of the heavens.'68 According to Ficino, when Plato refers to 'God', he means Apollo who, led by Jupiter, is the leader of the Muses illuminating the souls of the world and of the spheres and Urania is the voice of the 'starry heaven'.69 In common with other Renaissance gardens the aim was to recreate the gardens of the ancients and to surpass them. Antique texts inspired the planting of trees in ordered rows, terracing and the use of mythological representation. Whereas Italian gardens used these ideas and embellished them making great use of hydraulics, statues, grottoes and the like, Brahe in his garden on Hven does not appear to include any of these features in either garden design. SYMBOL OR IDEA The intellectual eclecticism (neo-Platonic/Hermetic/Parecelsian influences) within the design of Uraniborg means that the symbolism may be read in several ways. The Pythagorean mysticism and associated numberforms, whilst providing one possible explanation of the design process and the shape of the house, do not provide a clue as to the possible influences on the design footprint of the complex (the ground plan). Brahe's educational experiences provide further insight. Grammar, logic and rhetoric (trivium) formed the fundamental building blocks on which the higher-level subjects of arithmetic geometry, music and astronomy would be taught. These in turn provided the preparatory groundwork for higher-level study of theology or philosophy. A trained memory was an essential tool of the trade.70 In a gross oversimplification it may be stated that with this hermetic memory through which he grasps the world, man is reflecting the macrocosm in the microcosm of his mind: 'The magic of celestial proportion flows from his world memory into the magical worlds of his oratory and poetry and into the perfect proportions of his art and architecture.'71 These were talismanic images that could draw down power from above.72 TALISMANIC ASSOCIATIONS WITHIN THE DESIGN To train and aid memory there were systems that involved imagery association (once again, this is an oversimplification). One with which the astronomically and astrologically aware Brahe would have been familiar was the geometric shape used to describe Heaven (Figure 6).73 It enabled the order and the series of the images of Heaven to be engraved upon it in the mind's eye. The diagram is based on the twelve Houses of Heaven, the revolution of the sky taking place around the north and south poles. The diagrammatic shape for Heaven is a striking one and interesting enough, perhaps, to inspire a design that would reflect the macrocosmic world surrounding Uraniborg. Paralleling the Platonic and neo-Platonic attribution of ontological significance in the relationship between an ideal 'original' and its copy in nature, Ficino attributed ontological significance to the relation between a symbol and its original. From this link flows some measure of the potency of the original matter.

Uraniborg is depicted in perfect symmetry not only in its physical design, but also within a cosmological web. It was a design devised from a world view that was contained within a geostatic and finite universe and fitted perfectly within an ideological framework (Figure 7). Plants chosen for their iatro-chemical attributes could have been located in the garden according to their inherent zodiacal properties. This combined with astrological influences, such as the phases of the Moon or the likely influence of planetary movement on weather conditions, may have determined when and where a plant was placed in the ground.74 This of course is a purely speculative suggestion since evidential material is not extant. Uraniborg revolved around one man and it was designed to reflect his status and beliefs. The original garden design belonged to the philosophical house - a place for someone who was seeking answers. As his fame spread, important people visited Brahe and the ornate renovated garden design was that of someone who had found solutions to these questions. Just as changes were made to the interior of the house and additions made to the complex, so too the garden was developed over the period of Brahe's occupancy. Around 1591, the earthen walls were remodelled to include the exedra, the orchards were perhaps replanted and the garden redesigned. The design was then one that was less of a philosophic house and more the home of Apollo, the sun at the centre of a geostatic Tychonic universe (Figure 3). The synthesis of ideals that formed Brahe's cosmic view was complex and included factors considered strange today. Hermetic philosophy viewed God, the cosmos and humanity as forming an organic whole.75 By studying man it was possible to understand the universe, and by studying the universe it was possible to understand man. The heavens mirror the earth; as above so below; the interconnectedness and corresponding nature of phenomena. Celestial expression or worldly magic, the Uraniborg design was an intriguingly ambiguous statement of both. REFERENCES 1 For a fuller account, see Vivienne R.

(Ontario: Dover, 1982). 48 Brahe does not provide detailed measurements for Uraniborg, perhaps because it was unnecessary to do this; Raider et al, Tycho Brahe's Description, p. 126. 49 Ibid. 50 Peake, Five Books of Architecture, eh. 1, f.3, ?Of Geometrie'. 51 For example, the work of Jacques Androuet de Cerceau (c.1520-?:.1584). 52 por example, the work of Cornelis Floris de Vriendt (1514-75). 53 As far as Hanne Honnens de Lichtenberg's candidature of Johan Gregor van der Schardt is concerned - in Johan Gregor van der Schardt: Bildhauer bei Kaiser Maximilian IL, am d?nischen Hof und bei Tycho Brahe (Copenhagen: Museum Tusculanum Press, University of Copenhagen, 1991)- at this stage in my research I share the points made by Norbert Jopek in his review of the book in Burlington Magazine, 135/1089 (1993), pp. 833-4. My thanks to Isabel Swithenbank for her translation of Honnens de Lichtenberg. 54 Millar, Classical Architecture in Renaissance Europe, pp. 100-12. 55 Christianson, On Tycho's Island, pp. 299-300. 56 Vitruvius had exhorted all architects to gain a base of knowledge, which included astronomy, so that they were equipped to discuss their patron's needs; Frank Granger (ed./trans.), Vitruvius on Architecture, Books I V (Cambridge, MA: Harvard University Press, 2002), bk I.c.l, pp. 7-25. Alberti adopted a more pragmatic approach suggesting that a more superficial knowledge would be sufficient. He also recommended that the garden be seen as an extension of the house; Roy Strong, The Renaissance Garden in England (London: Thames 6c Hudson, 1979), p. 15. 57 For a comparison between Uraniborg and the Botanical Gardens of Padua, see Parrott, 'Moon, magic and Elysium', pp. 90-4. 58 David Jacques, 'The compartiment system in Tudor England', Garden History, 27/1 [special issue: 'Tudor Gardens'] (1999), pp. 32-5. 59 This division would seem to be more illustrative of Renaissance gardens in the north, such as those in the German states. Italian gardens usually favoured hedges and pergolas. 60 Claudia Lazzaro, The Italian Renaissance Garden: From the Conventions of Planting, Design and Ornament to the Grand Gardens of Sixteenth-Century Central Italy (New Haven and London: Yale University Press, 1990), p. 132. 61 For a succinct explanation, see Lyndy Abraham, A Dictionary of Alchemical Imagery (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1998), p. 129; and for a more in-depth summary, see Yates, Occult Philosophy in the Elizabethan Age, pt I. 62 Leon Battista Alberti, De re aedificatoria (written 1452, fully published Florence, 1485); repr./trans. by Giacomo Leoni as The Architecture Of Leon Battista Alberti In Ten Books, 3 vols (London, 1726-27); 3rd edn (1753-55) repr.

This also includes a diagram from Orince Fine's Protomathesis, which was his own personal cosmological statement; the central symbol represented his standing and birthplace. 65 This is not surprising perhaps when it is known that for several years before moving to Hven, Brahe had lived with his uncle at Herrevad, a former Cistercian monastery; although Uraniborg would be a secular rather than a religious space in the literal sense; John R. Christianson, 'Cloister and observatory: Herrevad Abbey and Tycho Brahe's Uraniborg', unpublished doctoral thesis, University of Minnesota, 1964, p. 157. Christianson terms the Uraniborg design an 'astronomical monastery'. 66 Lazarro, Italian Renaissance Garden, p. 75. 67 There was also symbolism in the types of plants used in Renaissance gardens. Laurel, for example, was sacred to Apollo. It was also a symbol for poetry. 68 Arthur Farndell (trans.), Gardens of Philosophy: Ficino on Plato (London: Shepheard-Walwyn, 2006), p. 7. 69 Ibid., p. 57. 70 Through Renaissance neo-Platonism with its hermetic core, the medieval art of memory</page><page sequence="15">80 GARDEN HISTORY 38:1 was transformed into an occult art; Yates, Art of Memory, p. 134. 71 Ibid., p. 174. 72 Ibid., pp. 159-60. 73 Tycho Brahe, 'By and by I got accustomed to distinguishing all the constellations of the sky'; quoted in Thoren, Lord of Uraniborg, p. 16. 74 The influence of celestial bodies on plants in particular was an occurrence that had its roots in ancient times; Pliny the Elder, Natural History, trans./Introduction and Notes by John F. Healy (London: Penguin, 1991), bk XVIII. Also, William Ellis-Rees, 'Gardening in the Age of Humanism: Petrarch's Journal', Garden History, 23/1 (1995), p. 18. 75 Since completing the research for this paper, the work of H?kan H?kansson (ed.), Att lata sj?len flyga mellan himlens tinnar. Tycbo Brake och Ren?ssansen (Stockholm, 2006) has been brought to my attention. I understand that it also looks at Hermetic elements within the Uraniborg design. I therefore look forward to an English translation.</page></plain_text>
