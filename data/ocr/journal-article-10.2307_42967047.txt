Perspicuous Opacity: Marianne Moore and Truth in a Fallen World Ben Reizenstein Marianne Moore commented on the initial difficulty she found in making sense out of some of Gertrude Stein's prose in a review for The Dial, and confessed: 'Looking harder, one is abashed not to have under- stood instantly; as water may not seem transparent to the observer but has a perspicuous opacity in which the fish swims with ease.'1 As with much of Moore's criticism, the suspicion that she is at least in part discussing similar aspects of her own work cannot be avoided; in early versions of ťWhen I Buy Pictures',2 Moore described her response to art she admired with the expression 4 1 take it in hand as a savage would take a looking glass' (1. 18).3 Though the frame may be new, and the image unfamiliar, what she sees within the glass turns out to be a reflection of her own face. And, like Stein's, Moore's work can frustrate readers with its difficulty - the sense can feel inaccessible, lying behind abstract language and relations. 'Perspicuous opacity' could well be taken to characterise 1 'Perspicuous Opacity', in The Complete Prose of Marianne Moore , ed. P C. Willis (London 1987) p. 340. 2 R. G.

Yet it does convey sense, and in mana- ging to do so that sense is illustrated: words can convey more than merely the sum total of their literal definitions. 'When I Buy Pictures' makes the demand that art be 'lit with "piercing glances into the life of things" '(1. 1 7), that it provide a way for the observer to glimpse not only through the potential opacity of language, but also through the external form of 'things' in the world, to reveal their hidden 'life'. Equipped with the notion of the 'life of things', and with the idea that 'piercing glances', rather than merely absorbing light, might actually illu- minate the 'perspicuous opacity' of Moore's poetry, I turn to the first two sentences of the much-anthologised poem 'The Fish', as it appeared in Moore's Observations (pp. 85-6; Schulze, pp. 41-120): THE FISH Wade through black jade Of the crow-blue mussel shells, one keeps adjusting the ash heaps; opening and shutting itself like an injured fan. (11. 1-8)5 This water is opaque, 'black jade'; seemingly solid crystal, like the tra- ditionally green and translucent mineral, yet at the darkest end of its potential spectrum of hues from almost white to almost black, and thus hindering both movement and light. Moore only describes, and allows her readers to see, those things illuminated by 'the submerged shafts of the II sun', thus providing those 'penetrating glances' which both rely on and supply the light required to see the objects. After the second line, the 4 Opacity: 'The quality or condition of not transmitting light; lack of transparency or translucency; inability to be seen through' (OED, def. 3a). Perspicuous: 'Transparent; translucent' (OED. def. 4). 5 I have not inserted the missing full stop, and will present each poem, as far as possible, exactly as the cited versions are printed.</page><page sequence="3">PERSPICUOUS OPACITY 319 fish disappear - the 'spotlight' of the sun's split rays settles on them briefly, so that the clear focus on them implied by the fact that they occupy the title is revealed to be temporary Moore only permits the fleet- ing vision of them vanishing. Yet even in this brief appearance they intro- duce uncertainty and taxonomical difficulty, for fish cannot 'wade'; wading, except in an early and obsolete form of the word, requires legs.6 The inappropriateness of the word demands a metaphorical reading, an understanding that passage through the water is difficult and slow. The line-break after 'Wade' forms an essential part of the formal revisions Moore made to the poem after its initial publication, and by introducing a visual interruption at this point the revised lineation further suggests the impeded progress of the fish. Subsequent metaphors within this passage continue the taxonomical confusion, in which language by convention or literal definition associated with one category of objects is applied to a member of an entirely separate category: 'Wade' is bound to a conceptual category or set which might be 'legged creatures', of which fish are not members. The description of 'crow-blue mussel shells', in which Moore has specifically chosen a colour that admits a bird momentarily into the undersea domain, simultaneously insists on 'crow-blue' being able to exist apart from its winged referent, for the mussels are not said to resemble crows, except in their colour. Moore uses such cross-categorial terms to be accurate, though; we all know that crows are black, but in the right light, the sheen on their feathers seems a shimmering blue, and it is this colour, the blue-sheen-on-black of the crow which could hardly be explained more precisely, with which Moore paints the mussels (see Figure 1). The lone active mussel is given intent: it 'keeps | adjusting the ash heaps'; but can a mussel, or a 'mussel shell', be said to adjust anything? The word 'adjusting' can be used by an observer to describe the effect of the mussel's movements, but cannot be the mussel's purpose in so moving. The existence of a consciousness behind the description becomes apparent. Moore is aware that in describing things she changes their nature, or at least influences and is prepared to distort the reader's percep- tion of those things; she is not mimicking the voice of truth here. If the 'ash heaps' are a metaphor for the silt at the bottom of the sea, which might be seen swirling like fine dust in the water passing through and around the mussel, even so the suspicion that they are not metaphori- cal remains, and informs an impression of a crippled, post-disaster land- scape in which only one shell remains capable of limited and repetitive 6 Wade (v.): 'Of inanimate things, esp. of a weapon: To go through, to penetrate into something. Obs.' (OED, def. lb).</page><page sequence="4">320 THE CAMBRIDGE QUARTERLY Fig. 1. Crow-blue Crow. Photograph courtesy of Jenny Bailey motion. The status of this impression is therefore uncertain given the pos- ition of the speaker - how much is metaphorical, a product of the imagination of the poet, and how much an 'actual' description, to be taken as describing 'how things are' in the little scene? The continuing post-disaster feeling culminates in the last metaphor of the sentence, 'opening and shutting itself like || an | injured fan.' Once again, a non- sentient object seems to be granted some human property, for though a fan can be broken (that is, can be no longer fit for the primary purpose for which it was designed), it cannot be wronged, cannot care about how impaired it has become. The cross-categorial language implies a perspec- tive from which it could be spoken or at least conceived, for the same voice that can describe a fan as capable of being 'injured' can describe a mussel (hard, aquatic bivalve mollusc) in terms of a fan (fragile, geo- metric, fabric, face-cooling tool). The process of deciphering these meta- phors involves adopting a point of view that can resolve Moore's specific language, can set up new categories and ignore old ones, a viewpoint in this case capable of understanding or projecting 'the life of things'. Where light is not limited, and Moore's eyes can linger on objects, her poems more frequently offer either a variety of such not easily resolvable, incongruous couplings around one subject or a working out of the reson- ances of one particular metaphor. They can provide points of dense and vibrant compound, moments of close associative study, as in the following cluster from 'Critics and Connoisseurs': I remember a swan under the willows in Oxford, with flamingo-colored, maple-</page><page sequence="5">PERSPICUOUS OPACITY 321 leaflike feet. (11. 9-11; Observations , pp. 35 -6) As the sentence continues, the language openly spirals away from the scene it describes, becoming more lavish and exotic, so that the swan is replaced by the flamingo, and the willows by the maple. Yet swans' feet do have three toes spread out like the veins within the tripartite leaves of several common maple species, and certain swans have webbed feet the pink-orange colour of a flamingo (see Figure 2). I pursue this for two reasons - to locate the perspective from which the metaphors can be understood, and to attempt to distinguish how far the similitudes complete the description of the swan and how far they shape it in their image. Mute swans, those found most commonly in Britain, have dark legs - has Moore's imagination distorted the accuracy of her description? In earlier versions of 'Critics and Connoisseurs' this passage reads: I remember a black swan on the Cherwell in Oxford With flamingo colored maple- Leaflike feet. (11. 9-11; Schulze, p. 215) Black swans' feet can certainly be colourful; the attribution 'flamingo colored' need not constitute evidence that accuracy of description is being sacrificed for the sake of exoticism (see Figure 3). In both versions, this anecdote is presented in support of the poem's opening position that 'There is a great amount of poetry in unconscious | fastidiousness' (11. 1 -2); it provides the focus for an attempt to derive ethical principles from obser- vation, to sermonise from life like a preacher or a writer of fables. What is there in being able to say that one has dominated the stream in an attitude of self-defense. . .? (11. 28-31; Observations , p. 36) Moore asks at the end of the poem, making the swan's 'attitude' (as revealed in its behaviour towards the food it was slow to take from her) ultimately into a potential exemplar of human behaviour. The consciousnesses of other species, even of other members of our own, are an inaccessible domain and consequently an imaginative playground - Moore can only have invented what she may seem to find</page><page sequence="6">322 THE CAMBRIDGE QUARTERLY Fig 2. Maple leaf. Photograph courtesy of Hanif Bayat Movahed Fig. 3. Black swan. Photograph courtesy of April Martinez inside the swan.7 But her anthropomorphising is an openly subjective behaviourist interpretation; not only does 'Critics and Connoisseurs' seem to prove the opposite of what it states (in that it makes 'a great amount of poetry' out of the 'conscious [rather than unconscious] fastidiousness' of the swan and of an ant) but, by drawing attention to the subjectivity even of accurate physical description, it raises doubts as to the truth of the morals thence extrapolated by the same imagination. 7 This sentence involves an expression by G. Rotella: 'fearful that we only invent what we seem to find': Reading and Writing Nature : The Pbetņ of Robert Frosty Wallace Stevens ' Marianne Moore , and Elizabeth Bishop (Boston 1991) p. 145.</page><page sequence="7">PERSPICUOUS OPACITY 323 This is not to say that Moore's descriptions are inaccurate - as I have tried to indicate and will continue to explore, they point to very specific correspondences and demand no deeper commonality - but that they can nonetheless allow the multiple associations of a single imagination to bleed into the scene they seem to describe. This is particularly true of the revised version of this section of 'Critics and Connoisseurs', with its textual transformation of the swan and the willow into the flamingo and the maple. For although the swan in Oxford is the subject of the sentence, and the metaphors are used to describe its feet, it becomes a collage both in terms of its appearance, were the description to be envisaged, and also on the page, in terms of the proportion of words which refer to disparate objects in an ostensible description of the swan. In visual art the former effect is called 'homospatiality': two images occupy the same space in the visual field, not producing perceptual rivalry, as with the duck/ rabbit optical illusion in which only one image is resolvable at a time, but rather allowing both images to exist simultaneously. Homospatiality of this kind produces Peter, a Frankenstein's monster of a cat, napping, in the poem of his name: he sleeps his time away - the detached first claw on his foreleg which corresponds to the thumb, retracted to its tip; the small tuft of fronds or katydid legs above each eye, still numbering the units in each group the shadbones regularly set about his mouth, to droop or rise in unison like the porcupine's quills - motionless. (11. 2-6; Observations , pp. 93-4) The interference of the metaphors in this description of the cat increases as the sentence continues, starting from a non-associative mode. The syntax of the three co-ordinated adverbial phrases following the dash is largely the same: noun-phrase, adjective-phrase; the former presenting a part of Peter's body, the latter describing its current prone state. However, in describing the claw, the comparison with a thumb is clearly signposted as a correspondence; in describing the vibrissae above Peter's eyes, the connective 'or' signals a shift into metaphor under the guise of a rephras- ing; and finally, when describing the cat's whiskers, the metaphor entirely eclipses the literal referent: though it is clear that whiskers are there, they are never mentioned by name. This metaphor is then further</page><page sequence="8">324 THE CAMBRIDGE QUARTERLY modified by another, 'porcupine's quills', with little immediate relevance either to a cat's whiskers or to 'shadbones', so that by the end of the sentence the literal referent is submerged beneath two distinct layers of metaphor. Peter's disdain for 'unprofitable - human' existence (11. 22 -3) and Moore's position of admiration for his difference (and indifference) to humankind are produced later in the poem, in part by suggestions of his thoughts and mental attitudes. This projection of 'attitude', as in 'Critics and Connoisseurs', is based on an interpretation of the animal's outward behaviour, and the imagining of a cat's internal voice is facilitated early on by the fact that he, unusually for Moore's animals, is named, and by the notion that his 'detached first claw . . . corresponds | to the thumb'. This correspondence is a biological one, to do with mammalian evol- utionary development, but it is firmly located within a human-centric per- spective, and has an anthropomorphic effect: it would not be too incomprehensible to allow him a consciousness. Katydids, in the next metaphorical superimposition, are not mammals but green grasshoppers, whose legs have little in common with the vibrissae, or feelers, of a cat in terms of substance, context, function, or traditional associations. The image of a cat with grasshopper's legs protruding from above its eyes is absurd; but just as the phonemes that make up 'cat' appear within 'katydid', though in a different spelling, from a different etymology and with a different significance, so Peter's feelers and the legs of a grasshopper can be found to share aspects: they are similarly delicate, thin and curved, sprouting outwards horizontally from the body with a flick at the tip. The cat's whiskers are then called 'shadbones' (a shad being a large bony fish), an association which once again makes sense (in that fish bones are long, slightly translucent, thin and delicate, and grow in almost parallel formation), and yet at the same time, as a result of the homospati- ality involved in metaphor, presents for inspection a cat with shadbones all around his mouth. This might be seen as a playful metaphor allowing imagination (Peter is asleep and perhaps dreaming throughout the poem) to envisage the cat as having recendy digested a large fish. Yet this par- ticular playfulness is only brief, for in the next stanza these shadbones/ whiskers are compared to 'porcupine quills'. Again, in the way that Moore specifies - the fact that Peter's whiskers move in unison - the comparison being drawn is accurate, but it is an accuracy based on a single point of contiguity between the two objects being compared. Any attempt to extend this metaphor will be a struggle, because, once again, the conventional connotations, function, material, and context of a porcu- pine's quills locate them in an entirely different conceptual category to the whiskers of a cat. The proliferation of metaphors in 'Peter' points to the</page><page sequence="9">PERSPICUOUS OPACITY 325 inadequacy of any one of them wholly to encompass the cat's individual being - Moore's attempts at accurate description make use of as large a vocabulary of forms as possible, regardless of their connotative relevancy, though in doing so the process of 'description' becomes the creation of a collage of dismembered (or 4 remember [ed]') parts. The clusters I have looked at are characteristic of Moore's metaphors early in her career; they tend to reveal what Hugh Kenner has called 'optical puns' - 'a triumphant hidden congrui ty, usually based on some acute visual resemblance'.8 And the visual or visible is central to the method of many of Moore's poems - as we have seen, 'The Fish' extends the limited visibility of the scene being described into limitations on how much of it is described and how much and how clearly the metaphors employed further illuminate the scene. The medium of communication becomes the 'black jade' medium of light transmission which is described. In 'Critics and Connoisseurs' and 'Peter' the visible behaviour of the animals becomes the outward expression of an internal 'attitude'. This should give some sense of the force of the former poem's persistent refrain: 'I have seen'. Resolving Moore's cross-categorial metaphors often requires 'seeing' what Moore is showing; if we have not seen a katydid up close or the Thomas of Leighton Buzzard wrought-iron vine, we are either stuck within our categories guessing at significance, or we rely on her account, which proves to emphasise points of visual contiguity. Here a division becomes apparent: on one hand, the visual metaphors provide comparisons on a universal experiential basis - if something looks enough like something else, anyone who has seen or can envisage those things can comprehend the comparison; on the other hand, the visible, external form of something can only be deciphered subjectively, can only 'mean' according to the mind that makes it 'mean'. The subjectivity of the choice of things found to be objectively visually similar casts a corre- sponding doubt on the potential for an objective interpretation of visible form, though the desire to make both ways of seeing equally truthful is explored and examined in many of Moore's poems. One such poem is 'Black Earth' (later 'Melanchthon'; Observations , in Schulze, pp. 237-8), Moore's only published dramatic monologue, in which she casts as her speaker an elephant confusedly trying to determine the nature of the relationship between form and essence: The sediment of the river which Encrusts my joints, makes me very gray but I am used 8 H. Kenner, 'The Experience of the Eye', quoted in H. Bloom (ed.), Modern Critical Views: Marianne Moore (New York 1987) pp. 19, 20.</page><page sequence="10">326 THE CAMBRIDGE QUARTERLY To it, it may Remain there; do away With it and I am myself done away with, for the Patina of circumstance can but enrich what was There to begin With. This elephant skin Which I inhabit, fibred over like the shell of The coco-nut, this piece of black glass through which no light Can filter - cut Into checkers by rut Upon rut of unpreventable experience - It is a manual for the peanut-tongued and the Hairy toed. (11. 11-25) Part of the difficulty of reading 'Black Earth' is that it is not unitary or coherent; even the two sentences quoted above seem to conflict with one another. In the first, the elephant, or the poet within the elephant skin, suggests that it (or she) is identified with the sediment of contingency, the visible effects of being in the world. Ignoring this 'Patina of circumstance' in an attempt to get to the animal within will be counter-productive, a failure to acknowledge the forces which have shaped it. Yet in the same sentence the animal says that these forces 'can but enrich what was || There to begin | With.' The existence of an already present entity, prior to any 'enrichment', reveals that the elephant, contrary to its claims, is distinct from the 'Patina of circumstance' after all; and the subsequent sentence finds the elephant, or the poet, an 'I' within an impenetrable 'black glass' shell, now totally distinct from the scarred hide containing it. If the 'I' within is entirely inaccessible, any attempted interpretation of its form will find the skin 'a manual for the peanut-tongued and the || Hairy toed.' At least two interpretations of these last two lines suggest them- selves, revolving around different senses of 'for': the skin could provide a reference work on the merely external attributes of an elephant - its diet and physical characteristics - in which case 'for' takes on a sense as in 'the manual for the television'; or it could provide a reference work for an interpreter, a human being who, in her or his neglectful reading, becomes 'peanut-tongued and . . . Hairy toed', as confused as the elephant she or he is trying to decipher - in which case read 'for' as in 'a manual for</page><page sequence="11">PERSPICUOUS OPACITY 327 budding fishermen'. Either way, though the elephant's form is an expression of its essence, this passage of significance from inside to outside cannot be traced backwards; the form can only provide meaning if the interpreter has already somehow gained access behind the 'black glass'. Later in the poem, the elephant judges human beings by their thin skin, seemingly ignoring the difficulties it has identified in the practice of judging by external appearance: I see And I hear, unlike the Wandlike body of which one hears so much, which was made To see and not to see; to hear and not to hear, That tree trunk without Roots, accustomed to shout Its thoughts to itself like a shell, maintained intact By who knows what strange pressure of the atmosphere; (11. 41-8) Human beings, who must be held together by a mysterious force since not contained within a thick skin, are as ephemeral to the elephant as their physical form implies. Language from former descriptions of the ele- phant fails to make it aware of its double standards: its trunk is seen again when it calls man a rootless 'tree trunk'; its skin, seen earlier as 'the shell of I The coco-nut,' echoes into the description of fruidess human over- expression which summons the image of 'a shell', perhaps a shell within which we might hear the waves crashing in our corpuscles. Indeed, to the elephant, although it shows some evidence of thought, man remains a 'Wandlike body', a weak physical entity first and foremost, and surely incapable of comprehending the world. The form of Moore's poem fluctuates here as well, with the line 'To see and not to see; to hear and not to hear,' missing a syllable from the thir- teen which would follow the regular stanzaic pattern. This twelve-syllable line becomes audibly accentual-syllabic, in contrast to the non-metrical lines Moore habitually uses, since it is split into isometric iambic halves with a clear caesura between them. The difference is audible, though the missing syllable only becomes apparent after examining its visible trace: we hear the metre but cannot hear the altered lineation. Also rendered audible are the letters 'tr' rooting certain words together: 'tha¿ tree tn ink without mots'; echoes of the sound within human 'thoughts', spilling through 'without' ' roots' 'sh ouť 'thoughts' and ' shouť 'sAelT; and the strange</page><page sequence="12">328 THE CAMBRIDGE QUARTERLY pressure of the rhythm leading to at least two consecutive stressed followed by three consecutive unstressed syllables: / - / / /.../.- Who knows what strange pressure of the atmosphere or / . //.../- Who knows what strange pressure of the atmosphere Either way, it is the moment of low pressure after high which strikes the ear. These formal qualities of the poem only take on such significances because of the content; their meanings are expressions or emanations from within. Correspondingly, when its meaning is inaccessible, language is reduced to an unsignifying hollowness, as Moore demonstrates when confusion descends in answer to the question 'the elephant is?' (1.55). It is to that Phenomenon The above formation, Translucent like the atmosphere - a cortex merely - That on which darts cannot strike decisively the first Time, a substance Needful as an instance Of the indestructibility of matter; (11. 56-63) The significance of the elephant to man - 'that || Phenomenon | The above formation' - is not clarified by the syntax of the sentence, which provides four adjectival phrases in apposition. The confusion may be seen in the different versions offered by Linda Leavell and John Slatin: Being defenseless themselves, 'Translucent like the atmosphere - a cortex merely,' humans have no understanding of thickness or depth, the elephant seeming to their ignorance merely 'That upon which darts cannot strike decisively the first / Time.'9 9 L. Leavell, Marianne Moore and the Visual Arts: Prismatic Color (Baton Rouge 1 995) pp. 156-7.</page><page sequence="13">PERSPICUOUS OPACITY 329 to [a human] the elephant is only a husk, 'a cortex merely,' as at first 'the wandlike body' is to the elephant merely a 'tree trunk without | Roots...'10 Are we 'a cortex merely' to the elephant or is the elephant 'a cortex merely' to us? The dashes around 'a cortex merely' could signify where the emphasis of the sentence (the complement of 'It is. . .') falls, or indicate a further suspension of emphasis - the syntax cannot guide the rhythm to find a unified sense. Finally, nor can the word cortex , which means both the outer grey matter of the brain (the seat of language and consciousness), and outer layers more generally, such as those of a tree trunk or an elephant. Just as the elephant's form can be interpreted only once its essence is known, these lines can only have a unitary significance once the sense has been decided upon - Slatin and Leavell can only see what the words say once they know what the lines mean. If only there were some obvious, universal, and incontrovertible bond between a form and its meaning, the distinction between the two would cease to exist; we would see immediately through the word 'cortex' to its sole possible intended sense. Nor would we struggle via metaphor to cir- cumvent the insufficiency of language when describing the nature of things in the world - their names would express their essences, and meta- phor would be impossible. As it is, the significance of a word or form is personal, and as the elephant says, we hear only our own meanings in other people's words. Perhaps the only true objectivity in language would be in a linguistic community of one, without any attempt to communicate outside the self - no encoding, no decoding. Alone in the Garden of Eden, without an interpreter with whom to attempt communication, Adam, creator of his own system of signification, provides Moore with the archetype and sole instance of someone who cannot be misinterpreted. As we shall see, for Moore the fall of language occurs not with the Fall of Man (though the two are bound up with one another), but with the crea- tion of Eve, the birth of interpretation. The following passage is from 'An Octopus', one of Moore's long, free-verse poems of 1924: The Greeks liked smoothness, distrusting what was back of what could not be clearly seen, resolving with benevolent conclusiveness, 'complexities which still will be complexities as long as the world lasts'; ascribing what we clumsily call happiness, to 'an accident or a quality, 10 J. M. Slatin, The Savage's Romance (University Park 1986) p. 84.</page><page sequence="14">330 THE CAMBRIDGE QUARTERLY a spiritual substance or the soul itself, an act or a disposition or a habit or a habit infused to which the soul has been persuaded, or something distinct from a habit, a power' - such power as Adam had and we are still devoid of. (11. 177-88; Schulze, pp. 312-18) The Greeks, according to Moore's characterisation, were unaccustomed to 'the beautiful element of unreason' which 'Melanchthon' finds within his thick hide and fails to see within mankind's thin skin. Their desire for 'Neatness of finish' (1. 209) drives them to the paradoxical neatness of attributing eternal irresolvability to complexities: at once an acknowledge- ment of fathomless depth and a reason not to attempt to fathom it. This depth of unreason leads to the imprecision of the cascade of competing definitions for 'what we clumsily call happiness'. I have quoted this section as it appears in the first published version in The Dial in 1924; later versions add commas after many of the options in the list. The effect is thereby changed: the lines become halting, each option almost able to conclude the syndeton, yet unable to exhaust the potential sources of hap- piness. In this early version the effect is cumulative, with the first four options grouped orderly in pairs, followed by the unpunctuated triplet 'an act or a disposition or a habit'. This interrupts the orderliness and con- tinues over the line-break in its inconclusiveness before ditching the whole idea of happiness as a 'habit', and introducing with the indefinite article 'a power' in its place. Moore breaks off her quotation as if in tiredness at the indecision, and concludes the sentence by making the uncertain 'power' refer both to the lost happiness of prelapsarian existence and to Adam's power over language. In the Adamic language, signifier and signi- fied are not bound by an arbitrary force of conventional signification, nor is meaning subjective and deferred; instead, the language is universal, strictly correlative and clear. There could be no wrangling over what 'hap- piness' denoted. 'An Octopus' is founded on a description of Mount Rainier in Washington, which Moore visited in July 1922, and the ascent to its hostile peak begins from a meadow called 'Paradise'. The poem is in part an exposition of the abundant flora and fauna of the Edenic scenery, in part the journey from Paradise, rather than within it. In the version which appears in Observations (Schulze, pp. 125-32), and in most subsequent publications, it opens like this:</page><page sequence="15">PERSPICUOUS OPACITY 331 AN OCTOPUS Of ice. Some of Moore's animal poems contain the animals in question - 'The Pangolin' is not a metaphorical title, nor 'The Fish' nor 'The Jerboa' - and although they may then be used as metaphors, they stand as creatures in their own right; nothing in the tide of 'An Octopus' suggests that this particular animal will turn out to be the vehicle of a metaphor. The illu- sion of literal meaning, according to which 'An Octopus' refers to the aquatic predator, only survives as long as the title of the poem. The first line reveals the deception, completing the noun phrase begun in the title and commencing the poem's interrogation of the inadequacies of language. The language both falls from literal to metaphorical meaning during the process of reading the opening and is revealed to have been metaphorical originally as the words lay on the page. As I suggested above, metaphor is an inherently post-Adamic, 'fallen' mechanism, relying on words not referring to what they appear to denote; Moore's language is fallen from the start. The first published version (Schulze, pp. 312-18) begins with a further complication, due to the house style of the periodical: AN OCTOPUS BY MARIANNE MOORE of ice. Moore's frequent use of the title as part of the first sentence of her poems ordinarily makes this kind of layout inappropriate, but The Dial's layout reveals a conservative attitude towards the title's role within a poem. In this case, her authorship becomes a fact within the poem: 'Marianne Moore' has made this octopus out of ice, sculpted the metaphor and claimed no objectivity in so doing. But when the shift into metaphor comes, her name is enveloped by it as if to question the entire process of denotation. This quirk of layout is highly apt: it takes nearly two hundred lines for Moore to specify the mountain as 'Mount Tacoma', one of its Indian names, as if attempting to regain the former language and its orig- inal power to name. 'Rainier', the name deriving from that of British Rear Admiral Peter Rainier, does not appear anywhere in the poem. The style of 'An Octopus' is indirect in its approach to the mountain, consider- ing it obliquely through figures and through other people's words; Moore</page><page sequence="16">332 THE CAMBRIDGE QUARTERLY cannot name Mount Rainier because neither her poem nor the language used within it have a close enough bond with the world. She lacks 'such power as Adam had', and so must carefully employ the faulty tools at her disposal. The cross-categorial associative method examined earlier remains an attempt to achieve accuracy of description, but this accuracy is infused throughout 'An Octopus' with an awareness that this mediated approach to description is necessitated by the imprecision of language and the taxo- nomies embedded within it. Literal meaning is insufficient to communi- cate what Moore has seen and desires to show. Thus metaphors begin to multiply early in the poem, elaborating and complicating the initial com- parison with an octopus: "Picking periwinkles from the cracks" or killing prey with the concentric crushing rigor of the python, it hovers forward "spider fashion on its arms" misleading like lace; (11. 8-11) This moment is made of two varieties of linguistic mediacy: the meta- phors of python, spider, and lace; and the two quotations, which Moore's notes at the end of Observations reveal to be culled from articles in London's two, internationally circulated, illustrated newspapers. The first of these quotations puns on 'periwinkles', which names simultaneously a molluscoid food-source for several species of octopus, and a blue flowering plant ( Vinca minor) to be found on Mount Rainier.11 Moore quotes the brief expression because it is appropriate to both the tenor and vehicle of the metaphor, but had she written it herself the two meanings of 'periwin- kles' would still coexist; by openly using another writer's words, Moore introduces the sense that the language of the quotation is being made to conform to a new meaning. The same is true of the second quotation, which is doubly mediated, being an appropriated metaphor, originally describing the movement of an octopus in the science column of the Illustrated London News}2 Nothing in the poem or its notes indicates the original context of the excised phrases; Moore only testifies to their having 1 1 See M.

This kind of (sometimes punning) usurpation helps to make the poem like the glacier, capable of assimilating foreign objects and apparent debris, but the quotation marks which frame the borrowed phrases draw attention to the gulf between the mountain and the words used to discuss it. In the Observations version of 'An Octopus', after the comparisons with the three predatory animals, the glacier is deemed 'misleading like lace'. Earlier drafts and later published versions of the text read 'misleadingly like lace' in this line, giving four, rather than three, Is which, along with the ss, help the line slide sibilantly and labially along to formally embody the con- fusion described.13 Though this unique instance seems likely to be another accidental revision - since Observations was printed under severe time pressure from The Dial (Schulze, pp. 34-5) - it is fitting that, missing two letters, this line instigates a search for further likeness which its other ver- sions deny outright. White lace might look something like spreading, inter- connected ice-flows, but Moore finds the glacier closer to the predators than to the material. Things which objectively look alike need not bear similarities any deeper than their surfaces. Yet we rely on the surfaces, slight and accidental variations of which can produce contrary readings, to interpret Mount Rainier or Moore's poem, for unlike Adam we have no clear way through what Walter Benjamin calls, 'the abyss of the mediate- ness of all communication, of the word as means, of the empty word'.14 Moore's most direct poetic treatment of the fall of language contrasts such difficulties of interpretation with the clarity of Adam's language, recalling his solitude in an opening sentence whose main clause cannot commence without considerable premodification: IN THE DAYS OF PRISMATIC COLOR not in the days of Adam and Eve but when Adam was alone; when there was no smoke and color was fine, not with the refinement of early civilization art, but because of its originality; with nothing to modify it but the mist that went up, obliqueness was a variation of the perpendicular, plain to see and to account for: (11. 1-8; Complete Poems , pp. 41-2) 13 'A Late Manuscript', p. 267; An Octopus', Complete Poems , pp. 71-6. 14 W Benjamin, 'On Language as Such and on the Language of Man', in Reflections , ed.

Jephcott (New York 1978) p. 328.</page><page sequence="18">334 THE CAMBRIDGE QUARTERLY The poem ostensibly begins by discussing how light was refracted during the brief moment in the second chapter of Genesis when Adam is without Eve, when 'there went up a mist from the earth, and watered the whole face of the ground' (Gen. 2: 6); nothing blurred the distinction between colours but this 'mist that went up'. But the biblical passage referred to is the very source of the Adamic language: Adam names all the animals in Eden, and 'whatso- ever Adam called every living creature, that was the name thereof' (Gen. 2: 19). Certain individual words in the poem are presented so as to highlight the imprecision of fallen language. Thus 'refinement' encloses 'fine', which has already been employed to mean 'distinct', 'precisely delineated', or 'fault- less'; although 'refinement' seems to mean a return to this 'fine'ness, it carries the contradictory meaning of being developed, of having been worked upon: even early civilisation art had to try to recapture a purity already lost.15 The make-up of 'originality' is also stressed: the context of Genesis suggests its sense of origins rather than of novelty. This desire (as in Moore's use of the Indian name for Mount Rainier) to find stable, unitary signification in the first definition of something pro- vides the impulse to the first sentence, for the syntactic centrality of its delayed subject, 'obliqueness', emphasises the uncertainty concerning what the word means. There are two very distinct definitions for 'oblique- ness', and Moore imagines a time when it had only one - that of a line formed by an angle other than 90 degrees to another line - 'a variation | of the perpendicular'. The alternative sense, of indirectness in addressing a point, would be inconceivable to the solitary Adam, with his universal language. That this sense is not provided, but merely obliquely hinted at, demonstrates further that we are not in Eden, and the poem continues with an abrupt confirmation of the Fall: it is no longer that; nor did the blue-red-yellow band of incandescence that was color keep its stripe: it also is one of those things into which much that is peculiar can be read; complexity is not a crime, but carry it to the point of murkiness and nothing is plain. (11. 8-14) Moore has only indirectly referred to the Adamic language; it is in this section that the poem reveals that the discussion of colour and light has 15 Re: ''prefix "Again", "anew", originally in cases implying restoration to a previous state or condition' (OED, def. c).</page><page sequence="19">PERSPICUOUS OPACITY 335 masked a discussion of language. With the mention of 'things into which much . . . can be | read', expression and light are woven together. Consequently, lack of accuracy in expression is understood as 'murkiness' or 'darkness', and takes us from Eden, in which things were 'plain to see', to a world in which 'nothing is plain'. I have already examined some of Moore's metaphors in which compre- hension rests upon visualisation; in these, she actualises this metaphor by which communication is conceived in terms of visual clarity. In expressions like 'I see what you mean', 'it all becomes clear', 'your prose is lucid', or 'her poems are opaque', it is evident that the merging of visual and seman- tic vocabularies is latent in English. It has been identified as one of the 'metaphors we live by', a conceptual superimposition so deeply rooted that it hardly seems metaphorical at all.16 But it is a metaphor; interpretation is not ordinarily like seeing; there are innumerable gradations of meaning just as there are of colour; 'we are still devoid of' the power to consistently realise the metaphor whereby seeing is interpretation. That Moore frequently attempts to synthesise the two processes shows her belief that clarity is still possible, and desirable, even in complexity. She was frequently accused of the deliberate obscurantism of which this poem complains, but unlike the 'murkiness' in which 'nothing is plain', Moore's legitimate complexity is, as James Fenton writes, 'plain murky'.17 The contradictions and uncertainties of her poetry are not ostentation, they constitute its 'perspicuous opacity', they carry its meaning. Those poets who enigmatise because they think it grown-up, or deny any possi- bility of interpretation, stubbornly exacerbate the effects of the fall of language: Complexity, moreover, that has been committed to darkness, instead of granting itself to be the pestilence that it is, moves all a- bout as if to bewilder us with the dismal fallacy that insistence is the measure of achievement and that all truth must be dark. Principally throat, sophistication is as it al- ways has been - at the antipodes from the init- ial great truths. (11. 14-22) 16 G. LakofT and M.

Fenton, The Strength of Poetry (Oxford 2001), p. 17.</page><page sequence="20">336 THE CAMBRIDGE QUARTERLY 'Complexity is not a crime' but a 'pestilence'; these lines are clear enough, playing with the line-break interruption of 'a- | bout' to exhibit the kind of needless effort expended to avoid simplicity in expression. But then the easily comprehensible style begins to take on the character of which it complains. Why 'throat', why 'antipodes'? The throat is the source of the voice, but not of meaning or sincerity; on its own it provides form but not content, gargling phonemes but not sense. 'Principally' is a Latinate word with connotations of princeliness and empire, and Moore's word choice brings down these sophisticated pretensions with bodily bathos in the Old English of 'throat'. As a partial phonetic inversion of ' truth ', ' throat' embodies the formal game-playing which results in inten- tional separation from content. It is a complicated word, but its compli- cations are expressive rather than fruidessly perplexing. As for 'antipodes', more of the poem will help to explain: "Part of it was crawling, part of it was about to crawl, the rest was torpid in its lair." In the short-legged, fit- ful advance, the gurgling and all the minutiae - we have the classic multitude of feet. To what purpose! 'In the Days of Prismatic Color' abounds with the pronoun 'it', but only during this quotation is the target of the pronoun unstable; Moore seems to have carried Ht to the point of murkiness'. If these its refer to the last singular noun, the quotation describes sophistication as a long, crawl- ing creature, as the serpent was, many-legged in Eden before its punish- ment (a serpent is mostly throat, after all). But the past tense of the sentence (in contrast to the present of those around it), the quotation marks, and those deictics together direct us outside the text to seek signifi- cance. Perhaps this is a reference to a famous work of literature which we are, embarrassingly, not erudite enough to recognise. Fortunately, Moore provides the source of the sentence in her appendix: Loeb's Greek Anthology. Readers are directed to a fragment of a text by the scarcely known Nestor of Laranda, a Greek epic poet whose claim to immortality is having composed a version of the Iliad which omits a different vowel in each book. His work is mostly lost. This could be about the most obscure possible reference, the most perfect example of an obscurantist poetics. The fragment Moore quotes refers to a mythical dragon which drank the river Cephisus dry in its thirst - there is not much of it apart from the</page><page sequence="21">PERSPICUOUS OPACITY 337 sentence Moore extracts.18 Not only does the quotation describe an animal with a 'multitude of feet', it is translated from a text written in 'the classic I multitude of feet' - the metre of Greek verse. Hence 'anti podes". The quoted lines act as example and description; the quotation reaches a head into Moore's poem, a little of its body is outside the work, in Loeb's Greek Anthology, ; and the rest lies torpid in the dark oblivion of lost texts. In short, Moore's application of the obscurantist strategy is illustrative, her pestilential complexity communicates her meaning. The 'it' within 'init- | ial' is a rhyme for the eye only, but it embodies the 'fit- | ful advance' of the articulated creature split into parts 'of it' - form for its own sake is a serpent: Truth is no Apollo Belvedere, no formal thing. The wave may go over it if it likes. Know that it will be there when it says, 'I shall be there when the wave has gone by.' Dismissing empty forms such as the statue of Apollo Belvedere, stylised, smooth, and Greek, Moore abandons the visual and aural interference of her five-line, rhyming, syllabic stanzaic form (13x, 12a, 7x, 12a, 18x, with some fluctuation), and allows the last three lines to end with her phrasing. The wit involved in not providing a mimetic run-on to allow 'the wave' to 'go over' the line-break emphasises the words 'if it likes', and implicitly says, 'which it doesn't just at the moment'. The distractions of mimetic form are discarded in place of an unembellished, unsophisticated, and (barring 'over') monosyllabic mode. The final two lines invoke the logical definition of truth - (P' is true if and only if P - in the form CP} is true therefore P. Because it is the voice of truth, we can 'Know' that the content of its proposition, regardless of its expression, will be true. But for this to be useful we must know what Moore and 'Truth' mean by 'the wave'. Without any clue as to what might lie behind the metaphor beyond some transient submerging force, we have only uncertain shadowy notions of what Moore's 'Truth' is saying. Moore communicates all she can about truth in our fallen world: that it is true, and that it is there, somewhere beneath the seemingly opaque forms of language and of the world. Her imperative 'Know' implores, instructs, and comforts us with certain faith in truth, encoura- ging us, as all her poems do, to strain to see through this obscuring 'wave' to the substance of the world, never to doubt that 'there are things that are important beyond all this fiddle'.19 18 The Loeb editors note: 'We do not know what this story of the dragon was.'
