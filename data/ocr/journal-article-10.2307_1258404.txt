<plain_text><page sequence="1">The Tripod by ELMER G. SUHR THE tripod, as a support for a vessel, even a human being, is much more common than a four-legged device, which at once raises a question in the mind: has this support a sacred tradition in its background? Why did the number three become a universal standard in the number of its legs? The shape of the alabastron was apparently so highly respected the bottom of the vase was never levelled off to permit the owner to place it on a flat surface, and much the same kind of scruple may have preserved the number three for the legs of a tripod. This grows so much more emphatic when we realize that, without supporting anything in a vessel or cauldron it can assume an important role in ritual and mythology, that it can be set up as a trophy, as a prize for a victor, and no matter what its purpose it always commands respect. The three legs sometimes terminate in the form of an animal's paw or hoof, though it is frequently difficult to identify the creature in question. We also find it furnished with wings, a fact which presupposes some kind of motion attached to its significance in its present form or to a form or object from which it was derived. Since it is not the exclusive attribute of any particular divinity, it must have enjoyed, in earlier times, a distinctive significance of its own. It will be our purpose to investigate the meaning of its early prototype. We can be fairly certain that Hermes issued forth from the cosmic column which has survived in his caduceus, that Aphrodite developed from her whirling spindle; Eros was probably produced from the comet or meteor, Poseidon has definite affiliations with the trident and Athena carries along features of the solar eclipse dragon, but the tripod appears in the literature and artifacts of the classical period, devoid of any attachment, as an attribute, to a particular anthropomorphic divinity. Was it always a three-legged stand? Was it ever manifest, before or after this period, in another form, human or otherwise? One of its distinctive features is the number three which, to the Greek mind, was no doubt more z16</page><page sequence="2">THE TRIPOD geometric than arithmetic, which means that its significance lay not so much in three units as in three extensions of line. Another feature inherent in the word is the 'foot' which may mean that the extensions, whatever their relation to each other, ran along three legs to three feet. We might think of it as a parallel to the two wings which became stylized into the Minoan double axe, then returned to a naturalistic version on the caduceus, but what stage do we find in the three-legged support? The hoof or claw leads us to think of an animal in its heritage, but what creature, if it is not mythological, can be presented in a three-legged version? By definition, a tripod is a three-legged support, generally of metal, for a pot, a cauldron, a table, and even serving as a seat for a divinity or his representative. Frequently it had three rings attached, as handles, to the pot or cauldron. The tripod was generally fashioned of bronze, at times of copper, stone, wood, terracotta, and for special dedications, of silver or gold. At times the container above was set on the support, at times joined to it;' some containers were designed to hold fire, others stood over a fire kindled below. The tripod and container set up in or near a sanc- tuary, were of three different varieties: the mantic tripod, like the one upon which the Pythia of Delphi sat, the votive offering such as the Athenians dedicated from the spoils of Plataea and the prize awarded to winners in athletic or choregic contests. The most decorative examples are to be found among Etruscan and Roman artifacts. The antecedent for the Greek tripod can best be traced to Meso- potamia where an excellent example, now in the Louvre,2 shows that the support was already fully developed there and adapted to the same use as in later Greece. Fashioned of bronze, it reaches a height of 0.33 m. At approximately one-third of its height from the base three straight cross pieces run from one leg to the other to bolster the vertical supporting power of the legs. At the junctures of these three pieces and the more vertical legs, as well as on the ring at the top, are human and animal masks looking away from the tripod; at the base the three legs terminate in the hooves of a bull or cow. The sturdy support, otherwise devoid of decoration, was meant to hold a vase or cauldron at the top. The Minoans have bequeathed to us a large number of tripod 1 DarSag. fig. 7067-68. 2 Perrot et Chipiez II, p. 732, fig. 393. 217</page><page sequence="3">THE TRIPOD altars3 for sacred offerings; interesting it is to note that they painted some examples in red, black and white bands, a trio of colors first observed in the total solar eclipse, then applied to the horn of the unicorn and elsewhere. A triple band of similar colors was also painted on a low tripod supporting a broad container.4 Evans also mentions a black steatite example, formerly plated with gold.5 J. W. Graham6 illustrates two examples especially important to us because they point to Minoan antecedents for the classical Greek type. Somewhat similar examples may be seen in a painting at Pylos' where each of two men holds a tripod before his body. Schliemanns found an unusual tripod at Mycenae, whose base has three handles and an open mouth on one side, which means it was meant to be tipped to one side to pour out the liquid. A terra- cotta version with globular body and flattened handles and legs was unearthed at Troy.9 The mantic, golden tripod in Delphi was the most famous of its kind, either because of the oracle's fame or due to the contribution it apparently made to the ecstatic frenzy of the Pythia as she uttered her prophetic speech. There were, of course, several features near the Pythian seat which served as aids to the oracle's inspiration: the laurel leaves which, when chewed, exerted a strange effect on the subject, the waters of the Castalian Spring, and the vapor of the cavern, especially popular in Roman times; but the uncertainty surrounding the evidence for all three, particularly in the light of the excavations, leaves the tripod as the most reliable source of inspiration.'0 This was certainly true of the classical period. It is true that no information is at hand about the mental and psychological nature of the priestess who was generally 3 Sir Arthur Evans, The Palace of Minos at Knossos, II, London, 1928, p. 283' fig. 379a. 4 Ibid., II, p. 302, fig. 175.

Today we may think of it as a divine force of pneuma whose efficacy was seldom questioned. From vase paintings we learn something about the position of the Pythia in the sanctuary. On a red figured vase in Berlin" Themis, who either succeeded or was identical with Ge before the coming of Apollo, holds a sprig of laurel in the left hand, a flat vase in the other, as she looks down at the vase before giving her message to Aegeus standing before her. The column between the two tells us the figures were in the interior of a structure, no doubt the temple of Apollo. Another red figured vase in the Vatican'2 presents Apollo himself seated in the basin of a large tripod, holding his lyre in the left hand and equipped with a quiver. The most interesting feature, from our standpoint, is the large pair of wings attached to one leg of the tripod and reaching out on each side. Wings suggest movement of one form or another, but whither can a tripod move inside a sanctuary?13 The motion must be inherent in the tripod, evidence of its divine power in associa- tion with the god himself. A vase in Berlin'4 pictures Triptolemos in his winged car destined to move forward in time and space, but the motion of Apollo's tripod stems from the divine pneuma, the spiral-like potentiality of life bound up with the tripod itself. We add that Euripides'5 gives the tripod to Apollo as a divine seat and Claudian'" makes the tripod whirl around with the breath of the god, a movement appropriate for divine inspiration. The most significant tripod dedication is that set up in Delphi after the Persian wars by those cities who took part in the battle of Plataea;'7 its remains are still in the hippodrome of Istanbul. It seems most plausible to follow Herodotus when he asserts that the n CVA 3, pl. I21, I. 12 G. MWautis, Mythologie grecque, Brussels, 1959, pl. z; L. S6chan &amp; P.

Parke, op. cit. pl. facing p. 24); the tripod, then, was fixed to a definite spot. As Parke writes (p. 24), a 'proper contact with Apollo's tripod was supposed in itself to inspire.' 14 CVA, 2, pl. 96, 3. 15 I. T. I249f. 16 In Rufin.

Evidently the column was cast in one piece. The gold was removed by the Phocians when they took possession of the sanctuary, and now what is left of the serpent column is entirely of bronze. For us it is important that the column consists of three serpents whose bodies coil in a spiral to the top and that the three mouths were open, a feature which gave forceful support to the inspiration of the tripod above; moreover, this form of the dragon may have been a concession to Ge, the first presiding genius of the site. Even in its present location the column, minus the tripod, gives an awe-inspiring impression of a vitality ascending upward. Numerous tripods, in form of dedications, were clustered around the main sanctuary of Delphi. The most sumptuous was probably the golden example sent by Kroisos,2' one of the richest patrons of the oracle. A number were presented by wealthy Sicilian princes.22 The most decorative support for a tripod was the fourth century dedication, a column of three dancing women, much of which was recovered in the course of the Delphi excavations.23 The figures, in high relief, are joined to a central pillar. The column with its acanthus leaves ascends like the stalk of a plant up to the dancers, all of which adds something of the same rising motion supplied by the serpents on the Plataea dedication. Poulsen (p. 248) believes that each leg of the tripod rested on the outward flaring leaf of acanthus, while the women stood on an inner circle of Mandragora. We mention also the oldest temple offerings at the shrine of Apollo Ismenios in Thebes;24 they were inscribed with what Herodotus calls Cadmean characters. 18 Delphi (Trans. by G. C.

Herakles, determined to set up his own oracle elsewhere, attempted to remove the Delphic tripod to another site. A struggle ensued which was interrupted by a thunderbolt of Zeus and a command to restore the sacred support to its proper place, and Apollo was enjoined to give his brother the oracle. Herakles was thereupon despatched, in the company of Hermes, to the court of Omphale in Lydia. The whole tale reflects a conflict in religious interests between Apollo and the divine Herakles, a quarrel perhaps between the incumbent owner of the oracle and an invading newcomer, and the whole drama, including the site of the court of Omphale and the servitude of her paramour, probably took place in the neighborhood of Delphi, not in Lydia.27 The divine Herakles, as the pediment in Delphi and the vase-painter28 seem to imply, is on his way to a victory over Apollo, but Zeus was on the side of the latter. The tripod, however, becomes very important: the impli- cation here is very clear that without the three-legged support Apollo could not be master of the oracle and the site of Delphi would lose its prestige; it is an indispensable vehicle for the utterance of prophecy. The tripod given as a prize in a competitive contest is a later development and probably owes its reputation to its mantic predecessor and its religious significance. The most outstanding, as a support for such an award, is the monument of Lysicrates, set up in 334 B.c. on the Athenian street of tripods.29 On a square podium rests a circular structure whose surface is relieved by columns which appear to be engaged, crowned with the first Corinthian capitals to be used externally in Greek architecture.

This feature is also enhanced by three scrolls30 running from the finial to the edge of the roof, perhaps serving also to support small statues. Small tripods were carved in relief between the columns, a short dis- tance below the roof. The most famous group of tripods, mythological in character, were being fashioned by Hephaestus at the time Thetis arrived to order a new set of armor for her son. The tripods31 were given golden wheels, and Homer adds that they were self-moving, which means they required no agent to direct them; they were possessed of something like the divine motion of an obedient Hermes; they moved by themselves without making a prior decision about whither and why. Philostratus32 makes them more independent: they have wills of their own, whatever that may mean in reference to their movements in a divine plan. They were meant to stand around the god's palace but were also capable of entering the gathering of the gods and returning home again. The handles had not yet been fitted on. The best example of a tripod with a sugges- tion of motion is one probably found at Herculaneum.33 The rim of the container is decorated with festoons and bucrania, the upper section of the legs takes on the form of a seated sphinx with wings reaching upward. The three slender legs, terminating in the hooves of an animal, are joined in the center by a floral spiral, just below the seated sphinxes facing outward. At this point we can ask what manner of prototype may have suggested the three legs of the tripod. The inspiration must have been furnished by a triangular object or design sanctioned by religious dictates and one also with an implication of motion. We have two obvious examples of such a prototype: the first is found on the forehead of the medusa on the Proto-Attic amphora of 30 Dinsmoor, op. cit., pl. LIX. 8x Iliad XVIII, 373f. Tripods were also among the first prizes given by Achilles to the victors in the funeral games in honor of Patroclus (Iliad XXIII, 259). 32 Vita VI, I . 33 A.

The body later became the triangular support, its legs planted on the three points of the lunar shadow. The container or cauldron was patterned after the head of the dragon, the head of the monster covering the face of the sun, as we see them on the medusa head of the Eleusis amphora. Both the tripod support and the cauldron have a religious sanction which is grounded in a mythological interpretation of early astronomy. Another triangular construct is found on the Rhodian plate in the British Museum.35 The main subject is the combat between Menelaus and Hector over the body of Euphorbus lying at their feet. Above is the triangular shadow filled in with a checkerboard pattern, on each side of which is an eye, probably that of the sun whose light reaches out from either side of the eclipse shadow. The checkers are a further development of the reticulated pattern which stands for the cloth- like texture of the moon itself. We may also ask why the artist laid so much emphasis on a flat, three-cornered shape. If the triangle represents the round cone of the lunar shadow, why not present it as a round object, tapering to the bottom? The answer lies in the preference, on the part of the painter and sculptor, for the angular form which he found much easier to handle. The labyrinth, we may be fairly certain, was first presented in a circular form, but the artifacts available to us, even the oldest from Pylos,36 shows a flat, angular structure, if structure it can be called. The herm for the image of Hermes was evidently round in its original version but, as Miss Goldman37 points out, it was less laborious to produce a rectangular object, and we may also add that, since it was usually set up out-of-doors, it fitted better into an architectural setting. The tripod, as a support, and the basin or cauldron, whether joined together or not, have religious antecedents going back to the astronomical dragon attempting to devour the sun, in the earlier 34 G. Mylonas, The Proto-Attic Amphora of Eleusis, Athens, 1957, pl. 14a. 31 The best illustration is that of J. Boardman, J. Doerig, W. Fuchs &amp; M Hirmer, L'Art Grec, Munich, 1966, 75. 36 M.

The cauldron may also have a parallel association with the crater of the volcano.38 The connection between the support and cauldron and the divine power inherent in both is also illustrated by the vessel of Medea, reflecting the same regeneration motive early man found in the solar eclipse. To persuade the daughters of Pelias to resign their father to her care the Colchian rejuvenated an old decrepit ram before their starry eyes.39 The episode is illustrated on the fifth century relief in the Lateran,40 where one daughter puts the tripod in place, the other pours water into the cauldron, while Medea, dagger in hand, stands by in a characteristic pose. The ram is rejuvenated even as the sun is resurrected after passing through the dragon's mouth or from behind the moon; the tripod and its cauldron carried something of this same magical power throughout its history. An example of another tripod invested with a magical power of a different nature is furnished by Apollonius Rhodius.4' When Jason made inquiries of Apollo in Delphi about his forthcoming voyage, the god presented him with two tripods which he stowed away in his ship: wherever either one was placed, so he was told, that land would never be ravaged by an enemy. The one tripod they left near the city of Hyllus, far beneath the surface of the earth and out of sight of mortals. The other42 Orpheus later ordered the men to bring to the shore to offer it to the gods as a propitiation for their return homeward. This tripod43Triton accepted and vanished with it into the sea. These two stands, radiating divine power from beneath the earth or sea and over an extensive area, were endowed with the old dragon's invulner- ability, the same protective defense found in the horned skin of Moses and Siegfried and in the armor of Athena. The site of Dodona also claimed a circle of bronze tripods 38 Folklore LXXVIII, 1967, p. 212. 39 Paus. 8, II, 2-3; Apollodorus 1, 9, 27; Ovid: Met. 7, 468-521. 40 H.

Another tripod of a similar character is recorded by Pausanias (1, 43, 8). 224</page><page sequence="10">THE TRIPOD surrounding the sanctuary and placed so near each other that when one was struck the whole circle of vessels gave forth a sound; fragments of those tripods have been recovered in recent excava- tions.44 A. B. Cook45 believes this circle of vessels preceded the famous gong elevated on a column and presented by the Corcyrians, both being apotropaic or purificatory in character (p. I4f.). He cites the custom of striking bronze at funerals and eclipses of the moon and mentions a number of instances where tripods have been placed on columns, suspended, as it were, between heaven and earth (pp. 27-28). C. B. Lewis, while somewhat skeptical about the circle of tripods,46 claims the purpose of the whole rite was to produce thunderstorms and rain by way of imitative magic (p. 95). Leroy Campbell47 suggests an interesting theory for the origin of the logos: he calls it a reflection of thunder of Zeus' voice from the sky; this may have prompted the sounding of the tripods in Dodona. Regardless of whether their purpose was apotropaic, for rain-making or revelation the tripods were invested with a certain power to bring about an effect beyond themselves. The tripod, Elderkin claims,48 was also sepulchral in character. If so, it played a role similar to that of the cosmic column or the statues of Easter Island, namely to establish a connection between the living and deceased with the heavens above. The tripod's religious background is also reflected in a Ruman- ian version of the Odysseus-Polyphemos tale49 in which one of three brothers, after the first two have been devoured by the giant, hurls the tripod and the fat of the container into the eyes of the monster and thus blinds him. The Homeric version of the stake piercing the single eye is nearer to the original astronomical phenomenon - the lunar shadow blotting out the solar light. The use of the tripod or the three-cornered shape we have already noted may be equally as old and seems to have eastern ante- cedents. This latter version of the shadow we must now investigate. 44 Steph. Byz. 3. v. Aos;vrw. p. 165, IIff. Dind. For a recent statement on the site see E.

Q 225</page><page sequence="11">THE TRIPOD The triangular pattern plays a popular role for decorative purposes, but occasionally it means something more significant: the egg-shell illustration from a Phoenician tomb in the British Museum50 shows the reticulated triangle extending over the neck of the solar lion over-powering the one-horned bull, adding some- thing to the eclipse motive presented here. We find the triangular- shaped object suspended from the solar ring held by Anahit.51 A similar object may be seen in another relief depicting the investi- ture of Ardashir II.52 The triangular or cone-shaped object (perhaps a dagger) is held by the infant Mithra.53 H. S. Nyberg54 comments on the magical instrument used by Icelanders to arouse an ecstatic experience or to summon the spirits of the departed. The agent is encircled by a ring of assistants, mostly women, who create an ecstatic elan by way of singing, possibly also with the aid of the drum. The most indispensable object is the seidhjallr, a high seat or platform on which the agent takes his place, a device which exerts the same kind of influence on the subject as the tripod on the seated Pythian priestess in Delphi. After a period of time during which the singing is con- tinued, the spirit of the agent leaves his body, as in so many shamanistic experiences, and travels into distant regions to gain information for the benefit of himself and others. The seidhjallr tended to isolate the agent from the contingent world of time and space and to protect him from the influence of evil powers. It was definitely an asset in encouraging prophetic powers and so presents us with a parallel to the Delphic tripod. As the figure of Triton, the parent of Athena, was conjured up from the triangular lunar shadow or dragon,55 the strange monster, sometimes referred to as the Persian unicorn, elsewhere as the three-legged ass, arose from a similar source, although its origin is not as clear in Persian artifacts and literature. The Bundahis56 describes this creature as having three feet, six eyes, nine mouths, 60 Perrot &amp; Chipiez III, fig. 624. "L F. Sarre, Die Kunst des alten Persien, Berlin, 1923, fig. 12. 52 J.

The six eyes and nine mouths are distributed to different parts of the body, each mouth as large as a cottage, the whole creature as huge as a lofty mountain. Each foot, when resting on the ground, occupies as much space as a thousand sheep, its ears likewise are huge, its one horn is of gold and hollow, and all kinds of branches have sprouted from it. The creature itself is called righteous, and his horn is a definite asset in over- coming the evil of noxious animals. He can shake the waters of the ocean, he can render all creatures pregnant and purify the waters of the whole cosmos. The remarks about the dung and urine of the ass contribute nothing to our subject. The ability to purify the water, the fertility aspect, the righteous character of the beast as well as his horn stamp this creature definitely as a unicorn, but as a living and moving animal he is more impossible than either the western or Chinese one-horned creature. The water of the moon may account for his position in the ocean, the light of the sun may account for his white body; his horn with its branches can be traced to the corona of the eclipse, but the rest of his anatomy is derived from a fantastic construct of meteorology and astronomy as vague as many of the figures of the zodiac. Ettinghausen57 finds he is quite different from the concept of the karkadann which has always kept a 'core' of reality. The ass whose figure appears in the company of Hephaestos, whose ears are added to the head of the griffon, apparently has some connection with fire; Jung believes the Persian unicorn is related to the ass described by Ctesias.58 Shepard69 contends he is three-legged because he is supposed to stand on earth, air and sea or his reign is to endure through three Zoroastrian ages. Like the parent of Athena and the three-legged support it probably derives its distinctive feature - the three legs -- from the stylized version of the lunar shadow and inherits its magical power from the same source. 57 The Unicorn (Freer Gallery of Art Occasional Papers) I, 3, Washington, 1950, p. 150. 58 Psychologie und Alchemie, Zuerich, 1944, p. 598, i; O.

The Scythian ass, mentioned by the same writer in another passage,62 likewise has a miraculous horn which will hold water from the Styx, and this river is a dragon stream, a forerunner of the horn of the unicorn; no vessel is capable of holding this water except the ass's horn, a statement echoed by Plutarch63 who ascribes the same miraculous power to the hoof of an ass. The type of animal and the miraculous character of horn and hoof ally these beasts with the unicorn of Persia, but nothing is said about the three legs. If we probe further into the traditions of the east we find a large number of creatures on arifacts and in literature with a single horn but no reference to the three appendages. I know of but one further men- tion of such a creature in later mediaeval annals: the man of God, according to Gregory the Great, meets the devil 'cornu et tre- pedicam ferens.'64 Grimm65 renders 'trepedicam' as a three- legged goat. A great number of bronze cauldrons were dedicated to Hera in Argos and Samos, which leads us to the conclusion that there must have been some connection between this sacred basin and the traditions surrounding the goddess. The cauldron, the companion piece to the tripod, resembles in many respects the Medusa heads of the Eleusis amphora which Mylonas66 describes as 'mask-like heads, cauldrons from the rim of which grow griffin and lion heads, a favorite votive offering of the times.' The original purpose of the cauldron and the significance of the Medusa head must have some- thing of a common base in that both echo the regeneration theme from the solar eclipse, much like the Medea tripod and cauldron already referred to above. Even when the tripod is not used as a support, the figure three usually characterizes the members used instead: Herodotus67 reports a bronze vessel of this type made by 60 Frag. Ctesiae Cnidii (ed.

Some cauldrons also show serpents alternating with griffons, serpents like those on the amphora of Eleusis. The Samian and Olympian cauldrons, which make up the greater number of the finest vessels, are of Greek origin6s and date, for the most part, from the 7th century B.C. Many of the griffons have a long relief line running from the head and along the neck until it culminates in a spiral, and in one case the spiral encloses the solar rosette,s9 thus resembling the Minoan examples from the throne room at Knossos. A few have cone-shaped bases which appear to be an importation from Asia Minor or Syria. The knobs on the griffon heads are sometimes cone-shaped, which tempts us to compare them with the 'Pilzhut' of Chinese bronze vessels ;70 Hopkins7' claims they show Asiatic influence. Although the serpent appears as a protome alongside the griffon, the former is undoubtedly the prototype for the latter; the serpent Hopkins traces to the uraeus of Egypt and its beard to the Anatolian ibex. Jantzen (p. 89) concludes that since griffons appear so frequently on the tripod supports, the tripod and griffons belong together. Certainly there can be no question of the sacred character of such vessels whose symbolism must be of long standing. Before going further we must be reminded that the tripod, steeped in religious tradition, goes back to the lunar shadow which can be presented in a number of forms; its nearest relative is the triangular figure already discussed. The cone-shaped shadow can also present itself in the form of the body of the dragon (the term 'body' is very important), in the horn of the unicorn and finally in the body of the anthropomorphic messiah; it may also be a blasting horn or a horn of plenty. The cauldron resting on the tripod can be the head of the dragon enclosing the sun, a bowl or 68 Ulf Jantzen, Griechische Greifenkessel, Berlin, 1955, p. 34; also by the same author, Die Bedeutung der Greifenprotomen aus dem Heraion von Samos (Fest- schrift Hans Jantzen, Berlin, 1951), p. 28. 69 Ibid., pl. o, 4. 70 C.

In the case of the messiah we frequently find an accompanying figure with many of the features of the former but more closely allied to the moon than to the sun; such figures include Balarama, Aaron, John the Baptist, Patroclus and Bran. In the ancient world we find the head or cauldron more or less with the body, horn or tripod, but in the later history of the two they function more as separate units, still preserving, however, similar attributes. The cauldron, as a healer and provider, appears along with other treasures of the Tuatha De Danann in the seventh century, in the British Isles. Loomis72 believes they are earlier than either the French romances dealing with the Grail or the Christian tradition attached to it. Miss Weston73 is convinced that the treasures and the symbols of the Grail castle go back to a common origin but have developed along different lines. Elderkin,74 relying somewhat on the historian Keating, believes they came originally from Scythia whence they were brought to Greece. At any rate, the cauldron and other subjects appearing in the Grail castle and elsewhere have much the same properties as the cauldron and Grail of the Arthurian tales, the Grail being nothing more than the dragon head; they are much the same as the cauldron of Medea as well, but the attributes of the Grail are extended to the characters associated with it: Gawain and Perceval are both healers.75 We might also state with some degree of certainty that the properties of the cauldron and tripod are extended to the messiah wherever we find him. The bleeding lance and fishing motive have evidently been added from another source. Moreover, the tripod, as such, does not appear with the cauldron, but it is implicit in the horn and body which play a leading role in the castle tableau. Bran, who is a wanderer and god of the sea, has a cauldron into which a slain man might be cast to restore his life;'6 he also owns a horn, one of the thirteen treasures of the Isles of Britain, a horn 72 Wales and the Arthurian Legend, Cardiff, 1956, p. i9f. 73 From Ritual to Romance, Cambridge, 192o, p. 71. 74 Related Ideas of Delphi, Tara and Jerusalem, Springfield, 196x, p.

Sinai.78 Like the messianic Krishna and Achilles he was wounded by a missile, his head was cut off and carried around by his followers for a great number of years during which time it supplied them with food whenever it was needed. Now the Grail contained a head,79 and as such can be equated with the cauldron which, in later Celtic myth, provided food, immortal youth and invulnera- bility, much like the Grail.80 There are too may parallels between the Grail and the cauldron of antiquity to lead one to believe that the former originated in the Christian tradition; both go back to the sun over-shadowed by the moon or the sun in the mouth of the dragon. The horn, which in the Arthurian cycle is separated from the Grail, is so similar to the latter in its attributes, it is sometimes called the Grail.8' Bran, then, unites both head and horn in his person, the same two which appear as Grail and body in the Grail castle, but his connection with the water of the sea and the loss of his head bring him closer to the class of lunar forerunner or companion to the messiah - another John the Baptist - than to an identification with the messiah himself. Why, we may ask, were so many bronze cauldrons dedicated in a shrine of Hera? What did Hera have to do with regeneration? The griffons point to a volcanic crater, but the tripod and cauldron could refer to either the volcano or eclipse, for, as we have seen, features of each one were fused together in the accounts of Greek writers; both phenomena, however, can be "raced back to the regeneration of the sun after the volcanic cloud or that of the lunar shadow passed from its face. The Argives say, according to Pau- sanias,82 that Hera recovered her virginity every year by bathing in the spring of Kanachos, a secret story borrowed from a mystery celebrated by the Argives in honor of the goddess; the site of such a spring has not been discovered. If the cauldron is another "7 Ibid., p. 20. 78 Exodus, XIX, I6. 79 R. S. Loomis, Celtic Myth and Arthurian Romance, New York, 1927, p. 236. 80 J.A.

What is the course of the development of cauldron and tripod before they meet and become reconciled with the messianic tradition of Christianity? The sun in the dragon's mouth and the dragon body pass over into the cauldron and tripod of Delphi and those of Medea; in India we find something similar in the wonderful vessel of Yudhisthira which the sun god had originally given to Kunti and which holds a never-failing supply of food.83 In the second stage of solar eclipse symbolism the two sections emerge as the unicorn and, in the third stage, as the messiah - in Greece the Homeric Achilles, in India Krishna, in Persia Mithra, among the Nordic peoples Siegfried, among the Jews Moses, and later Christ. The cauldron and tripod, meanwhile, had made their way through the Mediterranean and up to the British Isles and left their stamp on Celtic religion and mythology, and though the tripod is not explicitly mentioned, it is certainly implied in the horn and body. J. Rhys84 and G. Elderkinso make no scruples about equating the Irish cauldron of Taliessen with the cauldron and tripod of Delphi. The Christian tradition filtered into the Celtic heritage and fused the two, the cauldron and the messianic Grail (and chalice) into the Grail,86 and as such they were treated by the Welsh and Irish writers and the French romancers; the tripod was carried over into the body and horn. It must be remembered, of course, that while King Arthur serves as the focal center of the whole body of tales, the messianic features were dispersed into a number of characters of the Round Table, including the major figures of Gawain, Perceval and Galahad. 83 C.
