As a result, portions of  his biography are questionable.6 Nonetheless, his story of moving westward  from Illinois to Northwest California during the Gold Rush is emblematic of  the nineteenth-century doctrine of Manifest Destiny, which is rooted in the  idea that America had been chosen to expand, to drive out Indigenous peoples  and animals, and to perpetuate “civilization.” This doctrine is aptly symbol- ized by the female figure of Columbia, who ushers in light in John Gast’s paint- ing American Progress (1872), which was widely circulated as a lithograph.7  Aware of the public’s increasing interest in both hunting stories of the West  Figure 1.

Hunting grizzlies was a dangerous business, and it could bring fame to those  willing to take the risk. As Harper’s New Monthly Magazine reported in 1861 : If you kill your bear, it is a triumph worthy [of] enjoying ; if you get killed yourself,  some of the newspapers will give you a friendly notice ; if you get crippled for life, you  carry about you a patent of courage which may be useful in case you go into politics. ...  A “chawed up” man is very much admired all over the world.13  There was also a market for live grizzlies. They were used for a variety of lucra- tive purposes, including the popular bear-and-bull fights, which continued  the European tradition of bear-baiting, a spectator sport that involved tor- menting bears and pitting them against other animals.  In describing his presidential chairs, Kinman emphasized the importance  of obtaining materials through hunting in order to “make the patriotic idea  complete.”14 The equation of hunting with patriotism was manifested to  audiences in popular forms such as Wild West shows, literature, magazines,  and art that depicted struggles between man and animal. An iconographic  motif that dominated nineteenth-century illustration and photography was  that of the hunter posed in what Karen Wonders terms “victory-over-van- quished portraits.” These portraits depicted a successful hunter standing next  to — or on top of — the slain victim. She writes, “The motif of manly victory over  the native game had similarities with flag planting of mountaineers and other  explorers of foreign parts.”15 This claim of dominance resonates with Mathew  Brady’s 1865 studio photograph of Kinman seated in his Grizzly Chair, which  was taken just before he gifted the chair to President Johnson. | fig.  5 | Like  the victory portraits, the heroic narrative of the hunt is carefully illustrated by  the inclusion of dead game, weapon, and hunter. In the picture, the weapon- ry that Kinman required to kill the bear is clearly illustrated : his buck knife is  stabbed into the ground, while his tomahawk and large rifle rest against the  body of the bear/chair. Connecting the hunter to the hunted, the rifle is loose- ly cradled in Kinman’s right arm, while one of his fingers points downwards  towards the trigger and the face of the bear. Unlike the victory portraits of  11.

When he gave the chair to President Johnson, he  reportedly did not, as he normally did when touring the country, make ref- erence to any hunting stories. In this respect, the bear chair is more than a  hunting trophy : it becomes a symbol of expansion, conquest, and victory over  the western frontier. It was offered to the President as a testament to progress  in the form of a seat. While Kinman alluded to his four chairs as thrones, they  were never considered as such in any official capacity. They were recorded as  presidential gifts, and the only chair that was documented on display in the  White House was the Grizzly Chair. In the engraving in Frank Leslie’s Illustrated  Newspaper, this chair appears to have been used only as decoration and not as  an official seat for the president, who appears sitting behind his desk across  the room.17 Unlike royal thrones, which are passed on from one ruler to the  next, chairs used by American presidents change with each incumbent. In fact,  the only piece of furniture that traditionally has remained in the Oval Office is  the Resolute Desk, a gift from Queen Victoria to President Rutherford B. Hayes  in 1880, the same president who received an elk chair by Kinman in 1876.  16.

After the displays of stuffed animals at London’s Great Exhibition  racar 43 (2018) 1 : 53–70 103 </page> <page sequence="6"> in 1851, taxidermied animals became a popular commodity in Europe and  North America during the second half of the nineteenth century. While many  scholars have interpreted taxidermy as demonstrative of power over nature  and colonial conquest, as Sarah Amato argues, the variety of objects made  from preserved animals “reflected the Victorian and Edwardian belief that ani- mals should be useful to humans, even in death.”18 Using animal bodies to  make furniture for upperclass homes, British taxidermist Rowland Ward start- ed the trend of “Wardian” furniture in the 1850s. An 1896 article in The Strand  Magazine, titled “Animal Furniture,” features some of Ward’s creations, “there  are scooped-out pheasants as pie-covers ; the eggs of emus and ostriches as  basins and jugs ; hares’ heads as matchboxes ; flying opossums holding card- trays ; coiling snakes as umbrella stands ; capercailzie claws as candlesticks ;  wild asses’ ears as tobacco-pouches.”19 Larger animal furniture included bears  mounted as waiters standing and holding drink trays or lamps, as well as sev- eral chairs, each made from the entire body of an animal, such as a small ele- phant and a giraffe. When comparing the Grizzly Chair to Ward’s furniture, it  is apparent that the latter consisted of a menagerie of whimsical, submissive,  and often-anthropomorphic animals posed to suggest they were offering  their services willingly as useful household objects. In contrast, the Grizzly  Chair, and especially the head of the bear, is at once a testament to human  domination and control of animal bodies, and a reflection of contemporary  visions of what it would be like to meet a savage beast in the “wild.”  18.

In the context of European colonialism and the use of taxi- dermy, Rachel Poliquin writes, “Savage animals savagely posed offered ‘nat- ural’ proof of the validity of European colonial management.”21 Taxidermy of  big game animals in the American context can be understood the same way.  Grizzlies were preserved and collected as proof that they existed and func- tioned as material forms of power and progress ; the Grizzly Chair would have  been viewed as a representation of the domination of the Wild West. Kinman gave the Grizzly Chair to President Andrew Johnson, who suc- ceeded Abraham Lincoln after his assassination in 1865. Through its use of an  animal that was deemed ferocious and unpredictable, the Grizzly Chair was  intended to symbolically protect the president’s seat of power. When John- son received the gift, Kinman told the audience that the mechanized bear  head was meant to frighten off rebels and office seekers of the White House,  to which the president replied, the head better stay well protruded.22 Three  years later, grizzlies were extinct from Humboldt County and Johnson was  impeached.23 It is unclear how the chair made its way back to Kinman, but it  eventually came into the possession of Martha J. Herrick, a ranch owner from  Humboldt County, who purchased the Grizzly Chair from Kinman’s estate  21.

They reluctantly agreed, however, once Herrick insisted  racar 43 (2018) 1 : 53–70 105 </page> <page sequence="8"> on personally paying for the shipping costs.27 Herrick’s exhibit, titled “Hum- boldt as it was in 1850,” was criticized by San Francisco’s Weekly Times, which  described it as an “antiquated and moth-eaten collection of ‘fake’ relics.”  Despite the display of the county’s magnificent natural resources, the article  continues, it was humiliating to watch reporters pass them all by, in the thrall  of “their gaping ecstasy over the Kinman stuffed bear, with its jaw and string  attachment.”28 One could say that the presidential chair became “de-throned,”  like president Johnson himself, in that it no longer represented American val- ues. It was now merely an amusing prop used in a historical display. Herrick’s  exhibit may have been criticized in the press, but it nevertheless won a Grand  Silver Medal in its class at the Industrial Exposition.29 Perhaps due to this suc- cess, Herrick became one of the organizers of the Humboldt County exhibit  in the California State Building at the Chicago World’s Columbian Exposition  later that year. An article in The Californian Illustrated Magazine about the Chicago World’s  Columbian Exposition describes Humboldt County as one of the most iso- lated parts of the state, and this aspect of its character was suggested in the  imposing display through “the forest, the mountain slope, and the glen, with  deer, bear, and other wild animals therein.”30 Overall, the display emphasized  the abundance of natural resources in the county through its presentation  of flora and fauna. | fig.  6 | The main attraction of the exhibit was an imita- tion mountainside that included native moss, ferns, and shrubbery. On the  side of the “mountain” was a good-sized cave from which stuffed animals of  the county emerged.31 “As we enter,” the article in Californian Illustrated Maga- zine maintains, “a grizzly, coming out of his cave growls across our path. One  thinks himself in the midst of a museum. Here are trophies and relics and  curios ; here are woods and fruits and grains, and Mrs. Herrick knows the story  of them all.”32 Present throughout the duration of the fair, Herrick offered  lectures on the history of the county with Kinman’s curiosities and chairs as  props. Various accounts of these lectures suggest that Herrick did not men- tion or emphasize the history of the Grizzly Chair as a presidential gift, but  27.

The  106 Vanessa Bateman Ursus horribilis : Seth Kinman’s Grizzly Chair </page> <page sequence="9"> issue was less about preserving a species and more about saving what it had  come to represent.  The display of grizzly bears in an exhibit devoted to a county in which they  were extinct was not unusual for the California State Building at the Chicago  World’s Fair. One could argue that the number of California grizzlies there  outnumbered those in the wild. As its population declined, however, the  bear’s symbolic meaning increased. As Peter Alagona argues in After the Grizzly,  “By the time they were extinct, the California grizzly had become an indelible  icon.”34 Bears were included in most exhibits of the State Building in a var- iety of media, including taxidermy mounts, rugs, badges, bronze and plaster  statues, paintings, and, of course, California state flags. John Berger’s famous  essay “Why Look at Animals ?” asserts that, in our late-capitalist society, ani- mals have disappeared in their original form and have been replaced by sym- bols.35 This observation could also be made of the California State Building  at the Columbian Exposition of 1893, where the “real” bear was replaced by  symbolic forms ; in other words, it was overrepresented in compensation for  its loss. In the context of the Exposition, the Grizzly Chair took on new mean- ing. As Michelle Henning writes in The Afterlives of Animals, this “process of  recontextualzation ... by which some of the properties of an exhibited object  become perceptible and others disappear from view, may be described as the  object’s ‘social life.’”36 The chair was now a symbol and souvenir of what once  was — the materiality of its moth-eaten, deteriorating body was a testament to  time passed. At the Chicago World’s Fair, Frederick Jackson Turner read his seminal essay  “The Significance of the Frontier in American History” to a gathering of the  American Historical Association. Turner’s “frontier thesis” traced the social  evolution of frontier life and proposed that westward exploration and settle- ment had shaped US democracy and character from the colonial era until  1890, the year the US Census officially declared the frontier closed. In discuss- ing the process of exploration and westward settlement, Turner describes a  meeting between civilization and the untamed wild :  The wilderness masters the colonist. It finds him a European in dress, industries, tools,  modes of travel, and thought. It takes him from the railroad car and puts him in the  birch canoe. It strips off the garments of civilization and arrays him in the hunting shirt  and the moccasin. It puts him in the log cabin of the Cherokee and Iroquois ... In short,  at the frontier the environment is at first too strong for the man. ... Little by little he  transforms the wilderness, but the outcome is not the old Europe. ...

Turner’s reminiscence of the US frontier resonated with an exhibit that  depicted frontier life as something that needed to be protected for members  of the “leisure class.” While a part of the World’s Columbian Exposition earned  the title “The White City” for its use of neoclassical architecture and blinding  display of the relatively new technology of electricity, it also included a small,  wooded island upon which stood a replica of a hunter’s log cabin lit by candles.  Decorated with elk antlers, animal hides, and a large fireplace lit in the even- ings, the cabin offered visitors a taste of frontier life reimagined by the elite  organizers of the exhibit — the Boone and Crockett Club, a wildlife and habitat  conservation organization founded in 1887 by Theodore Roosevelt. This was  not the rough frontier that Kinman had experienced first-hand decades before,  but the site of a new pastime reserved for members of an exclusive men’s soci- ety.39 While the efforts of the conservation movement were associated with  an appreciation and desire to protect the American landscape, the movement  was entwined with issues of race, class, and gender. Scholars of American mas- culinity have noted that modern urban life was perceived to have “distanced  men from older forms of masculinity” and in compensation they turned  to outdoor sports as an antidote.40 Hunting associations and private clubs  allowed members to reclaim their manhood through ideal representations of  the American West, which became, as Karen R. Jones writes, “a landscape of  testosterone and restoration.”41 As a celebration of industry, technology, and  expansion, the World’s Columbian Exhibition represented what the outdoors- man was trying to escape in everyday life. The Boone and Crockett Club cabin,  in contrast, offered a place of solitude and renewal of manhood.  In highlighting not only national achievement in commerce, but also  nineteenth-century ideas of expansion, empire, and racial ideologies, the  1893 World’s Columbian Exposition in Chicago looked very much towards the  future.
