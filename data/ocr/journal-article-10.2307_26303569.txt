<plain_text><page sequence="1">Dali: Double and Multiple Images 311 SALVADOR DALl—A SYMPOSIUM Salvador Dali: Double and Multiple Images Abstract Salvador Dali's work in the 1930's includes two groups of paintings em bodying the pictorial concept of the multiple image. These works exhibit the most extensive form of mutual dependence of theory and artistic prac tice within his overall production of images of this nature. Referring to the early phas£ of Dali's paranoia theory, the 1930 group experiments with the documentation of the paranoiac phenomenon of multiple figuration. The aim: To raise doubts about the supposed reality of the objects of the exter nal world and, in terms of its iconography, to apply the erotic metaphor on a universal scale. The 1938 group displays conceptualized representations of paranoiac-critical activity as promulgated in Dali's writing of the mid 1930's. Dali's double images, on the other hand, which lack the theoretical and conceptual implications of the multiple images, generally indulge in facile visual trickery. Salvador Dali's employment of double or multiple im ages in his paintings has, undoubtedly, contributed to his reputation as an artist endowed with prodigious technical ability. Dali's magic wand turns swans into elephants, a group of warring cavalrymen into a woman's head and torso; or makes six different images rise out of one visual configuration. Evaluations of this aspect of his art range from uncritical adulation, centered on his draftsmanship and genius, to a less flattering view of this technique as exhibiting the "characteristics of a sophisticated picture puzzle for children."1 The controversy also encompasses matters pertaining to the theory underlying this artistic practice. No critic can safely ignore the relationship exist ing, in one form or another, between Dali's multiple ima gery and his theoretical assertions concerning what he calls paranoiac-critical activity. Yet there are critics who would American Imago, Winter 1983, Vol. 40, No. 4, pp. 311-335.

In addition, there is the changing function of paranoia-criticism—both as a theory and in relation to Dali's artistic practice—in the course of the 1930's. Indeed, the particular needs that para noia-criticism served, in its role as a theoretical system, in the heyday of Dali's surrealist career during the early 1930's, cannot be validly associated with his artistic output in the years that follow. These changes are well attested to by the changes in technique or visual conception of the double or multiple images in the course of these years. It is, indeed, this perception of a varying perspective— of change or mutation—that constitutes my point of depar ture. I shall focus on two groups of paintings embodying the pictorial concept of the multiple image—the first group having been painted in 1930, the second in 1938. The 1930 group comprises two quite similar versions of the same mul tiple motif, Invisible Sleeping Woman, Horse, Lion. The 1938 paintings combine diverse elements such as a face, a fruit dish, a squatting figure seen from its back, and different canine animals. Their most elaborate exponent is the paint ing entitled The Endless Enigma in which a single pictorial configuration gives rise to six different images. My choice of these two groups is dictated, above all, by a simple quan titative consideration: the fact that these are the only true examples of the multiple image in Dali's art of the 1930's. This pronounced scarcity of multiple images raises some questions, especially if such images are to be considered, as they will be in the pages that follow, in terms of an inevit able broadening—indeed a fulfillment—of the theoretical premises underlying the double image concept in Dali's scheme. Such a perspective on the multiple image will gain in depth and significance once the processes involved in the formation of the double and multiple images are eluci dated. For the moment, suffice it that we have been led to examine these two groups of paintings and to question</page><page sequence="3">Dali: Double and Multiple Images 313 whether the visual conception and technique informing their images have been altered perceptibly between 1930 and 1938. I will start by examining the techniques utilized in both groups to attain the multiple figuration, with the aim of evaluating them in terms of Dali's own theoretical formula tions. The earliest of these appears in the essay "L'Âne pourri" (1930), where Dali defines the double image as a "representation of an object that is also, without the slight est physical or anatomical change, the representation of another entirely different object, the second representation being equally devoid of any deformation or abnoramlity which might betray some arrangement."4 Utilizing the im ages contained in the 1930 paintings as examples, Dali goes on to contend that the double image may be extended to include a number of images. I have trimmed Dali's elabora tion of these concepts to its bare phenomenological essence, disregarding for the moment considerations of the mechan ism involved. Observed along these lines, the 1930 paintings (both entitled Invisible Sleeping Woman, Horse, Lion) appear to satisfy Dali's demand that the representation of one ob ject also be that of another object; in other words, that the images be circumscribed by one figuration. This is accom plished by slight additions of shadows and reflections, but also—and this is where Dali strays from the demands of theory—by pronounced anatomical distortions. Thus, the sleeping woman's posture is not only awkward but down right unnatural. She appears to lie on her back, her head thrown back, the hands falling underneath the head. Around the waist, though, the body changes posture to be come that of a kneeling figure, its buttocks turned upwards. The woman's figure is made to accommodate the form of a horse by displaying thick, angular and highly muscular arms. One arm forms the horse's head, the other is trans formed into a leg. The horse's hindquarters, defined by the woman's haunches, are embellished with a stylized tail which also serves for a lion's head and mane. The horse's hind leg is suggested by a vague reflection of the woman's thigh. In one painting (A), the simpler and more elegant of the two,5 the woman's leg is brought out by the shadow-line</page><page sequence="4">314 Haim Finkelstein 1. Invisible Sleeping Woman (A,B) 2.

The fellateurs (B)</page><page sequence="6">316 Haim Finkelstein surrounding the horse's tail or the lion's mane. (In fact, lion and horse simply reverse front and back). While the basic figuration of the multiple image is quite similar in both paintings, one of them (B) offers an addi tional image, largely consubstantial with the other three. Here the somewhat exaggerated delineation of the woman's breasts helps define the head and shoulder of a standing figure whose body is formed by the woman's right arm (or the horse's foreleg). The woman's head and left arm (or the horse's head), aided by a shadow projecting to the right, suggest a reclining figure whose posture, with regard to the standing figure, is clearly associated with the act of fellatio (as depicted by Dali in his erotic drawings and in other paintings done around that time, notably Le Grand masturba teur, 1929). This fourth image is repeated three times, in a more explicit fashion, outside the central figuration. There is also a fifth image of a headless torso which is formed by the woman's haunches (or the horse's hindquarters); this image reappears twice outside the central figuration. I shall consider later the thematic and theoretical significance of such repetitions. Keeping for now our attention on the cen tral multiple image we may repeat the observation made earlier that, while literally fulfilling Dali's ambition that the diverse images be "contained" within one figuration, the arrangement hardly satsifies Dali's requirement that this should be accomplished without the slightest physical or anatomical change or deformation. The difficulties are ex acerbated by the placement of the images, perceived as con cretely tangible objects, on a sharply inclined plateau which is obviously influenced by de Chirico's spatial conception. Thus situated, in a manner which enhances their isolation, the objects appear largely differentiated from their sur roundings. In other words, these images form a closed sys tem that must rely mostly on its internal constituents for the formation of its multiple figuration. This practical applica tion of the multiple image concept thus hints at a virtual impossibility and points to an ultimate sense of failure, at least as far as the fulfillment of the theoretical requirements is conerned. This separation of image or figure from the arena on</page><page sequence="7">Dali: Double and Multiple Images 317 which it is displayed is no longer apparent in the 1938 works. Not as strict as the 1930 multiple images in their application of the formula introduced in "L'Âne pourri," the 1938 paint ings display a more versatile reliance on certain painting techniques adopted by Dali in the interim. Here the images are not as concretely or objectively manifest as in the earlier works. They are formed, rather, by visual configurations de rived from the interaction of background and foreground elements, alternately functioning as landscape features and figures or objects; indeed, this approach calls for an exten sive use of the well-known optical phenomenon of figure ground reversal. Related to a series of beach scenes (some of which are adorned with telephones and grilled sardines) created in 1938-39, these works exhibit a receding body of water which also evokes, generally in an ambiguous manner, an alternate image of a projecting spatial form constituting, upon different "readings" of the image, parts of figures or objects. The concept is clearly illustrated in Beach with Tele phone (Tate Gallery) where a small lake takes on—through a manipulation of reflections on the water and a shadowing around its banks—the three-dimensional form of a fish lying on a flat plane. The "stage" for most of these paintings is set in The Transparent Simulacrum of the Feigned Image (Albright Knox Art Gallery, Buffalo, New York) where the fore ground area (the "beach") is depicted as a table top (more about the significance of this detail later on) over which hangs the light-blue shape of a deep saucer or dish. In other paintings this shape alternately evokes a face and forehead, a fruit dish, or a dog's abdomen. The hills seen across the bay outline the fruit in the dish or the dog's body and head. In Invisible Afghan with the Apparition on the Beach of the Face of Garcia Lorca in the Form of a Fruit Dish with Three Figs (private collection), a woman figure seen from the back (the "nurse" motif found in many of Dali's works) defines a face, while two reclining figures evoke the eyes; the dog is perceived as a light silhouette against the darker shapes of the surrounding hills. In the pictorially richer Apparition of Face and Fruit Dish on a Beach (Wadsworth Atheneum, Hartford, Connecticut) the body of the dog is merely hinted at while the well-defined head is formed by the shape of a hillside and the dirt road</page><page sequence="8">318 Haim Finkelstein surrounding it; a tunnel dug through the hillside forms an eye while a bridge and its arches (with their reflection in the water) evoke the collar. The most complex work in the series is The Endless Engima (Teatro-Museo Dali, Figueras) which comprises six different images, several of which appear in the other works discussed. Thus we re-encounter the face and fruit dish, the seated woman seen from her back, a dog (a greyhound this time) and yet another dog. Naming this last image "mythological Beast," Dali undoubtedly had in mind its strangely rounded hindquarters, a shape dictated, in fact, by the additional images of a boat's prow and a man dolin. Presiding over these images is the figure of a "reclin ing philosopher" formed by skyline and hills. The largely indeterminate character of the images populating these canvases disposes of the distortions and deformations found in the 1930 multiple images—or ren ders them innoffensive, when they do occur—and accounts for the greater elegance of the 1938 works. This does not mean, though, that Dali exhibits here a greater mastery of his craft or an improved technique. The difference, as we shall see, is rather one of essence; and while the two groups employ multiple images and may, perhaps, reveal a com mon theoretical basis they are, nonetheless, far from being consubstantial in terms of the aesthetic and motivation in forming them. This cannot, of course, be confirmed solely on the basis of the preceding analysis of the technical con ceptions underlying the two groups of multiple images, in which I have resorted to a descriptive approach which alto gether disregards iconography or meaning. Such an arbi trary separation may be justified, though, on meth odological grounds, since it has been largely dictated by the hitherto unproven assumption—one which will be explored in the pages that follow—that the nature of the iconography of both groups is firmly associated with their respective con ceptual approach and theoretical implication. Dali's first attempts to depict multiple images coincide with his introduction of a theoretical system meant to com pete with Surrealism's psychic automatism and based on his own version of the paranoiac thought process. Dalf's first elaboration of his theory is provided in the essay "L'Âne</page><page sequence="9">Dali: Double and Multiple Images 319 pourri," hjs point of departure being the common definition of paranoia as a delusional psychosis in which the obsessional delusions develop slowly into a complex and logically elabo rated system. Dali notes the distinction between the para noiac delusion and a simple hallucination, and emphasizes that the paranoiac activity "employs materials admitting a control and recognition" in the external world. His basic aim is to "systematize confusion"; that is to say, create a new order or system out of elements taken in the external world which otherwise would be unrelated to one another. At this stage, Dali considers his theory mostly in reference to its visual application as a tool utilized for subverting or discred iting our perception of reality. This function is embodied in the concept of the double and multiple image. The creation of these images is, according to Dali, the result of the para noiac's violent use of the external world in order to assert his own obsessional idea, a process utilizing all kinds of figurai "pretexts" and "coincidences" (terms employed here in the visual sense) to define the contours of additional representa tions. In other words, the object seen in external reality un dergoes a change of meaning or context without any physical modification (this would constitute an hallucination), the new context being a function of some obsessive idea which, as Dali would have it, is mostly erotic in nature. I should point out that this obsessional idea is not at all equivalent— and might rather be considered as analogous—to what is generally known of paranoiac obsessional delusions in the medical context. The paranoiac process may continue on and on, "the number of images limited only by the mind's degree of paranoiac capacity."6 The examples Dali utilizes to illustrate the double and multiple image concept are directly related, as shown be fore, to the two paintings entitled Invisible Sleeping Woman, Horse, Lion. The images employed here refer to several mo tifs which figure prominently in the paintings of 1929 1930, whose iconography will shed some light on the nature of Dali's obsessive ideas. Thus, for instance, the lion's head appearing in a great many of these paintings is, by Dalit's own testimony regarding the five heads in Accommodations of Desire (1929), a "terrorizing" image representing desire.7 Its</page><page sequence="10">320 Haim Finkelstein association with other motifs of the psychosexual» "dramas" enacted in 1929 works such as Illumined Pleasures reveals its underlying meaning as a representation of the father (alter nately shown as a bearded man or, in later paintings, as a William Tell figure) in his role of a punishing superego and a castrating agent. The culprit is the son (often represented by a Dalinian profile) who dares indulge in incestuous emo tions and, consequently, finds a safer recourse in masturba tion (The Lugubrious Game, 1929). This results in a sense of shame embodied in the figure of a young man hiding his face in his hand or resting his head on his father's shoulder (Accommodations of Desire). Another blatant emotion is that of castration anxiety, expressed by mutilated hands and other severed limbs, which is also related to the conception of the sexual act as a preamble to being devoured by the woman, a phobia associated in these paintings with the praying mantis motif (The Great Masturbator, 1929). The lion—its body fully shown at times—accompanies another related motif display ing the young man covering his face with his hand as the object of an act of fellatio performed by a male or female figure (Tour du plaisir ou Vertigo, 1930; The Font, 1930). The connection between these motifs and those found in one version of Invisible Sleeping Woman, Horse, Lion is obvious enough. Their association with the sleeping woman is eluci dated by Dali in an essay entitled "L'Amour." Pointing to an evident relationship between love and dreaming, Dali as serts that sleeping postures, especially those of lovers, dis play an intra-uterine curvature of the body reflecting an unconscious desire for self-annihilation; "and rightly so," Dali adds, "when those are [the postures] of the happy ones who sleep in the passionate and cosmic position of 69 or that of the praying mantis devouring the male."8 The paintings of 1929-1930 with their elaborate psy chosexual "dramas" are in no need of Dali's theory of para noia for their effect. Their iconography, explored along the lines suggested here, points to their strength as vigorous expressions of Dali's psychic life at the time. Yet, Dali felt strongly that his works should not be considered confes sional in nature or be subjected to psychoanalysis.9 While admitting to his paintings' basis in libidinal urges and, more</page><page sequence="11">Dali: Double and Multiple Images 321 significantly, to their function as a form of vicarious self gratification, Dali kept insisting that their images, actively solicited by him out of his unconscious, are not uniquely his own. Rather, they are drawn out of a substratum in the unconscious which is common to all men and thus are uni versally applicable. The difference between himself and others, so Dali would have us believe, is that he has been endowed with the ability to perceive those psychic traits and find the most potent symbolic expression for them. Or, in any case, in a true paranoiac fashion, his conclusions cannot be contradicted or rejected by others once he has indicated them. This is indeed the case where his evolving theory of paranoia comes to his aid by upholding the active nature of the paranoiac process (as opposed to the passivity of dream narration or automatism): "Paranoia uses the external world in order to assert its obsessive idea, and has the dis turbing quality of making others accept the reality of this idea. The reality of the external world serves as an illustra tion and proof, and is made to serve the reality of our own mind."10 The double or multiple image would perform in this respect a dual function. It would serve as a visually conceived—and therefore more accessible—illustration of the paranoiac process. It also would furnish "proofs" of sorts—conceived in terms of a visual analogy—for some of Dali's insights. Thus Dali's perception of love as a form of self-annihilation, involuntarily expressed by the sleeping (hence dreaming) posture, should be conclusively proven by the consubstantiality of the woman's sleeping posture with the act of fellatio, with both incarnated in the lion-desire figure. To this might be added another ambition, briefly re ferred to before, which informs Dali's activities in a variety of ways. Following Surrealism's general orientation, Dali situates himself during the early 1930's at the crossroads where life and art meet. It is Surrealism's "moral position" (in reference to the title of another essay) to discredit real ity—considered by Dali as a "simple state of depression and inactivity of the mind"11—and find refuge in the "terre de trésors" of human desire. Dali's ambition is to raise doubts in other people's minds regarding the stability and veracity</page><page sequence="12">322 Haim Finkelstein of the images of the exterior world, and not exclusively on the visual plane, I should add, as his activities throughout the 1930's bear witness to. In this respect the double or multiple image might be considered as an activity which "tangibly makes the very world of delirium pa&amp;s to the level of reality."12 The last quotation is taken from a small book, La Conquête de l'irrationnel (1935) which, although written a few years later, expresses to a great extent the pictorial ambition associated with the 1930 multiple images. Dali's aim is to concretize the irrational to the greatest extent pos sible. The guiding principle is the belief that, "The world of imagination and the world of concrete irrationality may be as objectively evident, consistent, durable, as thickly persua sive, cognoscitive and communicable as the exterior world of phenomenal reality."13 This pictorial ambition is paral leled by a conception of the double and multiple images, as proposed before, in terms of unique objects undergoing a perceptual transformation. This conception requires that the diverse images be "contained" within one figuration. Any visual interaction with the surroundings (by utilizing, for instance, the optical phenomenon of figure-ground re versal) would detract from the concreteness and tangibility of the objects undergoing this transformation. The concept of the multiple image, thus perceived in terms of purpose, iconography and pictorial character, is fraught with questions regarding its practical application. Perhaps the most telling evidence for that is the fact that, notwithstanding the weight and extent of the theory asso ciated with the multiple image, the few versions of Invisible Sleeping Woman, Horse, Lion are the only examples Dali ever painted that conform to this early concept of it. The un avoidable anatomical deformations made apparent in our analysis of the constitent images exemplify the kind of tech nical difficulties the artist must solve somehow in order to fulfill the demand that the diverse images be perceived as unique objects undergoing a transformation. The problems are further exacerbated by the nature of the iconography utilized by Dali in these years. The strength of the 1929— 1930 paintings derives from their freshness as spontaneous expressions of his inner life. Dali is engaged with a limited set</page><page sequence="13">Dali: Double and Multiple Images 323 or "catalogue" of motifs—bearded father-figure, shameful youth, woman-jug, hermaphrodite, grasshopper, lion, the "butterfly chase" group, the Gradiva figure, etc.—which are obsessively repeated and interrelated one with the other in a variety of ways. The effect of these paintings has much to do with the gradual accumulation of meaning and associations which may be experienced within the confines of a single painting or in the overall context of Dali's work; the motifs thus attain often the weight and richness of personal sym bols. In terms of the multiple image concept, however, this limited "catalogue" of motifs has posed a problem, since not many of the motifs could be molded to serve as potential constituent elements of a multiple image. The paucity of motifs that are utilizable in such a fashion would have obliged Dali to grasp at any image to which the multiple figuration may give rise—the horse, for instance—regardless of its gratuitousness in relation to other elements comprising the image. While gratuitousness plays an important role in Dali's thought,14 it cannot be successfully sustained within the radically limited context of the multiple image in its 1930 version since it undermines the effectiveness of Dalii's motifs as carriers of psychological and affective content. The difference between the two groups of multiple im ages, perceived so far in terms of formal conception and technique, extends also into the iconographical domain. The gratuitousness imposed to a certain extent on the ear lier works becomes a dominant quality of the second group. A painting such as The Endless Engima (to choose the most representative work in this group) appears to present an involved puzzle employing forced and rather arbitrary im ages, its iconography revealing an opportunistic manipula tion of pre-existent and well-tried motifs. For example, the ubiquitous figure of the nurse seen from her back exhibits in paintings done a few years earlier (1934-35) a consistent thematic and affective value by incorporating a childhood memory and a vision of the blurring of boundaries between the animate and the inanimate. Very little of this remains in evidence in its later obsessive utilization, which derives solely from its potential as a form that can easily lend itself to the metamorphosis into a face by evoking the shape of</page><page sequence="14">324 Haim Finkelstein chin, nose and lips. Similarly, the dog seen in Apparition of Face and Fruit Dish on the Beach has an obvious antecedent in the 1936 painting The Man with the Head of Blue Hortensias (A. Reynolds Morse Collection) in which the image of a dog's head is suggested by the shape of a hill. While the earlier image may have emerged quite unintentionally, its later utilization appears premeditated and indicates that Dali has been quick to grasp its potential. Thus we may be justified in considering The Endless Enigma (and, by the same token, other paintings in the series) as nothing more than a tour de force of illusionism and visual trickery. Or, we may conclude that an iconographie investigation pursued along the lines adopted for the 1930 works is simply inap plicable to the 1938 paintings; and, further, that their pur pose and meaning rest on different grounds altogether. The years separating the two groups of multiple images certainly gave Dali time enough to revise his notions regard ing the concept of multiple figuration. It would also appear that Dali himself was well aware of the limitations inherent in his earlier version of the multiple image. After all, a few years were to pass before he even took up the less demand ing concept—which is altogether different in its theoretical implications—of the double image. To present a coherent picture of Dali's evolving notions regarding the double and the multiple image, we should recapitulate the sense and purpose, as Dali would see them, of his earlier 1930 concep tion. These notions, as we have seen, can be classified as follows: 1. The multiple image is a painted documentation of a paranoiac phenomenon of multiple figuration ex perienced by Dali in external reality or in the course of an elaboration of images already existing on the canvas. One of its primary aims is to raise doubts about the supposed reality of the objects of external reality. 2. The multiple image utilizes certain formal analo gies or equivalents in order to illustrate ideas or theorems based on insights attained in a paranoiac</page><page sequence="15">Dali: Double and Multiple Images 325 thought process; those are psychosexual in nature and aim at a total eroticizing of human experience. 3. The multiple image offers a symbolic representa tion of the paranoiac process. The first category partakes of the general orientation of the surrealist experimentation of the 1920's, in particular, which applies so-called scientific methods of documentation to diverse phenomena such as dreams, chance (or what will be termed later "objective chance") and other related con cerns. The paranoiac elaboration of images would appear to fall under this heading, too. Yet a strict adherence to Dali's formula as presented in "L'Âne pourri" would make this ambition a near impossibility from the technical point of view. Invisible Sleeping Woman, Horse, Lion appears to have been conceived on canvas rather than experienced in exter nal reality; and even this somewhat more manageable procedure results, as we have seen, in very forced and awk ward images. The only instance of a paranoiac experience documented by Dali at the time is found in a "Communica tion" published in the third issue of Le Surréalisme au service de la Révolution (December 1931). It contains the reproduc tion of a postcard photograph of a group of Africans sitting in front of a straw hut; turned sideways the picture is trans formed into a face. And Dali informs the reader that he was seized by this aspect of the photo in a period in which he was much obsessed by certain types of heads found in Pi casso's art. Breton, preoccupied just then with Sade, dis covered in it, according to Dali, a portrait of the Divine Marquis, powdered wig and all. This "visage paranoïaque," as Dali names it, would satisfy the formulations of "L'Âne pourri" but for the fact that one of its images does not present a distinct object but a combination of landscape elements and figures. On the other hand, if we consider the postcard itself as the distinct element undergoing transfor mation, the different "meanings" ascribed to it by Dali and Breton may serve to illustrate the indeterminate nature of the images of external reality. But, whatever the case might be, this "visage paranoïaque" appears to be an isolated case; there is no other "communication" of this nature, the image</page><page sequence="16">326 Haim Finkelstein itself being unique enough to have served Dali as a model for a painting entitled Visage paranoïaque (1935) which is nothing but a replica of the photograph. The painting launched Dali in the years 1935-1938 on a series of double images which can be read as landscapes strewn with human figures or horsemen and, alternately, as a human face or, at times, a partial human figure. These Anthropomorphic Landscapes, as I should refer to them,15 differ from Dali's earlier conception in certain ways. The earlier demand for a paranoiac succession of images, all exhibiting the same de gree of "probability of existence" and thus raising doubts about reality, is quite inapplicable to these images, which employ only two alternating figurations, none of them ap pearing as "probable" enough. In addition, instead of the visual permutation of fully conceived objects or figures, those images evince a coalescing of smaller figures into a larger whole. Thus the Anthropomorphic Landscapes, in spite of their occasional effectiveness as "trick" pictures, are a watered down version of the earlier conception, at least in terms of their ambition and theoretical implication. In the light of these observations, the Anthropomorphic Land scapes foreshadow many of the double images created by Dali in the following years. Yet, it should also be added, the "opening up" of the objects undergoing transformation to encompass the whole field of visible reality links these works, as I shall point out later, to the 1938 multiple images. Employing the multiple image along the lines proposed in our second category is an endeavor fraught with ques tions and pitfills. I need only reiterate what was argued earlier regarding the paucity of motifs that can be used to this end in accordance with Dali's formula. Indeed, in terms of Dali's limited repertory of motifs in the 1929-1930 paintings, this particular conception of the multiple image could hardly have been anything other than a single-paint ing phenomenon. However, in his endeavor to eroticize ex perience or, in other words, to apply the erotic metaphor to the external world, Dali in the early 1930's moved towards a more promising aesthetic of libidinal gratification based on a formal vocabulary related to infantile sexuality. In 1929</page><page sequence="17">Dali: Double and Multiple Images 327 1930 Dali discerns the concealed image of desire under the guise of excrement and putrefaction to which he relates the biomorphic character of Art Nouveau artchitecture and decoration. In 1932, scatology is supplanted by food as a metaphorical representation of erotic concerns. In both cases, though, the formal correlatives consist of sinuous curves and flowing lines which give rise to the "morphologi cal aesthetics of the soft and hard" expressed in soft forms, unnaturally elongated heads and limbs, and, in 1934-37, visions of decomposition.16 These forms largely supplant the erotic motifs populating his 1929-30 psychosexual paint ings and, consequently, render obsolete the utilization of these motifs as regards the multiple image. The third aim of the multiple image, defined as a sym bolic representation of the paranoiac process, is not a fore most consideration in 1930, yet it is intimately linked to the aesthetics of representation involved. The multiple image concept introduced in "L'Âne pourri" is based on the para noiac faculty of looking at one object and seeing another and yet another, and Dali emphasizes that the "various forms adopted by the object under consideration are uni versally open to control and recognition once the paranoiac has simply indicated them."17 "Indication" is indeed the key factor in the process of communicating the paranoiac meta morphosis. It is a dynamic process, its mechanics, as Breton points out, akin to Hamlet's interrogation of Polonius con cerning the shape of a cloud. The painted multiple image, being a static pictorial representation of a dynamic process, is already a form of symbolic representation—indeed a con ceptualization—of the paranoiac process. In the 1930 works, the "indication" in question is accomplished in a number of ways: visually, through the exaggerated rendi tion of individual traits; verbally, by using a fully descriptive title. One of the paintings (B) illustrates another manner of indication whereby the fourth image (not referred to in the title) is, as we have seen, also depicted separately from the main multiple figuration. One suspects that this has been dictated by the need to aid the beholder in his efforts to reconstruct the image. The repetition of this image, how ever, points to another purpose: a conceptualization of the</page><page sequence="18">328 Haim Finkelstein notion that Dali's "paranoiac will" repeatedly unravels this erotic image underneath the images of external reality. The recurrence of the lion's head at the edge of the painting also contributes to this effect of erotic cyclorama ("round and round it goes . . It is my contention that such a symbolic or conceptual representation of the paranoiac process is also an innate quality of the 1938 multiple images. To support this conten tion I shall introduce another series of paintings which may serve as a link between the two groups of multiple images. Created in the years 1935-37, the paintings may be placed under a generic heading of Morphological Echoes (to reit erate the title given to several works in the series). As the name indicates, the repetition of certain forms or, rather, the perception of formal analogies is the series main forma tive principle. Thus, for example, in Nostalgic Echo (1935, private collection), an entrance cut in a wall repeats the shape (seen through it) of a church tower with its triangular steeple (even to the extent that a circular hole found above the entrance is echoed by a ball balanced on top of the steeple). Similarly, a girl skipping rope is echoed by the shape of the bell with the curve of the arch seen above it on top of the church tower. The most complex work in the series is Suburbs of the Paranoiac-Critical Town: Afternoon on the Outskirts of European History (1936, Boymans-van Beunin gen Museum, Rotterdam) in which elements from Nostalgic Echo and other paintings are combined with another set of less obvious formal analogies. A study for the painting (Ed ward James Collection) brings out these hidden analogies by placing alongside one another images of a bunch of grapes, a horse seen from behind, a frontal view of a horse's skull and—as a form supposedly subsuming all others—a woman (Gala, Dali's wife) holding a bunch of grapes in her hand. The schematic distribution of all these diverse images in the painting becomes even more pronouncedly didactic in two paintings created in 1936, Morphological Echo (Morse Collec tion) and A Couple with Heads Full of Clouds (Boymans-van Beuningen Museum). In each painting are displayed three sets of forms; in each set a small object placed on a table top is similar in shape to a figure situated in mid-distance and</page><page sequence="19">Dali: Double and Multiple Images 329 to a landscape element seen from afar (for example, a gob let holding a spoon, the figure of a woman in a long dress, and a tilted tower). It should be noted that most of these paintings were created around the time Dali promulgated his definitive theoretical exposition of Paranoia-Criticism in La Conquête de l'irrationnel (Conquest of the Irrational, 1935). Defining paranoia as a "delirium of interpretative association involv ing a systematic structure," Dali sets out literally to conquer the irrational by engaging in a paranoiac-critical activity de fined as a "spontaneous method of irrational knowledge based on the interpretative critical association of delirium phenomena."18 In other words, the paranoiac delirium asso ciates different realities by exploring them irrationally, and forms a systematic structure which, in itself, is an interpre tation of these elements in the context of the new relation ships formed between them. The stress is on the "associa tions," "relationships" or "coherences" which, energized by the obsessive idea, inform the most diverse and apparently unrelated phenomena ("sensational material, scattered and narcissistic"). In his most extensive elaboration of a para noiac-critical theme, Le Mythe tragique de L'Angélus de Millet, Dali attempts to unravel the supposed hidden erotic dimen sion underlying a painting which apparently is far removed from such concerns—Millet's L'Angélus. This revelation is accomplished through a series of associations—pivoting on the two enigmatic figures of L'Angélus—effected by the "dis covery" of visual and verbal analogies (based on formal similarities and puns) and brought to light through the working of chance. I propose, then, that the schematic ar rangements of formal analogies, ranging all over visible reality, in Dali's series of Morphological Echoes may be per ceived as conceptualized representations of paranoiac-criti cal elaboration of a "systematic structure." The formally identical shapes in these paintings may then be viewed as symbolic expressions of, or allusions to, the obsessive recur rence of a motif—for instance, Gala's body in Suburbs of the Paranoiac-Critical Town—which formally subsumes all other elements present. This view gains credence in the light of Dali's associa</page><page sequence="20">330 Haim Finkelstein tion with Jacques Lacan, in whose work on paranoia (1932) Dali found an endorsement of his own ideas.19 Significantly, Dali's essay "Nouvelles considérations générales sur le mécanisme du phénomène paranoïaque du point de vue surréaliste" (intended as a prologue to his L Angélus work) appeared in the first issue (1933) of the surrealist-oriented magazine Minotaure, accompanied by an essay by Lacan en titled "Le Problème du style et la conception psychiatrique des formes paranoïaques de l'expérience." Referring to his earlier work, Lacan comments in this essay on the forms of symbolic expression typical of paranoia (particularly found in the paranoiac's poetic and plastic production), noting that We have characterized the symbols by a fundamental tendency which we have designated by the term "itera tive identification of the object": the delirium is found to be very rich in phantasms of cyclical repetition, ubiq uitous multiplications, endless periodic recurrences of the same events, doublings and triplings of the same persons and, occasionally, hallucinations of doubling of the subject's own self.20 It is worth noting that this description fits well Dali's own paintings of the years 1929-30 with their obsessive repeti tion of motifs and situations. That these paintings are richer in meaning pertaining to Dali's own psychic life than the Morphological Echoes is due to a general trend discernible in Dali's art during the mid 1930's. I won't go into this in detail; it will suffice to indicate that his artistic production is marked by a progressive attenuation of the sense of per sonal urgency and a shift towards a greater pictorial attrac tiveness and decorativeness with an eye to his buying public. It is only fitting, though, that Dali's attempts, few as they might be at the time, to systematize and codify his theory would dispose him to look to the theory itself in order to replenish his waning sources of inspiration. Thus we come back to The Endless Enigma and the other 1938 multiple images. Ingenious displays of visual trickery, they were meant, undoubtedly, to amaze and dazzle Dali's rich patrons. (The Endless Enigma was painted at the estate of</page><page sequence="21">Dali: Double and Multiple Images 331 Coco Chanel on the Côte d'Azur.) This incontrovertible facet of these works does not, however, exclude other considera tions. Thus their conceptual basis is made at once apparent by the table-top arrangement derived from the Morphologi cal Echoes. Yet on the "table" are placed not distinct objects but, as shown before, bits and pieces of spatial forms extend ing into the whole field of vision (a legacy of the opened-up vistas of his paintings after 1934-35 and, in particular, the Anthropomorphic Landscapes). This is indeed where these multiple images differ from the Morphological Echoes: whereas Suburbs of the Paranoiac-Critical Town, for instance, conceptualizes paranoiac processes by employing a selected group of distinct objects, The Endless Enigma represents para noia on an all-embracing universal scale. This conception appears very similar to Breton's vision of the "délire d'interprétation" in Les Vases communicants (1932): "One ends up admitting that, in fact, anything at all makes up an image [tout fait image] and that the least important object, one which has not been assigned any particular symbolic role, is capable of representing no matter what."21 Criticizing Dali elsewhere for his "determination to rarefy his paranoiac method still further [which] has reduced him to concocting entertain ments on the level of crossword puzzles,"22 Breton points, in fact, to what may have become by then a matter of some anxiety to Dali. The tools or mechanisms of his paranoiac critical activity—and not only on the visual plane—have be come so refined that it has been possible for him to draw a limitless number of "systematic structures" out of any given corner of so-called reality. And thus The Endless Enigma em bodies a question that holds a profound existential meaning for Dali. His paranoiac-critical activity implies a tentative or conditional belief in a reality which lies hidden behind all those simulacra comprising the so-called reality of our daily experiences. The Endless Engima represents a vision of this activity which denies this possibility: its gratuitous images do not hint at any irrational structure of meaning which may open up a window to this hidden reality. This evocation of an endless enigma hardly conforms to Dali's earlier optimistic vision of a conquest of the irrational, and it raises questions about the sense of pursuing this activity any further. Yet the</page><page sequence="22">332 Haim Finkelstein painting stops short of carrying the whole burden of this questioning. A cool and elegant performance, it belies any sense of existential anguish. In addition, Dali evades the ulti mate questions by offering instead, in a conceptualized "leap of faith," a vision of reality incarnate. Jutting into the paint ing at an angle from the right is the head (partly cut off by the frame) of Gala, Dali's erstwhile companion and wife. Her peculiar position implies that she takes no part in what hap pens on canvas; she is a reality in her own right, the sole reality for Dali who, otherwise, would have been completely lost in this forest of images. Gala played a unique role in Dali's art and life, offering him a hold on reality and curing him, as Dali maintains, of his madness. Without going into further detail, I would like to suggest that The Endless Enigma thus also symbolizes a transition in Dali's career from the rigor of a quasi-scientific discipline anchored in surrealist theory to a metaphysical system pivoting at times around a mythologized Gala figure serving as the deity presiding over his activities. Utilizing the multiple image technique for a conceptual ization of paranoiac-critical activity, The Endless Enigma is not the kind of performance that can easily be matched or, for that matter, which bears repeating. For different reasons which have to do mostly with technical and iconographie limitations, Invisible Sleeping Woman, Horse, Lion is a unique example of the phenomenon of multiple figuration in its utilization as a form of documentation and illustration of Dali's paranoia theory in its early phase. These two works thus exhibit, each in its own unique fashion, the most exten sive form of mutual dependence of theory and artistic prac tice within Dali's overall production of double and multiple images. While the double images may serve as examples of paranoiac phenomena—Dali would like us to believe that they have been created in the course of a paranoiac elabora tion of images and that they are the result of a paranoiac insight—they have little to do beyond that with the theory's full implication, and they stand or fall on their own artistic merits. Thus, The Metamorphosis of Narcissus (1937, Tate Gallery) is quite effective as a metamorphic image (although, strictly speaking, it is not a double image proper but a form</page><page sequence="23">Dali: Double and Multiple Images 333 of the Morphological Echoes) since its iconography is com mensurate with the metamorphosis it depicts. The figure of Narcissus, combined with its reflection in the water, is strik ingly echoed by the twin form of a hand holding an egg shaped bulb signifying the reborn Narcissus. The two images echoing and re-echoing one another in a continuous pendu lum movement strongly evoke the unique and deeply per sonal character of this metamorphosis (thus reinforcing the ideas presented in a poem bearing the same title that was meant by Dali to be read aloud as an accompaniment to the painting). In contrast, Swans Reflecting Elephants (1937), al though technically quite adept, too, in its utilization of the reflections of the swans and tree trunks to suggest the forms of elephants, is iconographically an empty exercise com pletely denuded of any affective or conceptual value. Simi larly, the well-known Slave Market with the Apparition of the Invisible Bust of Voltaire (1940, A. Reynolds Morse Collection) may be used by the psychologists of vision as an effective illustration of the phenomenon of figure-ground reversal, but it lacks altogether the theoretical and iconographie sig nificance of Invisible Sleeping Woman, Horse, Lion or even the conceptual implications of The Endless Enigma. What is true of Dali's art in general is particularly true of the double and multiple images. Dali's art at its best requires the tension created by the need to function within the ambiance of a full-fledged theoretical framework. Without this tension to sustain him, Dali is liable to indulge himself in facile fire works of technical dexterity and undisciplined imagination.

It is for this reason that Dali objected so vehemently to Georges Bataille's article devoted to The Lugubrious Game (published in Documents no 7, December 1929) in which the painting, subjected to a psychoanalytical examination, is purported to express Dalî's inferiority complex, feeling of sexual inadequacy and castration anxiety. 10.

Gratuitousness in itself is indispensable to Dali as a constructive element ot the paranoiac process, primarily because it is sheltered from any "psycho-sensorial contamination or influence" ("La Chèvre sanitaire," La Femme visible, p. 24) and thus it offers a way of defying psychoanalysis. In Dali's method, the gratuitous creates a relationship where such a relationship is not perceived consciously or even unconsciously. Finding confirmation for his ideas in Jacques Lacan's thesis De la Paranoia dans ses rapports avec la personnalité (1932), Dali argues against the notion that paranoia involves a directed thinking and commends Lacan for refuting certain prevalent views that see paranoia as an a posteriori systematiza tion. Far from being a passive element given to interpretation and intervention, asserts Dali, the paranoiac delirium constitutes in itself a form of interpretation ("Nouvelles considérations générales sur le mécanisme du phénomène para noïaque du point de vue surréaliste," Minotaure, no. 1 [1933], pp. 65-67; also Oui 2, pp. 11-12. See also Haim Finkelstein, "Dali's Paranoia-Criticism or The Exercise of Freedom," Twentieth Century Literature vol. 21, no. 1 [Feb. 1975], pp. 65, 67-68). In other words, one should not attempt to find sense in what is gratuitous but rather allow the gratuitous to form a new meaning. It might be argued that such a conception of paranoia works quite effectively—at least as far as Dali's unique needs are concerned—in the elaboration of his great para noiac-critical feats of interpretation such as the one devoted to Millet's painting L'Angélus. In this activity the gratuitous merges in an extensive system compris ing a myriad of elements—images, associations, verbal and visual puns, etc.—all "systematically" revealing a new and altogether irrational meaning for the painting. This will be treated further on in this essay.</page><page sequence="25">Dali: Double and Multiple Images 335 15.

To this we might add an earlier painting, L'Homme invisible (The Invisible Man), conceived in 1929 and executed mostly while Dali was working on Invisible Sleeping Woman, Horse, Lion. I should add, though, that unlike the Anthropomorphic Landscapes, this painting utilizes still life and architectural elements, too, and, probably, was not conceived in the beginning as a double image proper but rather as an attempt to articulate "invisibility."
