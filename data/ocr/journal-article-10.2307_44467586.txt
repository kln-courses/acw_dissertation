ABSTRACT This paper presents information on analytical procedures being developed to characterize a "baseline" vehicle fleet in frontal crashes. A newly developed analytical model is being implemented for this characterization. The Passenger/Driver Simulation model (PADS) can simulate unrestrained and restrained driver and passenger occupants in frontal crashes. The "baseline" characterization started with the selection of representative passenger car make/model groupings. Each grouping has similar structural and interior characteristics. The PADS model is being run in an automated mode simulating these vehicles in different frontal crash configurations. The output of the PADS runs includes measures of injury severity and the cause of the injury. The PADS output obtained in these automated runs will be compared to field accident data. Since the analytical procedures and tools are still being refined, this paper focuses on the methodology and its implementation rather than the results. THE OBJECTIVE OF THE FRONTAL CRASHWORTHINESS research and development effort at the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) is to assess the safety problem associated with occupants of passenger cars involved in frontal impacts and to identify potential remedies for the problem. The approach being implemented during the present conceptual phase of this effort focuses on the analytical characterization of the in-use vehicle fleet involved in frontal crashes. This analytical characterization will be used in identifying present injury mechanisms, identifying alternative countermeasures , and in testing the effectiveness of these countermeasures . In order to characterize the "baseline" in-use vehicle fleet, an analytical model which simulates vehicles and occupants in frontal collisions had to be selected, a set of vehicles that represents the "baseline" fleet had to be identified, the input data for the analytical model for each of the representative vehicles had to be obtained, and the frontal crash configurations to be simulated had to be determined. Figure 1 illustrates the work flow during this conceptual phase of the project. The analytical model being utilized to characterize the "baseline" fleet is the Passenger/Driver Simulation model (PADS). This is a newly developed model which is designed to simulate restrained and unrestrained occupants in frontal collisions. The input data for the model are being obtained from several data collection efforts. Twenty-seven vehicles have been selected as being representative of the "baseline" fleet. Data on the interior geometry and material properties (force/deflection characteristics) for each of the 27 vehicle make /models have either been collected or efforts are underway. Crash pulses for each of the 27 vehicles have been identified from the NHTSA vehicle data base. The NHTSA accident files are being utilized to 2.331 0096-736X/86/9402-0331 $02.50 Copyright 1986 Society of Automotive Engineers, Inc.</page><page sequence="2">COLLECT TEST ' CRASH &amp; ACODENT DATA DATA SLED TESTS ANALYSES 1 A A - - I CHARACTERIZE EVALUATE FLEET ASSESS FLEET POSTULATE BASELINE FLEET CHARACTERIZATION $ WOE HARM $ PERFORMANCE REDUCTION TEST PROCEDURES ? ?

The validity of this characterization will be tested by comparing the predicted occupant responses and injuries to the accident data and also crash and sled tests being conducted for a number of the 27 vehicles. After the validation of the "baseline" fleet characterization, fleet wide harm reduction can be estimated through the postulation of alternative mitigation concepts. This paper presents the analytical tools being utilized to characterize the "baseline" fleet, the input data collection efforts, initial efforts in characterizing the "baseline" fleet, and the status of the project. SELECTION OF "BASELINE" FLEET The original intent of this program was to select certain make/model passenger cars which represented a large proportion of cars on the highway at that time. Also, since the modeling results were to be compared to accident data, this fleet should be highly represented in the accident files, such as the National Crash Severity Study (NCSS), the National Accident Sampling System (NASS) and the Fatal Accident Reporting System (FARS). The model years selected were from 1975 to the present and this period of production was chosen to limit the number of different maxe/models for characterization but would yield a large enough sample size for statistical purposes. A list was compiled of all make/model groups produced between model years 1975 and 1981 (when this project began) and ordered by numbers of cars produced. Different make/model nameplates were placed into common groupings based on manufacturers designations (such as GM X-body,eto) and on MVMA specifications. For purposes of testing it was decided that about 30 specific make/model cars, representing 30 groups, could be included, within time and other constraints, for testing and gathering other measurements. In addition to highest production some make/models were included for other reasons such as the car was still in production or was included in other frontal protection programs. The list was then sent to the domestic manufacturers to verify that the groupings were valid and subsequently some minor shuffling of specific models was necessary. The final list was composed of 19 domestic and 4 foreign 1975- 1981 make/models representing about 60% of the production for U.S. sales in those years. Four additional 1983 make /models were selected which were part of another frontal protection program. The list of specific make /models and the groups represented are given in Table 1 . SELECTION AND DESCRIPTION OF THE MODEL Several computer models are currently available which are capable of simulating an occupant in a frontal collision. The criteria placed on selection of the model for this project were: 1) A model which could predict occupant and vehicle responses which were consistent with observations. 2) A detailed description of the steering assembly and instrument panel to link injury causation to specific design parameters of these components . 3) A model which did not require an excessive amount of input thereby increasing the number of cars (and statistical base) which could be characterized. Also since the input /output is tailored for numerous simulations it was necessary to modify the model for this purpose. This task would be extremely difficult with a complex model. The computer models considered were the MVMA 2-D, CVS and PADS models. The MVMA-2D and CVS models have been used extensively by researchers for several years. The PADS (PAssenger /Driver Simulation) is a recent development by MGA corporation which upgraded a previous model (SCORES: Steering Column and Occupant REsponse Simulation) developed by Fitzpatrick Engineering. Although MVMA 2-D and CVS have been shown to satisfy the first criterion, the current versions do not contain a detailed steering assembly description to satisfy the second criterion and it was felt that they were were too complex to satisfy the third. The PADS model satisfied these criteria, although the other two models probably offer superior simulation of the occupants kinematics. Comparisons of occupant kinematics and responses for PADS and MVMA-2D are continuing for determining the validity of the PADS model(a further description of PADS is contained in Reference 1*). * Numbers in parenthesis designate References at end of paper. 2.333</page><page sequence="4">The PADS model was selected as the occupant simulation model for this project. It has the capability to model unrestrained or restrained driver or passenger, although at present, the analytical effort focuses on the unrestrained occupant. PADS is a two dimensional model with a four mass (head/neck, torso, lower body and sternum) description of the occupant. The vehicle interior compartment is described by a detailed steering assembly and seven contact planes: seat back and bottom, lower, middle and upper instument panel, windshield and header (Figure 2). The model also has the capability of modeling intrusion of the steering assembly, toeboard and all contact planes except the seat back and bottom. Circles for pelvis , abdomen , chest , head and knee are used to determine when contact with a compartment surface has occurred. The allowed contacts are the head with header , windshield , upper instrument panel and/ or upper steering wheel rim, the chest contacts the steering wheel hub (driver) or mid instrument panel (passenger), the abdomen can contact the lower steering wheel rim or mid instrument panel and the knee contaots the lower instrument panel. Each contact plane is defined geometrically by its x,y coordinates, angle and length. Mechanical properties include force-deflection, loading and unloading, surface friction and damping. The geometric description of the steering assembly includes: x,y coordinates, column and wheel angles, column length, wheel radius, hub location relative to rim of steering wheel and location of shear capsule and EA unit (Figure 3). Mechanical properties include force deflection, damping and friction associated with the EA unit , column and wheel torque-rotation, normal and tangential force-deflection of the wheel for head, shoulder, abdomen and whole body loading, and hub force-deflection. A graphical representation of a typical PADS unrestrained driver simulation is shown in Figure 4. SIMULATION INPUT DATA FOR "BASELINE" CHARACTERIZATION DRIVER SIMULATION DATA- The main effort in developing input sets for the driver simulation involved collecting mechanical properties for the steering assembly. This consisted of three areas of testing: Dsteering column and 2)steering wheel tests conducted statically and 3)dynamic column tests. The Transportation Systems Center (TSC) conducted these test programs as a cooperative effort with the Army Test Center for the first 2 programs and through a contractual effort with Batelle Columbus Laboratories for the third. Statio wheel and column tests were conduoted on as many of the 27 vehicles as was possible. Two column tests were conduoted on the 24 model year '75- '81 cars: axial column collapse and column collapse while applying a "side" load to the oolumn. These two tests provided the EA force-deflection properties and the friction coefficient of the column. A typical static force-deflection curve is shown in Figure 5. Since it was beyond the scope of this project to conduct all the tests required for wheel force-deflections for PADS (see previous section for required tests) , 4 wheel rim tests and the hub test were conducted. The rim tests included the upper rim loaded normal (to the plane of the wheel) with a head form, lower rim loaded normal and radial (toward the center of the wheel plane) with an abdomen form and the entire wheel rim loaded normal with a flat plate (typical force-deflection properties derived from these tests are shown in Figures 6 thru 8). The hub was loaded with a flat plate. The other force-deflection properties were extrapolated from this test data. Dynamic column tests were conducted on the following vehicles: three tests on a Citation, two on a Fairmont, and three on a Aspen. The desired test speeds were 15 and 25 mph, however the actual speeds varied and were lower than the initial actuator velocity because of inertial forces. The final velocities achieved were 11.1, 16.7 and 17.5 mph for the Citation, 18.9 and 22.7 for the Fairmont and 15.7 and 21.9 for the Aspen. Since the intent of these tests was to derive the damping factor for column collapse, attaining exact speeds was not critical. The derived damping factors were then extrapolated to the other make /model columns based on EA unit similarity. Column and wheel torque-rotation properties and seat properties were extrapolated from tests on a Citation and Fairmont conducted in the SCORES validation program (Reference 2). In addition, steering assembly geometry and mass properties were measured during the TSC testing. 2.334</page><page sequence="5">850251 Fig. 2 - PADS Occupant and Compartment Representation ÀXrim £bF i¿'f ''TRAD X ' ^^FW V' xwh» Ywh Xwh' Ywh = Coordinates of Wheel Hub i SC = Length to Shear Capsule f BA = Length to Aft Bushing on EA Unit I BP = Length to Forward Bushing on EA Unit t pw s Length From Shear Capsule to Firewall OC = Column Angle Fig. 3 - PADS Steering Assembly Configuration '|y vif Fig. 4 - PADS Dynamic Simulation of the Unrestrained Driver 2.335</page><page sequence="6">Col liMn enery ¿»sorber force/stroke 4000.0 3500.0. a 3000.0. / p 2500.0. */ I 2000.0. / ji 1500.0- / 1000.0. ■ i ēļ 500.0. 1 0.0, O'0 i 1.0 A 2-0 , A 4-0 .A «'O A A i 1.0 A , 3.0 A .A 5.0 A 7.0 A Deflection Fig. 5 - Column Statio Force Deflection Riu tangential force/defl due to head 320.0 200. 0. jl 240.0.

These are discussed in the "Passenger Simulation Input" section. PASSENGER SIMULATION DATA-The PADS model requires input data sets for the mechanical properties of the instrument panel, windshield, and header. Instrument panel force- deflection data are required for four different contacts : 1. Driver: Knee to lower instrument panel 2. Passenger: Knee to lower instrument panel 3. Passenger: Chest /Abdomen to mid instrument panel 4. Passenger: Head to upper instrument panel MGA Research, under contract with the The Transportation Center, is developing test equipment and test procedures for acquiring this type of information. Dynamic and static force-deflection data for instrument panels have been collected for a number of the 27 vehicles and the data collection requirements for the remaining vehicles are presently under consideration. This project will also develop the friction and damping characteristics associated with the instrument panel. Figure 9 illustrates the areas of the instrument panel being loaded to obtain force-deflection data. The sequence of the tests include first loading the lower instrument panel with a knee form, the mid instrument panel is then loaded with a chest form while the knee form is kept in place, and then the upper instrument panel is loaded with a head form. Windshield force-deflection data are required for head contacts into the windshield for the PADS model . MGA Research is collecting data on windshield characteristics. The impacts are being conducted by securing a Part 572 head form to a ram and then propelling the ram into the windshield in a horizontal manner. Static and dynamic tests on several vehicles have been conducted, and the requirements and procedures for collecting additional data are currently being examined. In addition to collecting these data for several of the 27 vehicles, MGA Research is also performing parametric tests on one windshield to observe the effects of contact velocity, edge effects, angle of impact, friction of windshield, etc. Header force-deflection data are required for head contacts into the header. The force-deflection data for headers in a number of current vehicles were obtained as one part of a study completed at the Vehicle Research and Test Center, NHTSA . The data were collected for impacts at 15 MPH for the following vehicles - Rabbit , Phoenix , Civic , Mustang , Malibu, Granada, and Horizon. The impacts were conducted by propelling a rigid headform into the structure. These data are currently being used in the PADS model as representative of the header found in the 27 vehicles being simulated. COMPARTMENT GEOMETRIC DATA- Most of the dimensions needed to describe the compartment geometry were obtained from another TSC Program (Reference 3) which compiled all MVMA specifications for recent year passenger cars. A few additional measurements were needed such as the x,y coordinates of the steering wheel pivot point and the lower instrument panel geometry. OCCUPANT ANTHROPOMETRY AND MECHANICAL PROPERTIES- Occupant descriptors for the PADS model were compiled for the 5th percentile female, 50th percentile and 95th percentile males. Rather than using dummy properties, whenever possible human properties were used since the ultimate goal is to compare the simulation results to accident data and to predict numbers of injuries and fatalities as a result of various safety improvements. All anthropometry data came from NHTSA 's "Advanced Dummy Program" (Reference 4) which developed detailed measurements for 5th percentile female and 50th and 95th percentile males based on human measurements. Since the occupant model in PADS is greatly simplified from a human, it took some subjective judgement to fit the model to the real data. Mechanical properties of the occupant required as input include force- deflection of the head, chest and abdomen, damping for the head and chest, and neck torque-rotation. The head parameters are those used to predict the Mean Strain Criteria (MSC) (Reference 5). The chest model is the same as proposed by Lobdell , et . al . , including the spring representing the superficial tissue (Reference 6) . Abdomen properties were selected 2.338</page><page sequence="9">850251 somewhat subjectively but were based on test data from cadavers, primates and properties of the Hybrid III dummy. In the absence of humanlike properties, the head force-deflection and neck torque displacement were based on Hybrid III properties from the SCORES validation program. STRUCTURAL INPUT DATA - Crash testing of the twenty seven "baseline" vehicles has been conducted over the past seven years as part of on-going programs at NHTSA . Test data have been stored in the NHTSA data base system. Twenty five of these tests were conducted at 35 mph, one at 30 mph and one at 40 mph (test data at 35 mph were not available for these two tests) . Crash input data collected for the analysis included occupant compartment crash pulse (acceleration-time), force measured at the barrier interface (from a 36 segment load cell barrier) and film analysis. These data were carefully screened and when necessary, the digital data were conditioned to ensure consistency between film data, force data and acceleration data. Conditioning of the data consisted of time shifting, bias correcting and amplitude correcting. Corrections of the data were based on a subjective as well as an objective approach. Subjectively the crash pulses were screened to eliminate data containing "glitches" believed to be an anomally. Next, compartment acceleration derived velocity and displacement data were compared to film analysis derived data. Operating on what was judged as the best pulse, corrections were then made to satisfy all parameters for the crash pulse and load data. For intrusion, film analysis was used as the only available means of determining instrument panel and steering assembly motions. In future NHTSA RßfD testing, instrumentation is being added to monitor intrusion, however results were not available for these analyses. Some preliminary data were used to validate film analysis on several of the vehicles. PADS AUTOMATED RUNS FOR "BASELINE" FLEET PADS CONTROL FILE GENERATOR- The analytical simulation of the "baseline" fleet requires the construction of numerous input files for PADS to simulate the accident environment. For each car group, input sets were required for combinations of the following parameters: Velocity: 10,15,20,25,30,35 MPH Occupant Size: 5th, 50th, 95th Occupant Age : 30 , 60 years Damage Location: Distributed, Left , Right , Center Object Contacted: Vehicle or tree/pole Partner Stiffness: Stiff, Medium, Soft Seat Location: Aft, Center, Forward While not all combinations of these parameters are required (ie: vehicle- to-vehicle center impacts, partner stiffness combinations for tree/pole contacts, etc.), it still requires approximately 1400 runs for each car group simulated and 37,600 runs (27 times 1400) for the "baseline" simulation. Creation of the input files and submitting the files for simulation would in itself be an enormous task, therefore a method was needed to reduce this effort. An automated procedure for performing this effort has been developed and is discussed below. The implementation of the automated PADS runs has recently been initiated and has begun with a limited scope. The initial simulations were for the driver, three occupant sizes (assuming the 5th percentile was seated forward and so on), a single age, three location/object contact categories (distributed/vehicle , left offset /vehicle, left offset/ tree-pole) and one value for stiffness which reduced the simulations to 54 for each car group. Intrusion effects were also not considered in these initial runs. However the future "baseline" fleet representation will attempt to use the full range of variations. The PADS control file generatori PCFG) was developed by TSC to automate the procedure for creating input files and submitting them. The approach developed was based on storing subfiles of the car characteristics, assembling the subfiles into the complete input set and inserting the completed input files into a "run stream" which can then be submitted for computer simulation. In addition the PCFG provides the user with the capability to mix different subfiles, modify portions or complete tables and/or single valued variables. This 2.339</page><page sequence="10">capability is very useful for investigating potential safety improvements. The car characteristics are. stored in the subfiles of: - Compartment File; this includes all geometry except specific wheel and column dimensions and all mechanical properties of contact planes. - Column File; all steering column characteristics . - Wheel File; all steering wheel characteristics . - Occupant File; all dimensions and properties of the occupant . - Occupant Initial Position File - Restraint System File; all seat belt properties and geometry. - Intrusion File; position-time points for intruding contact planes and steering assembly (see next section for a further discussion). - Program Control File; integration and print steps, etc. - Crash Pulse File; crash pulse data for all vehicles, velocities, and crash conditions (see next section). The PCFG is an interactive program that prompts the user for the subfiles to be assembled. Multiple input sets are created automatically when the user specifies more than one, or all, of any of the subfiles. A completed run of PCFG results in a runstream containing all combinations of subfiles, tables and/or individual variables entered by the user. Therefore it would be possible to construct all files for the "baseline" fleet simulation in a single PCFG run. The user then simply submits the single run stream which was created for computer simulation using PADS. CRASH PULSE /INTRUSION GENERATOR - Crash data matching that of the accident environment were necessary to effectively compare the PADS output with accident data. Crash conditions representing highest harm were identified from accident data and were used for this purpose. These conditions were car to car full frontal, car to car offset frontal, car to object distributed damage, and car to pole center and left side damage. Representative velocity conditions were chosen as 10-35 mph BEV (barrier equivalent velocity). The crashmode generator was developed based on a very simple linear scaling algorithm to facilitate the rapid generation of 7 crash pulses for each velocity and each car. (As discussed in the previous section, the initial runs were performed using only 3 crash pulses for each velocity). Sinoe there are 27 cars and 6 velocities a total of 1134 crash pulses are generated for the baseline condition for processing through PADS, hence simplicity was chosen in lieu of more complex modeling techniques. The crashmode scaling consisted of amplitude and time scaling by an empirically derived factor dependent on the crash configuration. The scaling factor for offset collisions is .80 The factor for pole type collisions is .60 . Additional scaling was applied according to the ratio of collision partner stiffness to subject car stiffness. The collision partner stiffness was expressed as the mean of the group peak force while subject vehicle stiffness was expressed as the actual peak force. Peak force was separated into 3 categories ranging in value from 75000 pounds to 150000 pounds. Intrusion data are derived from film analysis as a function of displacement and therefore is automatically scaled for most impact conditions. However when cars of non- equal stiffness collide their sharing of energy or crush is also unequal. Therefore additional scaling of the intrusion input parameters was necessary. The velocity scaling aproach is also relatively simple. A one mass model was generated to calculate loading, unloading and damping coefficients. The two scaling routines were combined with velocity scaling followed by crashmode scaling. A preprocessor was developed which was linked directly to the control file generator for PADS. Some examples of velocity and crash mode scaling are shown in Figures 10 and 11. Comparisons of two velocity scaled crash pulses to independently derived test data are shown in Figures 12 and 13. PADS OUTPUT FILES- As discussed in the section on the PADS control file generator, the analytical simulation of the "baseline" fleet requires the construction of numerous input files. Even for the initial simulations that are being run for the driver (three occupant sizes, six delta v ranges, three object struck/damage location categories, a single age category, no intrusion, and one value of stiffness), fifty four simulations are needed for each car group. Performing the 54 simulations for each of the 27 vehicles representing the "baseline" fleet results in 1458 output files. 2.340</page><page sequence="11">850251 16.0 r 12.0 - on7 X FULL FRONTAL A - C " A HALF OFFSET C E I □ POLE E 40 - R A - ^ 0 OO I / J 1 s -4.0 - i / / -6.0 - ' / / -t2X) I i i i i I i i i iti i i i 1 i i i i I i i i i 1 i i i i I i i i i 00 400 800 120.0 160.0 200.0 240.0 280.0 TWE (MUJSECONDS) Fig. 10 - 15 MPH Scaled Crash Pulses 80 p 40 - E -40 4 T ? -"r' // . - ļ // X SCALED DATA ? - '' // A TEST DATA S -120 - V J -mo - ' / y' / -200' 1111 F"| i i I Vi I I I I I I I i I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I 00 40.0 800 120.0 160.0 200.0 2400 280.0 TIC (MLUSECOMDS) Fig. 12 - Celebrity Scaled vs. Test Da*ta- «120 8.0 - I X FULL FRONTAL I &amp; HALF OFFSET A 4-°" D POLE C ~ E 0.0 -h -+- ^ ■* £ S ¡1 s -8.0 - ' ' y °~j -12.0 - '&gt;c _^g Q I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I 00 400 80.0 1200 «0.0 2000 24O0 280.0 TWE (MUJSECONDS) Fig. 11-25 MPH Scaled Crash Pulses 24.0 1 «.0 - X SCALED DATA - A TEST DATA Ž 80 7 E - / E 0.0 / / u* Ù, - - R &gt;r / / T &gt;r ' / S -«A j G - ' I S -«.o - ' i -24.0- ' / J -32.0 1 i i I i I i I i I 1 i i i i 1 i i i I 1 i i i i 1 i i i i 1 i I i i 0.0 40.0 80.0 120.0 «0.0 200.0 240.0 280.0 TWE (MLLJSECOfOS) Fig. 13 - Subaru Scaled vs. Test Data 2.341</page><page sequence="12">The output options that were originally included in PADS consisted of detailed and summary outputs. Even the summary output format , however , would have been difficult to utilize in analyzing 1458 simulations. Thus, a new output option was created for PADS that consisted of outputting one "line" of data for each simulation. The "line" of output data consists of sixty seven variables and includes information regarding the description of the simulation, selected simulation outputs, and run diagnostics. Descriptive data consist of the vehicle make/model, the occupant size, seating position, restraint use, impact velocity, object struck, etc. Output data include items related to the occupants impact with the interior surfaoes of the vehicle. For example, head and other body region data are output for any interior surfaces contacted including impact velocity, acceleration levels, force levels, and predicted injury based on alternative injury criteria. Diagnostic information indicates the status of the run, any errors that caused a simulation to terminate, and the time the run terminated. This "line" of output is produced for each run and a file is created for each vehicle grouping. The vehicle groupings can be combined to create an overall file representing the "baseline" fleet. In order to perform analyses on this file, the file was converted to a Statistical Analysis System (SAS) format . By using SAS a number of tabular and graphical displays can be efficiently produced. Examples of these analyses are presented in a latter section. ANALYSIS OF ACCIDENT AND SIMULATION DATA FOR "BASELINE" FLEET "BASELINE" FLEET ACCIDENT DATA- As indicated previously, the vehicles selected to represent the "baseline" fleet were chosen primarily on the basis of sales volumes. Analyses are underway comparing the NHTSA ' s complete accident files including NCSS (National Crash Severity Study), NASS (National Accident Sampling System), and FARS (Fatal Accident Resport ing System) with sub-files consisting of the accidents involving the vehicles in the 27 vehicle groupings. The "27 Vehicle" accident file is being compared to the complete files for crash, occupant, and vehicle factors and also as to injury consequences. This comparison will insure that the vehicles selected represent the accident experience . Presently the "27 Vehicle" accident file consists only of data collected within the NASS investigations. It is planned to expand this file to also include NCSS data. Figure 14 presents a comparison of the probability of receiving an AIS 3 or greater injury for the "27 Vehicle", NASS, and NCSS files. There is good agreement between the "27 Vehicle" and NASS files, whereas the NCSS file indicates a higher probability of injury. Since the "27 Vehicle" file is a sub-file of the NASS file better agreement between these files can be expected. Tables 2 through 5 compare the three files for body region injured and source of injury for drivers and passengers. These tables were constructed for injuries of AIS 3 or greater. The distributions are based on a count of injuries and not occupants (ie: one occupant could have received more than one injury at an AIS 3 or greater level). The distributions are fairly similar and, thus, indicate good agreement between the files. Differences in distributions are being analyzed to identify the reasons. Especially for the passenger, differences could be due to the small sample size for the "27 Vehicle" file. Eventually, it is proposed to compare the simulated data from PADS to these files. For the sources of injuries, this comparison must consider: 1. PADS is limited to simulating contacts only with frontal surfaoes and cannot consider contacts with A-pillars, side interiors, etc. 2. There are a large number of unknown contact sources in the accident data which need to be distributed. 3. For the PADS simulations, multiple contact sources are indicated for each body region impact. Thus, if the head contacts the header and windshield, the PADS simulation will indicate both sources as á possible injury source. Whereas for the accident data, only one contact source per injury is coded. Analyses of other factors related to crash configuration (delta v , object struck, etc.), and occupant factors (size, weight) are continuing. 2.342</page><page sequence="13">850251 * »VW MSS NCSS Fig. 14 - Probability of Receiving an AIS Injury of 3 or Greater Table 2 - Distribution of Body Regions Injured (AIS 3+) for Driver BODY REGION 27 VEHICLE NASS NCSS Chest I 22% I 27% I 31% I Head i 7 i 13 I 81 Lover Extremities i 30 i 22 i 20 i Upper Extremities i 5 I 6 i 6 i Abdomen I 14 I 14 I 17 I Table 3 - Distribution of Body Regions Injured (AIS 3+) for Passenger BODY REGION 27 VEHICLE NASS NCSS Chest i 13% I 15% I 26% I Head I 14 I 12 I 91 Lover Extremities i 11 i 26 i 24 i Upper Extremities i 23 i 15 i 11 i Abdomen I 17, i 10 i 9 i Table 4 - Distribution of Injury Sources (AIS 3+) for Drivers INJURY SOURCE 27 VEHICLE NASS NCSS Steering Assembly i 42% i 44% i 54 i Windshield i 9 i 5 i 4 i Instrument Panel i 22 i 18 i 18 i A-Pillar i Ri 2i 21 Header i 1 i 2 i 2 i Unknovn l 9 l 15 I 6 l Table 5 - Distribution of Injury Sources (AIS 3+) for Passengers INJURY SOURCE 27 VEHICLE NASS NCSS Steering Assembly i 0% i 0% i 3% i Windshield i 15 i 11 t 6 i Instrument Panel i 48 i 41 i 52 i A-Pillar i 6i 5i 21 Header i 0 i 1 i 2 i 2.343</page><page sequence="14">EXPANSION FACTORS FOR SIMULATED DATA TO REFLECT ACCIDENT ENVIRONMENT- As mentioned above, the PADS simulations will be run for several different vehicles under a wide range of crash severities and configurations. In order to transform the resulting series of simulations into a file that is representative of the accident experience, weighting factors must be assigned to each simulation based on the frequency of that event occurring in the accident environment. By using the NASS file, weighting factors are being developed for the frequency of occurrence for each simulated configuration. The overall weighting factor is obtained by considering the distributions of the 27 vehicles, the occupant sizes, the object struck, the location of damage, and the delta v. INITIAL RESULTS OF PADS AUTOMATED SIMULATION PROCEDURE- The PADS model and the automated mode framework are still in the process of being refined and updated. Better results should be obtainable after the inclusion of characteristics such as interior surface intrusion and better information on damping characteristics. A more complete algorithm to represent crash pulses for the different configurations is being developed. The interior geometry of the vehicles and occupant positioning are being reviewed to insure proper representation. Thus, the results presented below should only be considered as illustrative of the automated process and should not be taken as realistic values. Ten of the 27 vehicles have been run at this time. For these vehicles, any runs that produced unacceptable diagnostic messages were deleted. There were 504 (of a possible 540) successful simulations. The simulations are for different driver sizes (5, 50, and 95) for different configurations, etc. The following paragraphs present several analyses of these simulations. Table 6 presents contact information for the head for different size occupants. From an overall perspective, the contact distribution appears reasonable, and provides one indication that the relative motions of different size occupants is being properly simulated. For the 5th percentile size the primary contact is the windshield, for the 50th percentile the primary contacts are the windshield, header, and the steering assembly. For the 95th percentile size, the primary contacts are for the header and windshield. As discussed previously, head contacts are only allowed with the header, windshield, upper instrument panel, and upper wheel rim. In many cases the 5th percentile occupant tends to submarine, causing the head to drop below the upper wheel rim and therefore no contact is indicated. This explains the absence of head contact to steering assembly for the 5th percentile occupant in Table 6. If head injury from sources below the level of the upper wheel rim (or upper instrument panel for the passenger) is shown from accident data to be a significant problem than it will be necessary to include other contacts in the model. The remaining tables present data related to accelerations and forces seen by different body regions. Again, these results are presented only as illustrative. The results presented are for the distributed impacts for which the intrusion problem appears to be less of a concern and which was not considered in these initial runs. Table 7 compares head acceleration to delta v and Table 8 compares chest acceleration with delta v. In general as the delta v increases, head and chest acceleration increase. The cases showing low accelerations at high delta v's and those showing high accelerations at low delta v's are being examined. ,The distribution of femur loads and delta v are shown in Table 9. The accident data indicate a high frequency of intrusion for the toe board and the eventual inclusion of intrusion may have a large effect on these values. Alternative injury criteria for the different body regions are presently being reviewed and developed to transfer the mechanical readings obtained from PADS to injury severity levels. After the automated runs are successfully completed, and the individual runs weighted, and the injury criteria applied, direct comparison between the "baseline" simulation and the accident data can be accomplished. These comparisons can be accomplished at an aggregate total file level comparing the probabilities of receiving serious injuries to different body regions, the frequency of injury at different delta v levels, 2.344</page><page sequence="15">850251 OCCUPANT SIZE IN PERCENT HEAD CONTACT 5TH 50TH 95TH Header i 1 % i 4 % I 15 % I Windshield I 62 I 33 I 24 l Header &amp; Windshield i 6 i 41 i 39 i Steering &amp; Windshield i 0 i 18 i 14 i Windshield &amp; Instrument Panel i 0 i 1 I 3 i Combination of Above i 0 i 0 i 4 i No Contact I 32 I 2 I 21 Table 6 - Distribution of Head Contacts (All Severity Levels) for Different Size Oocupants As Predioted by PADS DELTA V HEAD ACCELERATION 11-20 21-30 31-40 41-45 TOTAL 0-10 I II 01 01 01 II 11-20 I 61 41 21 0 I 12 I 21-30 4 11 I 9 1 7 1 2 I 29 I 31-40 I 91 71 21 0 I 16 I 41-50 I 2 I 11 I 10 I 0 I 23 I 51-60 I 01 41 61 0 I 12 I 61-70 I II Ol 51 Ol 61 71-80 I II 21 21 Ol 51 81-90 I 41 II 21 Ol 71 91-100 I 12 I 21 II 0 I 15 I 101-110 I 71 21 21 0 I 11 I 111-120 I 41 21 II Ol 71 OVER 120 I 21 21 21 Ol 6 l TOTAL I 60 I 46 I 44 I 2 I 152 I Table 7 - Distribution of Head Acceleration by Delta v for all Size Oooupants (Distributed Vehiole Damage) DELTA V CHEST ACCELERATION 11-20 21-30 31-40 41-45 TOTAL 0-10 I 15 I Ol Ol 0 I 15 I 11-20 I 37 I 5 1 Ol 0 I 42 I 21-30 I 5 I 29 I 13 I 2 I 49 I 31-40 I Ol 6l 71 0 I 13 I 41-50 I 11 21 9i 0 I 12 I 51-60 I Ol II 81 Ol 91 61-70 I 11 li 51 01 71 71-80 I II 01 21 01 31 OVER 80 I Ol 21 Ol Ol 21 TOTAL I 60 I 46 I 44 i 2 1 152 I Table 8 - Distribution of Chest Acceleration by Delta v for all Size Oooupants (Distributed Vehiole Damage) 2.345</page><page sequence="16">DELTA V FEMUR FORCE 11-20 21-30 31-40 41-45 TOTAL 0-500 I 46 I 21 I 51 1 I 73 I 501-1000 I 81 9 I 14 I 0 I 31 I 1001-1500 I 21 51 41 0 I 11 I 1501-2000 I Ol 71 81 0 I 15 I 2001-2500 I Ol 2 i 13 I 1 I 16 I 2501-3000 I 41 Ol Ol Ol 41 3001-3500 I Ol li Ol Ol li 3501-4000 I Ol II Ol Ol Ii TOTAL I 60 I 46 i 44 I 2 l 152 l Table 9 - Distribution of Femur Foroe by Delta v for all Slze Occupants (Distributed Vehiole Damage) DELTA V CHEST ACCELERATION 11-20 21-30 31-40 TOTAL 0-10 I 41 Ol Ol 41 11-20 I 11 I 0 1 0 I 11 I 21-30 I 31 91 4 I 16 I 31-40 I 01 31 II 41 41-50 I II 21 3l 61 51-60 I Ol 01 31 31 61-70 I Ol Ol 41 41 71-80 I II 01 21 31 OVER 80 I 0 I 1 I 0 i 1 I TOTAL I 20 i 15 I 17 I 52 l Table 10 - Distribution of Cbest Aooeleration by Delta v for 50th Oooupant (Distributed Vehiole Damage) DELTA V HEAD ACCELERATION 11-20 21-30 31-40 TOTAL 0-10 i Ii Ol Ol ll 11-20 i 2l ll 1 i 41 21-30 i ll 51 21 81 31-40 i 31 31 Ol 6l 41-50 I ll 31 41 81 51-60 i Ol Ol Ol Ol 61-70 I 0 I 0 i 5 i 5 I 71-80 i Ol ll 1 I 21 81-90 i 3i Ol Ol 3i 91-100 i ll Ol li 2l 101-110 i 5 i Ol 21 71 111-120 i 21 1 i Ol 31 Over 120 i li li li 3 i TOTAL I 20 I 15 I 17 I 52 I Table 11 - Distribution of Head Aooeleration by Delta v for 50th Oooupant (Distributed Vehiole Damage) 2.346</page><page sequence="17">850251 the distribution of body region/contact source combinations for serious injuries, etc. The comparisons can also be accomplished using different filters such as only examining vehicle-to- vehicle impacts, 50th percentile occupant sizes, etc.. As mentioned in the introduction of this paper, validation of the PADS model is continuing and will be compared not only against accident data but also against crash and sled results. Preliminary data are available from the frontal crash test series. This crash test series is being conducted using unrestrained dummies. For the first six tests that were conducted, the head accelerations for the driver dummy ranged from 66 to 143 g's and for the chest it ranged from 41 to 72 g's. The tests consisted of passenger car to fixed rigid barriers and car to car impacts. The delta v's are in the range of 33 MPH. Comparing this with the simulation results presented in the tables, in the 31 to 40 MPH delta v category, approximately 50% of the cases have chest accelerations and 30% have head accelerations similar to those seen in the crash tests. Since the crash tests were performed using 50th percentile dummies, PADS simulations were analyzed using filters for distributed damage and 50th percentile occupants. The results for chest and head accelerations are presented in Tables 10 and 11. Approximately 70% of the cases have chest accelerations and 50% have head accelerations similar to those seen in the crash tests. It is planned to continue to validate the PADS simulations using the results of the crash and sled tests. DISCUSSION AND SUMMARY This paper has discussed the efforts involved in implementing an analytical procedure to simulate the frontal crash environment . This effort includes the development and refinement of the Passenger /Driver Simulation model, the identification of specific make/model vehicles that are representative of the in-use vehicle fleet, and the collection of extensive input data for the representative vehicle groupings. The implementation of the automated simulations has been initiated and the feasibility and efficiency of the procedure and the initial simulation results are encouraging. Work is presently underway to understand anomalies in the results, to further refine the automated runs to include other factors such as intrusion, and to include the right, front seat passenger. Data collection efforts are still continuing and primarily focus on obtaining additional properties of instrument panels and windshields. Additional supporting projects include a crash test and sled test program. These programs will be useful in helping to validate the adequacy of PADS in simulating the crash environment and also in obtaining additional data on parameters affecting crash pulse and intrusion. Remaining work in this initial phase of the frontal crashworthiness program includes the completion of the automated PADS simulation runs for drivers and passengers in the representative crash severities and configurations. These runs will be compared and evaluated against the field accident data files. Comparisons will include the body regions being seriously injured, the sources of these injuries, and the crash severities and configurations associated with serious injuries.
