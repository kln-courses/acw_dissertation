SUMNER SCRIPPS INSTITUTION OF OCEANOGRAPHY, LA JOLLA, CALIFORNIA Communicated August 25, 1934 Those who have taken part in the interminable controversy regarding the protective value of animal coloration have seldom concerned them- selves with the phenomena of color change, displayed so strikingly by the lower vertebrates and some other groups. Yet here, one would expect, the most important evidence on the subject should be found. It is hardly conceivable that there should have been evolved such a widely distributed and highly complex mechanism, involving sensory, neural and effector ele- ments, unless it were in some way vitally important to the animals in ques- tion. And so far as fishes at least are concerned, only one interpretation of this function has been proposed which seems to have the least plausi- bility. This is the obvious one that we have to do with an adaptation for concealment, either from enemies or from prospective prey. The only other type of explanation, so far as I know, which has been applied to the chromatic function in animals appeals to possible advantages derived from the absorption or reflection by the body surface of radiant energy, particu- larly that of the infra-red region. This hypothesis was proposed years ago by Max Weber, in relation to certain amphibia, and indeed it may have a limited application to some of the land-living vertebrates. But as ap- plied to aquatic animals, particularly such as remain perpetually sub- merged, it would seem to be inconsistent with the most elementary data of physics. Moreover, it would not explain those changes-the most familiar ones of all-which bring the organism into harmony with its back- ground. And least of all would it explain changes in the distribution of light and shade in the skin of some of the flatfishes-in the animals' pig- ment pattern-which is now known to be surprisingly responsive, at times, to the texture of the sand or gravel on which they lie, or to artificial pat- terns on the bottoms of the aquaria. However, no argument for the efficacy of "protective coloration," fixed or changeable, is likely to be convincing so long as we merely rest our case on the assertion that no other explanation is possible. The author has planned for years to undertake an experimental study of this question, but only recently has he had the opportunity to carry out such experiments. The general procedure to be followed seems so obvious that the wonder is that no such experiments have been conducted in the past. Fishes, well- adjusted and ill-adjusted to a particular background, are placed in equal numbers in tanks of the shade in question and exposed to the attacks of</page><page sequence="2">560 ZOOLOGY: F. B. SUMNER PROC. N. A. S. fish-eating birds. The proportionate numbers of individuals of the two shades which are eaten in a given time are recorded. Not only does the procedure for such an experiment seem to be obvious, but the outcome might appear to be predictable with complete confidence. However, with Fuchs,l Verne2 and others denouncing the entire protective coloration idea as "finalistic," "teleological," "anthropomorphic," etc., and with McAtee asserting a wholly non-selective choice of food-animals by birds,3 it is plain that one can no longer base one's arguments on in- herent probability alone. Detailed evidence seems to be called for. The following pages record the results of my first series of experiments in this field. My entire program is by no means completed. Arrange- ments have been made for employing other birds, probably waders, and perhaps predators belonging to other classes of vertebrates. Since, how- ever, the work cannot be resumed for another month or two, and since the first series of experiments, conducted with penguins, have yielded alto- gether decisive results, it seems worth while to report my observations to date. It gives me great pleasure to acknowledge here the assistance of members of the staff of the San Diego Zoological Gardens, and in particular of the director, Mrs. Belle J. Benchley, without which these studies would have been altogether impossible. It has been my privilege to carry out this entire work at our San Diego "Zoo," and to use birds from its collections for the purposes of my experiments. My acknowledgment is also due to Superintendent Alvin Scale and Mr. W. R. Martin of the Steinhart Aquarium, San Francisco, for providing the considerable number of Gambusia here employed. In preparation for the experiments, "mosquito-fishes" (Gambusia patruelis (Baird and Girard)) were placed in large numbers in two cement tanks, painted black and white, respectively. They were kept in these tanks for from seven to eight weeks before being withdrawn for use. As is well known, many fishes undergo rather rapid changes of shade when transferred from a light to a dark background or the reverse. It is now known that in addition to these prompt changes of shade or color, due to the shifting of the pigment within the chromatophores, more radical changes occur, resulting from an actual increase or loss of pigment or of entire chromatophores. Thus, fishes kept for long periods upon black, white or other back- grounds, reach degrees of pigmentation which are not promptly modified when the animals are transferred to new and different backgrounds. A fish which has been long habituated to black pales considerably within a few minutes, it is true, when it is transferred to white, but it remains for hours, sometimes for days, distinguishable from a fish which has been kept for a long time on white. The converse is true of a fish which is transferred to black after a long sojourn upon white.</page><page sequence="3">VOL. 20, 1934 ZOOLOGY: F. B. SUMNER 561 The "black" fishes used in the present experiments, when freshly taken from the black aquarium, were nearly dead black upon the dorsal and dorso-lateral surfaces. The "white" fishes, on the other hand, appeared pale buff or gray, rather than white, when viewed against a white back- ground, though appearing nearly white when seen against black. The rate at which these appearances change, after transfer to white or black containers, respectively, is being studied photographically, and will be dis- cussed in my final report upon these experiments. A very noticeable change occurs within a few minutes. As predators, I have employed successfully only the Galapagos penguin (Spheniscus mendiculus Sundevall). This bird was chosen because of its keen appetite for fishes, and its complete indifference to the presence of observers. A cormorant was tried on one occasion, but proved to be alto- gether too wild for the purpose. It did not swallow a single fish, though it killed five when first placed in the black tank.4 The penguins were put into the tanks two at a time. In most cases they had been fed on the pre- ceding day; in one instance, the interval since feeding was two days. Since the birds were taken at random from a stock of about a dozen, it is likely that more than two individuals were represented in the experiments. The tanks used were wooden ones, specially constructed for the purpose. Their internal dimensions were eight by fifteen feet, with a depth of three feet. They were filled with fresh water to a depth of two to two and a half feet. One was painted dead black within, the other a very pale gray, lying between Ridgway's "pale olive-gray" and "light olive-gray." The bot- toms were kept fairly free from leaves or sediment which might obscure them. It is evident that in the present series of experiments, we are not dealing with differences in color, sensu stricto, but merely with differences in shade. Thus, the problem of the extent to which birds possess color-vision has not been touched upon. In each experiment, an equal number of "black" and "white" fishes kept until that time in jars of the shade to which they had been habituated, were emptied together into one end of the tank. The birds were dropped in at the other end, either simultaneously with the fishes, or after a definite interval. They sometimes began the pursuit of the fishes immediately, sometimes after the lapse of a half minute or a minute. The time of so- journ of the birds was recorded from the moment when they began to chase the fishes. The fishes, when first placed in the tank, tended to form a single school, regardless of color. So far as noted, the "whites" and "blacks" behaved exactly alike. After the onslaught of the birds, however, this school was broken up, the fishes scattering in all directions, and tending to concen- trate in the corners. Neither the birds nor the fishes were disturbed by us</page><page sequence="4">562 ZOOLOGY: F. B. SUMNER PROC. N. A. S. in any way, during the feeding-test, except that on a few occasions, the fishes were driven out of a corner by a stick. The penguins, much of the time, swam under water, though coming to the surface at frequent intervals for air. In the pale tank, they could be readily seen pursuing the fishes; in the dark tank this was less easy to see. After leaving the birds in the tank for a period which was believed suf- ficient to enable them to catch about half of the fishes, they were removed. The surviving fishes were next removed. A movable partition of wire screen was pushed from one end of the tank to the other, and the fishes thus penned in were caught with a rectangular hand-net. Great care was taken to remove all of them.5 RESULTS OF EXPERIMENTS UPON PROTECTIVE VALUE OF CONCEALING COLORATION IN FISHES (Gambusia DEVOURED BY PENGUINS) INTERVAL NUMBER BETWEEN TIME OF ADMITTING ALLOWED SURVIVORS EATBN DATE EXPERI- NUMBER FISHES BIRDS IN DOUBT- DOUBT- 1934 MENT TANK FISHES AND BIRDS TANK BLACK WHITE FUL BLACK WHITE FUL Aug. 3 1 Pale 100 None 2 min. + 36 44 0 14 6 0 2 Pale 100 None 4'10" 21 36 0 29 14 0 3 Pale 76 None 4 min. 16 19 0 22 19 0 Aug. 9 8 Pale 300 11 min. 6 min. + 48 84 2 100 64 2 Totals 576 121 183 2 165 103 2 61% 38% 1% Aug. 6 4 Black 90 None 4 min. 32 11 0 13 34 0 5 Black 90 None 5 min. + 28 2 0 17 43 0 6 Black 90 5 min. 5 min. 28 3 0 17 42 0 Aug. 9 7 Black 200 10 min. 8-9 min. 74 18 0 26 82 0 Totals 470 162 34 0 73 201 0 27% 73% The identification of the fishes recovered, as "blacks" and "whites," was not difficult, despite the considerable degree of convergence of the two lots which took place when placed together on a common background. In the few cases in which certain identification was not immediately possible, recourse was had to treatment with a one per cent solution of urethane. This brings about an identical tonus of the chromatophores in the two lots, thus revealing the marked differences in the amounts of melanin present. The two specimens marked "unidentifiable" in the table were killed by the birds, but not eaten. The results of these eight tests are presented in the accompanying table. It will be seen that 1046 fishes were employed in all, of which 544 or some- what more than half, were eaten by the birds. Very nearly equal numbers were eaten in the pale and black tanks (270 and 274, respectively).</page><page sequence="5">VOL. 20, 1934 ZOOLOGY: F. B. SUMNER 563 The most important figures are those giving the percentages of "black" and "white" fishes eaten in each tank. Of those consumed in the pale tank, 61 per cent were "blacks," 3S per cent were "whites" and 1 per cent unidenti- fiable. Of those consumed in the black tank, on the other hand, 27 per cent were "blacks" and 73 per cent were "whites." Moreover, the single experi- ments for each tank all show the same trend. There are no exceptional cases. It will be noted that in three cases the fishes were left in the tanks for periods of five to eleven minutes before the birds were introduced. This was for the purpose of allowing a certain amount of change to occur in one or the other of the two lots of fishes, thus diminishing the difference be- tween the two. In reality, no significant effect resulted in the ratios be- tween the "adapted" and "non-adapted" fishes eaten. In the case where the fishes were left in the pale tank for eleven minutes before admission of the birds, the ratio is almost exactly the same as the mean figure for the other tests. The same is true, for the third test in the black tent, when a five-minute interval was allowed. Rather curiously, in the case where a ten-minute interval was allowed in this tank, the proportion of "whites" eaten was slightly greater than the average (76 per cent). It can hardly be doubted, however, that had considerably longer periods been allowed in each case for the less adapted fishes to adjust themselves to their new background, the capture of fishes by the birds would have become more and more indiscriminate. Theoretically, an interesting series of experi- ments would be possible here, in which longer and longer intervals were allowed for the fishes to approximate one another in shade. But it would be important to employ in each case the same individual birds, in the same state of hunger. In the course of these experiments, the question naturally arose whether this differential mortality of the fishes, under the attacks of the penguins, may not have been due, in part at least, to differences in the activity of the fishes themselves. It had long been noted in the laboratory, both for Lebistes and Gambusia, that specimens kept in white aquaria were far more shy than those kept in black ones. The former retreated much more rapidly than the latter when, for example, the hand of the observer was waved over the container. Special experiments showed that "blacks," after transfer to a white aquarium, gradually approximated the "whites" in shyness and activity; likewise that "whites," in a black aquarium, rather rapidly calmed down to a state in which they were nearly as quiet as fishes of continuously "black" history. In neither case, however, did the transposed fishes attain the degree of activity (or quiescence) shown by those which had been long habituated to a given background, at least within a period of forty minutes. So far as these results may bear upon the bird-feeding experiments, they</page><page sequence="6">564 ZOOLOGY: F. B. SUMNER PROC. N. A. S. would seem to make it probable that "black" fishes, in the pale tank, would be subject to an additional handicap, besides their greater conspicuousness. They would probably show a somewhat diminished propensity to escape from a pursuer. On the other hand, "white" fishes, in the black tank, would probably be somewhat more adroit in escaping than the "blacks," a circumstance which throws into greater relief the handicap which they undoubtedly suffer by reason of their greater conspicuousness. We are not, of course, in a position to evaluate the relative importance of visibility and motility in preserving these fishes from capture by birds which are fully capable of overtaking them in the water. In the feeding experiments herein dis- cussed, it is significant that the most striking results were obtained in the black tank, in which the handicap of greater visibility, on the part of the "whites," might have been supposed to be partially offset by a greater motility. It seems evident, in view of all these facts, that fishes which harmonize in shade with their immediate surroundings are less likely to be eaten by birds (or at least by certain birds) than fishes of the same species which do not so harmonize. If this is true, we can hardly doubt that the capacity of fishes to adjust their appearance to their background is highly useful to them. To what extent slight differences in this capacity would be of survival value is a question upon which we have no evidence. But it seems quite probable that, considered statistically, even scarcely perceptible differ- ences of this sort would be sufficient to affect the mortality rates, were we concerned with sufficiently large populations. In any case, any one who has experimented in this field knows that not only different species of fishes, but also different individuals of the same species, show marked differences in the perfection of their mechanism for color change. We thus have some of the essential conditions for the evolution of this mechanism through natural selection. 1 Fuchs, R. F., Sitzungsber. der phyzikalisch-mediz.

I must acknowledge the important services of my son, Herbert Sumner, who spent some hours in the water of these tanks engaged in this not very thrilling type of fishing.</page></plain_text>
