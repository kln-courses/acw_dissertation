<plain_text><page sequence="1">305 INDONESIAN INFLUENCE ON EAST AFRICAN CULTURE.' [WITH PLATES XXXVIII-XLII.] By JAMES HORNELL. IN European waters prior to the beginning of the Christian era and for several centuries thereafter, the sailors of every country, with the possible exception of Phcenicia and Carthage, appear to have had little deep sea enterprise. They lacked the reckless courage and foolhardy spirit of adventure that has characterized the peoples of the island world of Oceania from time immemorial. The Odysseys of the Greeks, for example, are but picturesque accounts of comparatively short voyages performed timorously along the coasts of the Mediterranean and Black Seas; the only ancient deep sea voyaging by Europeans of which we have knowledge, that of the Romans from the Gulf of Aden to South India, had to await the discovery by Hippalus in A.D. 45 of the value of monsoon winds as aids to oversea navigation. Thus it happened that at a time when the seas of Europe knew few mariners skilled enough -and hardy enough to sail out of sight of land, the greater seas of Asia were already being furrowed by the keels of Eastern peoples, guiding their vessels by the sun by day and by the stars at night. Indians were voyaging from Gujarat, from the Coromandel coast and from Kalinga to Western Indonesia, carrying trade, religion and civilization to Sumatra and Java; Persians, as recorded in Chinese annals, were trafficking with China in the days of the Sassanides; the Chinese themselves were laying the foundations of sea trade with Western India about the same time; while the ancestors of the Polynesians had already adventured far into the unknown regions of Oceania in search of new homes. The impact of Indian civilization upon the Malayan and pre-Malayan peoples of Sumatra and Java, who were barbarians by comparison with the Indians, had a vivifying effect comparable to that which resulted from the mingling of Northern blood with that of ?Egean Greece. Powerful and well-organized kingdoms grew up in both islands in the early centuries of our era, most notable being that of Srivijaya, in the south of Sumatra, with its capital at or near Palembang. This State eventually embraced within its limits the Malay Peninsula, Southern Siam and Java; its rulers appear to have been suzerains of Cambodia at the height of their power (eighth century A.D.) and even aspired to the overlordship of Ceylon, which they invaded twice, according to the Mahawansa. Unfortunately, the data available, although definite enough to enable us to deduce certain crucial facts, are extremely meagre and unsatis- Read in summary at the meeting of the British Association at Leicester, September, 1933. The term " Indonesian " is here used in a geographical sense as meaning the inhabitants of Indonesia, otherwise the Malay or East Indian Archipelago. Actually the people here referred to were Sumatrans and Javanese, the former predominating.</page><page sequence="2">306 JAMES HORNELL.-Indonesian Influence on East African Culture. fying, for the only positive sources are ancient Chinese texts and a number of Sanscrit, Tamil and old Malay inscriptions in South India, the Malay Peninsula and Indonesia. The earliest text bearing upon the present subject, if we omit references to the gold pro- duction of Sumatra by Valmiki in the Ramayana and in Ptolemy's Geography, is a Chinese one given by Paul Pelliot,' clarified by G. Ferrand.2 It occurs in the chapter of the Hou han shu (" The Annals of the later Han Dynasty ") devoted to the description of the barbarians of the south. The author or compiler states that " in the sixth year yony-kien of the Emperor Chuen, in the twelfth month [corresponding to the year A.D. 132], the King of Ye-tiao, who was called Pien, or Tiao-pien, sent an embassy to the Chinese court conveying tribute. In return the Chinese Emperor presented King Pien with a golden seal and a violet ribbon." Ferrand gives linguistic reasons for equating Tiao-pien with the old Javanese word Dewawarman (Sanscrit, Deva-Varman) and Ye-tiao (anciently pronounced Yap-div) with Yavadvipa, and proves also that the latter term refers not to Java, as is commonly inferred, but to the kingdom of Srivijaya, in Sumatra.3 The Sanscrit form of the name or title of the Sumatran sovereign thus recorded in Chinese annals is a fact of the utmost importance. It proves definitely not only that as early as the second century A.D. the Hinduization of Sumatra was already an accomplished fact, but also that the beginning of Hindu contact and influence must be pushed back well into the pre-Christian era. In Sumatran and Javan tradition no hint is to be found of any forcible conquest by Indian adventurers. Penetration was peaceful and by infiltration, begun probably by traders and consummated by Brahman and Buddhist missionaries. Under such circumstances the growth of Hindu political influence must have been comparatively slow, and thus it comes about that it may be assumed with reasonable certainty that the beginning of Indian dominance in Western Indonesia must be dated well anterior to the Christian era. Other embassies from Sumatra and Java carried tribute to China, probably usually nominal and in the expectation of receiving in return presents of superior value, at irregular intervals from A.D. 132, and did not cease till after 1499, in which year the Ming che records the wreck of all the ships conveying the Javanese envoys except that of their interpreter, which arrived safely at Canton.4 Other Chinese annals record embassies from the Hinduized Khmer kingdom (ancient Cambodia) dating from A.D. 225 and from Champa (Annam) from A.D. 230.5 Coincident with this oversea intercourse with China, still more adventurous voyages were being made to the westward, extending as far as Arabia and East Africa, and to Madagascar, which was colonized effectively. The first historical hint of this voyaging again comes from a Chinese source, the Ts'o fou yuan kouei, where it is recorded that in A.D. 724, in the seventh 1 "Deux itineraires de Chine en Inde a la fin du VIJIe siecle," Bull. de l'Ecole fran,aise d'Extreme-Orient, vol. iv, 1904, p. 266. 2 G.

Again in A.D. 813 a Javanese embassy to China is recorded in the Sin t'ang chu, or " New History of the Tang," as having included four seng-tchi slaves among the items of tribute,2 and a little later, in A.D. 860, a Javanese inscription employs the name jP'gi to designate people of the negro race; 3 the same term is used in the variants jangi and 'ni in other Javanese inscriptions dated 1135, 1140 and 1294, given by the same authority. As sengi-k'i, seng-tche and j8ngi are variants of the Persian zang or zangi, the term employed first by Persian traders and navigators, and later by their maritime pupils and successors, the Arabs, in the forms zang, zeng, zinj, zenj and zenji, according to the dialect spoken, to designate the negroes of the eastern coast of Africa, we have presumptive evidence that the Hinduized Indonesians of Sumatra and Java were engaged in the eighth and ninth centuries in a slave trade centred on the East African coast. How long it had existed prior to the dates of these records we have no information. A story told by Bozorg bin Shahriyar in the Kitab 'ajaib al-Hind (" The Book of the Wonders of India ")4 gives an account of what must have been an exceptionally ambitious and boldly planned tenth-century expedition fitted out from Sumatra, even after making full allowance for exaggeration in regard to the number of vessels employed. The tale is as follows:- " Ja'far bin Rasid, known under the name of Ibn L5ikTs, a noted pilot for the gold countries [Sumatra and South-east Africa], has related to me some extraordinary matters concerning the Wakwak of which he was himself witness. In the year 334 A.H. [= A.D. 945] the Wakwak set out with a thousand ships to launch a determined attack upon the town of Kanbaloh. But they were unable to capture it, for the town was strongly fortified and was surrounded by an arm of the sea, in the midst of which Kanbaloh rose like a fortress.5 People of the country [Persians or Arabs], with whom the intruders held parley, demanded why they had come to Kanbaloh rather than to any other place; they replied that it was because the country possessed merchandise of value in the Wakwak country and in China, such as ivory, tortoise- shell, panther skins and amber [ambergris], and also because they wanted to obtain some of the Zenj people, who, being strong men, are able to stand heavy labour. Their voyage, said they, had lasted a year. They had pillaged several islands at six days' sail from Kanbaloh ' P. Pelliot, "Daux itineraires, etc.," 1904, p. 335. 2 Ibid., p. 289. 3 Quioted by G. Ferrand, " L'6l6ment persan dans les textes nautiques arabes des XVe et XVIe siecles," Journ. Asiat., April-June, 1924, p. 241. ' Translation by Marcel Devic, Livre des Merveilles de l'Inde, Leyden, 1883-1886, pp. 174-175. 6 The identification of Kanbaloh is difficult. According to Masudi, who died in A.D. 956, the island of Kanbaloh, or Kanbalu, was taken by the Moslems at the time of their capture of Crete, or about A.D. 730, according to Ingrams (Zanzibar: its History and its People, 1931, p. 81), who is inclined to identify it with Mkumbuu in Pemba Island, as this town was undoubtedly called Mkumbulu in old days, I being frequently elided. If Mkumbuu is " surrounded by an arm of the sea," then there would seem little doubt that this identification is correct. If it is not, then I think we must look for it farther south, possibly at Kilwa or Mozambique, for both places agree with the description given by Ibn Lakis. VOL. LXIV. X</page><page sequence="4">308 JAMEs HORNELL.-Indonesian Influence on East African Culture. [? the Comoro Islands], and afterwards many towns and villages of the Zenjs in the Sofala country, without reckoning we know not what. If the story told by these people be true in speaking of a voyage of a year's duration, this proves," says the writer, " that Ibn Ldkis is right when he maintains that the Wakwak Islands are situated opposite to China."' Judging from what we know of the history of early European sea trade with India and Africa and of slaving in the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries, the need for storage accommodation for goods given and received in barter, as well as for guarded enclosures (barracoons) to receive slaves as collected, would entail the establishment of permanent or semi-permanent entrepots conveniently situated both for the shipment of goods and slaves and for defence against hostile parties of natives-such positions, for example, as the islands of Lamu, Mombasa, Kilwa, Kisiwani and Mozambique. Whether Indonesians had such trading posts on the East African coast prior to their main or effective settlement in Madagascar we shall probably never know with certainty, but that they were made at some period is extremely probable. The evidence for this, apart from the Chinese references to African slaves, rests in the main upon the presence of a large, though varying, proportion of Bantu (Zenj) blood in the population of Madagascar, upon the statements of Arab travellers and geographers, and on the occurrence along the coast of East Africa from Somaliland to Mozambique of forms of canoe and ship construction distinctive of Indonesian marine architecture; the widespread cultivation of the coconut palm in the coastal area points in the same direction, as do the occurrence of the Indonesian coconut scraper and of certain musical instruments on the Swahili coast. Traditional Origin. The traditions of the Malagasy regarding their racial origin are vague and confused and afford little substantial enlightenment on the migrations from the East. They refer solely to the second migration. As summarized by Ferrand2 they are as follow: (a) An Indonesian prince (Ramini), sovereign of an Oriental country of which legend has retained the names of two ports, Manguelor, or Mangaroro (in the south of Sumatra), and Mangatsini (in the south of the Malay Peninsula). (b) He had two sons or grandsons, Rahadzi and Rakuba. (c) Ramini say some, Rahadzi and Rakuba say others, left their native country and migrated to Madagascar. (d) The causes of emigration are not properly known. (e) Rahadzi established himself on the east coast, while Rakuba penetrated into the interior and arrived at Imerina, where he married a Vazimba, or autochthonous princess, who gave birth to a son; from him sprang a new dynasty. 1 G. Ferrand in his article " Le Wakwak, est-il le Japon ? " (Journ. Asiat., April/May, 1932, pp. 239-240) supplies conclusive evidence to show that the country of the Wakwak here referred to is the island of Sumatra. 2 G. Ferrand, " Les Voyages de Javanais C Madagascar," Journ. Asiat., vol. xv, 1910, p. 299.</page><page sequence="5">JAMES HoRNELL.-Indonesian Influence on East African Culture. 309 Ferrand is inclined to date this Ramini colonization, which gave rise to the Morina or IIova tribe and its collaterals, and is the latest in point of time, to the tenth century; he equates it with the great expedition described by Ibn L5kis (given above) as having left Zabag (Sumatra) in A.D. 945. Against this conclusion has to be set Flacourt's statement' that " the whites called Zaferamini [Zafi-Ramini, descendants of Ramini] came here [to Madagascar] 500 years ago." As Flacourt wrote towards the middle of the seventeenth century, this would place the latest migration in the middle of the twelfth century. This dating is not impossible a priori, but it is probable that the " 500 years " mentioned is merely equivalent to the expression " a long time ago " and should not be taken literally. The Zafi-Ramini at the present day are located in the south-east littoral region of the island (Antanosy), and may be the descendants of Rahadzi and his people, who, tradition says, settled on the coast, whilst his brother penetrated inland to the central plateau. Although the people of Sumatra and Java have no longer any intercourse with Madagascar, large numbers still voyage overseas each year, but to-day the stream flows to Arabia on pilgrimage to Mecca. Ameen Rihani, who travelled on the Arabian coasts in the time of the late King Husein of the Hedjaz, tells us2 that " of all the pilgrims, the Javanese are the most welcome at Jeddah and the most liked . . . there were in the island [the Quarantine Island at Jeddah] that day about 2,000 Javanese." The Bantu Element in Madagascar. Although the Malagasy language, spoken throughout the entire length and breadth of Madagascar, belongs without question to the Malayo-Polynesian group of languages, and has close affinity with Kawi, the ancient language of Java and Southern Sumatra, and although the Merina (bova), Betsileo and other central tribes are definitely Mongoloid and physically closely related to the people of Sumatra and Java, a large proportion of the population, particularly that inhabiting the western half of the island which faces Africa, are just as definitely of negroid stock. Suggestions have been made that the latter belong to the Oceanic section of the Negro race, but this may now be ruled out, partly because of the well-nigh insuperable difficulties that would inevitably beset Oceanic negroes undertaking a voyage from the Papuan region to Madagascar, even in the best sea-going craft at their disposal, but mainly and conclusively because Bantu words are to be found in Archaic Malagasy," while Bantu dialects related not distantly to the Swahili of Zanzibar are spoken in the Comoro Islands." It is most improbable that the ancestors of this Bantu element colonized Madagascar by their own unaided efforts. So far as historical and other evidences go, no Bantu tribe has ever adventured oversea or out of sight of land; as far back as A.D. 1154 we find Edrisi stating definitely that " the Zenjs [i.e. the Bantus of East Africa] have no ships for voyaging." Except 1 Histoire de la grande isle de Madagascar, 2nd edn., p. 3 of the introduction, Paris, 1668. 2 Around the Coasts of Arabia, London, 1930, p. 76. 3 G. Ferrand, Encyclopcedia of Islam, article " Madagascar," 1928, No. 38, pp. 67-68. a Sir H. H. Johnston in Living Races of Mankind, vol. ii, p. 419. x 2</page><page sequence="6">310 JAMES HORNELL.-Indonesian Influence on East African Culture. they were carried to Madagascar as prisoners or slaves, there is no satisfactory alternative solution to the problem of the presence of Bantu tribes in Madagascar. The association between the ancestors of the present Bantu stock and the Indonesian immigrants must have been exceedingly intimate to cause the Bantus to give up their own language and adopt the Malayo- Polynesian dialect of the immigrants. Slavery involves just such intimate relationship between peoples of different races as is necessary to bring about this result. It is because of this that the languages of American negroes conform to those of the men who held their forefathers in the bonds of slavery; in the United States and Jamaica, English is the speech of the negro population; in Brazil, the negroes speak Portuguese; in Spanish America their speech is a corrupt Castilian, and in Haiti it is French. Ferrand gives linguistic reasons for the inference that Sumatrans first colonized Madagascar as early as the second to fourth centuries of our era, possibly even earlier.1L If, therefore, these people raided and traded on the African coast for slaves and had slave depots there, as there is good reason to believe, ample time has elapsed for the growth of both sections of the population of Madagascar-the Indonesian colonists and the Bantu serf class-to attain the comparatively large numbers which they have at the present day.2 The great fecundity of both the Indonesian and Negro elements must not be overlooked when considering this problem. How the Bantu slaves became free and how they segregated out to form separate tribes we shall never know; probably they originated in much the same way as did the Maroon tribes of Dutch Guiana, from the banding together of numbers of runaway and revolted slaves who found refuge in the woods and mountains till they became sufficiently strong in numbers to defy their former masters and form permanent settlements of their own. That extensive Indonesian trade, apart from slaving, existed on the East African coast as late as the middle of the twelfth century admits of no doubt. Edrisi, who wrote an Arabic Geography in 1154, states so categorically in the section of his work dealing with Africa. In one passage as given in A. Jaubert's translation, Geographie d'Edrisi, Paris, 1836, slightly amended by Ferrand, Journ. Asiat., xiv, p. 63, he is quoted as saying :-Page 58, " The Zenjs [the people of the East African coast south of Cape Guardafui] have no ships for voyaging.... The people of the isles of Zabag [here Zabag = Western Indonesia] come to the country of the Zenjs in large and in small ships. They trade with them and export the Zenj merchandise, for they understand each other's language." Page 65, " The people of Zabag and the surrounding islands come to seek here [at Sofala, on the south-east coast of Africa] for iron to transport to 1 Encyclop. of Islam, article " Madagascar," 1928. 2 It is noteworthy that the relatively pure-bred Merina (Hova) tribe is the largest single tribe in the Malagasy population. Out of a total of a little over three millions, the Merina number 900,000, according to figures quoted by R. P. Henri Dubois (Africa, vol. vi, 1933, pp. 206-219), while the two chief tribes in which the African element is preponderant, the Sakalava and the Bara, number only 142,000 and 157,000 respectively. The bulk of the remainder of the population is obviously of mixed origin, the proportions varying greatly. But all speak Malagasy, whether of Indonesian or African affinity, and their culture is. distinctively akin to that of Indonesia. Very few Bantu words or roots are traceable in Malagasy, and it seems impossible that small bands of immigrants could have imposed their language and culture upon a virile African population had that been present prior to the coming of the Indonesians.</page><page sequence="7">JAMES HORNELL.-Indonesian Influence on East African Culture. 311 the Indian mainland and islands [Indonesia], where they sell it profitably, for it is an important article of trade and is utilized on a large scale in India. . . ." Page 78, " ... The people of Komr [Madagascar] and the people of the Maharaja [Srivijaya, in Sumatra] come among them [the negroes of the south-east coast of Africa] and being well received, carry on trade with them. The statement here made that the people of Zabag could understand the language of the people of Zenj is difficult to comprehend unless it be granted that there were Malagasy settlements on the Zenj coast. The suggestion which has been made that Zenj here includes Madagascar is inadmissible, for Madagascar had no merchandise suitable for export; it had nothing of value apart from foodstufls which were not wanted. Hence Zenj cannot have here any but its own proper significance-the coast of Eastern Africa, south of Cape Guardafui. An echo of this same traffic between Western Indonesia and Africa is afforded some centuries later by the Portuguese author, Diogo de Couto,' in his statement, written 1597, that " The Javanese are all men very skilled in the art of navigation, insomuch that they claim to have been the earliest navigators. Some, however, attribute this honour to the Chinese and affirm that the Javanese learnt from them. But it is certain that the latter [the Javanese] formerly sailed even to the Cape of Good Hope and that they have held communication with the Island of S. Lourengo [Madagascar], where are found numerous natives, tawny and of the Javanese type (bassos e ajavados), who are said to be descended from them [the Javanese]." In contrast to the bald statements of Edrisi, whose work, in common with the writings of nearly all Arab savants, is dull and dry reading, is the story of his travels in Southern Arabia by Ibn al-Mujawir, embodied in the Tarih al-mustabsir, or History by one who observes with understanding. This curiously titled work, written about A.H. 630 (= A.D. 1233), narrates the personal observations of the author as well as many local traditions of the places visited, in a delightfully simple and direct style, full of vivid touches. He includes information from contemporary sources and frequently adds the date when the items were collected. His knowledge of ancient history was slender, but he was versed in the history of his own time, and he gives us a clear vision of the miserable condition of Southern Arabia at this period. The value of his work actually lies in the fact that he was not learned; he chronicles just what he saw or what he learned by word of mouth. Many common things are therefore related by him which the learned of his time would have thought too trivial to record, and for this we are thankful. The part treating of Aden is the one of present interest to us, and, fortunately, we have an excellent translation by Lieut.-Col. S. B. Miles in An Account of the British Settlement of Aden in Arabia (London, 1877). The translator states that the author is cited by Al-Hazraji, the historian of Yemen, as a reliable authority for the period of which he wrote. The text, he adds, is very corrupt and full of lacunae. 1 Da Asia, dec. iv, book iii, chap. 1, p. 161. Lisbon edn., 1778.</page><page sequence="8">312 JAMES HORNELL.-Indonesian Influence on East African Culture. Another translation is given by Ferrand (1919, pp. 145-149). The following is the section in translation :- " Founding of Aden.-When the empire of the Pharaohs came to an end, this place [Aden] became deserted in consequence. The peninsula was inhabited only by fishermen who plied their craft in the neighbouring waters. They lived there for a long time, provided by Allah with the things needful for their material life. This lasted until the arrival of the people of Al-Komr in ships carrying a great number of men. These took possession of the peninsula, expelled the fishermen by force, and established themselves on the heights of Jebel Ahhmar [the Red Mountain], Hukkat and Jebel Munzhir, which dominate the buildings of the port. The monuments built by this people exist to this day; their construction is durable, being built with stone and cement obtained from the valleys and mountains of this country. "The poet says:- 'As for me, weep copiously; for their houses have become empty, And the leader of their camels has departed. The anguish of separation makes me mad. I stand on their habitations raving about them and asking: 0 houses ! have you no news of them ? Return me an answer quickly. It was answered me from the houses wailing and crying: " Weep blood, 0 neglectful one!" The caravans have departed. My slave girl is with them: in elegance and qualities perfect; In face and form roselike and thornlike.' "These people, sailing from Al-Komr in convoy, reached Aden in a single monsoon. Ibn Al-Mujawir says that these people are dead, their power ended, and the route closed by which they came. There is nobody left who has knowledge of the maritime activities of this people or can tell under what conditions they lived and what they did. " Ibn Al-Mujawir says: 'From Aden to Mogadishu one monsoon [is required to perform the voyage]; from Mogadishu to Kilwa a second monsoon is requisite, and from Kilwa to Al-Komr a third.'" "Formerly these people [those of Al-Komr] were accustomed to perform the three seasons (or monsoons) journey in a single monsoon; one ship actually performed the voyage from Al-Komr to Aden in this way in the year 626 A.H. [== A.D. 1228-1229]; sailing from Al-Komr and bound for Kilwa, the vessel came to anchor at Aden." ([Curiously enough, no reason is 1 In a footnote on p. 146, Ferrand in his K'ouen-Louen remarks that at the beginning of the sixteenth century the navigation of the Komr (=Malagasy) was restricted, according to the Nautical Instrucdions of Sulayman al-Mahri, to voyages from Madagascar to the eastern coast of Africa. There was no longer any question of voyages to Aden as in the thirteenth century.</page><page sequence="9">JAMES HoRNELL.-Indonesian Influence on East African Culture. 313 given for this deflection from the original destination, which must have been something outside of winds and currents.] That the people thus referred to were without doubt Indonesians or of Indonesian origin is proved by the reference to outriggers which follows, and which is noteworthy as probably the earliest record in literature of the use of this contrivance:- " Their ships have outriggers because the seas [of Al-Komr] are narrow, shallow and difficult of navigation on account of the currents. " When the power of these people became enfeebled, the Barabar [Arabians of the neigh- bouring country] who had come to live among them, [rose and] overpowered them, driving them out. These Barabar occupied the place and settled in the valley, where mat huts are actually now found. They were the first people who constructed mat huts in Aden. Subse- quently the place was abandoned, and remained in this state till the immigration of the men of Siraf [Persians], of whom we have already written. The Sultan Shah bin Jamshid bin As'ad bin Kaysar arrived at Aden, disembarked, settled there and repeopled the place. He wished to bring drinking water from Zayla, but as the distance was too great, he caused cisterns to be constructed 'for the storage of rain water." The foregoing account of an Indonesian settlement at Aden suggests that the earlier migrants to Madagascar followed a route known in advance to Malayan merchants, trading first to India and thence onwards to Arabia and Africa. Aden found deserted would attract the attention of the migrants as an ideal site for the establishment of a fortified trading post, and it may well have been but one of a chain of similar posts along the then wild and little frequented Western shore of the Indian Ocean-posts intended to facilitate and safeguard the voyages of vessels trading between the old home in Western Indonesia and the daughter colonies in Africa and Madagascar. This agrees with the probabilities. The vessels available to Indonesians for deep sea voyaging were well adapted for this purpose, for of a certainty they were of the fine type seen on the sculptured panels of the magnificent Buddhist stupa of Boro- Budur in Java, built in the ninth century. The larger of these were two-masted vessels of considerable size, stoutly built and seaworthy, and provided with the stoutest and most scientifically designed outriggers ever employed (Text-fig. 2 and P1. XXXVIII, Fig. 1); these rendered them exceedingly safe craft to navigate in monsoon winds blowing for weeks without change from the same point of the compass. But seaworthy as they must have been, they were scarcely equal to the onerous requirements demanded by a direct service between Sumatra and Madagascar, for the distance in a straight line is about 3,500 miles.' 1 In a letter to the writer from Sir H. H. Johnston, dated February 23, 1921, he wrote :-" The direction of Indian research which interests me most is anything which would throw light on the stupendous feat of navigation performed by those Malay seafarers who colonized Madagascar some two thousand-more or less- years ago. It is generally assumed that they steered south-west from Java or Sumatra and crossed almost the greatest width of the Indian Ocean to reach Madagascar. As it is assumed that they had nothing better than outrigger canoes, this enormously long voyage without sight of land seems incredible. I have often felt that they must have travelled more circuitously via the Nicobars, Ceylon, the Maldives and Seychelles."</page><page sequence="10">314 JAMES HORNELL.-Indonesian Influence on East African Culture. Support for the conclusion that the route was mainly coastwise is afforded by the in- ference that had the voyages been made direct to Madagascar, some of the islands lying on the route traversed would surely have been occupied in order to provide bases for refreshment and water supply; in particular, Mauritius, Bourbon and Rodriguez on a southerly traverse, and the Seychelles and Amirantes on a northerly one. But we know that all these islands were uninhabited when first visited by Europeans and that no trace of former occupation has ever been discovered. Furthermore, as Admiral G. A. Ballard has pointed out to me (letter dated August 1, 1926), before the discovery of the compass, oceanic steering by the heavenly bodies was much more difficult in the southern than the northern hemisphere owing to the absence of any stationary star in the southern sky corresponding to the pole star in the northern; an error of a point on either side of the true course in so long a passage would have meant missing Madagascar. Of direct bearing upon this problem are the particulars which the Arab merchant Suleiman, who wrote an account in A.D. 851 of the sea route from the Persian Gulf to China as performed by Arab, Persian and Chinese trading vessels in the first half of the ninth century, gives of the average times taken between the various ports of call on the voyage between Muscat and Canton.' (In passing, it is worthy of note that the period in question marked the culmination of an era of maritime and commercial activity, coupled with dynastic magnificance, in southern Asia and eastern Africa, without equal in history. In China the glorious dynasty of the T'ang was reigning; in Annam, Cambodia and Java the grandest Buddhistic buildings of all time were being reared under Indian inspiration; while in Sumatra the power of the Sailendra dynasty of Srivijaya extended over the Malay Peninsula and claimed suzerainty over southern Siam, Cambodia and Java. In South India the Pandya and Chola kingdoms were at the height of their prosperity and culture a thousand years ago, while in Bagdad, Haroun al-Raschid and his son Al-Mamun outdid the fabled magnificence of Solomon but coupled this with wise encouragement of commerce in all its aspects.) According to Suleiman the durations of those stages in the voyage which concern us here were as follow, each time being that taken with seasonal winds of moderate strengthl From Muscat to Quilon, in Travancore (South India) .. .. .. One month. From Quilon to Kalah, which appears to be Kra, on the west side of the Malay Peninsula .. .. .. .. .. .. .. One month. From Kra to the island of Tioman, at the south-east of the Malay Peninsula .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. Ten days. Presumably the times taken for these stages in a voyage in the reverse direction, if performed at the proper season, would be substantially the same. Hence the time required for a voyage from Sumatra to Aden should not have exceeded three months under ordinarily favourable conditions. 1 G.

From Quilon ships passed up the Gulf of Mannar and through Palk Strait, in preference to going south around Ceylon. On the way to Kra-at that time, be it noted, under the Sumatran sovereign of Srivijaya-where fresh supplies of water were obtainable, a call was usually made at one of the Nicobar islands called Langabalus, in order to obtain some fresh provisions-coconuts, bananas, sugar-cane and palm toddy. From the above it will be seen that all the probabilities point to the voyages of Indonesians from Sumatra and Java to Madagascar as having been performed in stages via South India and the Arabian coast (Aden) in the earlier waves of migration, probably under the pilotage of Indian navigators. In later times a direct course may have been shaped to Madagascar from the Indian coast during the period of the north-east monsoon. As the Sumatran kingdom of Srivijaya maintained intimate relations from a very early date with the South Indian Pandyan and Cholan kingdoms,' which were already highly civilized at the beginning of the Christian era, we may take it that the first stage was a direct run from Achin, at the northern end of Sumatra, across to South India or Ceylon, or possibly in some instances to the Maldive Islands; 2 thence, at the beginning of or towards the end of the south-west monsoon, direct to the Swahili coast or else across to the Arabian coast, where Aden would serve for refitting; and then by way of Mogadishu (Mogadoxo) and Kilwa, probably both used as Indonesian naval stations, to a final destination in the great island of Madagascar, known to the Arabs as Komr, a name still surviving in that of the small island group north of Madagascar, the Comoro Islands, which would form a secondary and convenient halt on the way to and from Kilwa. Alternatively, the early migrants may have coasted up the western side of. India, and thence along the shores of Baluchistan, Southern Arabia and Eastern Africa. Not all appear to have completed the voyage; besides those who stayed in Ceylon and Malabar and those who, at a later date, seized Aden, others settled in Sind. With regard to the last-mentioned, we have numerous Arabic notices of a people called Sayabiga, already settled on the shores of the Persian Gulf before the rise of Islam; this tribe or group appears to have been derived from a colony of Sumatrans, originally settled in Sind, but who were eventually made prisoners during a Persian invasion and forcibly enrolled in the Persian military forces. According to the consensus of Axabic opinion3 the Sayabiga were mercenaries of high soldierly qualities, 1 Negapatam, the city of the Nagas, on the Coromandel coast, and Korkai, the Kolchi of the Greeks, the Royal port of the Pandyans, on the Gulf of Mannar, were probably the Indian ports best known to the Sumatrans. Tamil inscriptions dated 1005 or 1006, 1046 and 1084, refer to the building and endowment of a Buddhist temple at Negapatam by the Maharaja of Srivijaya, while the Mahiu'ansa, the Royal chronicle of Ceylon, gives particulars of a joint invasion of Ceylon by the combined forces of the Sumatran, Pandyan and Cholan sovereigns about the year 1260, The connection is still maintained, for in 1918 I found Tamil traders and wharf labourers -from Negapatam as far afield as Amboyna and Borneo. The frequent employment of Tamil terms in the- Netherlands Indies is also very noticeable to visitors from South India. 2 Franqois Peyrard, who was wrecked on the Maldives in 1602 and who spent five years in the islands, records in his " Voyage " (Hakluyt Soc., 1887, vol. i, p. 236) that Sumatran merchants were among those whom he found resorting to these isiands to barter their wares for tortoiseshell and ambergris. 3 See the article " Sayaibiga," by G. Ferrand, in the Encyclopcedia of Islam, London and Leyden, 1926.</page><page sequence="12">316 JAMES HoRNELL.-Indonesian Influenoe on East African Culture. disciplined, used to the sea, faithful servants; in consequence, they were considered eminently suitable to serve as guards and soldiers, gaolers, and wardens of the treasury. In the reign of Caliph Abu Bakr (632-634) they formed a garrison at At-Khatt, in Al-Bahrain, and in 656 they a-re recorded as having been entrusted with the guarding of the treasury at Al-Basra. Ferrand shows (op. cit.) that the name Sayaibiga is derived directly from Sabag, which is a variation of Zabag, the ancient name for Sumatra, though sometimes both Sumatra and Java were included in the term. The characteristic qualities of the Sayabiga, enumerated by the Arab writers, are identical with those characterizing the descendants of a regiment of Malays who served in Ceylon at the beginning of last century; on the disbandment of the regiment most of the men remained in Ceylon, and their descendants are still regarded as the most reliable class of the population from which to recruit policemen, watchmen and bank peons. Another witness to the use of north-western Indian ports on the voyage between Africa and the Far East is afforded by Al-Biruni (circa A.D. 1000),' who says that " the reason why in particular Somanat [Somnath, in Kathiawar] has become so famous is that it is a harbour for seafaring people, and a station for those who went to and fro between Sofala, in the country of Zandj, and China." The people of the second migration (circa tenth century), who undoubtedly had larger and better-equipped ships (P1. XXXVIII, Fig. 1, and Text-fig. 2) and a more extensive knowledge of navigation than had those who had preceded them a thousand years before, would by reason of these advantages be enabled to avoid some part at least of the tedious coasting voyage of their predecessors. As the navigational value of the monsoon winds was common knowledge among the seamen of the Indian Ocean at this period, they would be able to sail to Madagascar direct from a port of call either in Ceylon or from one on the Malabar coast of South India. A call on the way at one of the Maldive Islands where lived a kindred people, would afford, if necessary, a new point of departure and be a useful break in the long sea voyage.2 This would accord with Hova tradition, which is precise that their forefathers settled first on the east coast of the island, for it is obvious that this location of the landing place suggests that the route followed was not down the African seaboard from a port of call on the Swahili coast. The latter route cannot, however, be ruled out, for we know nothing of the details of this notable migration. If the people concerned were those who attacked Kanbaloh, they may have intended to remain there had it been captured. Failing this and knowing that parts of Madagascar were in the hands of linguistic kinsfolk, they may have decided to settle in that island with their plunder, in a locality not as yet occupied-the east coast. 1 Alberuni'8 India, translated by E. C. Sachau, vol. ii, p. 104, London, 1888. 2 At the present time voyages by native sailing craft, Arab and Indian, direct to Zanzibar and other East African ports are of annual occurrence, in spite of the fact that the navigational skill of the pilots is now far inferior to what it was in the days of Arab sea-supremacy in the Indian Ocean; neither is it likely that their vessels are better constructed than were Indonesian ones of the tenth century. A voyage direct to Madagascar is also occasionally made, but this is infrequent as there is a decreasing trade connection since the French occupation.</page><page sequence="13">JAMES HORNELL.-Indonesian Inftuence on East African Culture. 317 After landing on the east coast of Madagascar, many of the new colonists migrated to the central plateau of Imerina and formed alliances with the people whom they found there. From this move inland and the high level of rice cultivation which they practised, we must infer that they were mainly agriculturists; that they made use of slave labour to a considerable extent is probable. Why they landed on the inhospitable east coast, surf-beaten and fever-stricken, and singularly deficient in good harbours, with fishing poor as compared with what it is on the north and west coasts, suggests strongly that the migrants had prior knowledge of the country and that they chose a landing on the east coast as offering the easiest route by which to gain access to the fertile and healthy central plateau. According to an Arab writer, Ibn Said, who lived 1208-1286,1 the impelling motives of the migration to AMadagascar are to be found in the following sequence of events:-" The people of Komr are the brethren of the Chinese. . . . The Komr lived with the Chinese in the eastern region of the earth [i.e. to the west of present-day China]. Strife having arisen between them, the Chinese drove the Komr towards the isles [Indonesia], where they remained some time. Afterwards discord breaking out among them, the people who did not side with the Royal family departed towards the Great Isle [Komr = Madagascar], and their sultan lived in the town of Komorriyya." Ibn Said adds that as they increased in numbers they split up into a number of independent states, and eventually a great number migrated to the south [west],2 to the beginning of the habitable world, to settle in the neighbourhood of the mountain which bears their name " (Komr). By this is meant Ptolemy's " Mountains of the Moon," the fabled source of the Nile, for Komr, the Arabic name of Madagascar, is here equated by Ibn Said with the Arabic kamdr, komr or kumr, the moon.3 If this identification be correct, the localization is curiously apt when taken in conjunction with the evidence given below that the Baganda canoes of Victoria Nyanza embody Indonesian features in their design. Moreover, this story of inland penetration into the highlands of Africa harmonizes with the conduct of those Ramini immigrants into Madagascar who penetrated at an early period of their settlement into the upland plateau of the island which they still occupy. Coming to more recent times when information becomes definite and unquestionable, we find Ibn Majid, the famous Arab navigator who piloted Vasco da Gama from Malindi to Calicut, stating in his Nautical Instructions, dated 1489-14904: "At the commencement of this period when the wind blows from the eastward, a fleet of ships set out from Komr [Madagascar] for Zanj, Mrima, Hormuz and India"; and again, Quoted by Ferrand, " Le K'ouen-louen," Jourm. A8iat., vol. xiii, pp. 445-446. 2 According to the Ptolemaic conception of the configuration of the Indian Ocean; actually we must read " west." 3 Actually Ibn Said makes a false equation when he identifies the Arabic term Komr, as designating the Malagasy people, with the Arabic name of the moon, komr or kumr. The former is a corruption of Khmer, the appellation of an ancient people of South-east Asia, the main stock probably from which an important section of the Indonesians have sprung, whereas Komr, as the Arabic name of the mountains adjoining the fabled sources of the Nile, is a direct translation of the Latin name Luncea monte3 or else of the equivalent Greek designation. This confusion need not, however, invalidate the truth of Ibn Said's definite statement that a migration of Malagasy people once took place from Madagascar to the uplands of East Africa. G. Ferrand, " Le K'ouen-louen," Journ. Asiat., vol. xiii, 1919, p. 484.</page><page sequence="14">318 JAMES HoRNELL.-Indonesian Influence on East African Culture. "Voyage from Komr to the coast of Zanj: this is effected at two periods, the one at the beginning of the kaws wind [the nominal S.W. monsoon, here usually a south-easterly wind at this season], which is then feeble, and the other at its close, when it has declined in force." Zanj is here used to designate the East African coast between Mogadishu and about 8 degrees south latitude, and includes the Swahili coast, by which term the Arab navigators of the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries particularized that section of the Zanj coast lying between 3 and 8 degrees, south latitude; Mrima lay further south, being the maritime uplands between about 8 and 11 degrees south latitude.1 With the increase of Arab influence and sea traffic and the advent of European trading fleets the seafaring enterprises of the Malagasy people declined concurrently with a general degradation of' culture, due probably to the deteriorating effects of continued intermarriage with a negroid stock. There can be no doubt that the vessels possessed by these people when Europeans made contact with them were far inferior in size and construction to those that carried the various contingents of settlers from Sumatra and Java, and which traded between Madagascar, Africa and India. Even so, Ferrand notes that the Sakalavas of the north-west and the Betsimisaraka of the eastern coast of Madagascar were accustomed to fit out formidable expeditions from time to time during the eighteenth and early part of the nineteenth century for the express purpose of pillaging the Comoro Islands; other expeditions crossed the Mozambique channel to plunder towns on the African mainland.2 Captain Tomlinson is quoted by him as writing in 1809 that the Sakalavas of the Majunga district " every year fitted out an expedition of at least 100 canoes, each containing from 15 to 35 men, armed with muskets. In each of the intervening years they despatched only 30 canoes, in order that they might not want for provisions and to allow time for the plantations to be re-established." One of these Sakalavan canoes seen by Tomlinson was 45 feet long, with a beam of 10 to 12 feet. Probably the last important Sakalavan foray on the African coast was that which was directed against Kilwa Kisiwani and Chole-Mafia in 1820.3 L. de Lacombe4 informs us that " in their light canoes, without any rudder save a large oar, and without compass, the Malagasy made the crossing of the Mozambique Channel in the eighteenth century; they set out with the south-east monsoon5 and returned with the north-east monsoon.5 The stars served alone to direct their course " (P1. XXXIX, Fig. 1). Technological Evidence. How far the material culture of East Africa has been influenced by Indonesian contact is a subject that has received insufficient attention. So far the only evidence adduced has been Ferrand, Le K'ouen-louen, p. 484. Le K'ouen-louen, pp. 482-483. 3 F. Stuhlmann, "Handwerk und Industrie in Ostafrika," Abhandlungen des Hamburg.

It may also be that certain architectural features of the Rhodesian stone-built ruins of the Zimbabwe type are to be referred to the imitative skill of Bantu builders who had seen the religious (? Buddhist) buildings of Indonesian settlers at some port on the coast. The evidence afforded by a study of canoe and ship structure consists of (a) The close resemblance which exists between the design of the outrigger canoes of the East African coast and those of Madagascar and the northern coast of Java; (b) The probability that the mtepe type of sailing coaster of the Swaheli coast is a relic of an Indonesian type bereft of its outriggers; and (c) The exceptional design of certain large canoes used on Victoria Nyanza, which embodies features peculiar to the vessels of Java and Madura and has no parallel elsewhere in Africa. FIG. 1.-DEGENERATE TYPE OF SMATL OUTRIGGER CANOE, N.W. COAST OF JAVA. THE OUTRIGGER IS SINOLE AND THE SECONSD BOOM HAS DISAPPEARED. (AFTER VAN CAMPEIN.) Outrigger Design.-At the present time outrigger canoes of the same fundamental type occur in Madagascar, the Comoro Islands, and everywhere along the East African coast between Lamu in the north and Mozambique in the south. This type, in turn, finds its counterpart in the design of canoes still used in the west of Java (Text-fig. 1). In Madagascar the Sakalava of the northern and north-western coastlands and the tribes farther south on the western side still employ in everyday work large numbers of sea craft equipped with outriggers, which -may be either of the single or the double type (P1. XXXIX, Fig. 1). On the eastern coast the outrigger canoe is not now in use, its place being taken by plank-built boats pegged or sewn together somewhat after the fashion of the masula boats of the Coromandel coast of India; in the ports these have been replaced by boats of European type. 1 F. Stuhlmann, " Handwerk und Industrie in Ostafrika," Abhandlungen des Hamburgischen Kolonial- instituts, Band I, pp. .6, 82, 85, 111-113, and 135. Hamburg, 1910.</page><page sequence="16">320 JAMES HORNELL.-Indonesian Influen&amp;e on East Afrcan Culture. Although the single outrigger is far more common than the double, there can be no doubt that in this locality the double is the older or original type, for the reasons detailed in my articles in La Ggographie (xxxiv, pp. 1-23, 1920) and Man (1920, No. 67). Its structure consists essentially of two booms lashed athwart the hull of the vessel, the outer end of each attached on one side in the case of single outriggers, or on both sides in that of the double type, indirectly to a cylindrical float by means of a vertical or slightly inclined peg connective. This intermediate part, as denoted by its name, is usually short and stout; through a hole bored transversely in its upper end, the thinned-down end of one of the booms is passed, and is usually keyed on the outer side to prevent it from pulling through; the lower end of the peg is pointed and is driven into a hole bored in the upper surface of the float. In the Comoro Islands a similar type of outrigger is in use in Mayotte (P1. XL, Fig. 1), but in Anjouan or Johanna both the single and the double form are found in use side by side; the double (P1. XL, Fig. 2) approximates to the African type as seen at Zanzibar, the single to that of Madagascar. The former has plank-shaped floats, whereas in the latter the shape is cylindrical. Africa.-Among the sea-fishermen of the middle region of the East African coast, termed the country of the Zang and Zenj by old Persian and Arab writers, the use of the outrigger canoe is as general as in the Comoro Islands and Western Madagascar; it is the characteristic design of all the small or inshore craft of the coast. In contrast with the other localities named, the older type, the double outrigger, is here universal; the single one is never seen. In its construction the African outrigger, while obviously very closely related to that of Madagascar, is characterized by minor differences which affect the form of both the connective and the float. Instead of being cylindrical, the float is flat and plank-shaped, while the connective, except in Mozambique (P1. XL, Fig. 3), changes from the peg shape to that of a squared bar, and instead of being vertical, is usually set at an angle of 40 or 45 degrees from the horizontal. The lower end is inserted into the plank-shaped float at right angles, and this causes the latter to rest obliquely on the water. To secure the connective at the proper angle to the boom, of which the attenuate extremity is thrust through a slot in the upper part of the connective as in Madagascar, a lashing holds down the head of the connective in the requisite position, after the fashion of that seen in the East Indonesian type.' That the plank-shaped float is a modification of one originally cylindrical is proved by the fact that nowhere in Madagascar or in Indonesia, the only localities whence the East African outrigger could possibly have been derived, is a plank float known. Invariably all are cylindrical. The plank-shaped float of East Africa is a unique modification, and no parallel exists elsewhere. The resemblances between the African and the Malagasy forms of outrigger are sufficient to demonstrate that they are both derived from the same source; at the same time, the differences are great enough to afford proof that the introduction of the type on the African coast took place sufficiently long ago to permit of considerable modification being introduced subsequent to the severance of the link connecting the original users of this type of craft in 1 J. Hornell, " The Outrigger Canoes of Indonesia," 7 Madras Fisheries Bull., vol. xii, p. 69, 1920.</page><page sequence="17">JAMES HORNELL.-Indonesian Influence on East African Culture. 321 Africa and Madagascar. Inverting this, we deduce the fact that a very long period has elapsed since the people who used the ancestral form of outrigger, the one which gave rise to all those now in use in Madagascar and along the African coast, ceased to exercise influence throughout both localities. The differences point to a separation of long standing. A further important deduction follows from consideration of the existing distribution in Madagascar of the outrigger type. This is, to-day, confined to the north and west coasts. On the surf-beaten eastern side, where it is absent except in the north and again at the extreme south (Cap Sainte Marie), its place is taken by beamy plank-built boats. This, taken in conjunction with the clear indications that the Merina (Hova) people reached their present central position in the island from settlements originally made on the east coast, involves the conclusion that the existing outrigger canoes of Madagascar are descended from the type of fishing outriggers used by the earlier of the waves of Indonesian settlers (P1. XXXIX, Fig. 2). The vessels of the later, or Ramini, immigrants of the tenth century (? or later) were certainly equipped with outriggers, but as this migration landed on the exposed east coast, it is probable that many of their vessels were wrecked, as tradition actually avers, owing to the difficulty of finding safe harbours for their accommodation. Those upon the north and north-west coasts were probably not available owing to the hostility of the people already in possession, for I believe that facts point to the original settlers having been located on the northern and western coasts, which are well provided with sheltered harbours and particularly well adapted to the needs of a trading and seafaring community. What fishing and minor coast traffic came eventually to be carried on by the Ramini people was in boats built of planks sewn together on a design akin to that of the masula surf-boat of Madras. After the settlement of the Ramini colonists communication with the homeland appears to have ceased; the colonists identified themselves completely with the conditions of life in the new land, but, finding the east coast hot and fever-stricken, the majority pushed their way inland till they reached the central plateau, where they settled down to till the soil after the fashion of their Sumatran and Javanese forefathers. The Sect-going MKLtepe.-This is the only cargo-carrying vessel on the Swaheli coast that is not obviously of Persian or Arab origin. It is described by Sir Richard Burtonl as " the quaintest and freshest local build. It is," he says, "a favourite from Lamu to Kilwa. The shell has a beam one-third its length and swims the tide buoyantly as a sea-bird. This breadth, combined with elasticity, enables it to stand any amount of grounding and bumping, nor is it ever beached for the south-west monsoon. It is pegged together, not nailed, and mostly, as the old traveller says, 'sewn, like clothes, with twine.' The tapering mast, raking forward, carries any amount of square matting, by no means air-tight, and the stern is long and projecting, as if amphisboanic. The swan-throat of the arched prow is the cheniscus of the classical galley- stem. Necklaced with strips of hide and bunches of talismans, it bears a red head; and the latter, as in the ark of Osiris and in the Chinese junk, has the round eyes painted white.... 1 Zanzibar: City, Island and Coast, 1872, vol. i, pp. 73-74.</page><page sequence="18">322 JAMES HORNELL.-Indonesian Influence on East African Culture. The mtepe carries from 12 to 20 tons, and can go to windward of everything propelled by wind." This description is clarified and extended by Ingrams,' from whom we learn that the Tntepe is " a large open vessel with a long projecting stern and a long prow made to resemble a camel's head . . . on the bowsprit (usually made of mangrove wood) is a row of charms of alternato leaves of mklindu (wild date palm) and mvinji (casuarina)." Stuhlmann (loc. cit., p. 115) also remarks on the presence of rounded white oculi carved on the stemhead. He compares the fringed strings round the stem to those seen decorating the bifid prow of the Uganda (Baganda) canoe. An outstanding characteristic in which the mtepe differs radically from Arab vessels is that the form of the sail is square and made of matting, bounded top and bottom by poles (yard and boom). Of the peculiarities found in the rntepe three in particular are of special significance to our present study: (a) the presence of round oculi; (b) the encircling bands around the stem, variously described as fringed strings, as strips of hide and bunches of talismans, and as garlands of leaves; and (c) the use of a rectangular mat sail with the upper and lower sides lashed or laced to poles. All three are also typical of Indonesian canoes; the first and the third are both seen in the sculptured representations of ninth-century ships at Boro Budur, and the second and third are common on Javanese and other Indonesian boats of the present day. The round form of the oculus is specially important. Burton is mistaken in likening it to that seen on " the ark of Osiris," for there it is the conventionalized eye of a hawk, the eye of Horus. Neither can it be correlated with the form of oculus employed by the Greeks and Romans on their vessels, for on these it was always represented in an anthropomorphic form. Only in the East, in ancient Indonesia and sometimes in China, is it round (Text-fig. 2). Similarly, the custom of placing talismanic cords and garlands round the stem is a custom characteristic of Indonesia (P1. XLI, Figs. 1 and 2) and India, rather than of any Western country. The mat sail bounded on two opposite sides by poles is, similarly, a typical Indonesian form of sail, though here in form, though not in material, parallels existed in Ancient Egypt and Greece. Taken together the complex is most suggestive of Indonesian affinity, and I do not doubt that the Swahili mtepe is the lineal descendant of the large sailing vessels used by Indonesians. in their ancient traffic on this coast. This conclusion is supported by the general resemblance of the head of some of the larger outrigger canoes of the Comoro Islands to that of the mtepe. In the former the horizontal, truncate stem with the low transverse upright projection behind, which together form a bifid prow, bears a crude resemblance in profile to a camel's head; like the mtepe, it has a white-circled eye in appropriate position on each bow; there is also one on each quarter. That the mtepe oculus is a survival of a similar ancient Indonesian ornamentation is made still more probable when taken in conjunction with the evidence contained in the following section. 1 Zanzibar-: its History and its People. London, 1931, p. 304.</page><page sequence="19">JAMES HORNELL.-lndonesian Influence on East African Culturm. 323 Duplication of Oculi on Boats and Canoes. One of the strongest pieces of evidence corroborative of the view that Indonesian contact has exercised considerable influence upon the material culture of this region is the fact that a number of the smaller craft are ornamented with oculi painted not only upon the bows, but also upon the quarters or the stern, according as the vessels are sharp-sterned or square-ended. FIG. 2.-A JAVANESE SHIP OF THE NINTH CENTURY AS REPRESENTED ON A SCULPTURED PANEL OF BORO BUDUR, JAVA. ROUND OCULI ARE SHOWN BOTH ON THE BOW AND THE QUARTER. AS USUAL, THE MASTS ARE BIPED AND PROVIDED WITH RUNGS. MUCH VARIATION IS SHOWN IN THE FORM OF THE OUTRIGGER ATTACHMENTS IN THESE BORO BUDUR SCULPTURES, INDICATING THE USE OF SEVERAL DIFFERENT TYPES AT THIS PERIOD. (ORIGINAL.) This quite exceptional duplication of the oculi is widely distributed. I have seen it on several of the better built and larger of the outrigger canoes in the Comoro Islands, and Mr. Ian Rolleston has informed me in correspondence that at least three classes of sailing craft are frequently ornamented with duplicated oculi in Zanzibar and Pemba. These vessels include: (a) The square-sterned jehazi, the Zanzibari equivalent of the Red Sea sambuk; VOL. LXIV. Y</page><page sequence="20">324 JAMES HORNELL.-Indonesian Influence on East African Culture. (b) The sharp-sterned ddu-a word which, in the form " dhow," has been adopted erroneously into the English language- as the generic term for all the larger types of Arab sea-going craft, whereas it is a local term for a- small and insignificant Swahili vessel used chiefly for the- transport of firewood and for fishing; and (c) The larger and better-found outrigger canoes, ngalawa. In all these instances the oculi are of the bull's-eye pattern, a small central disc surrounded by a broad circular band of different colour. That they are painted upon both ends of the hulls is an arrangement of extraordinary significance, because, so far as I know, this duplication occurs nowhere else in the world except upon several of the Javanese ninth-century ships sculptured on the walls of Boro Budur (Text-fig. 2); here, too, we have to note that the oculi are of the bull's-eye form and precisely similar to the Zanzibari and Comorian type. Such exact correspondence in peculiar characteristics cannot be fortuitous; it indicates clearly the Eastern origin of the Swahili oculus. The persistence of this unique duplication of oculi upon the sterns of vessels belonging to East African localities, dominated to-day by the Muhammadan religion, appears to me to be conclusive of the great strength of Indonesian cultural influence in bygone days, the more so because of the Koranic objection to the representation of any part of the human body in decoration or ornament and the fact that neither in the Red Sea nor the Persian Gulf are Arab vessels ever furnished with oculi, so far as I am aware. The Victoria Nyanza Canoes.-The larger and better constructed of these, notably those of the much discussed Baganda type first figured by Stanley,' have several characteristics of design marking them out as radically different in origin from the canoes of any other African locality; the significance of this isolation is emphasized when we find that these peculiarities are common to certain outrigger vessels of the present day found in that part of Indonesia which is known to have supplied Madagascar with a large proportion of the colonists who introduced Indonesian types of outrigger sea-craft and a Malayo-Polynesian dialect into that island. The most important of these canoe peculiarities consist of (a) The presence of a bifid stem, due to the prolongation of the basal or keel plank beyond the true stem in the form of a ram; (b) The penetration through the side planks of the ends of the paddling thwarts, which are thus exposed and visible on the outer side; and (c) The neat closing of the seams by means of longitudinal battens, held in place by stitching passed through opposed holes in the approximated edges of adjacent planks. 1 Through the Dark Continent, vol. i, p. 451.</page><page sequence="21">JAMES HORNELL.-Indonesian Influence on East African Culture, 325 The first two of these characteristics are also outstanding features in the construction of certain of the coasting vessels of Java and Madura, as well of those furnished with double outriggers as of those without (P1. XXXVIII, Fig. 2); the third is a common method of the "caulking " of canoes throughout Indonesia. Details of these parallel constructional features are given in my article in Man, 1928, No. 1. It has also to be noted that a bifid stem is prominent in the design of the fine outrigger vessels of the Philippines and that it is found also highly developed in the canoes of the Minahasa district of the Celebes as well as in some of those of Netherlands New Guinea.' None of the three features enumerated is, however, present in any of the existing coastal canoes of either East Africa or Madagascar; this may be due to the fact that these canoes are nearly always simple dugouts of small size, in contradistinction to the Victoria Nyanza canoes, where the dugout part is reduced to a basal channelled plank to which sides are added by means of attaching one, two, or even three strakes of planking edge to edge; these differences suggest that the Victoria Nyanza canoes are degenerate or simplified modifications of a large sea-going type of vessel, such as would be used by Indonesian voyagers trading on the coast of East Africa, and that they are therefore not related directly or by descent to the dugout type found on the coast of East Africa and Madagascar. This attribution of the origin of the Victoria Nyanza canoe type to an Indonesian source receives support from the statement of Ibn Said already quoted, which says that when the people of Komr (Madagascar) had greatly increased in numbers an important migration took place to a country " at the beginning of the inhabited earth," dominated by a mountain, correlated with Ptolemy's " Mountains of the Moon." As these were reputed to give rise to the sources of the Nile, and as the Nile actually issues from the Victoria Nyanza, it seems probable that Ibn Said's story relates to an Indonesian, or rather Malagasy, migration to the uplands of Kenya and the shores of the Victoria Nyanza. However this may be, the probability of an Indonesian origin of the lake design of canoe is strengthened, as we now see, by a number of facts pointing to an old-time and long-continued contact with Indonesian culture along the coast of East Africa. Coconut Cultivation.-Whatever may be the country in which the coconut palm originated, the centre of its diffusion within the historic period lies within the limits of Indonesia. Therefore, in view of the well-documented evidence of very early intercourse between South India and Ceylon on the one hand and Sumatra and Java on the other, it is not surprising to find both in Ceylon and in South India (Malabar, Cochin and Travancore) that tradition assigns the origin of coconut cultiva- tion to introduction from the eastward-surely from Indonesia in the case of 1 J. Hornell, " The Outrigger Canoes of Indonesia," Madras Fisheries Bulletin, vol. xii, pp. 43-114, 1920.</page><page sequence="22">326 JAMES HORNELL.-Indonesian Influence on East African Culture. Ceylon1; from Ceylon in that of Malabar. In the latter locality the caste whose vocational occupation is the cultivation of the coconut palm and the collection of its sap from which to make toddy and arrack, is termed Tiyyan, a variation of Tivan, signifying " Islander," from the Dravidian tivu, meaning island.2 The introduction of the coconut palm first into Ceylon and afterwards into Travancore and Malabar furnishes evidence of the intimate and friendly nature of Indonesian contact with India during the period when Sumatrans and Javanese were voyaging westwards towards-Africa and Madagascar. The fact that the first two recognized halting-places after passing the Nicobars on voyages from Sumatra and the Malay Peninsula towards Arabia, namely, Ceylon and Quilon in Travancore, coincide with the only two localities in the Indian area where the coconut is the principal agricultural product of the coastal natives cannot be overlooked, coupled as it is with the traditions of its exotic origin.3 On the East African coast, as in India and Ceylon, the form of the coconut scraper used by the Swahili for shredding the flesh of the nut is simlilar to that used in Indonesia: 4 it may be argued that this as well as the coconut palm owe their introduction into East Africa to Indian influence, but this is unlikely, for there is no evidence to suggest that Indian immigration or influence other than seasonal trading was considerable in that region until comparatively recent years. The presence of a dominant Indonesian population in Madagascar and the absence of any ancient Indian settlement there or in Africa weigh the scales in favour of the introduction having been due to Indonesians, as it was in Ceylon. Probably its introduction into Africa took place not long subsequent to the formation of the first coconut plantations in the two intermediate localities-Ceylon and South India. If the latter event took place in the second century B.C.,5 the first colonization of Madagascar is likely to have taken place soon afterwards, say within a couple of centuries. Even Ferrand, who originally deduced the date of the colonization as the second to the fourth century A.D., in his later work, " Le K'ouen-louen," 1 Sir J. Emerson Tennent in his Ceylon (1860, 5th edition, revised, vol. i, p. 436) states that " whatever the period at which the tree may have been first cultivated, a time is indicated when it was practically unknown in Ceylon by the fact that a statue, without date or inscription, is carved in high relief in a niche hollowed out of a rock to the east of Galle [near Welligama] which tradition says is the monument to the Kustia Raja, an Indian prince whose claim to remembrance is that he first taught the Sinhalese the use of the coconut." (Modern research controverts this tradition and attributes the statue to a Buddhist origin). Tennent mentions that no allusion is made to the coconut as an article of diet in the Mahawansa, the Sinhalese chronicles of the Kings of Ceylon, nor is it mentioned therein prior to A.D. 1153 in the lists of fruit-trees, the planting of which throughout the island is so often recorded amongst the munificent acts of the Sinhalese kings. 2 L. K. Anantha Krishna Iyer records in his Cochin Tribes and Castes, vol. i, p. 277, Madras, 1909, that according to tradition, the Tiyyans are descended from colonists from Ceylon, hence the term " Islanders." 3 For details of the ports of call between Arabia and Indonesia and China, see the Voyage du marchand Arabe Sulayman en Inde et en Chine redige' en 851," translated by G. Ferrand, Paris, 1922. 4 F. Stuhlmann, Handwerk und Industrie in Ostafrika, p. 111, Hamburg, 1910. 5Tennent, Ceylon, vol. i, p. 436, footnote, gives the date of the first reference to the occurrence of the coconut in Ceylon as 161 B.C.; in this year the Mahawansa mentions the use of its milk in the preparation of cement used in the building of the Ruanwelle dagoba, at Anuradhapura. By a later chronology this date should be amended to 118 B.c.</page><page sequence="23">JAMES HORNELL.-Indonesian Influence on East African Culture. 327 (Journ. Asiat., vol. xiv, p. 68) considers it more prudent to state his conclusion in the formula: " Madagascar was colonized about the beginning of the Christian era by Hinduized occidental Indonesians." This conclusion fits in well with the evidence furnished by the dating of the spread of the coconut to Ceylon. Quadrilateral Huts. The quadrilateral hut roofed with a thatch of plaited coconut leaves has a very circum- scribed distribution in East Africa, where its limits are conterminous with those of the Swahili people and of coconut cultivation. Along the coast it has almost the same geographical range as the outrigger canoe, whilst inland it penetrates a comparatively short distance. This rectangular type of hut is not known elsewhere in Kenya and Tanganyika than in this coastal strip; as its plan and roofing are similar to those of the commonest of Indonesian huts, we cannot but conclude that these characteristics are of overseas origin and were introduced into East Africa by the same people, Western Indonesians, who brought to Africa the coconut palm and the double outrigger canoe. The Flat-Bar Zither. This very peculiar musical instrument has a present-day distributional range, as given by Curt Sachs, limited so far as we know to the Celebes, Moluccas, Sumba, Madagascar, the Swahili coast of East Africa, and inland therefrom to the neighbourhood of Lake Tanganyika (Text-fig. 3).1 It is unknown in India, Persia, Arabia, Egypt and Western Africa; it follows, therefore, that the only possible source from which East Africa could have obtained the invention is from Indonesia, either directly or indirectly by way of Madagascar. Leaf-bound Funnel Clarinet. This peculiar form of clarinet, recorded by Sachs2 under the name " Basttrichterklarinette," and by Hornbostel as " bark-funnel clarinet," has been found in the south of- Sumatra, in the Mentawei and Nias Islands off the west coast of the same island, and in the Celebes, Timor and Flores; it is also recorded as in use among the Akamba, a Bantu tribe living in the Kilima Njaro region of East Africa, a locality which we may well consider to represent the Mountains of the Moon to which some of the people of Komr (Madagascar) are said to have trekked from the coast, according to Ibn Said as already quoted. 1 For further details see Curt Sachs, Geist und WVerden der Musikinstrumente, Berlin, 1929, p. 201; W. Kaudern, Musical Instruments in Celebes, G6teborg, 1927, pp. 146 ff. and 293 ff.; E. M. v. Hornbostel.

Wind-Rattles. The wind-rattle as known from the Celebes and East Asia is another sound-producing instrument which would seem to have been introduced by Indonesians into East Africa, where it is found at the present day in Tanganyika Territory, according to Hornbostel.1 That these three Indonesian instruments should be localized in Africa in the Kenya- Tanganyika area, the hinterland of the Zenj coast, lends notable weight to the other evidence here adduced of Indonesian contact with East Africa. 2.

Fishing Weirs. Extensive fishing pounds made up of lengthy " leaders " or arms, formed of lines of vertical stakes having their lower ends driven into the muddy bottom of estuaries and bays and their above-ground sections interwoven with branches to make a close screen in order to form directive barriers leading fish to an apical trap, are characteristic of Malayan methods of sea- fishing at the present day. Similar weirs are also found on the East African coast, one being 1 Africa, vol. vi, No. 3, 1933, p. 291.</page><page sequence="25">JAMES HORNELL.-Indonesian Influence on Ecast African Culture. 329 seen in the views of the foreshore at Mombasa taken by Dr. A. C. Haddon in 1905 (Man, 1918, 29). So far as I know, Arabs never construct marine fish weirs, and in India they are unknown except in the neighbourhood of Bombay, where they are of special design, not truly comparable with those of East Africa, the Malay Peninsula and Indonesia. String Figures. So far as our knowledge at present extends, string figures are not numerous among the peoples of Sumatra and Java; neither are there many among the Malagasy. The only one I was able to collect from among a regiment of Malagasy soldiers recruited in 1926 by the French for service in Syria was a simple one known right across Africa under slightly variable workings from Uganda (Nzige, the locust)' to Sierra Leone (Mende tribe; " Tied strings ").2 As this figure has not been recorded from the Dutch Indies, its presence in Madagascar suggests an African origin and may have been introduced by African slaves or prisoners brought by Indonesians from the mainland of Africa. For a description see the appendix. Zimbabwe and other Rhodesitan Ruins. Finally, it seems to be probable that Indonesian culture exerted indirect influence upon the people to whom we owe the inception of the Rhodesian stone-built ruins, of which Zimbabwe is the earliest, the most extensive and the best known. Although there can now be no doubt that these buildings are the product of Bantu skill and adaptability, foreign influence must have had some part, remote and indirect though it seems to have been, in giving inspiration and direction to the Bantu architects and craftsmen. As Miss Caton-Thompson says of the Zimbabwe ruins, " One or two features may, perhaps, not unreasonably be attributed to a foreign original in some coastal settlement, filtered through the Bantu mind and adapted by Bantu hands into the form familiar in the ruins and again, " The trade connection with India is undoubtedly strong-indeed I believe it to have been the primary stimulus which led to the development of the indigenous Zimbabwe culture."3 These are fair statements of what I believe did occur in the cultural history of certain of the Bantu tribes of Rhodesia and the Victoria Nyanza region, if Indonesia be linked with India in the second quAtation. Bantus in contact with Indonesian settlements on the coast, trading with Indonesian merchants and probably serving them as servants, boatmen and possibly soldiers, would carry back to the tribal home memories of the fortified settlements and religious edifices reared by the strangers and of the great ships anchored in the harbours and at times under repair on the beach. In the case of the Rhodesian Bantu, who had suitable building material ready to their hand, features of the coastal buildings may have been incorporated crudely in the stone buildings 1 W. A.

Ray.

While it may be only a coincidence, the fagade of the ruins of Nanatali, figured by D. IRandall-Maclver both in the frontispiece and on pl. xxi of his Mediceval Rhodesia (1906), has remarkable points of resemblance with certain constructional features of the upper terraces of Boro Budur. In both an open chequer pattern is characteristic-in the walls of the small bell-shaped shrines on the uppermost platform of the Javanese temple (P1. XLII, Fig. 2); as a band of five courses in the girdle wall of Nanatali (P1. XLII, Fig. 1). The broad " battlements " of Nanatali, each surmounted by a granite monolith, 0 50 m. high, have also a superficial appearance of being clumsy imitations of the small shrines surmounted by a pointed finial which encircle the three upper platforms of Boro Budur. Although Nanatali, being dated as post-media-val by MacIver, is much posterior in time to Boro Budur, there is no reason to doubt that in its architectural design it continued the tradition set up by Zimbabwe, which was founded at a period approximately contemporaneous to or slightly later than the Javanese masterpiece. Possibly the Conical Tower of Zimbabwe may be itself a rude representation of a Buddhist stupa, for both are solid throughout, without chambering. That the Indonesian settlers did erect substantial buildings when suitable material was available is attested by Ibn al-Mujawir, who, as we have already noted, records seeing the remains of their stone-built houses at Aden in the year A.D. 1223. The disappearance of all traces of their buildings on the East African coast is remarkable only so far as the same has occurred in Madagascar and Sumatra. But even if we were to admit that Indonesian influence, however indirect and remote, is not traceable with any certainty in the architectural plan or in the details of the Rhodesian ruins, the presence of certain forms of coloured glass beads in and below the lower occupation floor in the ruins of Zimbabwe suggests, by their similarity to beads found in South India and at various centres in Indonesia, from the Malay Peninsula to the Philippines and even as far afield as the Pelews,' that at the earliest period of Bantu occupation there was contact either with traders from South India or from Indonesia or with both. The age assigned to beads of the same description found at Tangal, in South India, is about the eighth century A.D., whilst the ninth century is given for those of another find in the Malay Peninsula.2 Both these datings agree with a period when we have the first records of African slaves being sent from Sumatra and Java as part of the tribute paid to the Chinese suzerains-from Sumatra in A.D. 724 and from Java in A.D. 813, as already detailed. These slaves must have been obtained on the African coast either by raiding or by barter; when by barter, then coloured glass beads and copper wire (of which quantities have been found at low stratification levels in several of the ruins) would form suitable articles of exchange. This record of the possession of slaves from 1 J. S. Kubary, Ethnograph. Beitrage zur Kenntniss des Karolinen Archipels, 1889-1895, vol. i, pp. 1-28, with Plate 1. 2 H. Beek, in Miss Caton-Thompson's Zimbabwe Culture, p. 234.</page><page sequence="27">JAMES HORNELL.-Indonesian Influence on East African Culture. 331 the East African coast by Indonesians, coupled with the fact that in their thriving and long- established colony in Madagascar the Indonesians had a foothold convenient for trading with the African coast, renders it much more likely that the traders with whom the early Bantu of Zimbabwe bartered gold, ivory, iron and slaves, were Indonesians (Sumatrans) rather than people from South India. The latter never imported East African or Bantu slaves, and their voyages to Africa suffered restriction both by the long distance to be traversed and the adverse weather which prevails during the south-west monsoon. Neither had they need to import either iron, ivory or gold, for India is rich in all these products; her stores of iron ore are vast, the enormous extent of ancient gold workings in the Deccan prove that she had no occasion to import gold,3 while her herds of elephants supplied all the ivory that her craftsmen required. Miss Caton-Thompson estimates the original foundation of Zimbabwe, as dated by the beads found below the first occupation floor, as probably made some time from the ninth to the tenth century A.D. (op. cit., p. 188). This dating is well within the period when collateral evidence suggests that Indonesian influence on the coast was still strong and had not as yet been obliterated by aggressive Arab competition. Edrisi's evidence, already quoted, is of the utmost importance in this connection, for his statement, dated A.D. 1154, that the people of Zabag (Sumatra) come to the Sofala coast in search of iron, and that they and the people of Komr (Madagascar) were on friendly trading terms with the negroes of South-east Africa, suggests pointedly that these were the foreigners with whom the people of Zimbabwe and the other Rhodesian centres traded for several centuries after the first occupation of the Zimbabwe site and until they were supplanted by Islamic Arabs. That so little positive evidence of Indonesian influence survives in Africa is paralleled by the fall into utter oblivion of the once mighty Srivijayan empire of Sumatra, an empire of which all knowledge was lost and forgotten until the decipherment of a few old and widely scattered inscriptions and search' in Chinese annals revealed something of its importance and of the wide extent of its dominion prior to its fall in the thirteenth century in conflict with the Javanese empire of Majapahit. As for Madagascar itself, were it not for the incontrovertible evidence of language and physical traits, it would be very difficult-indeed it would be impossible-to prove from direct historical records that migration on a comparatively extensive 1 The great extent and importance of the ancient gold-mining industry in India has been insufficiently realized; even Miss Caton-Thompson suggests that India was importing great quantities of gold during the time that Zimbabwe flourished. Now, apart from old workings that have been found in Mysore, the schist belt that runs through the Raichur Doab in Hyderabad State is honeycombed with the ramifications of ancient shafts and tunnellings made by miners in extracting gold. Mr. C. Beadon, a mining engineer of the Ooregum Gold Mining Company of India, Ltd., in a letter to me dated June 15th, 1915, with reference to evidence of ancient chank-bangle factories at Maski and Nilogal in this district, together with other signs that these places were at one time flourishing manufacturing and business centres, states that the explanation is to be found in " the enormous number of old [gold] workings all over the schist belt, the examination of some of which is my object in being here." Malny of these old workings were found to be sunk to an extra- ordinary depth considering the miners' lack of modern tools and engineering appliances; the amount of gold extracted must have been enormous. Strangely enough, no memory survives in the district of aught pertaining to these old gold mines, of whose existence the local people were actualy unaware until they were discovered by European prospectors.</page><page sequence="28">332 JAMES HORNELL.-Indonesian Influence on East African CuIlture. scale had taken place from Sumatra and Java to that island, sea-sundered by a distance of more than 3,500 miles.

Although there were several hundred of his fellow-countrymen aboard, no other figure was obtainable. Betsileo string figure. (No name given.) i. Place a loop over both little fingers, extend and turn the hands palms outwards, bringing both strings between the index and thumb of each hand. 2. Rotate the left hand towards the body, passing it under the strings and back into position again. This carries the two strings across the back of the left hand. 3. Insert the left index under the right palmar strings and extend; similarly, pull out the left palmar strings with the right index. 4. Pass the left thumb under the strings from the back of the hand where they emerge between the index and the thumb, and hook it over the radial index strings to prevent them from slipping. 5. Slip the strings which cross the back of the left hand over the tips of the left-hand fingers; then unhook the left thumb from its hold, release the right-thumb loop and extend. 6. By dropping the index loops, the figure dissolves. EXPLANATION OF PLATES. Plate XXXVIII, Fig. 1. A type of the two-masted outrigger vessels used by the Javanese for voyaging in the ninth century. Sculptured on a panel of the Boro Budur stupa, Java. Its outrigger is of a most elaborate type, strongly reinforced by brackets and stays; the masts are biped, the sails rectangular, lashed head and foot to yard and boom respectively. Compare this sail with that of the mtepe of Zanzibar. Plate XXXVIII, Fig. 2. A large Javanese outrigger coaster, photographed at Grisee, near Sourabaya, Java, in 1918. Plate XXXIX, Fig. 1. A Sakalavan sailing outrigger canoe, Nossi-be, Madagascar. The outrigger is single, but the second unit of a double outrigger canoe is present in a vestigial condition. When sail is set the mast and sprit diverge and give to the square sail the appearance of being extended on two sprits, without any mast, properly speaking. (1926.) Plate XXXIX, Fig. 2.
