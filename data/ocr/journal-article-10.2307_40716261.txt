In so doing, we chose an area of particular strength for the Museum- American Drawings and Watercolors, 1900-1945. Due to the fragile nature of these works, they are not always on display at the Museum. To familiarize the public with this special part of the Museum's hold- ings, we are pleased to present these unique works in greater depth. We asked Ruth L. Bohan, Associate Professor at the University of Missouri- St. Louis, to write this Bulletin. After reviewing our rich holdings, Professor Bohan, a specialist in American art of the twentieth century, enthusiastically agreed. A selection of 35 of our best works by 18 artists was chosen for this Bulletin. Professor Bohan has done a marvelous job and has presented insight- ful and scholarly research. I would like to take this opportunity to heartily thank her.

Unlike American painting and sculpture, which began attracting the attention of collec- tors and critics early in the nineteenth century, interest in American drawings received only modest attention until this century. Perhaps because of their greater similarity to oil painting, watercolors gained public acceptance first, and by the mid-nineteenth century were attract- ing the attention of private collectors. The founding in 1866 of The American Society of Painters in Water Color, later the American Water Color Society, helped stimulate interest. Still, it was not until 1922 with the publication of Albert E. Gallatin's American Water- Colourists, that the field received its first book-length treatise.1 Theodore Bolton's Early American Portrait Draughtsmen in Crayons, pub- lished the following year, provided the first serious consideration of American drawings.2 But it has really been only in the last twenty-five years that this area of the fine arts has begun to attract the serious and sustained attention of a sub- stantial number of scholars and museum professionals. Since artists first began to commit their thoughts and feelings to paper, drawings have served a variety of purposes and utilized a wide range of media and tech- niques. As employed today the term "drawing" is used to identify almost any work of art on paper. This includes works in pastel, gouache, charcoal, chalk, pen and ink, graphite, crayon, and watercolor. Contrary to the once standard view which held all works on paper to be of lesser significance than either paintings or sculptures, we now recognize and applaud the breadth and richness of the genre and point to indi- vidual examples as being among the choicest works in the entire repertoire of American art. The generally small size and fragile nature of most drawings have no doubt contributed to their being per- ceived as inherently inferior to their generally larger and more ambitious counterparts on canvas. However, the compelling beauty and intellectual challenge posed by many of the works discussed in this Bulletin provide con- vincing evidence of the folly of such outmoded beliefs. American artists active in the early twen- tieth century explored a broad range of drawing styles, media, and techniques, which paralleled developments in other branches of the fine arts. The Museum's holdings in this area offer a rich chroni- cle of the major tendencies which char- acterized the American artistic community before 1940. This Bulletin examines 35 works of art by 18 artists. The works span the years 1896-1939 and constitute the core of the Museum's collection of early twentieth-century American drawings and watercolors. The term "American" is broadly defined to include both artists born in the United States and immigrants whose careers flourished in this country. Characteristic of the period and evident in the Museum's holdings are the rich blend of European and American influ- ences which have informed so much of the history of American art. One sees, for example, the movement away from the nineteenth-century interest in land- scape and sentimental genre to an involvement in urban and architectural themes. One sees as well the movement toward abstraction and a more expres- sionistic handling of forms. Cubism, photography, and an interest in the machine aesthetic are equally promi- nent. At the same time, the collection reflects the continuing vitality of the realist tradition and of such highly tradi- tional subjects as nudes and still lifes. The collection provides a particularly vivid perspective on the variety of forces propelling artists to express themselves on paper. Most of the artists included in the Museum's holdings produced a sub- stantial body of work in other media as well. Archipenko, Lachaise, Nadelman, and Storrs were primarily sculptors who approached drawing as an aid to memory and a stimulus to their explorations of human and architectural form. Most of the remaining artists were painters. Of the artists who excelled in watercolor, Burchfleld, Demuth, Marin, Marsh, and Prendergast contributed significantly toward establishing that medium as the visual and intellectual equal of painting. The various ends to which a single artist might direct his efforts on paper is evi- dent in the several works of Hartley and Marin. Both artists are represented by highly finished pastels and watercolors intended for exhibition purposes and by drawings which served as preliminary studies for still other works of art. Happily, the painting that resulted from Hartley's drawing, Smelt Brook Falls , is also owned by the Museum. The weak- ening of the boundaries that traditionally separated the fine and the popular arts and the way early twentieth-century artists felt newly empowered to move freely back and forth between the two is revealed in the work of Matulka, Stella, Shinn, and Sloan. All four are repre- sented by at least one drawing intended for reproduction in the popular press. Sloan's two drawings are steeped in explicit social and political commentary and reveal the ways he purposely dis- tanced his drawings from his oils, while Matulka 's pen and ink cover for The Masses continues themes explored elsewhere in his art. 4</page><page sequence="6">The collection demonstrates both the range of media favored by early twentieth-century American artists and the tendency, apparent in other branches of the fine arts, toward experimentation. Shinn radically transformed the once genteel media of chalk and pastel by utilizing them for his decidedly non- genteel portrayals of turn-of-the-century urban life. Sloan's use of crayon for politically motivated drawings like Direct 'Action"! significantly departed from accepted turn-of-the-century prac- tices and allied his work with the graphic tradition of social protest established by Honoré Daumier and others in the pre- ceding century. Prendergast, Marin, and Luks devised innovative approaches to watercolor, and more than a few of the artists combined media to achieve new and often startling results. The lives of each of the artists discussed in this Bulletin bridge the years between the nineteenth and twentieth centuries. The oldest, Maurice Prendergast, was born in 1858, two years before the onset of the Civil War. The youngest, Charles Burchfield and Yasuo Kuniyoshi, were born the year of the World's Columbian Exposition, 1893. Both individually and collectively their work reflects the grow- ing cosmopolitanism of the American art world in the early years of this century. All but two of the artists (Burchfield and Sloan) studied or lived portions of their lives in Europe, while six (Archipenko, Kuniyoshi, Lachaise, Matulka, Nadelman, and Stella) were born abroad. Of these, all but Kuniyoshi and Stella came to this country already well-established in their careers. Nearly half of the artists discussed in this Bulletin (Archipenko, Lachaise, Nadelman, Storrs, Hartley, Luks, and Prendergast) are represented elsewhere in the Museum's collections. Four addi- tional artists, known primarily for their work in oils (Demuth, Hopper, Sheeler, and Stella) , are represented only by their works on paper. For both groups of artists the Museum's holdings provide telling insights into their working meth- ods and into the range of subjects and intellectual concerns that guided their careers. The Museum began seriously building its collection of early twentieth-century drawings and watercolors in the 1930s. Burchfield's Sulphurous Evening, pur- chased in 1936 just seven years after its completion, was the first work discussed in this Bulletin to enter the collection. Through a combination of purchases and generous donations the Museum has substantially expanded its holdings over the last fifty years. Morton D. May and Mr. and Mrs. Richard K. Weil, donors who are better known for their gifts in other of the Museum's collecting areas, contributed three important works in the late 1950s and early 1960s: Archipenko 's Two Nudes, Hartley's Still Life, and Prendergast's Mulberry Bend Park, New York. Brothers F. Lee Hawes and Richard S. Hawes III donated sixteen Shinns purchased by their father, two of which are discussed on the following pages. Mr. and Mrs. G. Gordon Hertslet have also given generously. Over a five- year period beginning in 1967 they donated eight of the works discussed in this Bulletin. Five of these came in 1972 as part of the Bequest of Marie Setz Hertslet. Among these were Marin's Weehawken, New Jersey, and Shinn's New York Horse Car. This publication is intended primarily as an educational tool, a guide to the most important early twentieth-century Amer- ican drawings and watercolors owned by the Museum. The eighteen artists are arranged alphabetically and their works discussed chronologically. Tanya S. Yatzek compiled the provenance, bibli- ographies, and exhibition histories on the individual works and handled much of the correspondence. James D. Burke, Director of the Museum, and Judith Weiss Levy, Curator in the Department of Prints, Drawings and Photographs, invited me to prepare this publication. For this opportunity I am especially grateful. I would also like to thank Judith Levy and Michael E. Shapiro, Chief Curator, for their careful reading of the manuscript and their sup- port throughout the project. Additional members of the Museum staff have been particularly helpful in facilitating my access to the works and in assisting me with the research. I owe a special debt of gratitude to Curatorial Assistant Elizabeth M. Wright in the Museum's Department of Prints, Drawings and Photographs; Stephanie Sigala, the Museum Librarian; and the staff of the Richardson Memorial Library. Without their help this Bulletin could never have been completed. I would also like to thank several individuals and institutions who generously responded to requests for information and photographs: Virginia C. Elliott, Sarah Greenough, Gail Levin, Emily R. Pulitzer, Diane Tepfer, Theodore Stebbins, Carol Troyen, Rebecca Zurrier, the Babcock Galleries, the Burchfield Art Center, the Delaware Art Museum, the Kraushaar Galleries, the Lane Foundation, the Museum of Modern Art, the Robert Schoelkopf Gallery, Ltd., and the Weyhe Gallery.

Sev- eral of these early works demonstrated the artist's social consciousness. "In others," he explained, "I tried to express the ingrown lives of solitary people."4 In time, Burchfield 's houses came to sym- bolize not only the lives of their individ- ual inhabitants but what he perceived as the tenor of small town Middle Western life generally. Burchfield 's treatment of small town life shares much in common with the realist writers of the 1920s and 1930s. Burchfield read and greatly admired the novels of Sherwood Anderson, Zona Gale, and Willa Cather. He sympathized with their harsh critique of the physical and psychological limitations of Middle Western life, yet consistently found a kind of poetry beneath the often austere outward manifestations of life on the "middle border."5 Sulphurous Evening, begun in 1922 and completed in 1929, depicts a simple nineteenth-century Italianate dwelling located on Wadsworth Street near Days Park in Buffalo, New York. Burchfield moved to the Buffalo area just the year before, and in 1925 purchased and lived the remainder of his life in a simple frame dwelling, not substantially unlike the one shown here. He recalled com- pleting the original sketch in July or August, 1922. Comparison of the water- color with a photograph of the actual house taken in 1944 by Charles Elliott reveals the artist's remarkable ability to evoke a spiritually unified scene through the conscious structuring and manipula- tion of its constituent elements (Figure 1). In place of the elegantly crisp propor- tions of the original house, Burchfield presents us with a weathered, cranky dwelling of chunkier dimensions and simpler details. "I exaggerated the unevenness of the clapboards to make them more interesting," Burchfield remarked. He also "juxtaposed the half- opened shutters to give the house a cross-eyed look and to create a spooky feeling."6 Figure 1 , House in Sulphurous Evening, photographed by Phillip C. Elliott, Good Friday, 1944, Courtesy of Mrs. Phillip C. Elliott. The sulphurous color of the sky, which Burchfield based on observations of the skies accompanying midwestern August storms, contributes to the eerie quality of the whole. "Something tremendous, or even disastrous seems about to happen" under such an "ominous yellow light," Burchfield observed.7 With its con- notations of the satanic fires of hell, Burchfield 's choice of the word "sul- phurous" to describe the scene conjures up images of the scorching heat of an August evening, with more sinister con- notations equally possible. The term seems also to suggest the oppressive lives of those who inhabit the house and its environs. Burchfield 's distinctive watercolor tech- nique supports and extends the ominous feeling projected by the house and sky. In contrast to the clear washes and trans- lucent colors traditionally associated with the watercolor medium, Burchfield utilized a rugged, overlapping stroke and colors substantially grayed and muted in tonality. The result is a work in which form, color and technique support and reinforce one another to create an image of compelling poetic mystery out of a seemingly unremarkable scene. Provenance (Frank K.

(10 x 14 in.) Signed lower left: C. Demuth, 1918 Gift of Mr. and Mrs. G. Gordon Hertslet 46: 1968 In the summer and early fall of 1916, while living in the resort community of Provincetown, Massachusetts, Demuth became interested in combining architec- ture and landscape elements. He contin- ued his explorations over the next several years, first in Bermuda, and then during summer visits to Gloucester and Pro- vincetown between 1917 and 1920. The resulting watercolors marked a signifi- cant departure from his figurative work of the preceding period, and lay the foun- dation for his highly regarded Precision- ist paintings of the 1920s and 1930s. In his pursuit of more architectonic subjects, Demuth built on the example of artists in his immediate circle, par- ticularly Marsden Hartley and Albert Gleizes. But it was his study of the late watercolors of Cézanne that offered him the greatest inspiration and guidance. From Cézanne Demuth devised ways of combining the organicism of his pre- vious work with his new found interest in geometry. Rooftops and Fantasy, painted in Provincetown in the summer of 1918, demonstrates the high level of sophistica- tion and originality that characterized Demuth 's experiments in this new direction. Like the other watercolors produced that summer, Rooftops and Fantasy records Demuth 's progress toward Cubism. The insistent geometry of the simple gable roofs acts as an effective counterpoint to the more organic trunk and branches of the centrally positioned tree. The rectan- gular roof planes jostle one another as they hover around and attempt to encir- cle the lone tree. The sense of hovering is reinforced by the roofs' soft, pale colors, their unevenly colored surfaces, and the incomplete rendering of their forms. 10</page><page sequence="12">By extending the edges of these man- made structures outward beyond their natural boundaries, Demuth created force lines emanating from the actual objects. These lines disrupt the continu- ity of the surrounding space even as they intersect and overlap the planar surfaces of adjacent roofs. The result is a highly complex and constantly shifting series of spatial relationships. The sinewy branches of the richly colored tree and the meticulously scalloped edges of its diaphanous green foliage represent a controlled middle ground between the free-wheeling organicism of the natural world and the geometric rigor of the manmade. As a watercolorist, Demuth had few equals. From the opaque black windows near the center of the composition to the thinly painted roofs near the periphery, Rooftops and Fantasy displays the full range and originality of his talents. The crisp, scalloped edges defining some of the foliage seem almost to defy the natu- ral fluidity of the medium. At the same time, the distinctive mottled effects observed in the handling of the foliage demonstrate Demuth 's skillful use of blotting, a technique he introduced in 1916 and which contributes to the rich textural variety of his later work. Above all one senses Demuth 's absolute control of his medium. Provenance Mrs. Charles Kunze, Bronxville, NY; (James St. Lawrence O'Toole Associates, New York); Mr. &amp; Mrs. G.

St. Louis: The Saint Louis Art Museum, 1975, p. 247, illus. In 1922 Demuth returned to Lancaster, Pennsylvania, to live. His decision to leave New York and return to the city of his birth was prompted in large measure by his deteriorated health. The previous year Demuth had been diagnosed as having diabetes. Demuth 's health mark- edly improved in March 1923, when he began receiving the newly developed drug, insulin, but he was never to regain his full strength or stamina. In Lancaster his mother supervised his diet, which had to be carefully monitored for the remainder of his life, thereby allowing him to focus his waning energies exclu- sively on his art. Demuth began working more consis- tently in watercolor after his return to Lancaster. He commenced a series of still lifes which continued the structural lessons of his Bermuda and Province- town landscapes while focusing on sim- ple arrangements of fruits, vegetables, and flowers. But in this later series Demuth returned to a more straightfor- ward presentation of objects in space, turning away from the complex network of interwoven planes so characteristic of his earlier work. In Eggplant and Green Pepper two com- mon garden vegetables share space on a circular, woven table or tray with a sim- ple glass jar from whose mouth a single leaf casually protrudes. An array of flowers, green foliage, and what appear to be a pair of sloping tree trunks estab- lish the backdrop. The vegetables are rendered with great sensitivity to the subtle irregularities in their smooth and undulating surfaces. Their rounded shapes catch and reflect light in ways that reveal Demuth 's mastery of the formal lessons of Cézanne. But where the natu- ral objects in Cezanne's still lifes suggest the permanence and solidity of inorganic matter, Demuth 's vegetables conjure up witty, anthropomorphic associations. Demuth continued utilizing the blotting technique and leaving large portions of the paper blank. His work displays tre- mendous control, but his forms are more organic and his watercolor technique correspondingly more fluid than in his work of the late 1910s and early 1920s. Of particular interest are the graphite passages that remain uncolored both in the floral areas in the background and in the rectangular patterning in the fore- ground. Passages such as these, which he first introduced into his work at this time, enhance and extend the ethereal delicacy of the composition as a whole. Provenance Estate of the artist; Robert E.

The small but ardent group of artists and critics who frequented Stieglitz 's gallery at 291 Fifth Avenue stimulated and reinforced Hartley's own emerging enthusiasm for the newer ten- dencies in art. Exhibitions of the work of Matisse, Picasso, and Cézanne, together with the group's ongoing discussions on aesthetic issues, proved decisive in redirecting Hartley's art away from the Post-Impressionist manner of his earlier work and toward the formal challenges suggested by the work of Cézanne and the Cubists. Stieglitz exhibited Cezanne's work for the first time in the spring of 1911 . Hartley, however, missed this exhibition and did not see a Cézanne painting first- hand until late that year or early the next, when Arthur B. Davies took him to see the Havemeyer Collection. Conse- quently, when Hartley commenced his first group of Cézanne-inspired still lifes in 1910, he had only black and white reproductions of Cezanne's work and the example of Max Weber to guide him. Weber first experienced Cezanne's work in 1906 in the Paris apartment of Gertrude and Leo Stein. The following year he painted several Cézanne-inspired still lifes which combined the formal experiments of Cézanne with the rich coloring of Matisse. He continued to champion Cézanne after joining the Stieglitz circle in 1909 and later that year returned briefly to a series of Cézannesque still lifes. Like Weber's early still lifes, Hartley's pastel combines a knowledge of Cezanne's formalism with the vibrant tonalities of Matisse. The flattened picture space, distorted perspective, boulder-like fruit and coarsely folded drapery demonstrate Hartley's careful study of Cézanne. At the same time the green vase, orange and yellow flowers, navy, mauve and blue-green draperies, and yellow, orange and pink foreground fruit bespeak his appreciation of the Fauve influence of Matisse. Pink and yellow contouring on the fruit reflects additional allegiance to the emotionally charged coloration of Matisse, while the bluish shadows on the vase and lemon belie the lingering effects of Impression- ism and Post-Impressionism. One early critic aptly described Hartley's work of this period as "superheated," terming his colors "deep and often spiritual."8 The coarse texture and charcoal coloring of the paper add to the deep resonance of the colors and complement the work's bold forms and jagged contours. The mountain-like fold of the drapery in the lower right hints at Hartley's later attrac- tion to Cezanne's mountains, a subject that would occupy much of his attention in the 1920s. Marsden Hartley was a master of the pastel medium which he utilized throughout his career for the same range of subjects depicted in his oils. In Still Life the medium convincingly conveys a sense of the firmness and solidity of the objects. Elsewhere Hartley employed it for more suggestive ends. The floral subject matter of Still Life, like the medium Hartley employed to depict it, was one to which he returned frequently throughout his life. The last painting on his easel when he died in 1943 was a bouquet of roses. Provenance Estate of Alfred Stieglitz, New York; Morton D. May, St. Louis Exhibitions 1979, St. Louis.

Hartley lived portions of 1935 and 1936 in Nova Scotia where he boarded with the rugged, French Canadian family of Francis and Martha Mason. For the peripatetic Hartley the experience was one of the richest and most emotionally satisfying of his life. However, on September 19, 1936, this happy idyll came to an abrupt and tragic end when the two grown Mason sons and their cousin were drowned in a boating acci- dent during a fierce North Atlantic storm. Hartley was devastated by the disaster and channeled his grief into a series of brooding landscapes and sea- scapes and a fictionalized tribute to the family, which he called "Cleophas and His Own, A North Atlantic Tragedy."9 Smelt Brook Falls constitutes the pre- liminary study for an oil painting, also owned by The Saint Louis Art Museum, that Hartley completed the following summer as part of this series (Figure 2). Both symbolize characteristics Hartley associated with the family. Even before the tragedy Hartley likened the family, both collectively and individually, to natural phenomena. "They are so utterly &amp; completely free of neuroses of any sort, and maintain an enviable balance between the material &amp; the spiritual worlds that they symbolize for me the term, ideal," Hartley wrote his friend Adelaide Kuntz. " Every one of 'em like rocks from which fresh springs flow without hindrance." Shortly after the deaths, Hartley again acknowledged the "rich fund of natural associations" tied up for him in his relations with the fam- ily. He judged them "among the very choicest of nature's gifts," described "a deep river of love running through them all," and expressed a desire to paint "a series of invented portraits of them."10 Figure 2 , Marsden Hartley, Smelt Brook Falls, 1937, oil on board, 71 . 1 x 55.9 cm. , Purchase: Eliza McMillan Purchase Fund. 14</page><page sequence="16">The flowing water, the rocks, and the river below in Smelt Brook Falls speak directly and forcibly to the viewer, unen- cumbered by the overlay of mystical and numerical symbolism Hartley employed four years earlier in his symbolic tribute to another drowning victim, Hart Crane (Eight Bells ' Folly, Memorial for Hart Crane, 1933, University of Minnesota) . The local lore in Maine surrounding the drowning of two sisters in a nearby waterfall no doubt strengthened the asso- ciation for Hartley between the falls and the Mason family.11 Like the other sym- bolic landscapes in the series, the subject provided Hartley with an important tran- sition into the "invented portraits" he commenced from memory in 1938, the first painted portraits of his career. It also marked his return to Maine and the beginning of his highly regarded late landscape manner. Hartley completed the drawing in Georgetown, Maine, where he spent the summer of 1937. His custom was to sketch directly from nature and to com- plete the oil painting in his studio with the sketch and memory to guide him. The drawing presents a far more natural- istic treatment of the trees, rocks, and falls than the painting. In the latter the forms have been considerably simplified and emboldened in both form and color. The falls appear opaque, the rocks like giant boulders, and the trees flatter and more rigid. The meandering irregularity of the drawing's chalky white falls is transformed into continuous bands of stark white water in the painting that look almost like a frozen ice sculpture. Although the sketch was made in the summer, the completed painting exudes the rich tonalities of autumn, perhaps because the drownings took place in the early fall and because it was Hartley's favorite season.

Hopper enjoyed all types of boats from breezy sailing vessels to rugged fishing trawlers like the Osprey. As a youth he built his own cat boat and at one point considered becoming a naval archi- tect. Time spent along the New England coast beginning in the 1910s stimulated his interest in boats and inspired a sub- stantial number of paintings with nauti- cal themes. Bow of Beam Trawler Osprey is one of several nautical subjects painted during a seven- week stay in Rockland, Maine, in 1926. Hopper depicted the Osprey in a number of watercolors that season, viewing the boat both from the shore and from its deck. This version shows the deck, looking toward the rust-colored bow, with a large net or trawl line sus- pended from an overhead pulley just to the right of center. Ropes, pulleys, and other nautical equipment give the deck a crowded appearance and restrict the space available for human activity. Sev- eral long shadows cut across the floor and forward wall, breaking up the space even further. The central and largely vertical clustering of ropes, pulleys, beams, and the partially visible smoke- stack and telephone pole on shore create a sense of congestion and confusion rare in Hopper's mature work. Hopper had worked in watercolor since the early 1900s, but in 1923 began to take the medium more seriously. A successful solo exhibition of his watercolors at the Frank K. M. Rehn Gallery in New York in 1924 marked a turning point in his career. The sale of 16 watercolors allowed him to give up commercial work and devote full time to his painting. The colors in Bow of Beam Trawler Osprey are limited to a narrow range of browns, blue-grays, rusts, and tans. The rust-colored surfaces of the trawler's forward cabin and side walls effectively capture the mottled patina of age and frequent use. The prominent play of shadows which crisscross the composi- tion, adding pattern and drama to the otherwise quiet, unruffled scene, are rendered in a softened bluish-gray. Perhaps because the lighting is not so intense as in many of Hopper's better known works, the element of mystery is more subdued as well.

Japan, 1893-1953 As an artist, Kuniyoshi's stated desire was "to combine the rich traditions of the East with my accumulative experi- ences and viewpoint of the West."12 In Bedroom, completed nearly 20 years after the artist's arrival in this country from his native Japan, one experiences a rich blending of Japanese, American, and European influences in a style indis- putably Kuniyoshi's own. The rich, brushed ink of the billowing foreground curtain, together with the delicate linear patterning on the pitcher, rug, and chamber pot, recall aspects of the age-old Eastern calligraphic tradi- tion. Kuniyoshi's studies of the folk art traditions of this country, especially the crisp, untutored paintings and decorative arts objects of the American primitives, contribute to Bedroom's linear pattern- ing, skewed perspective, and focus on simple household objects. No less impor- tant was Kuniyoshi's admiration of the art of Cézanne and the Cubists. The jumble of roofs and building parts piled up out- side the open window and the tilted table and pitcher within bear witness to Kuniyoshi's fondness for Cezanne's still lifes and Cubist landscapes. Prior to his first trip to Europe in the mid- 1920s Kuniyoshi worked almost exclusively from memory and the imagi- nation, not from the object itself. Such a working method no doubt contributed to the dream-like quality and ambiguous spatial relationships which dominate Bedroom and other works of this period. Bedroom probably derives from the interior of the artist's apartment in the Columbia Heights section of Brooklyn where he settled in 1919. The simultane- ous presentation of interior and exterior views, which Kuniyoshi used to great effect in his still lifes of the 1920s, cre- ates a tension between the confinement of the room and the expansiveness of the world beyond. Several elements in the composition, notably the fish, the leafy branch just outside the window, and the barren tree in the distance, constitute recurring motifs in Kuniyoshi's art. Fish began to appear in his art as he began spending summers at Hamilton Easter Field's Ogunquit School of Painting and Sculp- ture in Maine in 1918. The leafy branch has been identified as a reference to the Tree of Life in other paintings of this period, while the leafless tree would seem to have more ambiguous, personal significance. Kuniyoshi produced a number of impor- tant ink drawings in the early 1920s. Based on his own experiences, he pos- ited the opinion that as "an independent creation," drawing was "almost always freer and less self-conscious" than paint- ing. He explained further that It requires infinitely more knowledge to produce a drawing, which in itself speaks as eloquently as a painting, without relying on color. Most of us learn to draw before we learn to paint. However it is only after becoming a painter that one realizes the meaning of drawing, and goes back to relearn how to draw.13 Bedroom embodies the same visual and imaginative richness as Kuniyoshi's paintings, but its creative treatment of the blank page and the way it establishes its own boundaries independently of the terminating edge of the paper demon- strate the greater freedom Kuniyoshi brought to his drawings. Of equal inter- est is the rich range of colors and tex- tures Kuniyoshi achieved using only ink, charcoal, and the white of the page. One is immediately struck by the dramatic counterpoint established between the penetrating intensity of the billowing black curtain and the subtle modulations evident in the minutely detailed rug, pitcher, and shadows surrounding the simple bed frame.

France, 1882-1935 As a sculptor, Lachaise is best known for his depictions of heroically proportioned female nudes. His drawings, executed in ink, chalk, and graphite, display a simi- lar focus. Characterized by bold, undu- lating lines, sensuous contours, and an exaggerated approach to human anatomy, his drawings served as adjuncts to, rather than studies for, his sculpture. Nude and Torso, both executed in graph- ite, reveal two aspects of his drawing style. In Nude the anatomy is more dis- torted, the pose and gestures more the- atrical, and the enclosing outline thinner and more lyrical. The figure is partially enclosed in a transparent veil which cas- cades downward from her head, com- pleting and extending the triangular emphasis of her pose. In Torso the figure is both more boldly conceived and more bluntly rendered. Faceless and with portions of her head, arm, and legs cut off by the four edges of the paper, the woman's torso confronts the viewer frontally, her genitalia fully exposed, and one hand emphasizing the rounded contour of her ample breast. The figure is rendered with a bolder, thicker, more gestural line, recording both the chang- ing pressure of the artist's hand and the stops and starts of the drawing process. The highly simplified handling of the form and the way the undulating curves in the abdominal area echo the rounded contours of the woman's breasts reveal an underlying concern with abstract patterns. In both his sculptures and his drawings of the nude figure, Lachaise often treated the face as a mask. The oriental- inspired, slant-eyed mask in Nude appears on many of Lachaise 's drawings and is not limited to his depictions of women. The mask appears on his few male figures as well, creating a sort of androgyny within his oeuvre. The face- less nude in Torso also wears a mask, although this time the mask is centered on her anatomy. Her nipples are the eyes, her navel the nose, and her genita- lia an open mouth. 20 Provenance (above) The Lachaise Foundation; (Robert Schoelkopf Gallery, New York) Exhibitions 1979, St. Louis.

Like his interest in watercolor, his interest in marine themes and in the quiet, contemplative aspects of nature are not widely known. But subjects of this sort occupied his attention and became more prevalent during the 1920s. Scows at Night I and Scows at Night II capture two views of the same wharf. Both depict modest wooden boats docked in narrow boat slips, each viewed from the rear, and both place great emphasis on the reflections on the rippling fore- ground waters. In keeping with Luks' populist views, the boats are common, flat-bottomed fishing vessels. In Scows at Night II two fishermen sporting large sou 'westers stand on the decks of their respective vessels, perhaps readying them for the next day's launch. In Scows at Night /, at one time titled Reflections, two individuals in dark clothing fish from the dock. In both a large wooden building, elevated above the boats by an elaborate wooden scaffolding, dominates the background and keeps the picture space shallow. In his 1970 Master's thesis, Ralph Talcott characterized Luks' approach to the watercolor medium as that of an "experimenter." "In technique he ranged from pseudo-oil to expressive, two- dimensional patterns of the most modern simplicity," Talcott observed.15 After the paper dried, Luks often reworked pas- sages, much as one might in the oil medium, by applying additional color to achieve greater depth. The dark bluish-black patterning in the water of both works bears testimony to such reworking. The added color, applied with a drier brush over the royal blue, light green, salmon, and ocher first laid Scows at Night I, c. 1920 Watercolor 37.8 X 21.2 cm. (147/s X 83/sin.)

As such, it enhances the sense of mystery in these two night- time scenes. Luks was just as capable of achieving memorable results using clear washes. The luminous salmon-colored rudder in Scows at Night II and the shimmering yellow reflections visible beneath the wharf in Scows at Night I testify to his skills in the more traditional techniques of the medium. The lightness of Luks' touch is clearly apparent in the handling of the small rowboat and in the way he enhanced the sparkling effects of the water by allowing portions of the white paper to show through.

The two met in Paris in June through the interces- sion of the painter and photographer, Edward Steichen. At Steichen's sugges- tion Stieglitz exhibited Marin's work in his gallery at 291 Fifth Avenue earlier that year, and after the Paris encounter Stieglitz offered Marin a one-man show for the following year. Marin returned to New York in anticipation of the forth- coming exhibition and remained through the spring of 1910 before returning to the French capital for one additional year. During Marin's stay in New York he painted his first scenes of Manhattan and the Brooklyn Bridge, themes to which he would return again and again throughout the remainder of his life. He also com- pleted about a dozen watercolors of the industrial harbor of Weehawken, a com- munity just across the Hudson River from Manhattan where he spent most of his youth and young adulthood. In 1912 and again around 1916 Marin returned to the Weehawken docks to explore anew the industrial structures and the broad expanse of railroad tracks that formed the city's eastern boundary. In 1916 the series consisted of approximately one hundred works, all entitled Weehawken Sequence and all done in oil. Weehawken, New Jersey, completed in the late winter or early spring of 1910, shares with the works in the initial series a dramatic bird's-eye perspective and a colorful impressionistic palette. A multi- tude of brightly colored boxcars, one bearing the inscription, "Marin 10," extend at a slight diagonal across the foreground, while a distinctive ware- house and several multi-masted ships define the middle ground. The Manhat- tan shore is barely distinguishable in the steam- and cloud-filled distance. The mauve, lavender, blue, magenta, and mustard yellow of the boxcars create a bold, staccato rhythm of color across the lower third of the composition even as they serve as a distinctive foil for the more open, steam-filled middle ground. Marin's interest in industrial America built on his own earlier experiences as an architectural draftsman, and perhaps also on a familiarity with the urban industrial focus in the work of Monet, Manet, and the photographs of Alfred Stieglitz. Marin was one of the first American modernists to demonstrate a profound and abiding interest in the technological achievements of the recent American past. His choice of bright colors and a delicate, atmospheric per- spective underscores the optimism which fueled his early enthusiasm. The wafting puffs of gray and lavender steam, together with the gray-blue overhead clouds, envelop this booming industrial complex in a tonalist atmosphere of gently modulated color harmonies. Par- ticularly in the foreground, these wispy clouds of smoke and steam daringly interrupt the continuity of the whole to provide a telling foretaste of the more disjointed rhythms that dominate Marin's future urban scenes. As in his other watercolors of this period, Marin deftly exploited the fluid- ity of the watercolor medium, applying his colors with an eye to the suggestive rather than descriptive capabilities of the medium. Broad patches of color, delicate tonal washes, and saturated blocks of hue demonstrate Marin's loose, informal technique and his early commitment to the expressiveness of color.

Its subject, the energizing presence of Manhattan's proliferating population oftall buildings and, more specifically, the contrast between those cathedrals of commerce and the city's traditional reli- gious cathedrals, is one Marin explored repeatedly throughout his career. Saint Paul's Cathedral, designed by the Scotsman Thomas McBean in 1764-66, was one of two Broadway churches Marin included in his views of the city, the other being the more famous Trinity Church. Saint Paul's distinctive spire, added to the church in the 1790s, closely echoes the spire of James Gibbs' famous London landmark, Saint Martin's-in-the- Field, which Marin sketched in water- color in 1909. 16 But in contrast to Marin's straightforward, portrait-like treatment of the London landmark and of other versions of Saint Paul's, this depiction denies any reference to the church's handsome columned portico or simple gabled roof in order to focus full atten- tion on its soaring spire. Silhouetted against the open sky, the gracefully tapered spire tilts slightly in the direction of the multi-storied sky- scraper to its left. The skyscraper is probably George B. Post's Saint Paul Building, located just across Broadway from the church. The fact that the sky- scraper derived its name from the pre- revolutionary war church makes the juxtaposition of these two towers all the more provocative. The office building, which rises to a height of more than 20 stories, is actually many stories taller than the church, but Marin presents the church tower as if it were the taller. The tilt of the church steeple in the direction of the skyscraper's crenelated roof (actually a balustrade) seems to transform this scene into a twentieth-century jousting match with the church spire doubling as an ornately handled lance and the sky- scraper serving as the battlemented fortress under siege.

Signed lower right: Marin Purchase: Felicia Meyer Marsh, by exchange, and Eliza McMillan Purchase Fund 14: 1982 the steeple reinforces the sense of motion implicit in its tilt, while the profusion of shapes, lines, and shaded areas below extends this excitement even to the level of the street. In 1913 Marin described the "great forces" and the "influences of one mass on another greater or smaller mass" con- tributing to the cacophony of sights, sounds, feelings, and sensations which constituted the modern city.17 To capture this cacophony Marin sought inspiration in the work of Picasso and probably the French Orphist, Robert Delaunay, whose energized depictions of the Eiffel Tower bear a close resemblance to the frag- mented forms and disjointed rhythms of Marin's city scenes. In all of its essentials, the drawing closely parallels the principal features of the watercolor derived from it, Saint Paul's, Lower Manhattan (Figure 3). However, in the watercolor both towers appear narrower, perhaps to better emphasize their height, and the mass of the skyscraper has been broken up 26</page><page sequence="28">by the addition of large rectangular open- ings that suggest windows. The confusion at the street level displays a greater variety of curving shapes, and the skyscraper has been stripped of its crenelated cap, thereby eliminating the semblance of a joust. Like Marin's other explorations of the city, Saint Paul 's, New York Downtown acknowledges both the aesthetic and the ideological factors at play in the transfor- mation of lower Manhattan from a low density area of small shops, churches, and residences into a densely packed forest of towering skyscrapers. That church spires do not always dominate their commercial counterparts suggests that Marin's sympathies were not always on the side of tradition, but acknowl- edged the dynamic interplay between commerce and religion. Provenance Mr. and Mrs. John Marin, Jr.; (Kennedy Galleries, Inc., New York) In 1919, five years after his first visit to Maine, Marin began making annual trips to Stonington on Deer Isle in Penobscot Bay, a practice he continued throughout the 1920s. The year following his first visit to this picturesque fishing village, he wrote Stieglitz that his "chief inter- ests in life" were houses, islands and boats. ls Deer Isle, Maine: Sea and Boats captures Marin's fascination with two of these elements and records a theme to which he would return with regularity for the next quarter century. Whether in his urban scenes or in his depictions of the natural wonders of Maine, Marin was never one to find solace in the minutiae of the physical universe. But neither was he oblivious to the material substance of the objects that attracted his attention. Rather, his chief concern was to depict the inexorable bond he detected between the material and the immaterial. His intention was to give physical form to the facts and forces of the universe as he understood them and to depict those forces that bound disparate objects together into a tense and often contradictory whole.

In one manuscript he explained: "In nature ... every thing asserts itself irrespective of relationship."19 Elsewhere he stated his desire "To paint disorder under a big order."20 Deer Isle, Maine: Sea and Boats objecti- fies each of these convictions. Central to the watercolor is the struggle for domi- nance between the boats, the water, the sky, and the tiny islands that punctuate the ocean's vast surface.

These and other internal framing devices draw attention to elements within the composition as they guide our under- standing of the whole. In 1924 the critic Virgil Barker wrote that Marin "snatches out the essential from the inessential and flashes it out on paper in a swiftly running pictorial shorthand." The results, he affirmed, were "con- vincing re-creations of reality."21 Bald Head, Small Point, Maine demonstrates the abstraction to which Marin often pushed this process. The distant water has been reduced to a flat, geometric band of intense blue, the island that projects from it a smooth and startling orange, while the trees on the nearby hillside are treated simply as fuzzy green and yellow patches of vivid color. Marin's mastery of the watercolor medium is very much in evidence in this highly simplified rendering of the Maine shore. Thin mauve and gray washes define the sandy ground cover; the wispy texture of the twisting fir trees in the lower left reflects the use of drier, more controlled brush work, while the bril- liant green and yellow vegetation to the right exploit the full transparency of the watercolor medium.

Whether in film, photography, literature, the visual arts, various forms of non-fiction, or the new media of radio, film, and picture magazines, the 1930s took to heart Walt Whitman's com- pelling, half-century-old charge that: Whatever may have been the case in years gone by, the true use for the imaginative faculty of modern times is to give ultimate vivifìcation to facts, to science, and to common lives, endowing them with the glows and glories and final illustriousness which belong to every real thing, and to real things only.22 Marsh's depictions of dance marathon- ers, Coney Island revelers, Bowery bums, subway riders, and the surging crowds who frequented the city's bois- terous Fourteenth Street entertainment centers supported the decade's wide- spread populist sympathies and its need, as Stott has shown, to capture "the texture of reality, of America."23 10 Shots 10 Cents is one of Marsh's many depictions of life along New York's col- orful Fourteenth Street corridor. Like his other works on this subject, it gives equal prominence to the jostling crowds overflowing the area's principal thor- oughfare, and the rich array of printed announcements and commercial adver- tisements that bombarded them as they passed. To guide him in his endeavors, Marsh worked from photographs and sketches taken on the spot. Comparison of this drawing with two of his photo- graphs reveals that the general disposi- tion of the overhead signs, together with their wording and styles of lettering, and the wording and lettering on the sand- wich board in the foreground correspond almost exactly with actual signs from the period. But the reality Marsh captures is not limited only to the particulars of the physical environment. He probes with equal skill the psychological reality of its inhabitants. Like other documentarians, Marsh's concern was with communal rather than personal or private events. Sharing the sidewalk are young working women, a mother and her children, laborers, a man with a sandwich board, a street vendor, and an assortment of idlers and casual observers. Whether in motion or just passing the time, they convey the rest- lessness underlying much of the decade's surface frivolity. Their jostling figures belie the tension and uneasiness which encouraged many of the forms of mass entertainment advertised in the overhead signs. Despite the diagonal orientation of the scene, Marsh purposely constricts the space to heighten its intensity. The heads of several in the crowd seem on a collision course with the overhead signs, and both the signs and the people seem unnaturally compressed. The drawing gets its title from the ad- vertisement on the projecting marquee directly overhead. To a far greater extent than other artists of his generation, Marsh accepted the ubiquitous presence of advertising as a phenomenon of mod- ern culture. He effectively exploited its eye-catching messages to comment on the vagaries of modern life, and employed newspaper headlines in much the same way. The seriousness of the world political situation, as reflected in the newspaper headline on the extreme right, stands in sharp contrast to the pettiness and rampant commercialization of those who make their way hurriedly along the busy street. The headline reads: "Finns Fire Across Soviet Bor- der; Molotov Protests Provocation." The newspaper is the Communist Daily Worker. Provenance (Frank K. M.

Czechoslovakia, 1890-1972 In 1907 Matulka and his family immi- grated to America from their native Czechoslovakia. The following year he enrolled in the National Academy of Design where he studied for the next 11 years. His diligence was rewarded in 1917 when he became the first recipient of the Joseph Pulitzer Traveling Scholar- ship administered by Columbia Univer- sity. The scholarship allowed Matulka to travel throughout the American south- west, Florida, Maine, Canada, and even- tually Europe. Time spent in Paris in the early 1920s stimulated his interest in the highly restrained and formally sophisti- cated compositions of the Purists. Shortly after his return to the United States, Matulka commenced a series of still lifes which explored the formal and decorative emphases of the Purists and allied him with their American counter- parts, the Precisionists. Still Life with Gramophone and Mando- lin is one of at least two drawings and one lithograph Matulka made of this particular still life arrangement. Musical instruments were a traditional feature of Cubist and Purist still lifes and had spe- cial in u rest for Matulka, who was par- ticularly fond of music. The presence of the mechanical gramophone may also reflect his enthusiasm for the precision and simplicity of machine-made forms, which figured prominently in his many cityscapes of the same period. In Still Life with Gramophone and Mandolin Matulka explores the simple geometries of these two musical devices sharing the top of a rectangular table scarcely large enough to contain them. The tilted perspective relates directly to Cubist explorations of space, while the traditional turned table legs bear a resemblance to props favored by Léger and Corbusier. Of the three depictions of this arrangement, the Museum's drawing appears to be the earliest. The forms are handled in the simplest and least elabo- Figure 4, Jan Matulka, Still Life on Turned Table Leg, c. 1928, graphite, 17 X 13V2" (43.2x34.2 cm.), Courtesy of the Weyhe Gallery, New York. rate manner, the table is only barely suggested, and the complicating draper- ies, shadows and rectilinear patterning that enliven the other two works are as yet no more than a few schematic out- lines. A related drawing (Figure 4), in a private collection, presents the most visually complex treatment of the subject and would appear to have been done last. The lithograph (Figure 5) shares with the Museum's drawing the wood graining on the mandolin, a similar treatment of the adjacent pile of records, and the leftward orientation of the gramophone arm. The shadows behind the two musical devices are also similar, with those in the litho- graph merely following the outlines established earlier in the drawing. Close examination of the Museum's drawing reveals that Matulka experimented with the position of the needle, first sketching it in the "down" position (still faintly visible in the drawing), then settling on the "up" and "at rest" position in both the drawing and the lithograph. In the latter, he shifted the gramophone arm to the right and lowered the needle to the "play" position, effectively completing the work by adding sound. Matulka made few prints during his career and only a few impressions of any given image. Most of his printmaking was done around 1925 when he studied etching with Eugene Fitsch at the Art Students League. The lithograph in this series shows that Matulka treated print- making not as an end in itself but as one step in the art-making process.

Czechoslovakia, 1890-1972 The Harlem Renaissance was officially launched in 1925 with the publication of Alain Locke's The New Negro, an anthology of the writings and artistic achievements of thirty-four Afro- American poets, novelists, painters, playwrights, and critics. A major com- ponent of this artistic flowering, and by far its best known feature outside the Black community, involved its contribu- tions to American music. Whites and Blacks alike flocked to such popular Harlem night spots as the Savoy Ball- room and the Cotton Club to hear first- hand the jazz orchestras of Fletcher Henderson, Duke Ellington, and other jazz greats. The syncopated rhythms and brassy melodies appealed to a generation desperately trying to rid itself of the last vestiges of Victorian culture. Jazz and the Black musicians who performed it symbolized for many whites the freedom and spontaneity that seemed to have all but disappeared from their own cultural heritage. Negro Jazz Band shows three Black musicians performing on a banjo, a tuba, and a slide trombone with five additional musical instruments- a saxophone, a pedal-operated drum, a cymbal, bells, and a grand piano- rounding out the ensemble. The word "jazz," written across the bottom of the drawing, announces the group's musical orienta- tion. The seven musical instruments are each reduced to a series of abstract and often highly geometric shapes which abut and overlap one another in a manner calculated to evoke the complex texture and patterns of the music. The disjointed melodies and pulsating rhythms of jazz live on in the drawing's stirring combina- tion of straight and curving lines, abrupt angles, discontinuous forms, and pulsing light-dark contrasts. Matulka's fondness for the stylized abstractions to which he reduced each instrument is suggested by the fact that he repeated almost all of them, some several times, in other works devoted to musical themes. The carica- tural handling of the three Black musi- cians seems derived from Matulka's earlier efforts at cartooning, and con- forms to the age's simplistic and stereo- typical acceptance of Blacks as representatives of a new "primitive" directness. Negro Jazz Band was intended for use on the cover of the journal, The New Masses, a sequel to two earlier politi- cally leftist journals, The Masses (1911- 1917) and the Liberator (1918-1924). The phrase "New Masses" is faintly discernible beneath the heavy black border across the top of the drawing, and "January 1927" is still partially visible beneath a layer of white gouache imme- diately below and to the left. Matulka contributed 24 drawings to The New Masses from its inception in 1926 through 1930. Why this one was never published is not known, especially since each year the journal sponsored a fancy dress ball that featured a Harlem jazz band. An unfinished drawing on the verso may have served as a preliminary study for Negro Jazz Band. Matulka's name in large block letters fills the lower right corner, while a saxophone, a banjo, a triangle, and a row of bells extend upward from the lower edge.

Poland, 1882-1946 Born in Warsaw and educated at the Warsaw Art Academy, Nadelman settled in Paris in 1904 before immigrating to this country a decade later. During his years in Paris, he anticipated many of the formal concerns of the Cubists and experimented with a number of drawing styles which reflect his fondness for both Greek sculpture and Byzantine icons. Head and Neck dates from the artist's early years in Paris. Like his other draw- ings of this period, it is composed of a series of intersecting curves echoing an initiating curved line. Together these curved lines enclose and define the form's volume. Nadelman explained his interest in such highly reductive formal methods in a statement which appeared in Camera Work in October 1910: I employ no other line than the curve, which possesses freshness and force. I compose these curves so as to bring them in accord or in opposition to one another. In that way I obtain the life of form, i.e. , harmony The subject of any work of art is for me nothing but a pretext for creating significant forms, relations of forms which create a new life that has nothing to do with life in nature, a life from which art is born, and from which spring style and unity.24 As the first person to use the term "significant form," Nadelman looked to classical sources for inspiration in creating his elemental human figures. In the words of Lincoln Kirstein, "His researches were logical, based on a vir- tual annihilation of individuality towards an expression of lyric essence."25 The three-quarter view and rightward tilt of the head in Head and Neck character- ize many of Nadelman's drawings of this period, probably deriving from his stud- ies of Byzantine icons of the Virgin. The several curved lines outlining and defin- ing the essential contours of the woman's head and neck are thickened over the multiple internal lines which provide the figure's refining details. Mute and with- out eyes that see, the figure epitomizes Nadelman's striving toward "significant form." Head and Neck, c. 1909-10 Pen and black and brown ink 36 x 22.2 cm. (143/i6 x 83/4in.)

He completed the work the year following his return from four years in Europe, where he had divided his time between winters in Paris and summers along the coasts of Brittany and Normandy. In both Paris and the resort towns of Dieppe and Dinan, Prendergast revelled in the sumptuous spectacle of fashionably -dressed women and young girls strolling the city's streets, relaxing in the warmth of the summer sun. His watercolors of these years abound with depictions of the rich display of color, movement, and leisure time activity enjoyed by the French middle class. These same preoccupations can be seen in Prendergast's American watercolors, beginning with his depictions of Boston's North Shore resort communities. Revere Beach captures the colorful clothing, large hats, and relaxed demeanor of the area's summer visitors, who lounged on the sandy beach, mesmerized by the gentle lapping of the waves and the spec- tacle of the other festively clad specta- tors. A stairway leading to an elevated promenade extends off the paper to the left, while in the distance the strollers share the beach with two horse-drawn carriages. Two rafts or diving platforms, one carrying three swimmers, float peacefully on the intensely blue water. Thin, vertical shafts which extend upward from their floating, horizontal bases establish a visual association between the near and distant shores, thus connecting the foreground visitors with the larger world beyond. Like Prendergast's other watercolors of this period, Revere Beach owes a debt to the light-filled beach scenes of the French Impressionist, Eugène Boudin, and the thin washes and banded format of James McNeill Whistler's Venetian stud- ies. The broad expanse of unoccupied beach in the foreground and the averted gazes of the spectators may also reflect Prendergast's knowledge of Japanese prints and the psychologically charged imagery of Edgar Degas, both of which he encountered in Paris. The rock-strewn foreground effectively distances us from the cluster of summer visitors who popu- late the picture's crowded middle ground. This ploy, unusual in Prendergast's work, reinforces the spirit of isolation and quiet contemplation conveyed by the averted gazes of the visitors, most of whom turn their backs to us as they focus instead on the sights and sounds of the ocean. To a far greater extent than in his earlier French scenes, Prendergast's Boston watercolors display an impressionistic concern with light and atmosphere. In Revere Beach, the artist's deft, fluid handling of the watercolor medium cap- tures both the warm crispness of the summer sun and the freshness of the passing moment. Small daubs of red, pink, lavender, blue, and yellow suggest rather than define the brightly colored garments of the spectators. Portions of the paper left purposely bare simulate the reflective qualities and shimmering effects of the summer sun as it bounces off the smooth surface of the nearby water. The individual strokes of green, blue, and brown defining the scattered rocks in the foreground complement the staccato rhythms and scumbled effects of the visitors' clothing, and look forward to the distinctive, divisionist brushwork of much of Prendergast's later work.

In March, 1900, Prendergast exhibited a group of watercolors and monotypes at the Macbeth Galleries in New York, the first showing of his work in that city. During the following two years he spent considerable time in New York, com- muting there from his home in Boston. During his many visits to New^York he became good friends with William Glackens and Robert Henri. In defiance of the conservative norms of the Acad- emy, Henri urged artists to prowl the city's streets and to seek out subject matter bristling with the life and diver- sity of turn-of-the-century urban living. Mulberry Bend Park, New York, is one of a small number of works completed in 1901 and 1902 which bear witness to Henri's social consciousness. In contrast to works like Central Park or the later Bathers, Mulberry Bend Park, New York focuses not on leisure-class women but on immigrant males. Mul- berry Bend Park was a prominent gathering spot located along the main thoroughfare of New York's Little Italy. At the turn-of-the-century Little Italy and the surrounding Jewish and East European communities together com- prising the city's distinctive Lower East Side, welcomed the waves of new immi- grants who transformed the face of urban 38</page><page sequence="40">America in less than a generation. The area was a far cry from the fashionable world of Central Park and the city's wealthier upper East Side. In Little Italy the streets teemed with the cries of push- cart peddlers and the wares of small merchants who brought with them their distinctive Old World ways. Prendergast's watercolor ignores the colorful confusion of the streets to focus instead on the serenity and beauty of the area's principal public park. The bird's- eye perspective allows us to contemplate both the simple geometry of the park's curving walkways and the numerous inhabitants who occupy the park's slat- backed benches. In its dual concern with pattern and people at leisure, Mulberry Bend Park, New York bears a close affin- ity with Prendergast's other park scenes. But the unfinished watercolor is unique in Prendergast's oeuvre in its almost exclusive emphasis on men. Only about three women can be identified among the more than 60 males who congregate in this open-air living room. Being unfinished, Mulberry Bend Park provides significant insights into Prendergast's working methods. He generally began a work by lightly sketch- ing in the postures and locations of the objects and individuals who would inhabit the scene. He then painted in the principal ground color, taking care to work around the spots reserved for the objects just sketched. The figures reveal both Prendergast's acute observational skills and his deft handling of the water- color medium. With only a few well- placed brush strokes and a restricted palette of brown, blue, green, and tan, he conveys with great humor and conviction an extraordinary variety of postures and gestures. The brightly colored buildings which frame the park to the rear contrib- ute the only spots of color to this other- wise somber scene. One wonders if Prendergast intended this concentration of color as a reference to the spirited lives and colorful habits of the Southern Italians inhabiting the area.

New York's Central Park, with its promi- nent bench-lined walkways, landscaped terraces, and processional stairways, provided the setting for some of Prendergast's most beloved and charac- teristic work. Central Park reveals both the artist's eye for fashion and his flair for simple compositional formats. As a youth working in a dry goods shop in Boston, Prendergast made his first sketches of women's fashions. His sensi- tivity to the colors, textures, and stylistic variations characteristic of turn-of-the- century women's apparel remained with him for the remainder of his life and adds immeasurably to the witty charm and brilliance of his work. With just a few deftly -positioned strokes, he was able to succinctly capture the festive exuber- ance of a woman's large, flowered hat, or the subtle proportions of her cinched- waisted walking suit. A bemused sense of humor often accompanied his presen- tation of these fashion notes. In the scene at hand, the juxtaposition of the large, flower-filled urn at the end of the row of seated females comments on the exaggerated proportions of their urn-like hats. 39</page><page sequence="41">MAURICE PRENDERGAST American, 1858-1924 Central Park, 1902 Watercolor over graphite underdrawing 36.0 x 53.0cm.

The stairway provides a distinctive processional focus for the work even as the horizontal banding of the stairs, the slatted backs of the adja- cent park benches, and the horizontal expanse of the foreground walkway emphasize the flatness of the picture plane. The two-dimensionality of the surface is further reinforced by the fron- tality of the many women and children who inhabit the scene, and by the witty parallel suggested between the dark- stockinged legs of the children, the soli- tary lamppost in the lower left, and the profusion of thin tree trunks which punc- tuate the terraced yard. Central Park remained in the posses- sion of the artist's brother, Charles Prendergast, until just a few months before his death in 1948. The brothers lived and often traveled together, with Charles serving as the ears of Maurice, who was deaf throughout most of his adult life. A picture framer by profes- sion, Charles turned to art in 1912 when he completed his first gessoed panel. Charles' paintings and decorative panels shared with his younger brother's work an intense love of color and pattern and a fondness for people in park-like settings. Charles, who made the frame for Central Park and for other of his brother's paint- ings, no doubt enjoyed the New York scene because of the strong affinity it bore to his own later work.

Renewed contact with French art and a brief visit to Italy in 1911-12 lent new energy to Prendergast 's art. Over the next five years he experimented with a variety of new subjects and techniques. Nudes, portraits, and still lifes entered his repertoire; his palette brightened; he combined media, particularly pastel and watercolor, in new and previously untried ways; and he developed a looser, cruder technique which approximated more nearly the untutored freshness of children's art. Bathers y completed during this five-year period, embodies many of the new direc- tions in Prendergast's art. Nude and partially clothed female bathers stroll and lounge on the beach with a sensuous abandon that bears little resemblance to the jewel-like delicacy and restraint of Revere Beach. Fidelity to the reality of everyday life has given way to a mythic paganism which more nearly approxi- mates the seaside idylls of artists like Matisse and Gauguin. Anatomical cor- rectness no longer predominates. Bodies exhibit the same undulating contours as the waves. Colors no longer define forms but seem animated by their own internal needs and objectives, and the forms themselves lack any pretext of weight or solidity. In the foreground the lounging women, children, toys, and pets create such a cacophony of vaguely defined shapes and bright colors that only with great difficulty can one isolate and identify individual objects. The crude and purposely unrefined application of the watercolor medium contributes to the jarring intensity of the scene. Colors are applied with little or no thought as to their illusionistic poten- tial. Brush strokes remain separate and unblended. The colors themselves are often garish, with complementary colors employed to heighten the dissonance of the scene. The use of pastel provides 40</page><page sequence="42">Bathers, c. 1913-15 Watercolor, graphite, pastel, over black chalk underdrawing 35.2 x 50.3 cm. (137/s x 1913/i6in.)

Only a thin charcoal line defines the edge of the table on which the objects sit. All other contextual information has been purposely withheld. The effect of this highly reductive clustering of objects is brought into striking relief by comparing the drawing with Sheeler's Figure 6, Charles Sheeler, Still Life with Etruscan Vase and Apple, c. 1922, silver print, The Lane Collection, photograph courtesy of Museum of Fine Arts, Boston. ings are among the most elegant, aus- tere, and restrained productions of his career. The compact and slightly over- lapping arrangement of the stately Etrus- can pitcher, glass tumbler, low glass candy dish, and boulder-like apple reveal Sheeler's fascination with simple, curv- ing shapes, transparent and reflective surfaces, and everyday objects. Like Chardin, whose seventeenth-century still lifes he greatly admired, Sheeler was as motivated by the objects' time-worn associations as by their formal proper- ties and relationships. In early 1923 Sheeler told the critic Thomas Craven that his objective in this series was to impart "the absolute beauty we are accustomed to associate with objects suspended in a vacuum."27 To create a vacuum-like atmosphere, Sheeler eliminated shadows and severely 42 photograph of the same subject (Figure 6). The objects in the drawing achieve a heightened purity and clarity. Our inter- est in them intensifies as their forms, free from all distracting shadows, assume new meaning and significance. The influence of Marcel Duchamp is evident throughout this work, beginning with its focus on the mysterious appeal of a hermetically sealed environment. The work's restricted palette, meticulous craftsmanship, and subordination of the gestural to the intellectual provide addi- tional evidence of Duchamp's appeal. Partly in response to Duchamp's ener- vating presence, Sheeler moved from Philadelphia to New York in 1919. "Dur- ing the years following the Armory Show," Sheeler recalled, "life in Philadelphia seemed much like being shipwrecked on a deserted island. Whatever was happen- ing that was stimulating and conducive to work was taking place in New York."28 The self-effacing surfaces of Suspended Forms (Still Life) underscore the intellec- tual content of the work at the same time they reflect Sheeler's mastery of his materials. The swelling forms of the Etruscan pitcher, achieved by a skillful blending of chalk and charcoal, and the rich tones of the small apple, the result of watercolor over charcoal, complement the transparent and reflective surfaces of the two glass vessels. Sheeler's retention of this work as part of his private collec- tion, his "Pictorial Diary," reveals much about his fondness for the drawing and perhaps for the series of which it forms a part.

In this capacity he traveled to all parts of the city, recording in the quick, shorthand notation favored by turn-of-the-century newspaper illustrators, the principal local news stories of the day. Shinn also supplied illustrations to such well-known journals as Harper 's Weekly, Ainslee 's, The Critic, and Scribner's, and around 1900 began illustrating books as well. While working for Ainslee 's, Shinn received a commission to illustrate a book on New York city life by the novel- ist, William Dean Howells. The book was to include 36 of Shinn's pastels. Shinn quit his position at Ainslee 's to work on the project, but unfortunately the book was never published. According to Joseph Kwiat, a literary historian who corresponded with Shinn in the 1940s, the book was to examine "various phases of New York City life."29 Shinn presum- ably incorporated the drawings intended for the book into his regular portfolio and perhaps offered some as illustrations to the magazines to which he regularly contributed. Currently only one work can be posi- tively linked to the project which was to have been called, New York by Night. Madison Square, which bears the book's title across its top margin, was to have served as its cover. The subtly colored chalk and gouache drawing presents a nighttime view of a crowd of pedestrians alighting from a group of horse-drawn cabs visible in the background, hurrying through the snow toward an unspecified destination. The well-bundled individu- als share the sidewalk with a white- bearded gentleman leaning into the cold with a satchel and what appears to be a stretched canvas under one arm, at the extreme right border of the work. A top- hatted man wearing a sandwich board anchors the center of the composition. With a minimum of detail, Shinn deftly captures both the confusion of the street, and the chill of a snowy winter evening in the vicinity of the city's popular Madison Square Garden. The emphasis on night, the purposely ambiguous handling of the figures and the tantalizing illegibility of the message on the centrally placed sandwich board suggest the influence of James McNeill Whistler and the Tonalists. Essentially monochromatic, Madison Square builds on Whistler's fondness for the softening veil of night and his judicious placement of small amounts of bright color. The yellow glow of the street lamps, the coach lamps, and the illuminated win- dows in the distance, together with scat- tered touches of red in the scarves, on the sign, and in the initial letters in the title, act like delicate grace notes in this other- wise somber nighttime symphony.

Paris Street Scene, produced three years later, recalls that important visit to the French capital, in an unusual and understated manner. For someone as committed to the life of the street as Shinn, Paris Street Scene is strangely devoid of all human activity. Only the simple ladder-back chair left in the snow in front of one of the old store- fronts suggests human habitation, and then only indirectly. The deserted char- acter of the street contrasts sharply with Shinn's usual urban subjects and is more in keeping with the themes of loneliness and isolation we associate with the work of Edward Hopper and the photographer Eugène Atget. Like Atget, Shinn depicts a street in Old Paris. The small shops, cramped streets, and worn buildings in the old sections of the city contrasted sharply with the grand boulevards and elegant Second Empire structures that garnered the attention of the Impressionists just 25 years earlier. The melting snow and casual handling of the structures' many rectangular elements soften the under- lying geometry of Shinn's setting and contribute to the scene's weathered appearance. The only real color in the work, aside from the intense white of the snow, are the four shades of blue, rang- ing from a strong blue-gray to a delicate aqua, which accent the walls, doors, shutters, and horizontal sign in the cen- ter of the scene. The remainder of the walls and windows are rendered in varying shades of gray. Shinn excelled in the use of pastels, producing some of his finest work in this delicate and demanding medium. In 1906, the collector A. E. Gallatin described Shinn as "a master of the pastel," adding that: he knows thoroughly both the possibilities and the limitations of his medium. The material is never strained in endeavoring to get too much out of it; and if technically his pastels are great achievements, pictorially they are also.30 Shinn developed an innovative technique for working in pastels, using paper mounted on a heavy backing board, then soaked in a tub of water. He removed the excess water with a sponge before apply- ing his colors to the wet paper. The col- ors turned dark as soon as they touched the wet paper. Only when dry would they reveal their true hues. This process required that Shinn have the composition completely in mind before he com- menced applying the color. In contrast to the usual dust-like surface of pastels, such as Shinn achieved inNew York Horse Car, this process produced a dry, hard pigment resembling tempera both for its consistency and for the brilliance of its colors.

Shinn's Eviction, the animated depiction of an apartment eviction, formerly consti- tuted the verso of Paris Street Scene. The ( two drawings were separated in 1959. The drawing reveals Shinn's affinity for the life of the street and for lower class subjects. As several young men carry a chest of drawers down the stairs from a tenement building, an Oriental police- man restrains a group of curious onlook- ers while the evicted tenants, clustered at the left, appear dazed and unbelieving amidst their few meager and broken possessions. Facial expressions on both the onlookers and one of the youths con- vey glee rather than compassion for the dispossessed. By their rapacious expres- sions they underscore the vulnerability of the bewildered tenants. Shinn proba- bly witnessed many such scenes during his days as a newspaper reporter, and although attached to the back of a Pari- sian scene, the setting is probably New York's Lower East Side. In contrast to the hard, brilliant coloring of Paris Street Scene, the coloring here com- plements the sketch-like handling of the forms. Provenance (Victor D.

Like Madison Square, it depicts a nighttime view of the city and the flavor of a crowd on one of the city's broad avenues. The title identifies the scene as a gathering of the Salvation Army, whose efforts on behalf of the urban disadvantaged were well-established in New York and other American cities by the early years of this century. Flags and a yellow banner proj- ect above the heads of the spectators focusing our attention on the crowded middle ground, where a horse-drawn cab and an illuminated horse car await passengers. The urban subject matter and the small black and white sketch in the lower right- hand corner of the backing sheet link this drawing with five others in the Muse- um's collection. All are dated 1904, and two depict similar nighttime scenes. Street Scene shows a narrow, deserted, shop-lined street seen from an elevated vantage point. Rag Picker and Crush of Brooklyn Bridge depict crowds of people in dimly illuminated urban settings, while the smaller Cabbie and Man with Pipe focus on single individuals. Perhaps all six were intended for use in New York by Night, but there is no way to verify this. Like Madison Square, Salvation Army has as its focus a common and wholly unspectacular view of urban life. One views this gathering of Salvation Army sympathizers from the rear as if we, like others in the crowd, had just come upon them in the street and stopped to indulge our curiosity. A yellow glow in the dis- tance suggests the presence of a bright light illuminating those in the vicinity of the banners and the American flag at the head of the crowd. But from our vantage point neither the purpose of the gather- ing nor the presence of its leaders is clear. This ambiguity reflects Shinn's desire to capture not only the variety of urban experiences available to him and his contemporaries, but also the frag- mented and incomplete way those experi- ences were often perceived and enjoyed. The sketch-like handling of the forms, the emphasis on gesture, and the seem- ingly uncomposed nature of the scene bespeak Shinn's experience as a news- paper illustrator. But beneath this seemingly banal exterior is a highly sophisticated juxtaposition of open and closed spaces and a subtle handling of color. The intense yellow glow of the lights emanating from the buildings and the two horse-drawn vehicles act like staccato rhythms against the soft, reddish hue of the central building, and the dense black coloring of the carriage. The large expanse of empty pavement in the fore- ground suggests Shinn's knowledge of Degas, whose work he greatly admired and would have seen while in Paris in 1900. Provenance Richard S.

Like the enveloping veil of night, falling snow appealed to Shinn in the way it blended colors and softened the sharp, defining outlines of objects. He returned to snowy scenes often throughout his career. In New York Horse Car, the swirling snow almost completely masks the architec- tural details on the buildings bordering the street and softens the contours of the swiftly moving multi-passenger vehicle as well. In contrast to either Salvation Army or Madison Square, New York Horse Car minimizes the confusion of the urban milieu by focusing on a single large entity, which it presents with consider- able splendor and elegance. The simple lines and muted colors of the orange, ocher, and pink car contrast sharply with the tossed heads and prancing legs of the dark brown horses that pull it. The horses command the exact center of the composition and in their varied silhou- ettes and lively manner establish a witty dialogue with the irregular peaks of the buildings to their rear. In contrast to Paris Street Scene, New York Horse Car employs a more conven- tional approach to the pastel medium. The drawing's soft, chalky surface reso- nates with the look and feel of rapidly falling snow. By layering his colors and minimizing details, Shinn captures with noteworthy fidelity the sense of looking through veils of wet, blowing snow. His colors are richer and the surface treat- ment more lush than in his earlier draw- ings. With this combination comes a sense of elegance and refinement that more nearly approaches the work of William Glackens, a close friend of Shinn's and a fellow member of the "Eight."

He and his wife set- tled into an apartment on West Twenty - third Street in the heart of the Tenderloin district, then a center for vice and prosti- tution. Three years later he painted the first of four oil paintings focusing on the ubiquitous presence of streetwalkers in his community. A number of drawings and an etching followed over the next seven years. In contrast to the reformers of his day, Sloan's attitude was strictly nonjudgmental. He accepted prostitutes as one of the many phenomena of urban life and sympathized with their harsh treatment in the courts. As one historian has noted, "John Sloan not only had the audacity to ignore the general taboo against depicting prostitution, but also dared to provoke even the most liberal reformists when he decided to treat pros- titutes as mature, independent women who were essentially harmless to society."31 Picketing the Police Permit shows a gathering of six prostitutes, four of whom converse privately with four well- dressed men on an unidentified public street. It reveals both Sloan's sympathy for prostitutes and his growing social and political awareness. Following his move to New York and with intensifying regu- larity beginning in 1909, Sloan involved himself in the issues and concerns of the Socialist party. He contributed illustra- tions and cartoons to several Socialist publications, including the New York Call and The Masses, and became a party member in December, 1909. This drawing, completed within days of his joining the Socialist party, merges his sympathy for prostitutes with his revulsion at the treatment accorded a group of striking shirtwaist workers, which he had followed in the pages of the New York Call. On December 30, 1909, he recorded in his diary how the striking shirtwaist workers had been arrested for picketing the shops and that one of the magistrates in charge, claiming "that they had no right to picket," had meted out jail sentences to Blackwell's Island for some of the so-called offenders.32 Twelve days later, on January 11 , 1910, Sloan made this drawing. In his diary he referred to the work as "Pickets the Police Protect (streetwalkers)" and noted that he had made it "in reference to the shirtwaist strike now going on in which much police brutality has been cited by the 'Call.' "33 On January 23, 1910, the Sunday edition of the Call pub- lished a photochemical relief linecut of the drawing with the title Pickets on the Outposts of Capitalism. 34 The work has also been called Pickets and The Sort of Picketing the Police Permit. As a realist, Sloan depicts both the women and the men they solicit with an air of detachment and objectivity. The large feathered hats readily identify the women as prostitutes according to turn- of-the-century dress codes, but their behavior seems no different from that of other urban working women out for a stroll. The openly political nature of this and other of Sloan's drawings of prosti- tutes stands in direct opposition to the self-consciously non-political nature of his paintings of the same subject. Sloan purposely limited his political commen- taries to his illustrations and cartoons, preferring not to use his paintings for propaganda purposes. Picketing the Police Permit records Sloan's distinctive graphic style. Com- posed in black crayon on canvas-textured paper, the drawing's sketch-like quality complements the informality of the scene. Details are kept to a minimum, and the lighting effectively focuses the action. The photoengraving process used to reproduce drawings in the Call required that crayon drawings be done on textured paper "which broke the line down into individual particles of pure black. The drawing was then photo- graphed and the negative printed on a zinc or copper plate treated with a light- sensitive coating. The plate could then be etched in acid, removing all but the artist's original lines."35 This process permitted a new freedom of drawing that turn-of-the-century illustrators like Sloan employed to great artistic advantage.

Under the editorship of Max Eastman, the journal's goal was to be "frank, arrogant, impertinent, searching for the true causes; a magazine directed against rigidity and dogma wherever it is found."36 Until mid- 1916 when a dispute over policy issues prompted his resignation, Sloan super- vised the journal's art department and contributed 63 of his own illustrations. A zinc-plate reproduction of Direct ' 'Action ' 7 appeared in the journal 's February 1913 issue.

Smoke billowing from the factory's several prominent smokestacks shows the fac- tory continuing to operate despite the strike, kept going, no doubt, by scabs hired by the factory owners. The title refers to one of two methods adopted by early twentieth-century Socialists to change the existing social and political order. The other method, referred to as political action, advocated working within the system, particularly through the electoral process, to bring about gradual change. Direct action, advocated by the more militant wing of the party and the stance adopted by The Masses following its reorganization, urged more confrontational action, like strikes, to overturn the existing order and supplant it with a more egalitarian system. The quotation marks around the word "action" in Sloan's title are no doubt intended as an ironical commentary: the willful inaction of the strikers is to be seen as a bold and aggressive form of action. The presence of a lone woman in this gathering of striking laborers is in keep- ing with Sloan's longstanding interest in women as subjects in his art. The art historian Patricia Hills, who has studied Sloan's depictions of women, notes that even "[i]n the company of men, Sloan's women are the principal actors."37 In Direct ' 'Action ' 7 only the woman reveals her dual role as laborer and par- ent. The beseeching attitude of her child who gestures toward her suggests the strain and uncertainty the strike has inflicted on the families of the striking workers. But the woman, like the men, reveals her resolve to continue the strike despite its attendant hardships by responding to her child with only a wistful look. In 1912, Sloan wrote in his diary that "a good drawing is really worth as much and is as dear to me as a painting."38 His drawings for The Masses, like those for the New York Call, exploited the rugged coarseness of crayon. Crayon drawings had a long history in France dating back to the satiric cartoons and illustrations of Honoré Daumier, but were virtually unknown in this country. Sloan and his colleagues at The Masses were the first to respond enthusiastically to the rugged directness of the coarse crayon technique. As Rebecca Zurrier has noted in her excellent study of The Masses, that pub- lication was the first in this country to employ crayon drawings extensively. "In the hands of Sloan, [George] Bellows, [Stuart] Davis, [Boardman] Robinson, and their colleagues, the crayon line took on political significance as a stylistic rebellion against bourgeois illustration, and as the affirmation of a graphic tradition of social protest."39 In Direct ' 'Action ' 7, as in Sloan's other drawings for The Masses, craggy, tex- tured lines and subtle tonal gradations establish the work's dominant visual appeal. Details are kept to a minimum, and an ink overlay of nearly parallel lines intensifies portions of the shading. Ink is also used where finer lines are required, as in the smoke wafting from the pipe of the man in the extreme foreground and in the wisps of hair that project underneath the caps of the two standing figures in the center.

Italy, 1877-1946 A Greener: Lad from Herzegovina is one of more than 100 drawings Stella made in 1908 of immigrant laborers and their environs in the heavily industrialized city of Pittsburgh. The Survey, ajournai devoted to issues of social welfare and reform, commissioned the drawings for a series of articles detailing the wretched living and working conditions of the large number of immigrant laborers who constituted more than one-half of the city's oppressed steel workers. In the muckraking spirit of the day, the articles, accompanied by 31 of Stella's drawings, focused public attention on the social, cultural, and health-related problems confronting the unskilled and poorly educated immigrants who were among this country's most exploited laborers at the time. Stella's drawing appeared first in an article entitled, "The Slav's A Man for A' That," by Alois B. Kuokol, Secretary of the Slavonic Immigrant Society. The article, which included 6 other Stella drawings, appeared in the January 2, 1909, issue of The Survey, which until April ofthat year was called Charities and the Commons.™ The following year the drawing was reproduced in Crystal Eastman's book, Work-Accidents and the Law, edited by Paul Underwood Kellogg, the man in charge of the Pittsburgh survey.41 Stella, who was himself a recent immigrant, was extremely moved by the Pittsburgh assignment. In autobiographi- cal notes he likened the city of Pittsburgh to a "battlefield, ever pulsating, throb- bing with the innumerable explosions of its steel mills," seeming to him "the stunning realization of some of the most stirring infernal regions sung by Dante."42 His drawings sought "to portray the spasm and the pathos of those workers condemned to a very strenuous life, exposed to the constant MENACE OF DEATH."43 Stella's drawing captures with consum- mate skill the tone and intent of Koukol's article. In the opening paragraphs, Koukol announced that it was his purpose: to present the immigrant Slavs as they have not yet been generally seen - as human beings . . . - to present some- thing of their spirit, their character, their attitude toward America, and the effect on them of the conditions under which as in Pittsburgh and the neigh- boring mill towns they live and work.44 With the exquisite detail and sensitivity characteristic of the Old Master drawings Stella so greatly admired, A Greener: Lad from Herzegovina records the physi- ognomy and a portion of the clothing of a young Yugoslavian immigrant. The youth's sad and somewhat glazed expres- sion, together with the slight turn and tilt of his head, cause him to appear psychi- cally and emotionally remote, even off balance, despite his physical presence. The word "greener" in the title (slang for foreigner), and the reference to the youth's place of origin rather than his name, set him up as a type rather than as a specific individual. Such designations were common also for the contemporary photographs of immigrants taken by Lewis Hine and Jacob Riis and may have been occasioned by the grouping of these drawings under the heading, "Pittsburgh Types," when published by The Survey.45 Despite the impersonality of its title, Stella's drawing presents a sensitive, very real, and obviously unique individ- ual. Inhuman though the youth's life doubtless was, Stella emphasizes his humanity and vulnerability. In the pro- cess Stella reveals his own superb skills as a draftsman.

Italy, 1877-1946 Stella created many hundreds of draw- ings of flowers throughout his career. On more than one occasion he expressed a desire to begin each day with the study of a flower. "[T]hat all our days may glide by serene, sunny," he wrote, "each must begin with the study of a flower."46 Like Cactus, many of Stella's flower drawings are dated 1919, the year he completed the monumental Tree of My Life (Mr. and Mrs. Barney A. Ebs worth Foundation and Windsor, Inc.). Created at a time of the artist's growing nostalgia for his native Italy, Tree of My Life uses flowers and exotic birds to convey in personal and symbolic terms the intensity of Stella's mystical and nationalist sentiments. In autobiographical notes recorded in 1946, Stella recalled the artistic restless- ness which seized him at about this time in his career. "With sheer delight," he wrote, "I was roaming through different fields spurned by the inciting expectation of finding thrilling surprises."47 His interest in flowers and his search for new subjects took him often to the Botanical Gardens in Bronx Park. It was perhaps in this environment, the "luxuriant botani- cal garden in the Bronx"48 as Stella described it, that he sketched Cactus and other of his flower studies. Cactus records with stunning grace and beauty the prickly green surface and proud, torch-like bud of a flowering cactus. Like an icon of the botanical world, the cactus rises stately and erect from the bottom of the page, its form silhouetted against the neutral whiteness of the paper. The work boldly under- scores Stella's dual talents as a draftsman and colorisi. The exquisite greenness of the shaft of the cactus and the masterful shading in the bud, where the emerging red petals seem just on the verge of bursting forth in full and glorious bloom, elevate the drawing far above the level of mere illustration. Like other of Stella's flower drawings, Cactus invites a range of anthropomor- phic and sexual interpretations. The shape, location, and color of the bud call to mind the torch-bearing figure of the Statue of Liberty, which would have greeted Stella and his fellow immigrants upon their arrival in New York harbor two decades earlier, and may have been on the artist's mind in 1919 as he reflected on his immigrant status. The cactus and its projecting bud are also emphatically phallic, like many of the flowering forms in Tree of My Life. As described by Stella's biographer, Irma Jaffe, that painting abounds in "blade- shaped leaves, claw-like clusters, spidery tendrils, dagger-ish petals, saber-beaked birds, and a profusion of over-sized, out-of-scale butterflies and blossoms."49 Stella's penchant for implicit sexual imagery was doubtless stimulated by his friendship with Marcel Duchamp, whose sexually charged painting on glass, The Bride Stripped Bare By Her Bachelors, Even, 1918-23 , (Philadelphia Museum of Art), occupied much of his attention during the years of their friendship. In addition, Stella seems to have married at about this time, and although he kept his marriage a secret even from his closest friends, the phallic thrust of the cactus may have been intended as a witty reference to his own sexual flowering.

The son of a Chicago architect who studied sculpture with August Rodin in Paris in the 1910s, Storrs turned to architectonic forms only after Rodin's death. The initial inspiration for his architectural work came from his fasci- nation with Joseph Stella's monumental tribute to New York, The Voice of the City of New York Interpreted (The Newark Museum, New Jersey), which he saw in 1923 . Storrs' biographer, Noel Frackman, has written that "In Stella's New York Interpreted panels, Storrs saw idealized building forms that inspired him to strive for a similar self-contained energy and symbolism in his own archi- tectural sculptures."50 Within two years, Storrs was producing highly reductive architectonic sculptures that shared with Stella's painted skyscrapers and towers a similar formal vocabulary and feeling for the dynamics of urban form. A second stimulus to Storrs' work was the figurai and abstract architectural sculpture of Frank Lloyd Wright. In the early 1920s, Storrs became acquainted with several of Wright's assistants, including the sculptor Alfonso Ianelli with whom Wright had collaborated on the Midway Gardens project in Chicago in 1914. Storrs had undoubtedly seen this popular dining and entertainment center and was familiar with other Wright proj- ects as well. Under the combined influ- ence of Stella and Wright, Storrs set out to reinvigorate the relationship between architecture and sculpture in order to create, as he wrote, "forms and combi- nations of forms which are the natural outgrowth of the real &amp; the lasting in our life of today."51 Study for a Monumental Tower with Sculptural Decorations , c. 1928, is one of Storrs' most visionary sculptural- architectural schemes. Where most of his ink drawings served as studies for metal sculptures, this one records, in his highly reductive style, plans for an actual, albeit extremely Utopian, archi- tectural monument. The structure's rig- orously controlled and symmetrically balanced cluster of highly simplified vertical shafts, together with its combi- nation of straight and curving forms and stylized figurai ornamentation, suggests the influence both of Wright and of the qualities the two admired in the Art Deco style. The winged figures crowning the struc- ture's several projecting pinnacles con- stitute a recurring motif in Storrs' art. Storrs sculpted his first winged figure in 1913 and the following year produced his first figure and column combination. Storrs' interest in the "expressive column" was firmly bound up with his commitment to symbolic forms. Frackman records that "Storrs associ- ated winged figures with spirituality- but also with freedom, liberation of the soul, the soaring of the creative imagina- tion, and the new technology of flight."52 Perhaps his most telling use of this motif was his monument commemorating the one-hundredth anniversary of the birth of his idol, the poet, Walt Whitman, where a winged figure sits majestically astride a handsome and powerfully built horse (The Art Institute of Chicago).
