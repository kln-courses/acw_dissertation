Kuriyama writes, "the history of the body is ultimately a history of ways of inhabiting the world" (237; qtd. in Paster, Humoring 134). Recover- ing that ontological and phenomenological history, though, is no easy task. Hu- mans, regardless of the time or culture into which they are born, perceive through their senses, move through time and space, and die. The way we inhabit the world and the meaning we make of our experiences in it feel natural. Our tendency to assume certain human experiences to be universal and natural, to assume a pre- discursive essentialism, has produced innumerable flawed readings of other cul- tures. Many studies of the body's history recapitulate the flaw in Lévi-Strauss's theorization of the incest taboo. Lévi-Strauss's sex-is- to-gender-as-nature-is-to- culture analogy imagines sexual difference as a biological fact, a pre-discursive truth, but as Judith Butler has contended, any gesture to the originary, pre-symbolic body disregards the cultural construction inherent in the terms "sex," "body," and even "materiality" itself (Gender Trouble 37; Bodies 1-12). THE JOURNAL FOR EARLY MODERN CULTURAL STUDIES Vol. 7, No. 1 (Spring/Summer 2007) © 2007</page><page sequence="2">114 &amp; THE JOURNAL FOR EARLY MODERN CULTURAL STUDIES One recent reiteration of this fallacy occurs in Michael Schoenfeldt's Bodies and Selves in Early Modern England: Physiology and Inwardness in Spenser, Shakespeare, Herbert, and Milton, Schoenfeldt argues that the self- regulation of the humoral body allowed early modern subjects to "produce the parameters of individual subjectivity" (15) and claims that within this "dis- course of self- regulation . . . [we] may begin to make a space for something rec- ognizably modern" (39). Schoenfeldt also takes issue with Gail Kern Paster's reading of the humoral body in The Body Embarrassed, stating that Paster "tends to pathologize the leaky body" (15), rather than read it as a site of self- fashioning: "humoral theory encouraged not carnivalesque liquefaction but rather the careful maintenance of constitutional solubility" (15). Schoenfeldt's reading of humoral theory, though, ignores the inscription of class, race, and especially gender on the early modern body. As Paster points out in Humoring the Body, his reading "mistakenly presumes an unmarked '"individual' prior to biological- that is to say hierarchical- classification" (21). Our attempts to see ourselves, to inscribe our own ontological "realities" onto other cultures, also reveal themselves in the very foci of our studies. Since Burckhardt, numerous scholars have identified the Renaissance as the midwife to modern subjectivity, the moment when the concept of individuality was born. Even with our acknowledgment of the early modern period as pre-Cartesian, prior to the mind-body split, our studies tend to reproduce this rift: Paster's The Body Embarrassed: Drama and Disciplines of Shame in Early Modern England and Katharine Maus's Inwardness and Theater in the English Renaissance are two of several such studies. Most recently, we have been obsessed with objects, reach- ing our hands into the past to finger fabrics, taste the exotic, and marvel at the technologies. The movement from new historicism to cultural materialism has ushered in a variety of deliberations on the materiality of the body and the cul- tural nexus of bodily discourses. How do religious and scientific explanations of the body affect the subject's lived experience in the world? This narcissistic scholarship is not in itself a bad thing, provided we are aware of our predilec- tion to see ourselves in others and provided we resist the urge to view our "na- ture" and "natural" constructions as normative or pre-discursive. The critical writings of Burckhardt, Paster, and Maus offer us many insights into the cul- ture of another time, but they also provide us with insight into ourselves. And though this scholarship sometimes rehearses modern dichotomous classifica- tions, gifted scholars such as Paster and Maus always remind us of our own cul- tural constructions even as they explicate the early modern worldview. Paster's Humoring the Body furthers the foundational scholarship of The</page><page sequence="3">HENLEY 115 Body Embarrassed. In The Body Embarrassed, Paster states that one of her pri- mary goals is the exploration of "the experience as from within as bodies that understood themselves and were understood by others in terms of humoral physiology" (2; author's emphasis). Paster extends her meditation on early modern phenomenology to this second study of the humoral body, where she provides a convincing argument that the psychological and physiological lives of the early modern subject are inextricably entwined. Approaching her sub- ject from "a historically specific early modern language of affect and theory of the body, on the one hand, and a transhistorical register of emotional experi- ence on the other" (244), Paster reconstructs the emotional life of early moderns through an exploration of humoral physiology. She pays particular attention to the interconnectivity of psychological and physiological func- tions, which she refers to as "psychological materialism" or "psychophysiol- ogy" (12). Pulling from primary sources that range from Aristotle to Robert Burton to Montaigne and drawing upon theoretical sources as far afield as Deleuze and Guattari, Paster scrutinizes the embodied and material founda- tion of early modern passions and the expression of those passions. Paster organizes her book into four chapters, each of which investigates a new facet of psychological materialism. Chapter 1 focuses on the early mod- ern subject's understanding of rage and how it was caused by the material ex- changes that occur between the subject and his or her environment. Chapter 2 delineates the effect of woman's natural coldness on feminine temperament and the ways in which heat or "caloric economy" (77) manifest differently in women than in men. The third chapter outlines the shared humoral attributes between man and animal, a point that has far-reaching consequences for our understanding of early modern subjectivity. The final chapter identifies the social hierarchy implicit in Galenic humoralism. Delving into the "phenomenological character of early modern experi- ences of emotion" (19), Paster delineates the complicated ecology of the hu- moral body as well as the pneumatic and hydraulic character of the embodied, expressive passions. The text opens with Bishop Edward Reynolds's contrast be- tween Christ's passion and that of men {Treatise of the Passions and Faculties of the Soule of Man [ 1640]). Rather than describing passion as man's sinful nature that reason must always strive to control, Reynolds depicts passion that in Christ is pure, but in man is corrupted: "The passions of sinfull men are many times like the tossings of the Sea, which bringeth up mire and durt; but the Passions of Christ were like the shaking of pure Water in a cleane Vessell, which though it be thereby troubled, yet is it not fouled at all" ( 1; author's emphasis). This quotation</page><page sequence="4">116 ■,. THE JOURNAL FOR EARLY MODERN CULTURAL STUDIES is an apt opening for Paster's two basic contentions. First, post-enlightenment thought separates the human body into reason/emotion, mind/body, but for early moderns the body and the mind were not separate entities. Instead, the hu- moral body and the flux of various humors, fluids, and spirits dictated all aspects of the lived material body, ranging from physical excretions to passionate expres- sion. Second, the humoral body, as a microcosm of the cosmos, reenacts the pneu- matic and hydraulic ecology of the macrocosm. As a consequence, similes and metaphors comparing the body to nature are not merely analogous. Rather, they are emblematic of an early modern "understanding of the relation of macrocosm to microcosm, of world to body, of the movement of wind or water to the move- ment of the passions," a relationship that Paster calls an "ecology of the passions" (9). Paster further illustrates the difference between the pre-Enlightenment understanding of analogy, its relationship to early modern epistemology, and our own ways of knowing, which privilege "fact" over representation. Paster quotes from Maus's study of inwardness: "Renaissance speech habits can make it diffi- cult to know when ... a bodily analogy is really an analogy; when we are dealing with metaphor and when with a bare statement of fact" (Maus 196; qtd. in Pas- ter 27). According to Paster, this hierarchical differentiation between analogy, metaphor, and fact "fails to register the importance of analogy to an emblematic way of thinking, still dominant in Shakespeare's lifetime, that made discovery of similitude and resemblance the richest and most direct path of knowledge of the world" (27). Thus Reynolds's comparison between the humoral body and the seas stands as a way of presenting knowledge of the material body, rather than as a poetic trope. In Reynolds's analogy between the passions of Christ and those of man, it is Christ's temperance- not his repudiation of emotion- that provides the crux of the distinction between his sinless nature and man's sinful mire. Strik- ingly, Reynolds employs the sea as an analogy for the workings of the humoral body. In man's body the dirt inherent in the vessel "fouls" the pure water, while Christ's clean vessel ensures that the waters, though stirred, are not con- taminated. This comparison clearly represents the body's recapitulation of the natural world. The early modern conception of the humoral body's exchanges reveals a complex system in constant flux. The passions' circulation in the hu- moral body mimics the circulation of fluids and forces in the natural world: The passions are like liquid states and forces in the natural world. But the passions - thanks to their close functional relation to the four bodily hu- mors of blood, choler, black bile, and phlegm- had a more analogical re- lation to liquid states and forces of nature, because, in this cosmology, the</page><page sequence="5">HENLEY &amp; 117 stuff of the outside world and the stuff of the body were composed of the same elemental materials. (Paster 4) Further, these material substances and their interactions within the body ex- plained the subject's range of behaviors and supplied an impetus for all ac- tions, thoughts, and characteristics (13). Thus, the various permutations of behavior and emotional states could be accounted for through the physical make-up of an individual's humoral balance and lability. And more impor- tantly, these fluxes in emotional states were material changes caused by mate- rial substances - a manifestation of "the Minds inclination follow [ing] the Bodies temperature" (Selden B4; qtd. in Paster 13). Taken as a whole, Paster's text convincingly mandates a modification in our theoretical approach to early modern subjectivity and individuality. For example, chapter 3, entitled "Melancholy Cats, Lugged Bears, and Other Pas- sionate Animals," delineates persuasive evidence that a paradigmatic shift in our theorization of early modern subjectivity is needed. Paster maintains, "it is important to our historical understanding of the passions that they be- longed to a part of the natural order jointly occupied by humans and animals" (135). To support this claim, she reminds us of three basic early modern be- liefs about the cosmos. First, in the hydraulic model of the passions, organs or systems of organs provide a locus for various psychological functions. Second, animals with a heart and blood also inhabit humoral bodies. Third, though humans alone possess an "intellective soul," both animals and humans pos- sess a "sensitive soul" that controls "perceptual, motive, and appetitive facul- ties" as well as a "vegetative soul" (also housed in plants) that facilitates "growth, nutrition, and generation" (136). In the hierarchical organization of the soul, the sensitive soul is central, "between sense and reason- with sense defined as purely external and material actions of the vegetable soul and rea- son as the purely internal and immaterial action of the intellective soul" ( 1 36). Passions endow both humans and animals with their basic attractions and aversions and with their psychological makeup, their temperament. This hierarchy of the cosmos and the belief in a permeable body ex- changing bodily matter with its environs argue for a very different under- standing of subjectivity than our own. Paster calls for us to "interrogate the place of psychological materialism in the whole analogical network of early modern ontology" (137). She makes the radical suggestion that recognizing the humoral constitution of animals along with its affective entailments serves to widen the active scope of the passions well beyond</page><page sequence="6">118 ; THE JOURNAL FOR EARLY MODERN CULTURAL STUDIES the species barrier, extending the passions' salience out to the universe at large and underscoring the passions' ontological status in nature. Thus to embed humoral affectivity in the world is not to take it out of the body; rather, it is to deterritorialize it, to remap it, to extend it. It is to understand Immorality in Deleuzian terms as a means and mechanism to bodily desire. (187) The consequence of Paster's theorization of the passions in conjunction with her earlier work on the humoral body is that we now have a clearer picture of early modern human embodiment and subjectivity, one that is vastly different and decidedly alien to us. In this history of the body, we find a fluid, labile, and material psychology. Thus, as Paster points out in her epilogue, Descartes's refutation of the tripartite soul and his advocacy of a single soul do more than simply introduce the mind/body split and modern skepticism; Cartesian thought also introduces a dematerialization, an abstraction of all functions as- sociated with thought and emotion, making it difficult for us to find our way back to a pre- Cartesian phenomenological experience of the world. However, as Schoenfeldt points out, even Descartes does not completely reduce the soul to immateriality. Descartes's belief that the soul was housed in the pineal gland still participates in a material understanding of the humoral body (11), a fact that modern scholars frequently gloss over in their simplification of Descartes's writings. Carol Thomas Neely approaches early modern subjectivity from an- other angle. In Distracted Subjects: Madness and Gender in Shakespeare and Early Modern Culture, she concentrates on the discourses of distraction and their representations from 1576 to 1632. She issues a corrective to such earlier studies of the period as Basil Clarke's Mental Disorder in Earlier England and Michael McDonald's Mystical Bedlam. She also responds to such broader his- torical overviews as Foucault's Madness and Civilization, overviews which fre- quently represent early modern madness and its treatment as homogeneous and fixed, merely marking time until the Enlightenment. Neely contends, "new divisions emerge when mental disorders change their epistemological profile and their cultural place" (3). By perusing scientific treatises, with their explanations of and treatments for distraction, and by dissecting the literary and theatrical representations of madness, Neely successfully reveals cultural shifts in the early modern definitions of disease and the prescribed treatments. Using Greenblatt's concept of the "circulation of social energy," Neely traces the "fluid and reciprocal exchanges among multiple cultural locations, each influenced and altered by gender as a category of analysis" (7). The first</page><page sequence="7">HENLEY m 119 two chapters argue that representations of madness on the stage "introduce distinctions that influence cultural debates about gender, the supernatural, and the subject" (8). Chapters 3 and 4 focus on sexual and erotic desire, ex- posing how gender and class become increasingly relevant to the diagnoses and treatments of distraction caused by desire. In chapters 5 and 6, Neely points out the alarming tendency of modern scholars and historians to treat theatrical representations of the distracted as a mimesis of material practices. Comparing theatrical representations with archival accounts of practices and attitudes pertaining to the mad, Neely claims that institutions and representa- tions of confinement "develop divergent uses of and attitudes toward the con- finement of the distracted, one compassionate, the other farcical, one dominant and humanizing, the other emergent and dehumanizing" (8). The Jacobean stage representation of the Bedlamites and other distracted individ- uals as nonsensical animals to be indefinitely confined in Bethlehem Hospital and only trotted out for entertainment purposes does not, according to Neely, reflect the actual historical practices. In this final chapter Neely scrutnizes the single piece of evidence most commonly cited as proof that viewing the mad at Bedlam was common practice. Neely places the 1610- 1 1 bookkeeping entry for the disbursement of 10s. to the "show of Bethlehem" in its archival context and outlines the various other entertainments to which this phrase might re- fer. Neely views modern scholarship's propagation of the Bedlam occupants as dehumanized spectacle as a universalization of our own practice of institu- tionalizing and demonizing the mentally ill. These last two chapters successfully challenge the practice of looking to dramatic texts as historically accurate depictions of society and reveal the all- too-common practice of assuming that previous archival research is accurate. What these closing chapters lack is a thorough consideration of early modern attitudes regarding the poor. In previous chapters, Neely takes the issue of class into consideration. In her history of Bedlam, though, Neely notes that the primary purpose for the hospital's existence is to house the distracted poor, but she does not theorize about how being mad and impoverished might alter treatment practices. The dehumanization of the mad that occurs after the historical period she describes, when we do have documentation of the Bedlam occupants as spectacle, has as much to do with their poverty as their distracted state. The administrators at Bedlam were the same Board of Governors who ran Bridewell. Bridewell housed not only prostitutes and reli- gious dissenters, but also idle vagrants and orphans and had originally been chartered for the purpose of educating poor boys. The "cure" for all of these</page><page sequence="8">120 &amp; THE JOURNAL FOR EARLY MODERN CULTURAL STUDIES ills was work. At the end of the period that Neely covers, Bridewell became known as a place of entertainment, where spectators could spend the after- noon watching the whipping of prostitutes. A whipping post with a public viewing area was placed at Bridewell in 1633; the viewing areas was enlarged in 1677, and the whipping post was raised in 1682 so that spectators could have a better view (Cowie 356). It is not at all far-fetched to think that the mad housed at Bedlam might be more demonized than those whose families could afford to look after them at home. Nor is it ridiculous to speculate that the same, frequently corrupt, Board of Governors responsible for housing, feeding, and "curing" the indigent at Bridewell might carry the same practices over to Bedlam. Neely claims: the hospital's charitable and therapeutic functions, its space, its protocols of admission, and its desirability as a refuge for indigent distracted persons remained unchanged from early fifteenth to the late seventeenth century. Close attention to these matters shows that at no time were mad- persons who sought entry viewed as less than or other than human, deemed incur- able, or considered spectacles. (169) Yet Neely's own archival evidence demonstrates the similarity between treat- ments at Bedlam and Bridewell. Neely quotes from Thomas More's "Apology" (1533), in which More writes of a man who was "put uppe in Bedelem, and af- terwarde by betynge and correccyon gathered hys remembrauce to hym" (118; qtd. in Neely 170), and Neely recounts a 1446 reference to Bedlam stating that the occupants are "so alienated in mind and possessed of unclean spirits that they must be restrained with chains and fetters" (History ofBethlem 1 1 4; qtd. in Neely 171). She points out that More's allusion refers to a beating that More or- dered and that it occurred outside of Bedlam. Of the second quotation, she states that chaining was probably necessary in the case of the most agitated oc- cupants. However, the More quotation also allows the possibility that whip- ping was occasionally used as a "cure," while the second story establishes that occupants of Bedlam were restrained, but gives us no indication as to the atti- tude of those applying the restraints. Neely also paraphrases the results of a 1598 inspection, which illuminates Bedlam's sad state of disrepair, noting that "the kitchen sink [was] stopped up, the floor and ceiling in the keeper's lodge falling down, and tiling everywhere in need of repair" (171). Neely speculates that because there were not many (recorded) complaints, this "suggests that few visitors went there" (175). But it might also suggest that if spectators visited Bedlam, they were not sympathetic to the occupants and saw nothing amiss in</page><page sequence="9">HENLEY m 121 the housing conditions. This one-sided reading at the end of the book, though, does not negate the impressive work of scholarship found in this text. Neely of- fers new and insightful readings of theatrical representations of madness. She complicates our understanding of the reciprocity between early modern the- ater and "scientific" discourse, and her reading of the important roles that gen- der plays in the diagnosis, treatment, and representation of early modern madness impressively corrects early scholarship. Susan Zimmerman's The Early Modern Corpse and Shakespeare's Theatre is also an exemplary model of feminist scholarship. Like Paster, Zimmerman's interest lies in the interstices of the transhistorical experience of the living (or, in this case, the dead) body and the historically specific, cultural constructions of meaning. Like Paster and Neely, she also provides subtle readings of the ways in which the early modern theater represented these constructions. Zimmerman's book project began as an investigation into what she calls the "transhistorical signifier, in ritual and in language, for the inexplicable and the inexpressible" (1). Bringing the theories of Georges Bataille, Mary Douglas, and Julia Kristeva to bear on an inquiry into constructions of the body as enigma and taboo, Zimmerman examines "the ritual and psychic processes by which the subject constructs the body itself as a prototype of the unknowable and the unspeakable" (1). There are three particularly sophisticated and groundbreaking compo- nents to this book. The first is Zimmerman's astute explanations of the role the body (including the corpse) plays in the reformists' rebuttal of Catholic religious practices. The second lies in her interpretation of how early modern theatrical practices like cross-dressing complicate stage representations of the corpse. The third and most impressive aspect of Zimmerman's text is her ac- count of the difference that gender makes in both the reformists' theological debates about materialism and in the stage representations. Zimmerman begins by explicating Bataille's configuration of taboo as so- ciety's system whereby it both "seeks to regulate primary forms of violence, and thereby to defy the larger scheme of radical instability that constitutes the sub- ject's world" and titillates the human desire to "'approach the void'- a case of 'desire originati ing] in its opposite, horror'" (3). The text then explores how the fear of psychic/bodily dissolution and the simultaneous longing for origi- nary, pre-discursive unity "situates the corpse at a critical nexus that connects local and universal signifiers in a reciprocal, productive tension" (3). The author discusses Bataille's claim that the "ambivalent power of the putrefying corpse is implicit in the biological structure of the living body" (3) in</page><page sequence="10">122 S&amp; THE JOURNAL FOR EARLY MODERN CULTURAL STUDIES which the sexual organs double as the conduits for the purgation of bodily waste. Thus, the generative power of sex is linked to the body's dirt and decay. In particular, the body's eventual decay- its putrefaction- "is the foremost signifier of marginal, indeterminate, being" (4). Douglas also sees putrefac- tion as the ultimate signifier of dissolution, as may be seen in the reaction to human "dirt" of all kinds- including excreta and menstrual blood. Bodily dirt escapes the "categories of symbolic order" and "evokes the horror of and desire for originary formlessness - Bataille's void" (4). Zimmerman observes that for both Douglas and Kristeva, the female body becomes the central sig- nifier of bodily dissolution. She concludes that female sexuality represents the means by which the female body is "empowered to exercise its life- and death- dealing potencies, that is, its power as breaker of existing entities in sexual self-dissolution, and as generator of new entities in the gestation and birthing of infants" (6). Zimmerman's exposition of the theories of Bataille, Douglas, and Kristeva demonstrates the way in which the female body emblematizes death and marginality. This theorization provides the foundation for the au- thor's complex reading of the corpse on the early modern stage. In chapter 2, entitled "Body Imaging and Religious Reform: The Corpse as Idol," Zimmerman adds theology to theory. She examines the medieval and early modern theological debates that raged over the process of putrefaction and its relationship both to man's post-lapsian fall and to Christ's sacrificial suffering. Zimmerman claims, "Fundamentally, the Reformation's attack on the anthropomorphism of idolatry was symptomatic of its preoccupation with the dangers implicit in materiality and its properties: the materiality of the image or idol, the materiality of the body, and- at its most profound and orig- inary level- the materiality of the corpse" (24). At the heart of the reformists' debate about Catholic practices was a profound disagreement about the nature of the body's materiality. Christ's redemption of mankind required his embod- iment, physical suffering, and the sacrifice of that vessel so that humans might transcend their own sinful and mortal bodies. Church fathers debated the exact processes of the soul's transcendence at the time of death and questioned what role the body's decay played in that transition. Catholic practice tended to focus on Christ's humanity. Drawing on Caroline Walker Bynum's work, Zimmer- man observes that in late medieval Catholicism Christ's body "figured as the central emblem for the redemptive process, but even more importantly, the transformative functions of the body itself were seen as deeply imbricated in Christ's redemptive act" (29). Protestants saw Catholicism as "privileging the material principle over that of the spiritual in the Christian system of belief</page><page sequence="11">HENLEY m 123 (25). To privilege Christ's humanity, rather than his divinity, recapitulates, from a reformist perspective, the error of idolatry; it entails molding Christ into man's image rather than acknowledging his inconceivable divinity. In short, Zimmerman characterizes the "Reformation's virtually intractable dilemma" as the struggle "to reformulate the prevailing concept of the body/soul relation- ship so as to counteract the materiality of Catholicism, but without repudiating the paradoxes at the heart of Christian doctrine" (25). The corpse is especially problematic because it, in Catholic theology, in- habits a liminal space between the tainted material body and the soul's spiritual transformation. Zimmerman notes that "the function of putrefaction as trans- formation-that is, the generation of change through transformation- seemed to collapse distinctions of any kind between states of being" (27). For the re- formists, this conception of the corpse dangerously obscures the corruption of the material body. As Zimmerman indicates, several Tudor texts attack Catho- lic materiality. For example, Foxe's Acts and Monuments and the official homily against idolatry issue virulent critiques of materiality. In the homily against idolatry, the homilist posits that the body stands as the material opposite of the soul; the body is sentient only because it is animated by the soul. The homilist then links the "spiritual whoredom" of privileging the material body to "carnal fornication" because "to privilege the body as an independent entity over the soul is to privilege its corruption" (52). Extending the analogy further, the ho- milist genders insubstantial spirit and the material body as male and female re- spectively: "the qualities of Spirit are ... imbricated in the male principle; by extension, then, whatever is not Spirit- that which is 'gross, bodily, and visible' is theoretically female" (57). Zimmerman brilliantly connects her earlier dis- cussion of transhistorical anthropological and psychological theorization about "women's customary function as a scapegoat for death" (12) to an his- torically specific account of how this displacement works in the early modern period. The text also implicitly comments upon Paster's discussion of the soul, pushing the refutation of humoral medicine's account of the soul's materiality back as far as the mid-sixteenth century, rather than beginning with Descartes. In chapters 3 and 4 Zimmerman turns to plays by Middleton, Massinger, and Webster. She first scrutinizes necrophilia in Middleton's The Second Maiden 's Tragedy and Massinger's The Duke of Milan, arguing that in both plays the focus is on the dead body's "re/generative potential" (90). Thus, both plays display the corpse in the form of the "body as idol," ostensibly reiterating the re- formists' rant against idolatry. However, the result of such a display on the stage paradoxically destabilized the theater's rebuttal of theatrical representation as</page><page sequence="12">124 ■&amp; THE JOURNAL FOR EARLY MODERN CULTURAL STUDIES idolatrous. By siding with the reformists* condemnation of "the corpse as idol- atrous object of desire" (91), these plays participated in the same arguments against "the performative agency of the actor as part of its larger attack on ma- terial, and especially anthropomorphic, images" (90). In chapter 4, Zimmer- man skillfully reads Middleton's The Revenger's Tragedy and Webster's Duchess ofMalfi as plays in which the corpses- Gloriana's skull, Antonio's wife, and the Duchess- participate in early modern myths of animated corpses. In both plays, sexual desire is graphically entwined with putrefaction and death, play- ing on the culture's "iconographic blurring of the boundaries between putre- faction and reproduction" (131). In Zimmerman's final chapter, she provides a complex psychoanalytical reading of Hamlet's father's ghost in Hamlet and Duncan's corpse in Macbeth. Zimmerman construes the ghost and corpse in these plays as "uncanny doubles" confronting Hamlet and Macbeth with their own imminent and inevitable dissolution. Reading MacdufF s description of the dead Duncan as '"a new Gorgon'" in psychoanalytical terms, Zimmerman sees the ghost and the corpse as incarnations of the Medusa. She claims, "To view the Medusa is to discover the indeterminacy of originary being and to lose one's 'self as a con- sequence: Hamlet's fate in confronting his ghost; Macbeth's also in internalis- ing the Gorgon that Duncan has become" (173). All three of these studies provide astute readings of early modern self- hood and its theatrical representation. Paster's and Zimmerman's texts, in particular, break new ground and open further vistas for future scholars struggling to represent the lived experience of early modern subjects. Paster and Zimmerman also utilize psychoanalytic and feminist theory in a fresh way, managing to avoid claims of essentialism by situating all transhistorical theory in an historically specific and theoretically complex milieu. In Bodies That Mattery Judith Butler asks, "Is there a way to link the question of the ma- teriality of the body to the performativity of gender?" (1). All three of these texts account for gender in their attempts to historicize human interiority, successfully demonstrating the fraught relationship between the body's mate- riality and gender's performance.
