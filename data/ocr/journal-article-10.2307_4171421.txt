<plain_text><page sequence="1">Sumptuary Arts of Ancient Persia N APRIL and May I965, under the patronage of His Imperial Majesty, the Shahanshah of Iran, there will be shown in the Museum of Fine Arts, Boston, an exceptional wealth of material from the Archaeological Mu- seum in Teheran and from the collection of Mohsen Foroughi of Teheran. Entitled 7000 Years of Iranian Art, the exhibition covers the entire span of Persian art from its earliest prehistoric beginnings to the igth century A.D. The major emphasis of this great exhibition is on the still little understood cultures of Luristan and northwest Iran, including the recent and spectacular discoveries made at Marlik in the province of Gilan. To enlarge the representation of Achaemenian art and its predecessors, several American collectors and museums have generously agreed to lend a group of works of art from Persia of the First Millennium B.C. I have selected as the title of this supplementary exhibition "Sumptuary Arts of Ancient Persia" with a deliberate reference to the art of gold and silver working which has from time immemorial been Persian par excellence. I have also included, however, objects made from other materials which, while baser in their modern im- plications, must anciently have had a much greater significance both to the men who devoted so much craftsmanship to their manufacture and to their patrons. Although Persian metalwork of the First Millennium is not rare in America, these several masterpieces may represent the most magnificent group assembled at one time in this country, and the Museum is honored to acknowledge its profound gratitude to the collectors, curators and museums who have made possible the exhibition published here: Mr. Alastair Bradley Martin (Guennol Collection), Mr. and Mrs. Leon Pomerance, Messrs. Bernard and Michael Pomerance, Mr. Norbert Schimmel, Mr. Vaughan Crawford, Mr. Bernard V. Bothmer, the Metropolitan Museum of Art and the Brooklyn Museum.' The Boston Museum's own interest in ancient Persian art began in the early part of this century when officers of the Museum desired to excavate a site - "Per- sepolis or the like" - for the purpose of obtaining both works of art and historical knowledge. George A. Reisner, already having remarkable success for the Museum in his excavations at Giza, was approached and was sympathetic to the proposal to dig in Persia during intervals of suspension of the work in Egypt. At that moment, political conditions in Persia worsened and the plan had to be given up. But thirty years later the Museum joined with the University Museum of the University of Pennsylvania and the Oriental Institute of the University of Chicago in supporting the excavations of Erich Schmidt at several sites, including Persepolis. As a result of this cooperation, the Museum received an interesting series of prehistoric pottery 3</page><page sequence="2">C] 4</page><page sequence="3">and small objects. Meanwhile, Mr. and Mrs. Edward Jackson Holmes, while he was Director and then President of the Museum, were collecting Persian art, both ancient and Islamic, and stimulated the purchase of important antiquities for the Museum. A direct result of their interest was the acquisition of a large and valuable collection of Luristan bronzes which had first appeared on the market in 1929 and which were acquired in I930. During the I930's several Achaemenian reliefs from Persepolis were purchased and in I937 the Oriental Institute deposited in Boston for permanent loan the great lion-bull symplegma from Persepolis. An exhibition from the national collections of Iran was shown in New York in 1949 and was brought to Boston early in I950, where it was joined by objects from the Museum's holdings, the collection of Mr. and Mrs. Edward Jackson Holmes and other American collec- tions. In i952 and 1957 Mrs. Holmes made gifts of the larger part of the collection belonging to her and her late husband; in I964 it was a melancholy duty to record the receipt of the remainder in the form of a bequest. These well-known objects, including important Sassanian and Islamic material, are now known as the Holmes Collection. In I958 the Department of Egyptian Art assumed charge of the Ancient Near Eastern Collection and in the ensuing years we have been fortunate in obtaining gold work, bronzes and terra cottas of the early First Millennium. In i96o we acquired the spectacular silver and gold bowl of the Achaemenian period, which is one of the great examples of the sumptuary arts of the Persian Empire.2 Catalogue THE LENDERS have provided most of the illustrations published here, and have generously supplied much of the information utilized in the catalogue. It has not been possible to analyze the metals and when an object is called "bronze," it must be borne in mind that "bronzes" sometimes turn out to be copper. The objects are arranged as nearly as possible in chronological order, although the development of Achaemenian style is by no means so well established that an unquestioned order can be given. The same state exists in the case of the earlier material. Bronzes and Pottery of Northwest Persia i. MASK, apparently representing a horned deity. Collection Bernard Pomerance. Bronze. Early First Millennium. Possibly from Payravand. H. 8"I6 in. (22 cm.). Exhibited: Queens College, Man in the Ancient World, I958, p. I5, No. 34; p. 34 (ill.); Metropolitan Museum of Art, von Bothmer, Ancient Art from New York Private Collections (hereinafter referred to as New York Private Collections), I959, p. II, pls. 4, I7; Petit Palais, Paris, Sept mille ans, I96I, p. 6, No. 27. Also published in Le Figaro, Paris, October i8, I96I. On a long cylindrical neck sits a geometrical face with large, hollow eyes, beaked nose, slashed mouth and hemispherical ears pierced with four holes each. Three ridges define the forehead and may represent the lower edge of a helmet or cap to which the sweeping horns are attached. A twisted ring of bronze is added to the lower part of the right hand horn. The back of the mask is hollow and might well S</page><page sequence="4">have had a core of some other material to which the mask was originally attached. The holes in the ears are obviously meant to take earrings. What is this strange deity? Despite many attempts to do so, no one has satisfactorily pinned down an external cultural milieu to which the Luristan bronzes might belong. The several mythological analyses that have been proffered are, I think, as much myth as they are fact. Such parallels with other Luristan bronzes that exist are more iconographic than stylistic. The horns are found on many of the so-called "Gilga- mesh" bronzes, those figures which, because of their horns and hairlocks, are thought by some to be derived from the rather similar Mesopotamian representation of the epic hero. In every case of this type, however, the chins are exceptionally defined, as are the cheeks, by what might be described as "blobs" of flesh which give the impression of being pinched as if in clay. In fact, stylistically, the closest parallels to the bronze mask are the pottery figures of steatopygous females and the spouted masked vessels of askos-shape that I have elsewhere inaccurately referred to as "bird-pots."3 In these two classes we find the same moon-shaped jaw, flat or flattish foreheads, circular eyes (more irregular in the bronze mask), beaked nose, and large pierced ears. The terra cottas, as far as is known, come from the general region of Dailaman (in which the village of Amlash is located and where the chief market for the antiquities is found; the village has given its name, inaccurately, to the antiqui- ties). In general there is little, if any, relationship between the terra cottas and bronzes of Dailaman and those of Luristan, and it is obvious that they represent two distinct strains of pre-Achaemenian culture. Several bronze figurines from Payravand (in the mountains of Kurdistan) bear a certain resemblance to our bronze mask and have given rise to the suggestion that the mask came from that area. Here again the relationship is slight and the Payravand bronzes, although differing in some essential details from the normal Luristan type, are more closely associated with the latter than with the bronze mask. All that can be said, then, is that the Pomerance bronze represents for the time being a unique and important type. If its archaeo- logical context is uncertain, at least we can say that as a work of art the mask has great authority and that it stands as another important monument to the individuality that is characteristic of the pre-Achaemenian metal-workers of Iran. 2. CYLINDER with human heads. Collection Norbert Schimmel. Bronze. Early First Millennium. From Marlik (?). H. 4A4 in. (10.7 cm.). Exhibited: Fogg Art Mu- seum, I964-I965, H. Hoffmann (ed.), Norbert Schimmel Collection, Mainz, I964, No. 65 (C. Wilkinson). Cylinder open at top, bottom ending in closed cone. Six human heads, looking downward, attached to sides in symmetrical arrangement. Six triangular cutouts interspersed between heads. Wilkinson, op. cit., points out the occurrence of tri- angular cutouts on certain bronze pendants and "bells" found in the Caucasus (cf. C. Schaeffer, Stratigraphie comparee, Fig. 298). He also mentions a similar cylinder with projecting heads excavated at Marlik, and now published in Iran (Journal of the British Institute of Persian Studies), 2, I964, pl. iid. The latter is open at both ends and is no doubt a mace-head. Although the Schimmel bronze is closed at one end, there is really nothing to prevent it from being a mace-head also, and it is to this purpose that I would ascribe its use. Stylistically the Marlik and Schimmel bronzes are 6</page><page sequence="5">/7. 2 3 extremely close (the heads of the latter are only somewhat more fully rounded than the excavated example), and it is with little doubt that we place the bronze in the Marlik complex. Triangular cutouts occur also on a pomegranate-shaped bronze bell excavated at Marlik and published in ILN, May 5, I962, p. 699, Fig. 5. The excavated cylinder retains inlaid eyes of bone and the Schimmel bronze probably had the same. As with the bronze mask, a primitive object is given a highly satisfying resolution of form, and although it is barbaric it reveals a nice sense of balance and even reserve in its simplicity. 3. WHETSTONE HANDLE ending in four horses' heads. Collection Norbert Schimmel. Bronze. Early First Millennium. From Luristan. L. 44 in. (I2 cm.). Exhibited: Sept mille ans, No. 237; Hoffmann, op. cit., No. 66 (C. Wilkinson). Funnel-shaped handle, with loose ring for attachment inserted in holes near open end. From a double-ring collar at the narrow end spring the heads of four horses stylized in the usual Luristan fashion. The manes are carefully worked, the tufts being slightly modeled. The ears lie back against the neck, and a forelock projects forward. The eyes as usual are large and lozenge-shaped. A triangular depression occurs in each forehead (to take an inlay?). Most such whetstone handles, as they are called, end in a single head of a horse, caprid, or lion and occasionally in two such heads. The present example is so far unique in having four heads. The decoration is 7</page><page sequence="6">imbued with considerable movement which is enhanced by the forward thrust of the heads and their slender form. This handle is an exceptional example of the finest group of Luristan bronzes which employ an economy of means to produce straight- forward, unadorned grace (cf., for example, the bronze finial of confronted felines, Terrace, No. 37). 4. MALE FIGURE holding a cup. Collection Norbert Schitninel. Pottery with burnished red slip. Early First Millennium. From S. W. Caspian. H. I2 in. (30.4 cm.). Exhibited: Hoffmann, op. cit., No. 71 (C. Wilkinson). The figure of a male holds a cup, the bottom of which opens into the hollow interior of the vessel. The head and face are summarily rendered, the "pinched" appearance being like the bronzes mentioned above. Although the arms are not separated from the body, they are modeled as over-extended, string-like appendages, ending in carelessly incised fingers which grasp the cup. The buttocks are over-large and modeled. The heavy legs are somewhat suggestive of a squatting figure, the massive knees drawn up under the arms. The feet, like the legs, are out of proportion and heavy. Tool marks separate the otherwise unmodeled toes. The eyes are circular daubs worked in the clay, the nose coarsely made. The mouth is an open hole. The male genitals are rudely indicated in the round. The ears do not seem to have been indicated in any way. The use to which these anthropomorphic vessels and their 4, back 4, front 8</page><page sequence="7">zoomorphic counterparts were put is unknown. They must, however, have served some ritual purpose and their discovery in graves raises the obvious implication of an association with funerary rites. The figure is somewhat similar to another male holding a pot, reputedly from Luristan (Ghirshman, Art of Ancient Iran, Fig. 108), although the face in that case is rather more like those of the Dailaman terra cottas referred to above but without the tiered head dress so typical of the latter. Two figures from Marlik, also holding pots, represent still a third type. The squared-off shoulders, broad chest and squatting shape of the Schimmel vessel separate it from either of the types just mentioned. Much more similar is an unpublished vessel, but representing a female, in the Heeramaneck Collection, New York. 5. HEAD of a lion-griffin. Collection Norbert Schinmmel. Bronze. Early First Millen- nium. From N. W. Iran. L. 76 in. (20 cm.), D. of rim 5 ' in. ( 3 cm.). Exhibited: Hoffmann, op. cit., No. 6I (C. Wilkinson). The object has been so well described by Wilkinson in Norbert Schiimmnel Collection that I shall do no more here than to recapitulate briefly the more important points. The head is hollow. After casting, details were added by punching and incising. Particularly interesting are the tiny circles of dots that cover the cheeks of the beast. The roof of the mouth is adorned with horizontal rows of dots and lines. Later, in 5 9</page><page sequence="8">Achaemenian times, these become ridges in imitation of a feature found in nature. The protruding teeth are modern restorations. The long ears are attached in several places by bronze rivets. On either side of the neck are two holes for attachment. The ruff, brows, cheeks, nose and tongue are nicely modeled. This' ferociously roaring beast does not belong to any easily defined category of Near Eastern art. Although the triangular eye has counterparts in Urartian art (the Assyrian-influenced art of ancient Armenia), Wilkinson rightly points out the absence of other features of our lion-griffin from the Urartian repertoire. In fact, the closest parallel would seem to be at Ziwiyeh where the "Urartian" eye is also found, and in particular I would suggest that the two lion-griffins on either side of the "sacred tree" found on the gold epaulette, No. 7 below, are quite close in several respects to the bronze head. Specially notable are the forward-projecting ears, the ruff which runs up to the base of the ears, the wrinkles or whiskers between nose and mouth, and the triangular eyes. I would, then, tentatively assign this bronze and its close parallel (No. 6 below) to the art of Ziwiyeh, toward 700 B.C. or possibly somewhat later. Its use is uncertain; that it was a situla (a kind of cup) held by handles attached through the holes seems unlikely. Wilkinson's suggestion of an architec- tural ornament seems the best idea, although the possibility that it was a chariot-pole finial cannot be completely discounted. 6. HEAD of a lion-griffin (?). Collection Mr. and Mrs. Leon Pomerance. Bronze. Early First Millennium. From N. W. Iran. L. 7Y in. (I9 cm.). Exhibited: New York Private Collections, p. 9, pls. 4, I2; Sept mille ans, No. 286, pl. xviii. Published: Ghirshman, ILN, April 2, I960, p. 55I, Fig. 5. Ghirshman, Artibus Asiae, 25, I962, pp. 57ff., Fig. I5. Like No. 5, the Pomerance beast is probably a lion-griffin, although the ears are missing. Holes at the top of the ruff no doubt indicate their former presence. Once more the musculature and ruff are well modeled, and the projecting fangs in this case are original. The teeth between are carefully marked, and there is some evidence for the ridges which are better preserved in the mouth of the Schimmel bronze. As is customary with griffins, a lump occurs in the center of the forehead. The upper line of the eye stops at the outer corner instead of continuing in a sweeping line as it does on the Schimmel griffin. The wrinkles or whiskers cover the nostrils, and the area between them and the mouth are modeled. The curious dotted lines and circles of the Schimmel piece are absent, and here the neck is intricately and elaborately decorated with a most delicately worked feather pattern which covers the entire neck and reaches over to the forehead. Whether this feather pattern is really meant to indicate plumage or, as in the case of certain Luristan bronzes, is simply a decora- tive representation of fur or hair is not certain. Logically, a griffin could be expected to have such feathers. Only one small hole is preserved near the rim, but the other side (now restored) probably had one also. The small size suggests the placement of a rivet to hold the head to some object. Below the rim is a guilloche which encircles the neck. The dramatic fierceness of these beasts reflects at its best the imaginative creativity of the early Iranian artist. In many ways they are naturalistic, yet the total form and IO</page><page sequence="9">6 its ornament are utterly decorative without repressing the vehement nature of the creatures. We have no idea to what mythological world this and other strange demons belong, but we may be sure that it was a frightening and awesome one filled with terror and uncertainty so great that all the artist's endeavors were de- voted to the creation of what we must take for the representation of an apotropaic environment of new and powerful forces. In the better ordered world of the Achaemenians we shall find this ferocity somewhat tamed (No. I7 below), but even there something of the old force, so vivid here, remains. II</page><page sequence="10">7 I2</page><page sequence="11">The Ziwiyeh Treasure 7. EPAULETTE with mythical monsters. Collection Mr. and Mrs. Leon Pomerance. Gold. About 700 B.C. or slightly later. From Ziwiyeh.4 H. 8/ in. (22.5 cm.). Exhibited: Sept mille ans, No. 500A, p1. XXXVII (upper part only then known); Metropolitan Museum of Art. Published: BMMA, April 1963, p. 277, Fig. 5; Ghirshman, Art of Ancient Iran, Fig. 378; H.A.L.E. Bijvanck-Quarles van Ufford, "Points de Repere pour la Chronologie de l'Art grec au 7me Siecle av. J.-C.," Bulletin van de Vereeniging tot Bevordering der Kennis van de Antieke Beschaving te ,s- Gravenhage, 39, I964, p. 69, Fig. Io. The entire object is framed by parallel ridges between which a guilloche is placed. The two upper comers have a petal each, the narrow end of which is punched with a hole for attachment to fabric or leather; holes are also found on the sides and bottom of the plaque. The upper register consists of mythical winged beasts confronting a "sacred tree." On the left, facing right, are first a female sphinx, then a bird-tailed lion-griffin. The "tree" is next with a lion-griffin, sphinx and finally a third lion- griffin skillfully fitted into the narrow comer by folding its rear legs, all facing left. This register is separated by a ridge from the rest of the design which is fitted into the remaining lozenge-shaped space, in which all the figures are directed toward the lower point of the epaulette. The outer registers consist of two processions of fantastic beasts, again all winged, but with new elements. Beginning at the left we have a bull, a man-headed bull, horned lion-griffin and lion. At the right: a bull, man-headed bull, horned lion-griffin, griffin and lion. At the point of the epaulette, and on the same ground line as the right-hand procession is a winged bull, its forelegs bent to the ground. The most interesting scene of this object, and one of the most interesting in the entire Ziwiyeh repertoire, is a strange bird, its wings outspread and seen from above, but its head in profile. It grasps in its beak a human head and in its talons two tiny Mischwesen of an indeterminable kind: they appear to be young beasts of some sort, their heads rather resembling young caprids, but their legs and feet seeming to be those of felines (or dogs?). The patterning of the bodies resembles the fleece of sheep or goats, and the tails too are caprid-like. In the narrow point of this ridge-defined lozenge a naturalistically-rendered, roaring lion seems to confront the great bird with defiance. Wilkinson (op. cit., p. 279) has drawn attention to the Mesopotamian and Susian parallels to this strange scene, but these are many centuries earlier. One would expect to discover a closer and more direct line of trans- mission of this ancient and fearful spectacle, but the bird preying on beasts and men seems to be missing from late Assyrian art and particularly the glyptic which would have provided the easiest means of sending the scene to Ziwiyeh. The subject occurs only in a different form, where a lion-griffin or the like attacks, e.g., a caprid (Moort- gat, Vorderasiatische Rollsiegel, No. 652). A subject more like that from Ziwiyeh is found at Marlik (7000 Years of Iranian Art, No. I9). A curious feature is the skirt between the front legs of the female-headed sphinxes of the upper register and the griffin of the right-hand register. This skirt is thought to derive from Phoenician iconography, and was no doubt transmitted to the Ziwiyeh repertoire via Assyria where Phoenician ivories of the early First Millen- nium are well known. The striding, man-headed bulls come directly from Assyria, I3</page><page sequence="12">unless they are at Ziwiyeh by way of Urartu. The Urartian origin of the Ziwiyeh material has been much discussed, as have other possibilities. The artistic traditions involved at Ziwiyeh are, to say the least, confusing. Scythian, Phoenician, Assyrian, Urartian and native Persian elements abound. Some of the ivories found in the treasure must be imports from Assyria, but others are just as certainly local products. It is too much to state that, as a whole, the objects are either Urartian or Scythian, but influences from these exist. It has been proposed to call the treasure "Mannaean" after the textually documented inhabitants of the region, but the material from Hasanlu, less derivative and more original in style, seems to disprove the Mannaean tag. The arguments for and against these various attributions have been sufficiently well put forward in the literature cited, and no good purpose would be served in making a reprise here. [See cover illustration] 8. PLAQUE with heroic scenes. Collection Mr. and Mrs. Leon Pomerance. Gold. About 700 B.C. or slightly later. From Ziwiyeh. H. 5 Y in. (I4 cm.). Exhibited: Metro- politan Museum of Art, BMMA, March I955, p. 220; Oriental Institute, Oriental Institute Annual Report, 1958-59, p. I7, Fig. 8; Museum of Fine Arts, Annual Report, I963, p. 6I; also exhibited Brooklyn Museum. Professor Helene Kantor believes this plaque to come from a quiver to which the following plaques also belong: Archaeological Museum, Teheran (Registers 6-8), van den Berghe, l'Archeologie de l'Iran ancien, pl. 141e; Louvre (Register 9), Syria, 35, I1958, p. I82, Fig. 7; Archaeological Musuem, Teheran (Registers II-I2), Godard, Le Tresor de Ziwiye, p. 37, Fig. 27; New York Private Collections, p. 9, pls. I2, 102 (Register i). The fragment of the quiver preserved in the Pomerance collection retains six frames each containing identical scenes derived directly from Assyrian art: a robed and bearded figure slaying a lion with a sword. It becomes a highly popular subject in Persian art and in the Achaemenian period is found on reliefs and cylinder seals. The frames are separated by ridges and dots, and the two halves divided by a guil- loche. The outer edges are pierced with holes for attachment to whatever material the quiver was made of, possibly leather. The heroic figure of the lion-slayer wears the robes and coiffeur of an Assyrian king: a patterned and fringed garment which was made of either sheepskin or fabric. A very similar robe is worn by the winged figures found on the reliefs of Ashurna- sirpal in so many American collections (e.g., Terrace, Nos. I8-I9). A relief of Ashur- banipal (Frankfort, Art and Architecture of the Ancient Orient, pl. 109), showing the king in the act of giving the coup de grace to a wounded lion, has the king wearing a somewhat different robe, this time either a fabric, or possibly patterned leather for greater protection. In the Assyrian relief and the Ziwiyeh plaque a diadem holds the hair in place, gathered in a bob at the back of the neck. How closely a people with an uncertain tradition of their own have followed examples, may be seen in the rendering of the musculature of the legs, which in Ziwiyeh is based on such a prototype as the relief of Ashurnasirpal (Terrace, Nos. I8-I9). The three-dimen- sional, curving form of the calf of the Assyrian relief becomes in the derivative art a cursorily incised line to which are added other lines to indicate the long muscle that 14</page><page sequence="13">runs down the leg from the back of the knee to the ankle. The kneecap, too, at Ziwiyeh receives scant attention, but it is there just as it is on its models. The lion on the other hand is somewhat more original. The rib-cage takes the shape of a wing, a design found elsewhere at Ziwiyeh (e.g. on most of the beasts of No. 7) and in later Persian art (e.g. Nos. II, I5-I8, although in some cases wings or fur may be intended instead of the rib-cage). We also find other details turned into decorative devices: the famous shoulder whorl and the flame-patterned fur on the haunches. It is, in fact, typical of Persian art that what had been elsewhere a subject inspired with heroism and sometimes even with pathos becomes more ornamental than dramatic. The drama is gone from these rigid figures and we are left with a pattern pleasing to the eye, the original emotion of which we may come to intellectually but which is hardly significant instinctively. The hero slaying a lion may have a reference to an ancient Mesopotamian concept of the triumph of order (represented by the hero) over chaos (the lion symbolizing the forces of nature). That the artisans of Ziwiyeh were aware of Mesopotamian myth is shown by the curious scene on No. 7. On the other hand, and I think likelier, the subject may simply refer to the prowess and bravery of the chieftain whose hunting equipment was once adorned with this plaque. Early or Proto-Achaemenian Silver 9. VASE with bull handles. Collection Mr. and Mrs. Leon Pomerance. Silver with high copper content. Sixth century B.C.(?). Provenience unknown. H. 6%s6 in. (I6 cm.). Exhibited: Sept mille ans, No. 283; Zurich, Kunst Schdtze aus Iran, 1962, No. 131, pl. 29; Milan, 7000 Anni d' Arte Iranica, I962, No. I72, pI. 27; Essen, 7000 Jahre Kunst in Iran, I962, No. I32; Hague, 7000 Jahr Perzische Kunst, I962; Museum of Fine Arts, Boston, I965. Published: ILN, December 27, I958, p. II4I, Fig. I2. The vessel is rather squat in shape, with a wide shoulder sloping upward to the lip in a shallow curve. Below the lip is a guilloche between braided patterns. A frieze of open lotus flowers alternating with lotus buds rests on a braided pattern which encircles the shoulder. The lower half of the vessel is covered by a rib and pendant-boss pattern worked in repousse. The most notable feature of the vessel is the graceful figures of young bulls which spring from shoulder to lip to form the handles. First cast, details were then added by chasing, and finally they were soldered to the vessel. An exactly similar bull handle, perhaps from the same mold, is in Teheran (7000 Years of Iranian Art, No. 447). This amphora poses some stylistic and chronological problems. The patterning of the bulls is not readily identifiable as Achaemenian, but the overlapping calyx (outer petals) and symmetrically-sided inner petals of the lotus flower I have shown else- where to be specifically Achaemenian (Terrace, Antike Kunst, 6, I963, 72ff., particularly Figs. I-8). In the same discussion I have found the simple cushion-shaped tie on which the floral elements rest to exist almost exclusively in Achaemenian representations of the floral frieze. For these reasons I unhesitatingly ascribe an Achaemenian origin to the Pomerance amphora. The curious patterning of the bulls bears some resemblance to that on a bull handle in the British Museum (Aman- I5</page><page sequence="14">dry, Antike Kunst, 2, 1959, pls. 23, 24, 25). It was found with other objects of the fifth century B.C., but Amandry in the article cited only reluctantly dates the bull to the early fifth century, while implying that the sixth century might be better. Also to Achaemenian Persia I would assign the highly curvilinear treatment of the forms of the bulls of the Pomerance vessel, a quality which rapidly becomes characteristic of Achaemenian art and which in the best work is the most salient feature of Achaemenian design. The apparent halter around the neck, which turns into the double half-circle modeling of the front shoulders, may be the prototype of a purely ornamental halter found on the lion-bull symplegma from Persepolis (Terrace, No. 47). A similar halter is found on a bull carved on the baldachin at Persepolis (Ghirshman, Art of Ancient Iran, Fig. 286). On the other hand, these two incised half- circles become the typical figure-8 modeling found on the same relief and in many other examples of Achaemenian animal art, including the lions of the bronze mirror, No. I8 below. No. I I below shows the same device in a transitional stage in which the figure-8 remains open as a reversed curve. Because of the archaic decoration of the bull handles with its several undeveloped features, I would date the vessel in the sixth century B.C., in the early Achaemenian period. 9 i6</page><page sequence="15">t .' r I IO IO. PLATE with four bulls. Collection Mr. and Mrs. Leon Pomerance. Silver. Sixth century B.C. Perhaps from Egypt. D. I2i in. (32 cm.). Exhibited: Metropolitan Museum of Art, I964. Unpublished. Four bulls leap counterclockwise, their hooves touching a raised band around the rim, their horns, ears and tails touching another raised band which encloses a rosette made up of sixteen petals encircling a slightly raised boss. It has not been 17 r ,^ n: '.- ^4 . I 'I :*vw ^ * m+</page><page sequence="16">II possible to examine the plate under the microscope, but almost certainly the relief of the animals was produced by swedging away the background. The technique is described under No. I below. Details are added by chasing. The plate was perhaps a part of the royal tableware or temple service. This highly original plate has only one parallel, plate No. I I below. As Wilkinson remarked about the latter, at first glance one seems to be looking at an Achaemenian work, and it is only on closer examination that difficulties appear. These difficulties, however, are more apparent than they are real, and indeed the impression of Achae- menian art received at first is entirely justified by the curvilinear style that is so pre- eminently Achaemenian. A sweeping curve may be drawn along the back of one bull, continued through the next and so on until it returns to the first. This same line may be interrupted on any bull, to recurve through the tail until it comes to the tip of the horn, when it returns again. The elliptical modeling of the shoulders is echoed in the curving lines of the breast and the stomach. In fact, straight lines are almost nonexistent. I insist on these purely formal elements because of their im- portance in helping to correctly place the style of both plates. Several details are much closer to the art of Ziwiyeh than they are to Achaemenian work. One of these is the rib-cage made up of parallel lines, with hatching between, I8 XE:I:</page><page sequence="17">springing from the elliptical shoulder muscle. A caprid on a glazed jar from Ziwiyeh (Ghirshman, Art of Ancient Iran, Fig. 3 98) has the same device, and something similar may be seen on two or three of the beasts on the Ziwiyeh epaulette, No. 7 above. It is observed again on a bronze plaque from Ziwiyeh in the Metropolitan Museum (Ghirshman, Ibid., Fig. 369), and on a silver boss also in the Metropolitan Museum (MMA 54.194), and frequently elsewhere. The line of hair along the ~ack is also familiar at Ziwiyeh (e.g., BMMA, April I963, Fig. 4), but it enters the repertoire of the Achaemenian artist and becomes common (e.g., Terrace, No. 47, and in a somewhat different form, No. I6 below). Writing about the Schimmel plate, No. ii below, Wilkinson draws attention to other elements relating it to Ziwiyeh and makes the suggestion that these details have persisted into the sixth century. I would not only agree but would insist that the two plates without doubt represent the style of the early Achaemenians. Some circumstantial evidence exists for an Egyptian origin of the two plates, and it is doubtful that the work of the pre-Achaemenian inhabitants of the mountains of northwest Iran could have found its way to Egypt except through devious routes. On the other hand, it is not impossible that the Achaemenian conquest of Egypt in 525 B.C. brought with it objects from the royal treasury, either of contemporary or even earlier manufacture. Occasional finds of Persian art have been made in Egypt (No. I4 below) and prove that purely Achaemenian work was imported. With no hesitation then, I date the two plates about 525 B.C. or slightly earlier. ii. PLATE with four ibexes. Collection Norbert Schimmel. Silver with gold. Sixth century B.C. Perhaps from Egypt. II3, in. (29.9 cm.). Exhibited: Hoffmann, op. cit., No. 78. Four ibexes stride counterclockwise, all four legs shown. The hooves touch the outer rim, but the horns do not quite meet the raised band around the central orna- ment. The latter is a circle of gold with a rosette worked in repousse. Between each of the sixteen petals is the tiny point of a sepal. The rosette is attached to the plate by means of sixteen silver pins, each one of which is placed between every second one of thirty-two punched dots. The plate is worked from a single piece of silver by swedging the background away from the animals in relief. This technique is the opposite of repousse which is accomplished by working from the back of the object and hammering the pattern into a mold or a soft cushion of bitumen. In the case of swedging from the front, the back of the object is laid on the cushion of soft ma- terial. The back of the Schimmel plate was also swedged to produce a smooth surface. The pattern of the tiny tool used for this purpose may be seen barely with the naked eye, but it is quite clear under the microscope. The details of the animals were added by chasing. If we cannot say that the two plates, Nos. 10 and II, are made by the same hand, we must admit that they were made in the same workshop. It is interesting to note that one of the more striking features of this plate, the rib-cage of the caprids, is, like those of the bulls above, related to a usage found at Ziwiyeh. Only here we have the winged form, or "half-leaf" as Wilkinson describes it, attached to the reverse curve of the shoulder muscle. The wing-shaped rib-cage is frequent in Ziwiyeh art I9</page><page sequence="18">:gj eq</page><page sequence="19">and is to be noted on the gorget (Ghirshman, Art of Ancient Iran, Fig. I37). On the same ibexes and on adjacent sphinxes may be seen another detail prominent on the Schimmel plate: the line of hair or muscle structure following the outline of the outer haunch and twisting into a curl in the middle of the back. Even in classically Achaemenian sculpture we find a version of this device. In the baldachin referred to above (Ghirshman, Art of Ancient Iran, Fig. 286) it is seen, only interrupted at the tail, so that it does not continue as a unit. Nevertheless, the Persepolis version must be seen as a later, still more decorative form of the outlining found on the Schimmel plate and on the Ziwiyeh objects. With these earlier features in mind, we can go on to the more explicitly stylistic, and in this case datable, quality, which is again the specifically curvilinear treatment of the animals. Wherever we look we find the curving line; even where an angle must be made, as in the back of the knees of the rear legs, a small incised semi-circle, almost apologetically softens the impact of sudden angularity. Unless Median art was taken over of a piece by the Achaemenians, and there is no evidence for it, I think we must accept these two remarkable plates as the earliest examples of Achaemenian art that we know. Achaemenian Art i2. RHYTON with ram's head. Collection Mr. and Mrs. Leon Pomerance. Silver. Sixth-fifth centuries B.C. From Ghaflantu. L. ii in. (28.5 cm.), D. of mouth 7~ 6 in. (i8 cm.). Exhibited: Sept mille ans, No. 491, pl. xxxiv; Metropolitan Museum of Art, I964. Published: [Denys Sutton,] "Persian Art in Paris," Financial Times, London, November I96I; "The Exposition of Iranian Art in Paris," Archaeology, Spring I962, p. 52; Ghirshman, Artibus Asiae, 25, I962. pp. 57ff., Fig. 19. A drinking or pouring cup worked on a bitumen or other yielding core to shape the ram's head; the horns were worked separately and soldered to the main piece. The carefully and intricately worked curls are typically Persian. In earlier times they were more conventionally rendered; we might even cite the feather-pattern of No. 6 above as an early example. More specifically Achaemenian are the ears, the double- lobed lower end of which is found, for example, on the bull of the Boston sym- plegma. The modeling of the head is quite geometric, even conventional, but the parts make a convincing whole. Even the ribbed neck of the vessel adds its own impact to the total decorative effect of this unusual and imaginatively conceived object. Another and similar rhyton is much more conventionally treated (BMMA, Summer I956, pp. 9ff.); the horns, while more elaborate, are yet less interesting because they are so tightly held to the body of the vessel. This rhyton may be earlier than the Pomerance example. Despite the latter's similarities to rhyta from Ziwiyeh (cf. Godard, Le Tresor de Ziwiye, Figs. 57-58), the freer handling of the facial struc- ture, the horns which are detached from the side of the head, and particularly the characteristically Achaemenian ear (not found at Ziwiyeh), suggest that it be put into the Achaemenian period, probably early in that era. 21</page><page sequence="20">13 I3. COUCHANT IBEX with depression in back. Collection Alastair Bradley Martin (Guennol Collection). Illustration Courtesy of the Brooklyn Museum. Black Limestone. Fifth century B.C. Provenience unknown. H. I3 9/6 in. (34.5 cm.), L. of base I43A in. (37.5 cm.). Exhibited: Sept mille ans, No. 66I, Pl. 71; Metro- politan Museum of Art; Brooklyn Museum. See also Bulletin Cleveland Museum, 48, I96I, p. 256, Fig. 3; Ghirshman, Art of Ancient Iran, Fig. 305. This remarkable sculpture is unique. It was used either as a libation vessel or as the base for a vessel placed in the depression. Several Sassanian vessels of a shape that would fit such a depression have appeared recently (cf. BMMA, April I960, p. 267, Fig. 32). No such Achaemenian objects are yet known, however. The figure is carved in the black calcite-limestone found at Persepolis and was obviously made there. The tail is striated; the legs are worked in high relief on the base; and the male genitals are indicated in relief. See Appendix: Examination of Guennol Ibex. The richly carved forms of the animal are so elaborate that the sculptor seems to have made a deliberate choice in simplifying the representation of the beard to incised lines. Something similar was done on the Boston bronze ibex (Terrace, No. 59), only here the lines are wavy and horizontal instead of vertical as on the 22</page><page sequence="21">13 (detail) 23</page><page sequence="22">Guennol ibex. Two bronze ibex heads, one in New York and the other in Cleveland (BMMA, November 1956, pp. 72ff.; Bulletin Cleveland Museum, 48, I96I, pp. 254ff.) have more naturalistically rendered beards. The striated hair at the base of the horns is similar to the Guennol animal. These lines are wavy on the Boston protome. Al- though the double-lobed ear is common at Persepolis, a single lobe is also frequent. Little of nature is left in the highly stylized ears of our ibex, which also form supports for the horns. The dramatically curving horns, the sweeping forms and curvilinear detail of the ibex are made still more impelling by the complexity of planes adorning the surface. They arouse a sense of constant movement and permit dramatic shifts of light and shadow, a quality of great importance in the reliefs and sculptures at Persepolis where the intense shadows of the sculpture provide the only relief from a hot and bleaching sun. It is remarkable how quickly the Achaemenians, without a tradition of monumental sculpture, adapted to the requirements of purely sculptural art. The same instinct for sculptured form may be seen in the few large-scale statues in the round from Achaemenian Persepolis: Schmidt, Persepolis II, pl. 36 (mastiff, ibex, feline), pl. 37.B (bull). Once established, Achaemenian style shows little if any de- velopment, although there are several versions existing side by side (Terrace, Antike Kunst, 6, I963, pp. 76ff.), and we cannot say that the Guennol ibex is spe- cifically of the fifth or even fourth century B.C. It seems safe, however, to assign it for the time being to the classical period of Persepolitan sculpture, the fifth century. I4</page><page sequence="23">I4. IBEX handle from a vase. Brooklyn Museum 54.50.41. Silver. Fifth century B.C. H. 69/6 in. (I6.7 cm.). From Tell el-Maskhuta (Pithom) in the Nile Delta. Exhibited: Sept mille ans, No. 644. Published: Cooney, Five Years of Collecting Egyptian Art, No. 50, pl. 74; Amandry, Antike Kunst, 2, I959, p. 46. An ibex, its front legs couchant, is attached to a bar on either side of which the rear legs are indicated in relief. The bar ends in the standard Achaemenian open lotus flower on either side of which is apparently a bud. This very beautiful silver handle was discovered at Pithom in the Eastern Delta in a hoard of temple equipment con- taining numerous silver vessels, gold-banded agates and at least one more handle which ends in a lion's head. The vessels are unusual and the decoration of some of them seems to be an Iranian version of Egyptian designs. Others, however, are more typically Persian. Several of the vessels bear inscriptions in Aramaic (Rabinowitz, JNES, I5, I956, pp. I-9). The date of the hoard seems to be about 4IO B.C. Certainly the style of the ibex suggests a fifth century origin. Many of the features prominent on the Guennol ibex (No. I3 above) are found here, including the striated beard on which the incised lines are almost vertical. The ears are very much the same, although on the silver ibex they are somewhat more naturalistic. It may be noted here that a habit of the Achaemenian artist was to have the tips of ears and horns of the ibex meet. This feature is found also on Nos. Is5-6. The large muscle of the front shoulder, represented in purely decorative form on the stone ibex, is here closer to the real thing, but the Persian instinct for ornament impelled the artist to accentuate the muscle by chasing around its outline. The evident strain of the animal in its forward thrust is highlighted by the long taut muscle along the stomach. Elsewhere (Terrace, Antike Kunst, 6, I963, pp. 76ff.) I have tried to show that there are two styles of Achaemenian animal sculpture in metal: a developed and a severe style. Because of the obvious reflection of natural forms, I would place the Pithom ibex in the de- veloped style. Although found in Egypt, I think we must accept the ibex as a purely Persian work, either imported or made locally by a Persian. I5. AMPHORA with ibex handles. Collection Messrs. Bernard and Michael Pomerance. Silver. Fifth century B.C. H. of vase ii in. (28 cm.), with handles I3 in. (33 cm.); w. at handles ioY in. (26 cm.). Said to have been found in Iraq. Exhibited: Sept mille ans, No. 685 (without handles); Metropolitan Museum of Art, I964 (with handles). The two handles are similar to No. 14 above, except that the heads here are twisted backward. The plate attaching the handles to the shoulder of the vessel is in each case incised with an undeveloped lotus flower. The hair line continues from the point of the beard and along the back to the tail; it is also placed on the back of the neck and reaches over to the forehead, and is rendered as a chevron pattern. The beards are like those of Nos. I3-I4. The patterning of the body is quite simple: the slightly modeled haunches are decorated with single circles and others are found on the front shoulders. The rib-cage (or is it fur?) is made like a slightly curved feather and as always springs from the back of the front shoulder. The sections of the horns are here merely incised. The vessel itself is of simple amphora shape and is decorated with tongue patterns and a braided collar while the lower half of the body is ribbed. 25</page><page sequence="24">Two holes, one on either side of the base, reveal that liquid was poured from this vessel into others. Perhaps snow or ice was placed in the amphora to cool the wine that would be poured into the mouth. The cooled liquid, streaming from the holes near the base, would be caught in cups of gold and silver. Among the tribute being brought forward to the Great King in the reliefs of the Apadana at Persepolis, are several amphoras with animal handles (good illustrations in Amandry, Antike Kunst, 2, I959, pl. 20.1, 2). Amandry has collected most of the preserved examples in the article just cited, and we can now add this splendid vessel in the Pomerance collection. With the greatest simplicity the artist has pro- duced a highly refined type. He has deliberately refrained from over-decorating the bodies of the ibexes, and restrained the ornament of the vessel to the simplest. I5 26</page><page sequence="25">i6 These kings of the Achaemenians and their nobles were patronls of a fine and some- times even exquisite taste. We find this refinement everywhere in Achaemenian art, and while it is essentially an art of decoration, it is ever careful to avoid excessive decoration. I6. TORQUE with ibex finial. Collection Alastair Bradley Martin (Guennol Collection). Gold (solid cast). Fifth century B.C. H. 57 6 in. (I3.8 cm.), H. of ibex I4 in. (3.I cm.). Provenience unknown. Exhibited: Guide to Exhibition of Persian Art, Iranian Institute, New York, 2nd ed., I940, p. 319, No. H; Brooklyn Museum; Sept mille ans, No. 643. Published: ILN, May 3I, 194I, p. 719; Pope, Master- pieces of Persian Art, pl. 30.C. Bulletin Brooklyn Museumn, 15, I954, pp. I2-13. Cast to resemble a twisted rope, the torque ends in an ibex the back legs of which are stretched back and the front legs couchant, in the same manner as the handles Nos. I4-15 above. The head is twisted to face out. The sections of the horns are modeled, but otherwise there is little plastic rendering of the body. Instead, where we would expect modeling, we find depressions cut out to take inlays. In one of the parallel depressions on the back (not visible in the illustration) a trace of green material was found which is thought to be feldspar (information from the Brooklyn Museum). The other end of a very similar torque is preserved in the British Museum (SPA IV, pl. I22.F), and is from the Oxus treasure. This jewel is similar in technique to a bracelet with griffin finials from the Oxus treasure and now in the British Museum (in color, Porada, Iran ancien, p. I66 top), which was once even more heavily inlaid with colored materials. A striking ancient illustration of the use of such a torque is provided on the Brooklyn Museum statue of an Egyptian of the 27th Dynasty (period of Persian domination). Ptah-hotep, although certainly an Egyptian, wears a Persian robe and wide torque ending in ibex finials, only the heads of the latter are twisted backward so as to be seen in pro- file. The statue can be dated to about 490 B.C. (B. V. Bothmer, Egyptian Sculpture of the Late Period, No. 64; detail of torque, pl. 6o, Fig. ISI). The Guennol torque is a dramatic example of the skill of the Achaemenian goldworker and of the lavish use of gold for personal ornament. 27</page><page sequence="26">I7. LION-HEADED RHYTON. Metropolitan Museum of Art 54.3.3, Fletcher Fund 1954. Gold. Fifth century B.C. H. 6Y4 in. (I7 cm.), D. of mouth 5X in. (I4 cm.). Weight 975 gr.; volume oo1100 cc. From Hamadan(?). Published: Wilkinson, BMMA, March I955, pp. 221-222; Ghirshman, Art of Ancient Iran, Fig. 306; color in Porada, Iran ancien, p. I55 left. The funnel-shaped vessel has several bands of ribs separated by blank spaces. The space between the upper band and the lip is filled with forty-four rows of two wires twisted together. Each wire is .00125 in. in diameter, and the length of each is I36 ft. The face of the lion protome is richly modeled. The jaws are open in a roar, with the naturalistically modeled tongue protruding between vicious fangs. The teeth are carefully indicated, and the roof of the mouth is ridged. The ruff is distinctly but conventionally treated. The breast and backs of the head and neck are completely 17 28</page><page sequence="27">covered with an intricate pattern to indicate tufts of hair. A sharply ridged mane ex- tends from the forehead down the back of the head and neck. The ears, carefully detailed in relief, lie against the head and have the tufts often found on the ears of Persian lions (cf. an Egyptian lion of the Persian period, Cooney, Five Years of Col- lecting, No. 69, pl. 86). The feet and claws are particularly detailed. The design of the shoulder muscle is somewhat similar to that on the bulls of No. 9 above. The wing- shaped decoration on the sides are in this case probably meant to represent hair along the belly instead of rib-cages as in other examples. On Assyrian lions, the hair in this area was more naturalistic (cf. Frankfort, Art and Architecture of the Ancient Orient, pI. 109). The ferocity of the Achaemenian lion is somewhat more polite than that of his predecessors, e.g. Nos. 5-6 above. Nevertheless, the wrinkled muscles of the cheeks and nose, the bulging brows, and the two lumps between the eyes, remind us that the beast was originally a vicious creature. The protruding tongue adds considerably to this aspect. The elaborate and ornamental quality of the decoration, however, tends to detract from the beast's terrifying nature. The fierceness of the lion in Teheran (Ghirshman, Art of Ancient Iran, Fig. 290) is even more tamed by the addi- tion of gracefully curved wings which add so much to the decorative beauty of the piece. Mythical or not, these creatures are like pets kept for the pleasure of the Achaemenian royal household. Hamadan is a modern city in western Iran which lies on the site of ancient Ecba- tana, capital of the Medes and the Achaemenians. Over the years peasants have made occasional finds of treasure which have added considerably to the body of Achae- menian sumptuary art. Several magnificent examples, including the rhyton published here, have entered the collection of the Metropolitan Museum of Art and have been published together by Wilkinson (BMMA, March I955, pp. 213ff.). One of the finest pieces of Achaemenian goldwork from Hamadan, comparable in quality to this rhyton, is the beautiful roundel of a winged lion-griffin made to fit the shape of an enclosing circle of gold (Oriental Institute: see Kantor, JNES, I6, 1957, pp. 1-23; in color, Porada, Iran ancien, p. I69). I8. BRONZE MIRROR with adorsed lions. Collection Norbert Schimmel. Fifth century B.C. Maximum H. 9 in. (22.8 cm.), D. 8 A in. (21.7 cm.). Provenience unknown. Exhibited: Hoffmann, op. cit., No. 74. Within a circle of thirty-three twelve-petalled rosettes are two lions, back to back, the heads twisted to face each other, two front feet pushing against one another, and the tails intertwined. Seven pins, several still preserved, at the top held the now missing handle which presumably had some means of suspension so that the scene could be viewed at the correct angle. The object was cast and details added by chasing. The amazing instinct of the Achaemenians for design is perhaps better represented by this marvelous mirror than by any other monument yet known to us. It is so far the only decorated mirror from Achaemenian Persia known (Mrs. Leon Pomerance has called to my attention a smaller silver object with similar decoration in the Ashmolean Museum which may also be a mirror). A parallel for the design may be found on several roundels from Hamadan(?) in the Oriental Institute, and in New 29</page><page sequence="28">I8 York (JNES, i6, I957, pls. in and ix, and MMA 55.I86, 56.42.4), but on these objects all four legs stride around the outer circle of gold. Although basically two- dimensional in design, the artist has not failed to indicate the overlapping toes. All the elements of Achaemenian style found in the preceding examples are here: the stylized musculature of the face, the conventional ruff and hair, the figure-8 shoulder muscle, the outlining of the legs and haunches, etc. Naturalism is everywhere re- pressed in favor of the perfection of the design which here receives the ultimate curvilinear treatment that we have seen to be characteristic of Achaemenian art. It is no less remarkable to realize that the monumental sculptures of Persepolis were conceived on a basis of unity of design as compelling as that of the bronze mirror. It has been said against Achaemenian art that it is without emotion and without spiritual quality. It is, however, an art of the intellect remarkable in conception and achievement and in its own right stands as the last great invention of 4000 years of Ancient Near Eastern art. EDWARD L. B. TERRACE 30</page><page sequence="29">NOTES I. I wish also to thank my friend, Thomas Dahill, for many conversations about the art of Persepolis. 2. Most of the Museum's collection of ancient Persian art, with the exception of the pottery and the inclusion of only a few Luristan bronzes, is published in Terrace, Art of the Ancient Near East in Boston, I962, hereinafter referred to as Terrace, followed by the appropriate number. The silver and gold bowl is published in detail in Terrace, Antike Kunst, 6, I963, pp. 72ff. A gold applique in the form of a lion's head, of the Achaemenian period, is found in MFA Bulletin, 6I, I963, p. I20. Later acquisitions of ancient Persian art are published in MFA Bulletin, 62, I964, pp. 59ff. Abbreviations used in the catalogue are: MFA Bulletin: Bulletin of the Museum of Fine Arts, Boston; BMMA: Bulletin of the Metro- politan Museum of Art; ILN: Illustrated London News; JNES: Journal of Near Eastern Studies; Sept mille ans: Sept mille ans d'art en Iran, exhibition at Petit Palais, Paris, I96I-I962; SPA: Survey of Persian Art. A sensible and valuable history of Persian Art before Islam is given by Edith Porada in the introduction to 7000 Years of Iranian Art (Exhibition from the Arch- aeological Museum, Teheran, and collec- tion of Mohsen Foroughi, I964-1965, Smith- sonian Institution Publication No. 4535), pp. II-32. The reader is referred to this excellent discussion for a fuller treatment of the art of Persia during the First Millennium B.C. 3. Syria, 39, I962, pp. 2I2ff. 4. A recent and complete bibliography for the Ziwiyeh, Hasanlu and Marlik material is given in 7000 Years of Iranian Art, pp. 47-48. The Ziwiyeh treasure was dis- covered in a hoard by peasants in I947. Many objects were apparently melted down for the gold, others were mutilated to provide each of the finders with a share. The epaulette (No. 7) and the plaque (No. 8) are examples of such a case, but happily the two parts of the former were eventually rejoined. [Some question has been raised about the black limestone ibex in the Guennol Collection, No. I3. To assist further study of the object, it seems appropriate to publish in full the technical examination made by William J. Young, Head of the Research Laboratory, Museum of Fine Arts.] APPENDIX Examination of Guennol Ibex Visual Examination FROM a visual examination the Ibex showed decided wear on the top and underpart of the horns which would point to considerable handling in this area. Worn grooves on the underpart of the horns caused by handling appear in natural positions where the fingers would come in contact during handling. The base of the Ibex only touches the ground in the central portion of the base and the underpart of the left foreleg. In these areas the greatest wear was noted. The broken horn clearly showed that the fracture occurred through a calcite vein, which would be a weak spot where one would expect a natural fracture to occur. The fractures of the horn showed evidence of erosion. Ultra-Violet THE Ibex, when examined under ultra-violet rays using a "Corex A" filter, fluoresced in general a dark purple while the weathering deposit fluoresced a lighter purple. 3I</page><page sequence="30">The result, although not decisive, is generally noted in genuine ancient objects. The ultra-violet established, by fluorescence, that an applied patina with a binding medium was not present. Microscopic THE object was then examined with the aid of a binocular microscope using a power of 50 times. It was clearly seen that the weathering was a natural one and in small islands of the weathering, iron pyrites were observed. The stone of which the Ibex was fashioned proved to be a calcite-limestone. It was observed by this examination that where calcite crystals appear at the surface of the object, the weathering had attacked the softer surrounding material leaving the calcite crystals intact (see facing page). This examination definitely establishes that the weathering was a natural one. X-Ray Diffraction A SAMPLE of the stone was taken, ground in an agate mortar, and an X-ray diffraction chart made with the aid of the X-ray Geiger Counter spectrometer. The result was compared with a standard taken from Persepolis. These compared identically in composition, being a mixture of calcite and quartz. A sample was then taken of the weathering product and an X-ray diffraction chart made. This indicated a natural weathering product with a composition of quartz, calcite, and illite. A sample of the sandy deposit was taken from the interstices of the object and an X-ray diffraction pattern made. This was compared with the sandy deposit taken from the standard sample from Persepolis. The two materials were found to be of the same composition, but varied in quantity of mineral present. The sandy deposit from the Ibex was found high in quartz and low in calcite; the sandy deposit from the standard sample from Persepolis was found to be high in calcite and lower in quartz. Spectrographic Analysis THREE samples were then taken: one from the stone of the Ibex; one from the weathering product of the Ibex; and one of the standard from Persepolis. These samples were imbedded in Boron-free carbon electrodes and spectrograms made in juxtaposition with the following analyses: Ibex Ibex Persepolis WEATHERING STONE STONE PRODUCT (STANDARD) Iron M/H L L Silicon M/H M M Aluminum M/H M M Calcium H H H Magnesium H H H Copper T/L L T/L Tin T FT FT Titanium L/M 0 0 The spectrographic analyses indicated the three samples to be of similar composi- tion. The weathering product contained a higher percentage of iron and aluminum 32</page><page sequence="31">and was found to contain titanium, which was lacking in the stone of the Ibex and the stone sample from Persepolis. The analyses of the weathering product both from X-ray diffraction and spectro- graphic analyses is of a composition that one would expect from a long burial. The weathering product in general has penetrated into the surface of the object through- out. The pattern of the weathering action could only be achieved from long burial under local surface waters. By microscopic examination small rounded crystals of quartz sand were observed'in the interstices indicating the presence of wind-blown sand. The above analyses strongly indicates that the piece in question has been sub- jected to long burial anid,gives every indication of antiquity. In my opinion, the Ibex is unquestionably genuine and of ancient origin. WILLIAM J. YOUNG (I955) Micro-photograph of weathering on surface of Guennol Ibex. 33</page></plain_text>
