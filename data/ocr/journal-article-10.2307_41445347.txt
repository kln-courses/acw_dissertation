<plain_text><page sequence="1">Frederick J. Cummings Assistant Director 8 During the 18-month period covered by this report the professional staff carried on a vital exhibition and acquisitions program, expanded publications, research, and library acquisitions, and revitalized educational programs. Despite further reductions in museum personnel, each of these efforts has increased the Institute's effectiveness. Since the opening of the North Wing in 1971, we have turned our energies towards increasing and installing the permanent collections and making them more available to the general public. 936 works of art valued at $2,641,351 were acquired during this period. Two of the major acquisitions have been in the field of 20th century sculp- ture. Tony Smith's Gracehoper , already considered an important monument in the history of modern sculpture, was erected on the lawn of the North Wing. Naum Gabo's Linear Construction No. 4 was presented to the Institute by W. Hawkins Ferry. From the ancient world an important Roman marble sculpture, a Loricate Torso of an un- known emperor dating from about 200 A.D., was acquired through the generosity of the Matilda R. Wilson Fund. In the American field a portrait by John Singer Sargent, Madame Paul Poirson , was acquired with the aid of a gift from Mr. and Mrs. Richard A. Manoogian. In the European field two of the finest works acquired this year are the por- trait of an Officer ivith a Plumed Hat by Rembrandt van Rijn given by the Matilda R. Wilson Fund and a rare, early altarpiece by Charles Le Brun, The Presentation of Christ in the Temple , donated by Mr. and Mrs. Allan Shelden III in memory of Allan Shelden IV.</page><page sequence="2">The Presentation of Christ in the Temple (1645), Charles Le Brun, French (1619-90); oil on canvas, 105/4 X 12lA in. Mr. and Mrs. Allan Shelden III donation in memory of Allen Shelden IV (73.1). A leading concern has been to refurbish the galleries and to develop new galleries from spaces on the main floors heretofore used for storage. The completion of this work will take several years. A second major effort during this new phase of rehabilitation and consolidation is the education and publications program. Richard Miihlberger was appointed Chairman of Education in the spring of 1972. During his first year he has consolidated his staff and introduced many new and successful mini-course programs. The Museum Intern pro- gram in cooperation with Wayne State University initiated its first year under the 9</page><page sequence="3">10 sponsorship of the National Endowment for the Humanities. The interns were Ross Fox, Arien Linn, and Camille Podalak. The Art Quarterly is improving in quality with each issue thanks to the excellent work of its editor, Jerrold Lanes. The Publications Department, now headed by Susan F. Rossen, is gradually becoming fully operative. Careful attention and effective planning is leading towards a museum Bulletin which will continue to publish articles on the museum's acquisitions, clarifying their historical significance. As this program de- velops, the Bulletin will serve as the nucleus of an effort to make the Detroit collections known and accessible to those interested in the arts not only throughout our region but also all over the world. A great part of this program is made possible through the Edsel В. and Eleanor C. Ford Education and Communications Fund established in the spring of 1972. As a part of our long term planning during this post-building phase, we have given particular attention to developing the general program of conservation, cleaning works of art, and improving security in their presentation. During the past year the Con- servation Services Laboratory has become fully operative through gifts from the Knight and Kresge Foundations. The results can be seen throughout the building in the im- proved presentation of many works of art. A significant event in 1973 was the election of Lydia Winston Malbin to the position of Honorary Curator of Modern Art. This appointment was made in recognition of Mrs. Malbin's important and distinctive role as a sensitive and enthusiastic scholar of 20th century art, as well as her deep and continued interest in the Institute. Over the years we have been the grateful recipients of numerous benefactions and generous gifts of personal time, knowledge, and energy from Mrs. Malbin. For a nine-month period in 1972 and 1973 the Institute displayed a selection of 64 outstanding objects loaned by Dr. and Mrs. Malbin from the Winston Collection. The museum is fortunate that it will continue to benefit from Mrs. Malbin's concern for its growth and enrichment as she assumes this new responsibility. The search for a Curator of Modern Art continued throughout this period. Even with a skeleton staff a full exhibitions program went forward. One of the most original and interesting exhibitions was "African Terra Cottas South of the Sahara" organized by Willis Woods and Daniel Mato. The works of the French Romantic painter, Theodore Géricault (1791-1824), were featured in a major exhibition seen by some 45,000 people. Both exhibitions were sponsored by the Edsel В. and Eleanor C. Ford Exhibitions Fund. For many months the professional staff has been involved in intensive preparation for the most active exhibition season in the Institute's history. The schedule in the next year will include many exhibitions, including three major events: "French Paintings from the USSR," "Akhenaten and Nefertiti: Art from the Age of Egypt's Sun King," and "Twilight of the Medici," co-sponsored with the City of Florence. Such an outstanding period of acceleration in the growth and care of our collections and in the expansion of so many of our essential programs is due to an important tradition established by Detroiters over many years. It reflects the serious commitment on the part of our patrons to increase our public's knowledge and joy in the arts and enrich our lives by providing us with the finest and most beautiful cultural creations man has produced. That this kind of increased activity and growth should occur in spite of the difficulties posed by our time is in fact testimony of the faith shared by museum staff, patrons, and public in the enduring worth of the aesthetic experiences which a vital museum can provide.</page><page sequence="4">Outstanding for the department in 1972 was the acquisition of a marble Roman torso. Larger than life-size, this torso depicts an emperor in armor and dates from the end of the second century A.D. The statue, a gift of the Matilda R. Wilson Fund, adds a new dimension to our collection of Roman sculpture, taking its place in the gallery beside the recently acquired togate figure of Nero. Together they suggest the scale of sculptural works of the Roman Empire. The department prepared two exhibitions. In the fall an exhibition of memorabilia was assembled to commemorate the 50th anniversary of the opening of the tomb of Tutankhamun. In early 1973 "Detroit Collects: Antiquities" provided an impressive first public look at objects from growing private collections in the area. The exhibition was sponsored by the Antiquaries, the supporting group of the department. The Antiquaries had a particularly good year both from the standpoint of growth and activities. A more detailed discussion of these can be found in the Founders Society Committee Reports. Long-term loans from the Egyptian and Ancient Near Eastern Departments of the Metropolitan Museum of Art and the Egyptian Department of the Boston Museum of Fine Arts continued and served to make our representations in these areas more complete. A group of Egyptian objects was lent to the Ella Sharp Museum, Jackson, Michigan, for an exhibition in the fall. The Curator published articles in The Journal of Near Eastern Studies on an Egyptian relief in the collection, in the University- Liggett Antiques Show Catalog (1972) on collecting antiquities, in the museum Bulletin on the Egyptian tomb wall of Mery- nesut and on the Napoleonic 22-volume Description de Г Egypte, in the Crarïbrook Magazine on ancient Egypt and the wish for eternal life, and two book reviews on Egyptian subjects in the American Journal of Archaeology.

In December the Curator and Mrs. Elsie Peck, Research Associate for Ancient Art, represented the Institute at the annual meetings of the Archaeological Institute of America in Phila delphia. In February 1973 the department co-sponsored, with Wayne State Universit and the Smithsonian Institution, a two-day symposium on "Death and Disease ii. Ancient Egypt," which included the autopsy of a mummy lent by the University о Pennsylvania for the occasion. As Adjunct Professor of Art History at Wayne State University, the Curator со- tinued to teach courses in Egyptian Art. He also continued to serve as the curatori advisor to both the Institute Shops Committee and the Rental Gallery. With the aid of volunteer and part-time help, a program of research and catalogir- of the department's holdings has continued. Nancy Mitchnick, through the work-stud) program at Wayne State University, was of invaluable assistance during the summer and fall. The department also wishes to thank Penelope Slough, Linn McGlade, Helen Sherman, and Kathryn Lippman for participating in the research program. Mariam Watkins also provided essential office aid.

Important additions were made to the collections of French, Dutch, and Italian art. These accessions reflect the policy, developed in cooperation with the European Com- mittee, of securing works which amplify areas of strength, as well as those which demonstrate aspects of art not well represented in the collections. The Institute's fine collection of Netherlandish art was augmented through the acquisi- tion of two important paintings. The generous gift by the Matilda R. Wilson Fund of an Officer with a Plumed Hat by Rembrandt has given a new dimension to our collec- tion of works by this master. A robust portrait from the early and optimistic years of the artist's development, it was painted about 1634, some six years before his Visitation , a masterpiece acquired in 1927 as a city appropriation. A portraitist who precedes Rembrandt by a century is Jan van Scorel whose Pilgrim was given by Mr. and Mrs. James A. Beresford. Formerly in the collection of the Cranbrook Academy of Art, the Beresfords have generously assured that it will remain a part of the cultural heritage of this region. A leading concern in recent years has been to increase the representation of later French art. An important altarpiece by Charles Le Brun, The Presentation of Christ in the Temple , was donated by Mr. and Mrs. Allan Shelden III in memory of their son, Allan Shelden IV. This monumental work of 1645 summarizes Le Brun's powers when he was working in Rome under the influence of his teacher, Poussin. It is a unique work in America and would be a rarity even in France, where it is difficult to find paintings from Le Brun's Roman years. The entire collection of 17th century French paintings has been highlighted and clarified by this major gift. The French paintings collection was further enriched by the addition of The Sacrifice of Isaac by Laurent de La Hyre given by Dr. and Mrs. Coleman H. Mopper. It joins the beautiful Finding of Moses by the same artist, presented by Dr. and Mrs. Mopper Department of European Art Frederick J . Cummings 13</page><page sequence="7">14 last year. These two works afford a representation of this artist rare in American museums. Louis Jean François Lagrenée is represented by Pygamalion and Galatea , a superb work signed and dated 1785, the gift of Mr. and Mrs. Benjamin H. Long and various funds. This year we began to improve the Institute's collection of early 19th century French art by the addition of two masterworks. One, The Judgment of Paris by Jean Baptiste Regnault, was the gift of Mr. and Mrs. Henry Ford II. It is one of Regnault's finest and most important works, illustrating the influence of antique sculpture and subject matter on artists working during the reign of Napoleon I. Mr. and Mrs. Alvan Macauley gave a strikingly beautiful Portrait of a Woman of 1846 by Hippolyte Jean Flandrin, J.A.D. Ingres' most important student. Impressionism and the genesis of modern art are represented by two important addi- tions to the collection. An early Head of a Man , signed and dated 1865 by Paul Cezanne, was purchased with the aid of the Robert H. Tannahill Fund. Added to the four Cézannes in the Tannahill Bequest, the Institute is now able to illustrate fully the development of this key master in the history of modern art. Edward E. Rothman donated a fine pastel by Edgar Degas, Dancers in Repose. The collection of Italian art has been enhanced with three select works of uniformly high quality. The Entombment of Christ by Luca Giordano, painted in his early years around 1665, is one of the finest paintings by this highly skilled and prolific Neapolitan master. It was a gift of the Robert H. Tannahill Fund. William J. Poplack presented The Flight into Egypt , a superb work by Carlo Dolci. It is the only representation in the collection of a work by this Florentine artist who was patronized by the last Medici rulers of Florence. The Birth of the Virgin by Corrado Giaquinto, a modello for the decoration of the ceiling of the Church of Santa Barbara, Madrid, is a significant addi- tion to the collection of 18th century Italian art. This beautifully painted picture was given in memory of Mr. and Mrs. James S. Holden by the James and Lynelle Holden Fund. There were three bequests of particular interest during this period. From Edward F. Fisher the Institute received Captain Little's Children by the English master George Romney. It is an especially charming group portrait of a type considered highly desir- able, and it is the only painting by Romney in the museum's collection. Also from the Fisher bequest is a fine large Dutch painting Exotic Birds , by Melchior de Hondecoeter. Mr. and Mrs. James S. Whitcomb bequeathed Family Group in a Landscape by Thomas Gainsborough, showing a woman and children resting on a forest path. It broadens the representation by this English master considerably, since it is the first landscape by Gainsborough to enter the museum's collection. Building on the solid base afforded by purchases in previous years and the more recent Anna Thomson Dodge Bequest, significant additions have been made in various areas of the decorative arts. A Chop Plate by Jean François Landron and a Ciborium by Robert Cruickshank were added to the impressive collection of French Canadian silver donated by the Elizabeth, Allan, and Warren Shelden Fund. A Ciborium by Lorenzo Greci was added to the collection of Italian decorative arts by Esther Cutler in memory of Robert H. Tannahill. Miss Cutler also gave a French Coffee Pot by Denis François Franckson in memory of Mr. Tannahill. A Covered Soup Dish and Salver by Pierre Jean Meunier was given by Mr. and Mrs. Alan Joslyn, also in memory of Mr. Tannahill, as well as a Tea Pot by Denis François Franckson. Many galleries of the museum under the department's care were refurbished and rein- stalled to accommodate new works as well as to increase their beauty and historical accuracy. French 17th century paintings were reinstalled to utilize the Le Brun altar-</page><page sequence="8">piece as a key work in that collection. French 19th century paintings were installed on the North Wing Balcony to give them a more meaningful location in relation to the refurbished Tannahill galleries of Impressionist and Post-Impressionist art. Early in June 1973 work was begun on the reinstallation of the Kanzler Louis XV Room in the South Wing, where it will be shown near the Dodge Memorial Collection. Early in 1972 the Curator installed the Theodore Géricault exhibition, organized by Professor Lorenz Eitner of Stanford University, in the South Wing special exhibition galleries. With the aid of Curatorial Assistant Ronald L. Winokur, the Curator in- stalled throughout the French galleries the 80 objects on loan from the J. Paul Getty Museum. This collection of French 18th century decorative arts added greatly to the impact and meaning of the museum's collections and provided representative works of the highest quality for the public. In addition, ten paintings were lent by the Minneap- olis Institute of Arts. These were hung in appropriate places in the French, Italian, and British galleries. The department lent two works to major exhibitions: La Tour's Young Virgin Mary (fragment) to the Georges de La Tour exhibition at the Orangerie, Paris, during the summer of 1972; Eros and Psyche by Niccolo dell'Abbate to the "School of Fontainebleau" exhibition in Paris and Ottawa, 1972-73. In December the department sponsored a lecture by Jean Feray of the French government's Council on Historic Buildings; he spoke on "Furniture in Two Parisian Private Homes." The Curator was awarded the Fine Arts Silver Medal of the Michigan Academy of Science, Arts, and Letters for 1972. In addition, he was appointed Curator and Co- ordinator of the Bicentennial exhibition for the National Gallery of Art and Chairman Birth of the Virgin , Corrado Giaquinto, Italian (1703-65); canvas, 36 x 55% in. Acquired in memory of James and Lynelle Holden (73.100). 15</page><page sequence="9">of the Committee on College-University Relations of the College Art Association of America; he was also appointed to the National Council on Museum Education. The Curator served as a visiting member of the Accreditations Committee, American Association of Museums, to the Metropolitan Museum of Art and the Cleveland Museum of Art. The Curator delivered a lecture, "Erotic and Amorous Love from Fragonard to Fuseli," at the College Art Association Annual Convention, New York, 1973, and published two articles: "The Problem of Artistic Style as it Relates to the Beginning of Romanticism," Studies in Eighteenth Century Culture , Irrationalism in the Eighteenth Century , edited by Harold E. Pagliaro, Cleveland, 1972; and "The Assump- tion of the Virgin by Guercino," Bulletin of the Detroit Institute of Arts. Mr. Winokur delivered public lectures twice weekly in July and August 1972 on the Mr. and Mrs. Horace E. Dodge Memorial Collection. In May 1973 he also gave similar lectures on the Dodge and Getty Collections. In addition, Mr. Winokur conducted a mini-course in April 1973 for Founders Society members on French 18th century decorative arts. Museum intern Ross Fox of Wayne State University carried on extensive research concerning the collection of French Canadian silver pursuant to compiling a catalog and preparing the collection for reinstallation.

Curry 18 General activity in the department during this period included refurbishing and reorganizing the painting galleries. The pictures were rehung to achieve a logical pro- gression, with schools or periods brought together in a coherent way wherever pos- sible. Several works of high quality, put on display after a long absence from the gal- leries, received favorable comment from both staff and museum visitors. Lighting was changed or adjusted in many areas and further technical innovation is being considered. The Curator continued to examine works of art for the public at the rate of one to three appointments per week in the Institute and about one visit per month to a gallery or the home of an individual collector. There is great demand for loans from the collection. In spite of increasing restrictions on lending, there are usually a half dozen or so important works missing from the galleries at any given time. Among the more important paintings to go out during this period were In the Fields , included in the Eastman Johnson exhibition at the Whitney Museum of American Art; Banjo Player by William Sidney Mount, shown in "Art and the Excited Spirit" at the University of Michigan; The Dinner Horn , appearing in the Winslow Homer exhibition organized by the Whitney Museum of American Art; Charles Demuth's Building Abstraction for "The City in American Painting" at the Allentown Art Museum; and William Page's Mrs. William Page , shown at the Worces- ter Art Museum in "The American Portrait." In the summer of 1972 the department opened a major exhibition of paintings and drawings by Eastman Johnson, originated by the Whitney Museum. This show gave the people of Detroit an opportunity to view 100 of the best works of this artist whose interpretation of the American scene in the 19th century is often on a par with that of Winslow Homer. Two smaller exhibitions were designed to enhance and increase the exposure of the Institute's collection to the public. For the University-Liggett Antiques Show in June 1972, the Curator and his assistant prepared an installation of early American cer- ramics and glass. In cooperation with Winkelman's "Focus USA" fashion campaign in September 1972, an exhibition of watercolors and drawings entitled "Uniquely USA" was selected from the collections not permanently on view and hung where they could be seen within the context of the other works in the American galleries. The department is planning several major exhibitions, such as "American Paintings from Private Collections" (1975-76), to include works from the most important col- lections in the country, and "Copley, West, and Stuart," a Bicentennial project (1976). Curatorial Assistant Nancy Rivard has been organizing an exhibition of Pewabic Pottery to take place in June and July 1974. A number of significant acquisitions have increased the scope and importance of the American collection. The portrait of Madame Paul Poirson easily becomes the star in our impressive group of four paintings by John Singer Sargent. Dating from the artist's formative years in Paris, this work reflects all the creative genius of a young man described by Henry James as "a talent which on the threshold of its career has nothing more to learn." Rimmer's Civil War Scene depicting the carnage of battle in a green meadow is an interesting complement to Victory , the other painting in our collection by this painter, a more typical allegorical subject which alludes to warfare in a much different way. Compared to the latter, despite an intensely romantic quality, it is a much more straightforward concept of military conflict. These two pictures and a bronze Dying Centaur represent well this strange but important artist, who was also a practicing physician and pioneer anatomist in America. With a Philadelphia highboy and a Duncan Phyfe bench, the Institute strengthened</page><page sequence="12">Chippendale Highboy , American (Philadelphia); mahogany, H. 96 in. Robert H. Tannahill Foundation and Henry Ford II Funds (73.3). 19</page><page sequence="13">20 its collection of American decorative arts. The highboy, resplendent with magnificently crafted ornamentation and imposing scale, is typical of the Chippendale style at its best. The graceful lines and the elaboration of the lyre motif mark the Duncan Phyfe bench as a rare and exceptional work standing apart from much of the production of Phyfe's enormous workshop. Research catalogs of forthcoming exhibitions and a projected catalog of the American paintings in the permanent collection were carried forward. The Curator wrote an article on "Madame Paul Poirson: An Early Portrait by Sargent" for the Bulletin of the Detroit Institute of Arts. In the catalog of the University-Liggett Antiques Show, which coincided with the Eastman Johnson exhibition, the Curator published an article entitled "American Genre and Eastman Johnson at the Detroit Institute of Arts," spotlighting the extensive collection of paintings by artists such as William Sidney Mount, Richard Caton Woodville, George Caleb Bingham, Winslow Homer, and Eastman Johnson. The Curator gave many lectures within the museum and in other institutions around the country, including the Los Angeles County Museum of Art, the Virginia Museum of Fine Arts, the Houston Museum of Fine Arts and the Kalamazoo Art Center. At Kalamazoo he was asked to select and judge the annual exhibition of regional artists. The Curator attended the convention of the American Association of Museums at Milwaukee and a conference in Boston to secure the collaboration of the Museum of Fine Arts in Detroit's celebration of the American Bicentennial. Membership in the Associates of the American Wing has begun to increase and the officers of the organization are most anxious to expand its activities both within the Institute and in the community. Toward this end an effort has been made to work out a program of great interest to all the members. Nine scholars were brought from Detroit and other areas of the country to lecture to the group on various aspects of American art, and a similar series for the coming year is planned. A private tour of the White House and the American rooms in the State Department by Clement Conger, curator of these collections, created great enthusiasm. A more detailed discussion of the Associates of the American Wing is included with the Founders Society Committee Reports.

The most exciting event took place in August 1972 when Tony Smith's Gracehoper , originally designed in 1961 and commissioned by the Friends of Modern Art in 1971, was installed on the North Lawn by the firm of Darin and Armstrong, under the super- vision of John D. Hilberry, Architects. Tony Smith was present during the entire process, as was William Schmidt, owner of Industrial Welding, Newark, N. J., which made Gracehoper. Under the guidance of Curatorial Assistant Frank L. Kol ber t, a half- hour color film was made documenting the fabrication and installation of the piece. On 14 October the Friends of Modern Art, the Board of Trustees of the Founders Society, and the Arts Commission together "unveiled" and dedicated Gracehoper . Memorable events that evening were talks by former Curator Samuel J. WagstafF Jr. and Honorary Curator of Modern Art Lydia Winston Malbin. Mrs. Malbin was appointed Honorary Curator of Modern Art in February 1973. This is a natural and at the same time a highly significant event in the life of the department. Mrs. Malbin has been involved with contemporary art for many years and with her late husband, Harry Lewis Winston, formed a remarkable collection. Her great interest in Futurism, the unusually high quality of her extensive collection, her continuing and thorough concern with documentation, as well as her wide range of friendships with artists and scholars will make her guidance invaluable in building our 20th century collection. From July to April the museum was privileged to have on view 63 works from the Lydia and Harry L. Winston Collection. Drawings, watercolors, paintings, and sculpture representing the multiple directions of art in this century were shown. In September Mr. Kolbert organized an exhibition of 41 works by 12 young artists, whose average age was 28, called "12 Statements Beyond the 60s." This show was held concurrently with an exhibition of four sculptures and six watercolors by Eva Department of Modern Art Susanne F. Hilberry 21</page><page sequence="15">Hesse (1936-1970), whose work served as a synthesis of ideas as well as a jumping-off point for many artists in the 12 statements exhibition. In addition to a video tape involving 10 of the 12 artists, educational activities for the exhibition included a tour and symposium, a lecture on Eva Hesse by critic Lucy Lippard, and gallery talks. Susanne F. Hilberry organized and installed the ff59th Exhibition for Michigan Artists." The jurors were James Monte of the Whitney Museum, Dean Swanson of the Walker Art Center, and Elayne Varian, Director, Finch College Museum of Art. Certain problems which arose during the show, coupled with a general concern on the part of the professional staff, resulted in the formation of a Michigan Artists Committee to study issues affecting such exhibitions. An open forum for Michigan artists was held in March, and a questionnaire was sent out. Such efforts are indicative of the museum's continuing commitment to improve its relationship with artists of our community, the quality of the Michigan exhibitions, and the general professional climate for serious artists in Detroit. An exhibition in 1973, "Art in Space," was sponsored by the Friends of Modern Art; E. C. Goossen, art critic and author, served as consultant. The show consisted of 44 works, roughly spanning the last ten years, by 24 artists, and the catalog featured an essay by Mr. Goossen on developments in contemporary sculpture. Educational events included a lecture by Mr. Goossen, a panel discussion, gallery talks, and a film program. The department continued to work closely with the Friends of Modern Art whose lecture series was exceptional (see the Friends of Modern Art report). Through the generosity of Chairman W. Hawkins Ferry, two very important works were acquired, Linear Construction No. 4, 1962, a major piece by Naum Gabo, a founder of Russian Constructivism, and U Administration des Leurres ( Setting Snares ), 1963, the first major U Administration des Leurres ( Setting Snares) (1963), Jean Dubuffet, French (b. 1901); oil on canvas, 51 И X leVs in. Gift of W. Hawkins Ferry (73.166). 22</page><page sequence="16">work in the UHourloupe series by the complex French artist Jean Dubuffet. From the "Art in Space" exhibition, Mr. Ferry and Mrs. Richard Manoogian bought a painted steel work for the museum entitled Up-Front , 1971, by English sculptor Anthony Caro. The monumental outdoor sculpture by Tony Smith, Gracehoper , permanently standing on the North Lawn, also attests to the beneficence of Mr. Ferry, who was assisted in this major purchase by many others. In June 1973 Mrs. Hilberry reinstalled the German Expressionist galleries, presenting a more chronological sequence. Reinstallation of other galleries of 20th century art was also completed. Our collection was greatly enriched by three loans from Mr. and Mrs. Richard Manoogian: Star by Frank Stella, To Fellini by Philip Guston, and a collage Banner by Roy Lichtenstein. Franklin Siden added to our collection of Claes Oldenburg with his loan of Icebag. Dr. and Mrs. Hilbert Delawter lent two Kenneth Noland paintings, Ease Out , 1964, and Gate , 1967. In addition, the department lent ten works to exhibitions outside the museum. Frank L. Kolbert, who served for three years as Curatorial Assistant to Curator Samuel J. Wagstaff Jr., carried on the work of the department after Mr. WagstafFs resignation in November 1971. Mr. Kolbert's own resignation the following November left the department without a full-time staff member. Continuity of operations was assured by the presence of Mrs. Hilberry, dividing her time between the Education and Modern Art Departments. Gifts Paintings J.

The Hills Fund is the first one so designated since the bequest of John S. Newberry in 1965, and the department is most grateful to Mr. and Mrs. Hills for their interest and support. In the spring of 1972 the Founders Society received a matching grant of $5,000 from the National Endowment for the Arts for the architectural and engineering services required to prepare a plan for the new departmental facilities in the southwest corner of the Main Building. John D. Hilberry, Architects, and Hoyem Associates, Mechanical and Electrical Engineers, were commissioned to prepare a preliminary design and engineering report. The scope of the report was expanded beyond the strict limitations of the grant to encompass an integrated design including facilities for the study and exhibition of works of art on paper, as well as for their storage and protection. In preparation for this report Mr. Hilberry and Miss Sharp visited print and drawing departments in this country and abroad. Valuable suggestions were received from the Institute staff, in particular the Chief Conservator and the Building Superintendant. A detailed design report, architectural plans, and a handsome model were created. These were submitted to the National Endowment this spring and an additional matching grant of $100,000 (half federal, half private) was received; $350,000 stil. needs to be raised. It is hoped that construction will begin in the fall of 1973. The department presented the following exhibitions: "Prints by Albrecht Dürer," "Poster Panorama," "Detroit Collects Prints and Drawings," "Edvard Munch: the Graphic Work," "Landscapes and Cityscapes: Prints, Drawings, and Watercolors from the Collection," "Prints by Rolf Nesch," "Photographs: Recent Accessions," "Aquatint" (in three parts: History and Technique, Robert Motherwell's A la pintura , and Twentieth Century Aquatints), "Emil Nolde and Otto Mueller: Prints, Drawings, and Watercolors from the Collection," and "Homage to Maurits Cornelis Escher." "Detroit Collects Prints and Drawings," a major exhibition of over 400 works from six Detroit collections, was shown in five galleries in the South Wing. A 54-page illustrated catalog was published with portrait photographs of the collectors repre- sented, whose collections were chosen for their excellence and striking contrasts in content. "Poster Panorama" covered five galleries on the ground floor of the Main Building. This comprehensive survey of the history of the poster assembled from Michigan collections comprised over 200 works grouped according to subject. We believe many of the unusual French fin de siècle posters from the collection of Allan Dreyfuss had never before been exhibited in this country. Another striking feature of this exhibition was the group of controversial underground posters displayed in the Underground Museum. In 1973 emphasis was given to presenting recent acquisitions. The photographic exhibition consisted of over 70 works, all acquired within the last two years. This group included significant works by Julia Margaret Cameron, Frederick Evans, Edward Curtis, Jacques Henri Lartigue, André Kertész, Manuel Alvarez Bravo, Berenice Abbott, Barbara Morgan, Walker Evans, and Jerry Uelsmann. Bill Rauhauser served as Consultant on Photography, advising on purchases. He also prepared biographies of the photographers for use as an educational supplement to the exhibition. The aquatint exhibition was built around an important contemporary acquisition, Robert Motherwell's A la pintura. The focal point of the Emil Nolde exhibition was his forceful woodcut The Prophet , a recent purchase.</page><page sequence="18">Dancers in Repose , Edgar Degas, French (1834-1917); pastel, 23 x 17 in. Gift of Edward E. Rothman (72.441). Major gifts were two masterpieces of 19th century lithography, Honoré Daumier's Rue Transnonain and Edouard Manet's Civil War, from Mr. and Mrs. Bernard F. Walker; two lithographs, one with collage, by El Lissitsky (from his 1 Kestner-Mappe 1923), from Paul G. Lutzeier; early impressions of two of M. C. Escher's most im- portant works, from Dr. and Mrs. Herman Linn, two handsome pastels by Edgar Degas and J. F. Millet from Edward E. Rothman and Mrs. Joseph B. Schlo tman, and a group of 20th century prints by Jacques Villon, Max Ernst, and Max Pechstein, from Dr. and Mrs. Barnett Malbin (Lydia and Harry L. Winston Collection). Purchases include important prints by Jean Mignon, Théodore Géricault, Camille Pissarro, and Emil Nolde. 25</page><page sequence="19">An inventory was started of the collections under the department's care: prints, drawings, wratercolors, illustrated books, posters, and photographs. This work has been carried out by Joseph Nardi and Naomi Dickerson, Wayne State University Work-Study Program students. They have been assisted by the following volunteers: Mmes. Austin Bender, Guy Curtiss, Stanton Glover, Michael Grosfeld, Harold Gwillim, Harold Stulberg, and Walter Szczesiul. When this project has been brought to com- pletion, we will have not only an inventory of the entire collection but also a file of location cards arranged by accession number (dates of acquisition) to supplement our catalog cards arranged by categories. Technical assistant Donella Vogel resigned in March 1972 and was replaced by Julie Paul and Ann Ligosky; 408 prints, drawings, and photographs in the permanent collection were rematted on all-rag board. The hinging, labeling, and filing of these works was accomplished by Mr. Nardi and Miss Dickerson, assisted by Mmes. Curtiss and Bender. In April 1972 the Curator attended the annual meeting of the Trustees of the Print Council of America held at the Cleveland Museum of Art and at the Allen Memorial Art Museum in Oberlin. She lectured at the Toledo Museum of Art in connection with the exhibition there of graphics from the collection of Mrs. Barnett Malbin (the Lydia and Harry L. Winston Collection). The Curator contributed an article to the Bulletin entitled "Some Notable Print Acquisitions." Curatorial Assistant Paul Binai attended the College Art Association meetings in New York in January 1973 and presented a course in the spring of 1973 for the University Center for Adult Education entitled "Styles in France, 1500-1900." In the spring of 1973 Departmental Secretary Shirley Pencile attended a workshop on museum label production sponsored by the Smith- sonian Institution in Washington. Figure Left.

Made possible by the support of the National Endowment for the Arts and of the Eleanor C. and Edsel В. Ford Exhibition Fund, this exhibition was the most comprehensive presentation of the subject to date. Ranging from prehistoric to traditional and modern work, "African Terra Cottas" demonstrated the sophistication and imagination with which the African potter could use this medium, as well as its importance to life in Africa. Professor Daniel Mato acted as curator, Georges Rodrigues collected many of the works, and Professor Roy Sieber served as consultant. John Hunter and James Chatelain assisted with preparation and installation. Important additions to the collection include 20 sculptures and objects given by Justice and Mrs. G. Mennen Williams, and a major Benin bronze plaque purchased from the sale of the Cranbrook Academy Collection with funds provided by Mr. and Mrs. James A. Beresford. Black African Art Willis F.

American Indian Art Because of the scarcity of suitable exhibition space, the American Indian artifacts have not been on view for quite some time, but research and expansion of the collec- tion continues. In memory of Duffy Dean, the Jan Tours Company gave eight objects made by the Seri Tribe of Sonora, Mexico. Other recently recorded accessions have been in the building from as long ago as 1895, when most of the Frederick Stearns Collection was received. Outstanding examples from this group of Northwest Coastal art were selected and cataloged for the permanent collection. Miss Clara Avery's gift of baskets dates back to 1919 but had never been formally processed. 30 Gifts Mexico, Seri, Seal, Manta Ray, Shark, Sea Turtle, wood (72.26-29); Baskets, Trav (72.203- 6): Jans Tours Company in memory of Douglas Duffy Dean.

However, a completely new installation with expanded and improved labels is scheduled for the autumn of 1973. For more than a year as a Wayne State University work-study student and then as a curatorial assistant, Robert V. Rubyan has extensively researched and photographed the collection. The collection of Peruvian ceramics and textiles was enhanced by the addition of 49 pieces, gifts of Mrs. Frances H. Cinelli and of the J. L. Hudson Company. A fine Jalisco ceramic warrior was presented by Mr. and Mrs. Walter B. Ford II, and a second clay sculpture from Jalisco, Mexico, was purchased through the Lillian Henkel Haass Fund.

Woods The Oriental collection was enlarged with 266 works of art during the period of this report. Outstanding among these acquisitions were the gifts of Justice and Mrs. G. Mennen Williams, Dr. and Mrs. Leo S. Figiel, and Dr. and Mrs. Steven J. Figiel. The Williams Collection of Far Eastern Ceramics has been on loan to the Institute for some time. Obtained mostly in the Philippines, the diversity and quality of the Chinese, Thai, and Annamese objects constitute an admirable review of Far Eastern attainments in ceramic art. The Figiel gifts include Indian and Japanese illustrated manuscripts, Indian paintings and Bidri metalwork, and 33 Japanese lacquer pieces. Three lacquer writing boxes were given by Joseph J. Dodge in memory of his father Joseph M. Dodge. 32 Gifts Arms and Armor Japanese, Suit of Armor, Long Sword (Katana) , Short Sword (Wakizashi), Small Knife (Ko- gatana) (72.278-80a) : William C.

Grossman 34 As in past years, Detroit Youtheatre increased its audience for the continuing program, "Something Every Saturday." The newly initiated Magic Carpet Coach, sponsored in cooperation with four major shopping centers, brought over 6,000 suburban youngsters and their parents to the Institute. Subsidized in part by a grant from the Michigan Council for the Arts, educational programs toured southern Michigan com- munities, bringing curriculum-oriented entertainment to 150 schools. Fash/Bash II and III, fund-raising galas sponsored by the Founders Society Junior Council, netted approximately $17,000 for the benefit of Youtheatre. Members of the Junior Council, their families, and guests were invited to two Family Fun Days at the Museum, which included Youtheatre performances, luncheon, and treasure hunts. Tickets to three Youtheatre performances were offered as a Founders Society membership benefit. Total Youtheatre attendance in schools and at the museum approached 250,000. The department, in cooperation with the University Center for Adult Education, presented a film series, including several "Opera on Film" titles, "Tokyo Story," the award-winning Russian "War and Peace," the BBC documentary "Phantom India," a series complementing the Tutankhamun exhibition, and other films not generally seen in the Midwest. Ethnic dinners held in conjunction with the various film pro- grams met with great success. Negotiations with the American Film Institute and the National Endowment for the Arts were undertaken for the establishment of a Michigan Film Center to be based at the Institute. The department was host to two annual Detroit Metropolitan Theatre Festivals featuring original plays performed by area community theatre groups, and the 1972 Regional Children's Theatre Festival. The Paul McPharlin Gallery of Puppets, a permanent exhibition of puppets from the Institute's fine collection, was opened when the Great Plains Regional Puppetry Festival was held in Detroit in April 1972. The highlight of the entire period of this report was the sumptuous Wassail Feast held on two evenings in the Institute's Great Hall: 700 guests enjoyed a most unusual holiday festivity, featuring Renaissance entertainment and a lavish dinner. Loans from the department included exhibitions to the Kresge Museum at Michigan State University and the Metropolitan Lansing Arts Council. The Curator was again appointed Chairman of the American College Theatre Festival, Great Lakes Region. Gifts Print E. Weddige, Les Marionettes , lith. (73.50): Mrs. George Kamperman (bequest).

Given the concept of the Institute, it is most fitting that the museum has sponsored a superior and unique Concert Series for so many years. In selecting an individual artist or group attraction, the wishes of the audience, superior quality, uniqueness, and variety are important considerations. Public response and attendance attest to the success of the series. The 1972 portion of the 1971-1972 season included Boston Ballet with Edward Villella, guest star (23 February), and Nana Mouskouri, Greek folk singer, and her ensemble, the Athenians-Musicians (23 March). The 1972-73 season was varied and successful. Its programs were Les Manestriers , five French minstrels (27 October), The Yuval Trio from Israel (10 November), Acis and Galatea , an opera (serenade) by Georg Handel (1 December), Joseph Kalichstein, pianist (26 January), Troupe Liubliana , Yugoslavian dancers and musicians (9 Febru- ary), Polish Mime Ballet Theatre (16 February), Mozarteum Orchestra of Salzburg (16 March), and James Dick, pianist (8 April). A subsidy by the Mr. and Mrs. Benson Ford Foundation enabled us to offer four free tickets to members of the Founders Society for Mr. Dick's concert. Two free tickets were also given to the annual subscribers of the Concert Series. Concert Series Edith J. Freeman During the period of this report the Education Department was able to grow in personnel, expand in service and activities, and enter into closer cooperation with the entire museum staff to achieve the goal of interpreting and enlivening for today's public the legacy of art preserved at the Institute. The year began with three staff appointments. Richard C. Mühlberger, formerly Curator of Museum Education at the Worcester Art Museum, became Chairman of Education in June 1972, a new post that combines directing the department with broad inter-departmental responsibility to coordinate the total educational efforts of the Institute. In November Kyra Curtis left the faculty of Wayne State University to become a Junior Curator; she had formerly been an Institute intern in a cooperative museology training program with Wayne State University. Christine Schneider, who was also teaching at Wayne State University, became the third new member of the department, also as a Junior Curator. She has an impressive background in elementary and secondary school, and college teaching. Prior to returning to her home in Detroit, she was head of the art department at the University of Albuquerque. Linda Downs was promoted from Junior Curator to Assistant Curator in June 1973. Linn McGlade left the department in November. She had been staff advisor to the Art to the Schools Committee for most of her five years at the Institute. About 240 volunteers assist in the work of the department. The Volunteer Docent program was supervised by Linda Downs and Kyra Curtis; Art to the Schools volun- teers, by Linn McGlade and Christine Schneider; John Hunter took over supervision of the Information Center Volunteers, and Richard Mühlberger became advisor to the volunteers of the Gallery Aides Committee. Ross Fox, Arien Linn, and Camille Podolak were interns working in various depart- ments under the direction of the Education Department in a cooperative graduate program in museology with Wayne State University. Wayne State University and Kalamazoo College work-study students assigned to the department were Charlene Cantow, Charles Cole, Naomi Dickerson, Jacqueline Dunning, Cary Gersh, William Hodson, Evelyn Hunt, Karen Jenkins, David Kelly, Eileen Laverty, and Michael Williams. Education Department Richard C. Mühlberger 35</page><page sequence="29">36 John Hunter organized art workshops in the museum co-sponsored with Your Heritage House, which administers the classes. The focus of the program, which began in 1972, is to bring talented students from a variety of backgrounds into the environment of the museum for concentrated work in painting and drawing. The Institute began a major project under the direction of Christine Schneider, and in cooperation with the John D. Rockefeller III Fund, to develop teaching ma- terials for elementary and secondary schools that will relate art to standard curricu- lums. A network of museum staff, school teachers, and Art to the Schools volunteers has been testing the materials in classrooms of city and suburban schools, and the John D. Rockefeller III Fund has supplied expert guidance and direction through regular conferences. Since December, when the project began, work has centered on developing elementary school units 011 architecture and the visual arts in America. A program of monthly Gallery Mini-Courses began in February 1973 with William Peck, Curator of Ancient Art, teaching an eight-hour course on the decorative arts in the Ancient World in the galleries and storage areas of his department. In March Jean Dodenhoff taught a six-hour course on 17th century landscape paintings in the Dutch galleries. Gillian Wilson, Curator of Furniture at the J. Paul Getty Museum, Malibu Beach, and Ronald Winokur, Curatorial Assistant, Department of European Art, each taught a three-hour course on 18th century French furniture in April. Linda Downs taught about French Impressionist paintings in May, Richard Mühlberger about Italian Renaissance paintings in June. The courses, centered on the collections of the Institute and usually held in the galleries, were strictly limited to 20 enrollments per session. The demand was so great that all but one of the mini-courses had to be repeated. The department's classes and lectures in cooperation with the University Center for Adult Education continued with an ongoing four-part survey of Western art taught by Linn McGlade, Kyra Curtis, and Dominic Ricciotti of Wayne State University; an ongoing four-part survey of Oriental art taught by Michael Farrell of the University of Windsor; a survey of African art taught by Daniel Mato of Wayne State University; th ree different art appreciation courses taught by Jean Dodenhoff, Susanne Hilberry, and John Hunter; and a critical course on "Women in the Visual Arts" taught by Susan F. Rossen, Coordinator of Publications, and Julia H. Wise of the Society of Arts and Crafts. In conjunction with this course, Ms. Rossen and Nancy Rivard, Curatorial Assistant, Department of American Art, arranged a small exhibition of works by women artists in the Institute's collections but not always on view. Eight directors of North American art museums were asked to talk about their personal favorites in the collections of the Institute in a lecture series entitled "Director's Choice" during October and November. Participants were Daniel C. Rich, Joshua C. Taylor, Thomas M. Messer, Martin L. Friedman, Philip R. Adams, Jean Sutherland Boggs, Sherman E. Lee, and James Elliott. A series of six lectures called "Origins of Modern Movements," inspired by the Lydia and Harry L. Winston Collection on loan to the museum for nine months, took place in February and March 1973. These were given by Susanne F. Hilberry, Leo Steinberg, Michael Kirby, Kenneth Frampton, Robert Rosenblum, and Victor Miesel. Sinclair Hood and Christine Lilyquist were brought here to lecture in co-sponsorship with the Detroit Society of the Archaeological Institute of America. Two special free lectures for the academic community were sponsored and arranged by the department: Prince Subhadradis Diskul, dean of the faculty of archaeology in the Department of Fine Arts of the Ministry of Education in Thailand, spoke on Thai art; Sir Nikolaus Pevsner lectured on William Morris.</page><page sequence="30">Linear Construction No. 4 (1962), Naum Gabo, Russian-American (b. 1890); bronze and steel, H. 50И in. Gift of W. Hawkins Ferry (72.437). A Japanese tea ceremony was demonstrated in a program planned in cooperation with the University of Windsor in acknowledgment of the museum's volunteers. The department sponsored five Corporate Members luncheons. The speakers were Richard C. Miihlberger, James Greaves, Michael Farrell, Robert Douglas Hunter, and Sir Nikolaus Pevsner. Sir Kenneth Clark's new film series, "Pioneers of Modern Painting," attracted sell-out audiences for five three-week performances during the dead of winter. Three major exhibitions were mounted under the direction of members of the depart- ment. John Hunter planned and arranged the Walter Gropius exhibit. Susanne Hilberry organized and installed the "59th Exhibition for Michigan Artists," and Linda Downs planned and supervised the Barbara Chase-Riboud exhibition. Mrs. Hilberry also directed the reinstallation of the 20th century galleries on the second floor of the North Wing. 37</page><page sequence="31">Mrs. McGlade produced educational material for the Smith College exhibition that related a number of the loans to works in our own collection. Mrs. Downs assisted the Theatre Arts Department with the exhibition "Diaghilev and Russian Stage Designers" and wrote the catalog for that show, as well as an information sheet and check list for the African terra cottas exhibition, which Mr. Hunter installed. Mrs. Hilberry supervised the production of a video tape with 10 of the 12 artists in the ff12 Statements Beyond the 60s" exhibition. The Film and Electronics Communica- tions Department of Ford Motor Company generously donated their video crew, under the direction of Frank Benesh, to tape the artists with their works. Mrs. Hilberry also arranged tours, lectures, and symposia in connection with that exhibition, as well as for the rrArt in Space" show. In addition, she supervised the Friends of Modern Art lecture series in cooperation with Friends' Chairman W. Hawkins Ferry. The attached statistical reports indicate that during the last 18 months there was à great increase in museum services to the public. The average monthly number of school children given tours by the Docents rose from 1,466 to 2,013, and the adult monthly average soared from 281 to 407. Staff-led tours increased by eight-fold, and counting the splendid work of extra hired personnel during the African terra cottas exhibition, the increase was 25-fold. The Art to the Schools volunteers saw an average of 4,812 children every month, doubling their average monthly contacts from the 1971 season. Suburban school visits continued to outnumber Detroit school visits by 5 to 1. The number of unguided classes increased sharply from an average of 2,700 students a month to 3,633. Every Tuesday through Friday, between 9:30 a.m. and about 2:30 p.m., there was an average of over 400 students on tour in the museum, not counting the bus loads that arrived almost daily without previous notification.

The museum entered into association with Ford and Earl Design Associates of Warren, Michigan, which contributed graphic designs for the department. These included three issues of the Bulletin , three special exhibition catalogs ( Twelve Statements Beyond the 60s, 59th Exhibition for Michigan Artists , Art in Space), check lists for the "Lydia and Harry L. Winston (Dr. and Mrs. Barnett Malbin) Collection," "Eva Hesse Exhibition," "African Terra Cottas South of the Sahara," and "Detroit Collects: Antiquities," two educational hand-outs, and 11 gallery sheets. During the period of this report the museum published six issues of the Bulletin , and a supplement. Work continued on the catalog of the Mr. and Mrs . Horace E. Dodge Memorial Collection , on the biography of William R. Valentiner by Dr. Margaret Sterne, on a catalog of the exhibition of African terra cottas, and on Medieval Treasures , Art from the Middle Ages in the Young People's Guide Series. Publications Department Susan F. Rossen The Registrar's Office maintains records on works of art in the Institute's collections, on loans to other institutions, and on loans received, either for exhibition or under consideration for acquisition. A chronological list of exhibitions and a list of loans to other organizations are given in Appendix III. All accessions to the permanent collection acquired since the last Annual Report are included in the curatorial department reports herewith. Staff members of curatorial departments periodically review the classification of works of art under their jurisdiction. Significant reattributions or changes in identification approved during the last five years or so also are listed in curatorial department reports; many routine minor refinements in nomenclature and dating have not been included. Preparing and maintaining the records for an art collection of well over 24,000 works or lots, which increases at the rate of 500 or more per year, is beyond the capabilities of the Registrar and Assistant Registrar alone. Volunteer help is essential. Many Volunteer Staff Aides again served faithfully during the year. Under the supervision of Mmes. Betty Love and Mary Jane Siegmund, Mmes. Louise Alic, Marie Burgess, Ann Joiner, Frances Pascoe, Virginia Podolak, Julanne Rust, and Geraldine Yannello inaugurated and completed a card file recording all works of art in the permanent collection under the names of their donors. A similar file recording works under the names of their artists (and including former attributions) is underway. Mr. and Mrs. Chaim Tigel continued to process identification photographs and mount them on accession records. Other volunteers who helped to reorganize and inventory art storage areas, inventory galleries and loans to governmental offices, or work on other records were Mmes. Kathryn Anderson, Mary Bursey, Helen Chason, Joan Heneveld, Marjorie Longo, Beverly Pack, Elaine Rauth, Penelope Slough, Beverly Weihe, and Ann Woods. Marvella L. Barham served as office clerk for well over a year. Her chief duties were processing and labelling photographs. Assistance in several fields continued to be furnished by students participating in college work-study programs: Sharon S. Burke, Josephine M. Flores, Dolores A. Giannuzi, Mary M. Gray, Joseph S. Nardi, Robert V. Rubyan, and George P. Seedorff worked in this office at one time or another on a full or part-time basis. Among their projects were the establishment of a file of corres- pondence with borrowing institutions arranged by cities and of a card file of works on exhibition arranged by galleries. Registrar's Office Charles H. Elam 39</page><page sequence="33">Research Library F. Warren Peters During 1972-1973, with the help of EEA employees and Wayne State University work-study students, the Research Library was able to function smoothly and effi- ciently. In addition to its continual use by the museum's staff, the library also wel- comed over 3,300 registered visitors who availed themselves of its services and resources. Through purchases, gifts, and exchanges, 1,370 book titles and continuations were added to the collection. From the perennial backlog of uncataloged material and current acquisitions, 1,844 titles were cataloged, including most of the 754 books received from the Robert H. Tannahill Bequest. By count, 4,600 items received from American and foreign art dealers were recorded. There were 11,200 catalog cards (including 4,500 contributed by the Detroit Public Library Fine Arts Department) added to the 240 drawers of our already crowded book catalog. For the first time in many years additional funds were provided by a grant from the McGregor Fund, making possible the acquisition of a good number of expensive but important sources for art connoisseurship. Among the 50 titles that enriched the collection should be mentioned the Author Catalogue of the National Art Library Catalogue , Victoria and Albert Museum , Boston, 1972 (10 vol.) and its companion Catalogue of Exhibition Catalogues. The reprinted volumes of Man, 1-50, 1901-50, published by the Royal Anthropological Institute of Great Britain and Ireland, were acquired to aid in the study of ethnographic cultures. The six-volume work by M. Dortu, Toulouse-Lautrec et son oeuvre , New York, 1971, is representative of the kinds of monographs and catalogues raisonnés an art library finds indispensable. An example of original source material, so useful to the documentation of art objects, is the set by Jean Aimar Piganiol de La Force, Description Historique de la Ville de Paris et de ses Environs , Paris, 1765 (10 vol.). Another example is the work by Florent Le Comte, Cabinet des Singularitéz ď Architecture, Peinture , Sculpture et Graveure , ou Introduction à la Connoissance des plus Beaux Arts , 2nd ed., Brussels, 1702 (3 vol.). The McGregor Fund also enabled the library to acquire a number of 18th and 19th century French publications (both original editions and reprints) and to fill gaps in such periodicals as the Journal of Hellenic Studies. It^is a great pleasure to conclude with the most splendid gift, the Description de l'Egypte , published by order of Napoleon Bonaparte, Paris, 1809-26 (22 vol.), pre- sented to the Institute by Mrs. Josephine H. Fisher, to whom we are most grateful. Conservation Services Laboratory James L. Greaves 40 During 1972-73 the basic construction of the laboratory was completed. Thanks to generous grants from the Kresge Foundation for basic microscopy equipment, the Knight Foundation for decorative arts conservation equipment, the World Adventure Series for a complete air abrasive cleaning system, and the McGregor Fund for the general underwriting of operating expenses, the three-dimensional arts and paintings conservation workshops are now operational. The laboratory began interviewing specialists in paper conservation and obtained advice on establishing a paper conservation studio from William Spawn, Conservator, American Philosophical Society, Philadelphia. The problems of textile preservation were explored in detail and included a visit by Malcolm Delacorte, Research Associate, Conservation Center, New York University. During 1972, S. N. Hlopoff, Consulting Conservator of Decorative Arts, agreed to extend his services to six months per year, thus enabling us to expand our decorative</page><page sequence="34">arts conservation program. Throughout the year we were assisted by the volunteer service of Mrs. Robert Weston and of Michael Heslip, who was later appointed an assistant, funded by the Founders Society. James Chatelain continued to work on a part-time basis in early 1972. Frances Golden, a Wayne State University work-study student, provided valuable assistance and has been accepted as our first official apprentice. The Chief Conservator attended a conference on paper restoration sponsored by the International Institute of Conservation - American Group (IIC-AG), held in Phila- delphia, and the 1972 annual meeting in Winterthur, Delaware (as a member of the officer-nominating committee). He participated at policy-making and program-review meetings of the Intermuseum Conservation Association and Training Program in Oberlin, Ohio. He visited the Cooperstown Graduate Program in Art Conservation to observe the training program and negotiate for future intern students in art conserva- tion, and he attended a special General Electric Conference on problems of museum lighting. During a European trip in the fall the Chief Conservator attended the bi- annual conference of the International Institute for the Conservation of Historic and Artistic Works, Lisbon, Portugal, and also visited the laboratories of the Cairo Museum in Egypt, the Instituto Centrale della Restauro, Rome, the Pitti Palace and the Fortezza, Florence, and the Louvre, Paris. Works of art under consideration for purchase were examined in Rome, Florence, and Paris, as were collections in Madrid and the cities mentioned above. Mr. Hlopoff attended the IIC-AG meeting in Winterthur, where he presented a paper entitled "On the Conservation of French XVII Century Furniture." He also pre- sented a paper entitled "Furniture Styles in France during the XVIII Century and their Conservation" at the Ella Sharp Museum in Jackson, Michigan. There were 258 works of art treated in the laboratory; an additional 39 works under- went laboratory examinations, and 67 works were examined prior to loans. Eighteen oil paintings received major treatment including cleaning, 29 were given only struc- tural or minor conservation treatment, and 56 were prepared for loan or special Figure Left.

The cleaning and restoring of the Officer with a Plumed Hat by Rembrandt, and the cleaning of the Girl with Candle by George de La Tour prior to its exhibition at the Louvre were among the major conservation projects. The cleaning of the La Tour was of critical significance, revealing that it was of far greater quality than had been believed, and that it is a fragment of a "lost" Education of the Virgin , which had been detrimentally altered in an earlier restoration. The painting is now on view in its fragmented state with a minimum of retouching. American paintings cleaned included Portrait of Robert Barr by Whistler, Coast Scene by Eilshemius, Scene at Giverny by Robinson, and four paintings by John Mix Stanley. European paintings cleaned included Cattle at Water Trough by Troyon, The Muse of Paintings by Veronese, Brazilian Landscape by Post, and Return of the Holy Family from Egypt by Dujardin. A great variety of three-dimensional art works were treated, many in conjunction with the reinstallation of galleries. The consolidation and partial restoration of most of the museum's collection of Egyptian "mummies" (including two cartonnages, one mummy case, and one actual mummy) coincided with the reinstallation of the Egyptian galleries. To date 15 Gothic sculptures, including Madonnas by Bonino da Campione, Andrea Pisano, and Tino di Camaino, have been cleaned for reinstallation in the Gothic Hall. In addition to the above major projects, 10 ceramics, 6 ancient stone sculptures, 3 American stone sculptures, 3 ancient metal items, 7 French bronzes, 1 oriental bronze, and 5 pre-Columbian silver objects were treated. 58 American and European silver pieces were cleaned. 12 European works of decorative art were treated, including 3 French gold doré clocks; 3 Japanese wood and lacquer boxes were repaired; and 6 picture frames were treated. The period of this report marked the trial introduction of conservation services to the public and to institutions within the Detroit metropolitan area. Thus far examinations and treatments have been restricted primarily to oil paintings and these have been limited because of other staff commitments. The experiment will be continued on a "first call" basis for another year, at which time the program will be evaluated. Photographic Department Joseph Klima Jr. 42 Despite a continuing personnel shortage, the department produced 3,784 black and white negatives and 12,726 prints from existing negatives. There were 5,418 original color slides made for staff and library use, 18,784 duplicate slides made for sale, and 217 larger color sheets made for reproduction and publication. Services to the Con- servation Department and to other staff members with photo-related problems were provided. All of this was accomplished despite the cutbacks in EEA funds that resulted in the departure of Mrs. Ruby Woods and Patsy Coleman from our staff. Thanks to the help of volunteers, the mounting of a backlog of prints for the Regis- trar's file of albums is nearly up to date. Volunteer Percy Whiting is reducing the library's invaluable old 334 x 4 in. slide collection to the more useful 2 x 2 in. size. Currently, work-study students Gail Rosenbloom, Gwen Dekker, and Allan Waters are helping with the tremendous workload of the department, as are our long-standing volunteers, Mr. and Mrs. Chaim Tigel. Assistant Photographer Nemo Warr remains active with the Photo Guild of Detroit and the Photographic Society of America. He delivered lectures to the Camera Club of Massachusetts and to the Greater Washington, D.C., Camera Club. The Photog- rapher attended a Conservation and Photography Workshop in Kansas City, and was</page><page sequence="36">the principal speaker for the Photographic Workshop at the American Association of Museums Convention at Milwaukee. The latter was an inaugural workshop and was very successful. A major promotion campaign was carried out for the exhibition, "African Terra Cottas South of the Sahara." Over-sized four-color posters, newspaper advertising, and a series of elaborately produced public service TV announcements all helped inform the public of this exhibition. The National Bank of Detroit, with the help of Seymour &amp; Lundy Associates, specialists in black community relations, and WXYZ-TV were particularly generous in aiding the museum's effort to persuade persons living in the metropolitan area to visit the exhibition. While the first assignment of Public Relations is to publicize the Institute's acquisi- tions, exhibitions, and general programs, it also serves as a promotion and advertising department. Activities in these areas were increased considerably in the past 18 months, reflecting the accelerated lecture, theatre, concert, and special event schedules of the auxiliary groups of the Founders Society and the Education Department. Lectures were advertised in advance, with particular emphasis given to university newspapers. The Concert Series, the Detroit Youtheatre season of 34 weeks, and such special promotions as Alistair Cooke's "America" and the Junior Council's FASH/ BASH II and III, required the full energy of the department. Margaret DeGrace, Manager of Press Relations, and Katherine Douglas, Department Secretary, provided invaluable assistance. Public appreciation of the Institute was perhaps best symbolized by the two 30-minute television programs produced for prime time in March 1972 by WWJ-TV. These beautifully taped shows, The Collectors : Their Legacy of Art , not only won national prizes for the station but struck a public note of gratitude for all the patrons who have contributed to this museum's importance. Public Relations Robert R. Rodger s Two of the most pressing difficulties faced by the administration this past year have been the interrelated problems of personnel shortages and security for the works of art. On 30 June 1972 more than one third of our City employees were being paid by the federal government under its Emergency Employment Act. Since many of our guards were in this category, we would have had to close the museum to the public early in 1972 had it not been for this federal assistance. The EEA program funding was reduced during the past year so that our City payroll on 30 June 1973 stood at 113 employees, of whom 24 were EEA financed. This compared to 138 total with 49 EEA at the end of fiscal 1971-72. By February 1973 the reduction of EEA personnel made the museum's closing a distinct possibility. The Arts Commission invited the Mayor and his top financial advisors to a meeting to outline the gravity of the museum's plight. The statistics were compiled in graphic form by the Commission Secretary, who made the presentation with Lee Hills, Commission President, the Director, and the Assistant Director. Mr. Hills stressed that the Founders Society's many commitments in support of the Detroit Institute of Arts prohibited it from assuming any more of the City's obligations for museum maintenance. Mayor Gribbs' response to the presentation was favorable; he gave his assurance that despite the serious deficit financing position of the City, the Institute would not close due to lack of security personnel. As a result of a subsequent survey of guard assignments made by the Comptroller's office, we are presently dis- Administrator's Office William A . Bostick 43</page><page sequence="37">cussing with City authorities changes in amount and deployment of security personnel which will again permit all galleries to be open - a situation which has not existed since the early months of 1972, when we had our maximum of EEA guards. The Administrator-Secretary made a very profitable trip to Europe in the spring of 1973, interviewing authorities at Interpol in Paris and police personnel in London and Amsterdam on the serious problem of art thefts. He also participated in an inten- sive, five-day International Conference on the Problem of Security in Museums, sponsored by the International Council of Museums (ICOM), at St. Maximin, France, and delivered the opening address on behalf of the American delegation. He has been asked by UNESCO to write an article, "The Ethics of Museum Acquisitions," for its quarterly publication Museum , which will summarize the results of the international security meeting. The City's contribution to the Institute's operation is an indispensable part of our annual operating budget. For the fiscal year 1972-73, $1,694,292 from City tax revenues was allocated to the Institute, of which $1,338,973 was apportioned for salaries and wages and the balance of $355,319 for maintenance and programs. Because of a city-wide effort to save money in all departments, $262,363 was frozen from salaries and wages, making the total funds available $1,431,929. Maintenance and Security Departments Lawrence W. Jackson A number of building renovations, including the resetting of the Woodward entrance driveway walls, steps, and deck were made during the period of this report. The painting and redecorating of the South Wing galleries has continued as scheduled. The Contemporary galleries were rearranged and rehung. Various storage rooms were relocated for better utilization. The department installed 39 temporary exhibitions. A number of retirements and promotions occurred, including the retirement of Head Guard William S. Brown. The Superintendent participated in the Business Administration Workshop conducted by the American Association of Museums and was appointed a Director of the Inter- national Association of Museum Security Officers.
