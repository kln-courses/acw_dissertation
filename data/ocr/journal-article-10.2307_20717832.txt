Paperback: $45.00 Caroline Joan (Kay) Picart In a passage from Daybreak (?169), Nietzsche dares us to conceive of architecture in terms of a labyrinth?the only structure, in his view, that would be consistent with our all-too-modern souls. Alexandre Kostka and Irving Wohlfarth's edited book, Nietzsche and "An Architecture of Our Minds," takes on this challenge with an ambitious sweep of essays, whose connections are labyrinthine rather than linear. The approaches used are principally from aesthetics and art his tory, and among the questions it seeks to grapple with are: What did Nietzsche know of histor ical and contemporary architecture? What was the significance of architectural metaphors in his language? Which architects, painters, writers, and scientists are we entitled to describe as "Nietzscheane" and to what degree? The book is tripartite, moving from an examination of the metaphors of architecture that abound in Nietzsche's writings, to reflections on Nietzschean resonances/influences in art, lit erature, and architecture, and finally to a more specific focus on Nietzschean biographical and conceptual influences on various modern architects. After Tilmann Buddensieg's introduction, Claudia Brodsky Lacour does a genealogy of architectural metaphors in Western philosophy, including Plato, Descartes, Kant, Hegel, and finally Nietzsche. She argues that Nietzsche's "con ceptual construction" (der Bau der Begriffe), "a process by which man-made metaphors for sen sations are rigidified into concepts, their anthropomorphic origins forgotten" (21), was consonant with the modern search for a "technique" or methodology for going beyond "all-too-human" representations. Karsten Harries and Anthony Viddler then examine the metaphors of the labyrinth and the mask in Nietzsche's work. Harries argues that "the stony, mute hardness of our modern architecture and of our modern world lets us long for life, even at the price of architectural order, lets us dream of antiarchitectures, of ruins and labyrinths" (47). Vidier analyzes the recurring motif of the mask, the feminine aspect of the "uncanny," and the theme of horror as the space "behind" the mask alongside the "authenticity" of the labyrinth in its lack of facades (61) as quintessentially Nietzschean and modern architectural tropes that get at the heart of nineteenth and early twentieth-century debates over meaning, authenticity, and materiality, and late twen tieth-century discussions of postsemiotic and posthistorical signification. The second section of the book, which is the most sprawling and ambitious in its examina tion of Nietzsche's influence on art and aesthetics, begins with Werner Hofmann's essay. Though it remains an open question whether Gustav Klimt ever actually read Nietzsche, or whether Nietzsche's ability to "reverse perspectives" reached him as part of the climate of Vienna in his day, Hofmann presents a compelling case for the preponderance of Nietzschean themes, such as the "Pessimismus der St?rke" (Pessimism of Strength) and the coexistence of the Apollonian and the Dionysian, derived mainly from The Birth of Tragedy in many of Klimt's works (76). In turn, Paolo Baldacci argues that Giorgio de Chirico "was a Nietzschean to the very core" (91). De Chirico envisaged himself as a creator of mythical metaphors in which elements of pri Journal of Nietzsche Studies, Issue 27, 2004 Copyright ? 2004 The Friedrich Nietzsche Society. 85</page><page sequence="2">86 Book Reviews vate memory fuse into and exchange places with symbolic cultural elements. By "eliminating" (wegthun, Nietzsche's word) the conventionally unambiguous nature of things, de Chirico forges the multiple ambiguity of the "void" and thus transplants Nietzsche's influence onto the visual arts. Similarly, Hanne Bergius uncovers Nietzsche's pivotal role in all three centers of Dadaism? Zurich, Paris, and Berlin?as evidenced in the Dadaist celebration of the dance and montage as representing a polar "new unity" (123) and ultimately focuses on the Berlin Dadaists, such as Baader and Finsterlin. In turn, Irving Wohlfarth examines various reactions to, and appropria tions of, Nietzsche's critique of the disintegration of master builders in the face of the death of God. Wohlfarth argues that Walter Benjamin and Siegfried Giedion attempted to distance them selves from?even to repress?the Nietzschean temptation evident in Jugendstil architecture. Benjamin's later interpretation of Henrik Ibsen's "Solness as the Master Builder," who embod ies the contrary Nietzschean impulse to rise above (and collapse into) the all-too-human petti ness of the age, reveals that in Benjamin's view Nietzsche and Ibsen as purported saviors from the modern claustrophobia may prove to be "yet more phantasmagorias, born and bred in the selfsame bourgeois interior" (160). Alexandre Kostka gestures to the difference between Henry van de Velde's remodeling of the Nietzsche-Archiv as a cult space for the elite (1902-3), under Count Harry Kessler's directives, and his design for a Nietzsche-Tempel as a place of reconcilia tion between elite and masses (1910-14). Ultimately, Kostka draws out an insightful link between Kessler and Joseph Beuys: both shared the aspiration of becoming the architects of the "New Man" by installing an elite of superior individuals, nourished and strengthened by art, as the builders of history. In keeping with this plan, "Nietzsche himself becomes a source of energy, and his aura is to be 'stockpiled' in a temple" (223). To close this section, Le?n Ploegaerts argues, using Van de Velde's memoirs in relation to his architectural pieces, that "Van de Velde's interest in Nietzsche's philosophy and his turbulent life at times assumed the overtones of a cult" (233). The final section begins with Tilmann Buddensieg's contention that Nietzsche's interpreta tion of architecture as "empty form"?a reflection of psychic states analogous to music?rever berated with subsequent generations of architects, starting with Van de Velde and August Endell, and architectural theorists from Heinrich W?Tfflin and August Schmarsow onward (267). Fritz Neumeyer uncovers the pervasive influence of Nietzsche on Ludwig Mies van der Rohe and his close collaborator, Ludwig Hilberseimer, as well as other architectural avante-garde such as Bruno Taut and, surprisingly, Erich Mendelsohn?a fact earlier covered over by Oskar Beyer in an attempt to sacrifice "Nietzsche as a 'musical offering' on the altar of architectural history" (298). Similarly, Jean-Louis Cohen argues that Nietzsche's Zarathustra provided Le Corbusier with the metaphorical vocabulary to construct a personal language and to articulate his thought in regard to both his vision of "the great city and the relation to tradition, namely the very mean ing of creation" (330). Ultimately, the book "closes" open-endedly, returning where it began, with an appendix consisting of a collection of quotations from Nietzsche aimed at excavating "the full range of the architectural metaphor in Nietzsche's mature works" (333). Like a labyrinth, it is easy to get lost in the experimental excursions of Kostka and Wohlfarth's edited volume; yet perhaps that is what makes it true to the Nietzschean vocation of "living dangerously."
