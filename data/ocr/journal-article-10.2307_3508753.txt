<plain_text><page sequence="1">Eighteenth-Century English Dictionaries and the Enlightenment CAREY McINTOSH Hofstra University, New York In the eighteenth century lexicographers were still learning their trade, and perhaps we should not expect them to have been acutely sensitive to current intellectual trends. The commercial advantages of keeping very much abreast of new words and idioms were slight. Samuel Johnson, whose dictionary certainly dominated lexicography in the second half of the century, recom- mended the usage of earlier generations as a model, in preference to current usage. Nevertheless, whether they meant to or not, dictionaries seem to have 'become enlightened' during the course of the first fifty or seventy-five years of the eighteenth century. They reflected and promoted Enlightenment values. I shall present evidence here that the later eighteenth-century dictionaries not only exhibit an increasing awareness of the cultural ideals we associate with high Enlightenment but also embody those cultural ideals. Most research on eighteenth-century English dictionaries has been concerned either with the evolution of lexicography or with Johnson's achievements in the field.' Thus, the two early dictionaries I quote from most frequently in this essay have been characterized as relying more on 'the subjective impressions and prejudices of the editor or his sources than [on] the objective documentation of language' that modern dictionaries aspire to.2 Thus, more trivially and questionably, one scholar asserts thatJohnson's was 'the first English dictionary that could in any way be considered as a standard, all its predecessors being mere lists of words in comparison'.3 My approach, while by no means incompatible with these two, is different: making common-sense allowances for idiosyncrasy and error, I take diction- aries as representative of their times. This is not an unproblematical assumption, given that every eighteenth-century dictionary drew heavily on I For example, De Witt T. Starnes and Gertrude E.

Also, disconcertingly, dictionaries tended to stay in print: R. C. Alston reminds us that there were versions of Bullokar's An English Expositor published from 1616 to 1775 and of Nathan Bailey's Universal Etymological English Dictionary from 1721 to 1802. My approach relies on the likelihood that author and publisher could not afford a great number of obviously out-of-date and old-fashioned definitions in a dictionary intended for a wide current readership. The compilers of diction- aries and the booksellers who offered dictionaries to the public would not have printed one that seemed completely out of touch with current usage. When Ash ( 775) copiedJohnson ( 755), orJohnson copied Bailey ( 72 I), or Bailey copied Kersey (I 708), most of the time they must have judged that the old definition was current enough.4 The 'enlightening' of eighteenth-century dictionaries can be observed within three areas: as changes in content; in style (form and content mixed); and in categories. Obviously, a number of trends that we associate with the Enlightenment do not figure in this essay, and I have not followed up all possible leads. Eighteenth-century dictionaries might also be quoted to illustrate the commercialization of culture, the new aestheticism, or evolving values such as charity, humanity, sensibility, sentiment, sympathy, socia- bility, cosmopolitanism, equality under the law, and the rights of man. i: Changes in Content i. First, and uncontroversially, later dictionaries retreated from the realms of magic and superstition. While it is true that even as up-to-date and science-minded a scholar as Ephraim Chambers accepted a large number of 'wondrous curiosities and supernatural cures' in his dictionary-like Cyclopae- dia of 728, the general trend was undoubtedly away from magic and toward what we now regard as 'science'.5 For example,javaris is defined in Kersey ( 708) as 'a Swine in America that has its Navel on the back', but in Ash (I775) simply as 'a kind of wild swine found in America'; for Asterion, Kersey gives 'a kind of Spider, the Bite of which is said to weaken the Knees; also an Herb call'd Cow-parsnep': Ash has the herb only. Kersey (1 708) and Bailey ( 72 ) define witch, elf, and charm in (almost identical) words ascribing magical powers to these beings, but in Ash (I 775) a witch is 'supposed to practice unlawful arts' (emphasis mine), and 4John Ash, The New and Complete Dictionary of the English Language, 2 vols (London 1775); Samuel Johnson, A Dictionary of the English Language, 2 vols (1755; repr.

In Sheridan (I780) an elf is 'supposed to be seen in wild places'; a charm is 'imagined to have some occult power'. It is not merely that the late- eighteenth-century world, as created or re-created in dictionaries, is less concerned with magic; we witness also a fading-out of the irrational and a foregrounding of known, knowable causes and effects. Kersey's definition of gossamer postulates mysterious forces and unexplained dangers: 'a kind of thin Cobweb-like Vapour that hovers in the Air, and is suppos'd to rot Sheep'; whereas Ash's definition of gossamer is a straightforward description of fact: 'The down of plants, the long white cobwebs which usually float in the air about the time of harvest'. One must of course bear in mind that the 'Enlightenment' process was not homogeneous or straightforward, and eighteenth-century dictionaries provide evidence of this also. Kersey was a man of genuine learning, and though not a mathematician like his contemporary John Harris, he cannot be dismissed as a naive or unsophisticated writer. He had drawn freely on Harris's scientific and technical knowledge in his abridgement of Edward Phillips's dictionary in I706.6 Where Phillips (i658) has 'Camelion, a beast like a Lizard, that turneth himself into all colours, and lives by the aire', Kersey describes the camelion as 'a Creature like a Lizard, that frequents the Rocks; it lives upon Flies'. Kersey supplies not only the conventional meanings for mass, 'a huge heap, or pile [...]. All the Blood in a Humane Body', but also 'in Natural Philosophy, the quantity of Matter in any Body', a rather astute summary of what I take to be a Newtonian sense of the word. Kersey's definition of gravity confirms the notion that he had read Newton: 'Graveness, Soberness. In a Philosophical Sense, that Quality, by which all heavy Bodies, tend towards the Center of the Earth'. On the other hand, there are occasional startling irrationalities in Kersey: 'Artificial Lines [.. .] are Lines so contrived as to represent the Logarithmick Sines and Tangents, which will solve all Questions in Trigonometry, Navigation, &amp;c'. 'Natural Magick or Natural Philosophy [s.v. magick], a useful Science, teaching the Knowledge and mutual Application of Actives to Passives, so as to make many excellent Discoveries'. Here is the new science in older clothes. 2. The early dictionaries preserve more of feudalism than the later ones do. The definition of benerth, 'a Service formerly render'd by the Tenant to his Lord, with his Plough and Cart', appears in almost the same words in Kersey, in Bailey (I 72I), and in the fourteenth edition of Bailey (I 75 ), but not in Johnson (I755) or Sheridan (I78o).7 (I have not found it in the OED. Perhaps it is a ghost, with no surviving texts to support it outside the 6 Edward Phillips, The New World of English Words (1 658; repr. Menston: Scolar, 1969). See Starnes and Noyes, p. 85. 7 Thomas Sheridan, A General Dictionary of the English Language, 2 vols (I780; repr. Menston: Scolar, I967). 5</page><page sequence="4">English Dictionaries and the Enlightenment dictionaries.) Orenges, '(in Heraldry) little Balls, usually represented of the Orange-Colour', appears in Kersey and Bailey, but not in Johnson, Ash, or Sheridan. Kersey lists the five 'Beasts of the Forest': 'The Hart, Hind, Hare, Boar, and Wolf', and the five Beasts of Chace, buck, doe, roe, fox, martern [sic]. Both Kersey and Bailey describe the Falcon Gentle as 'a sort of Hawk, so call'd from her familiar Courteous Disposition'. 3. The early dictionaries reflect a more rural world than the later ones do. The England of forest, farm and pasture is better represented. Kersey ( 708) and Bailey (I72I) give barbes, 'a Disease in Horses and Black Cattel, known by two Paps under the Tongue'. Until quite recently, farmers tended to spend more time with animals than with people. A nest in Kersey and Bailey is 'a little Lodgment, in which Birds hatch, and breed their Young'; Johnson's and Sheridan's definitions are less anthropomorphic and include a scientific term: 'The bed formed by the bird for incubation and feeding her young'. Many remnants of the games and customs of country folk are preserved in the early dictionaries and omitted from the late, for example: to Nick the Pin, 'to drink just to the Pin plac'd about the middle of a Wooden Bowl or Cup'; Ascoltasmus, 'a kind of Play, among Boys call'd, Fox to thy Hole'. One surprising rural custom appears in the first and survives in the fourteenth edition of Bailey (172I and 175I): Free Bench, the Custom of the Manors of East and West Embourn [.. .] if a customary Tenant die, the Widow shall have her Free-Bench in all his Copyhold Land, Dum sola &amp; castafuerit, but if she commit Incontinency, she forefeits her Estate; yet if she will come into the Court, riding backwards on a black Ram, with his Tail in her Hand, and say the Words following, the Steward is bound by the Custom to re-admit her to her Free Bench. Here I am, Riding upon a black Ram, Like a Whore as I am; Andfor my Crincum Crancum, Have lost my Bincum Bancum; Andfor my Tail's Game, Have done this worldly Shame; Therefore, Iprayyou, Mr Steward, let me have my land again. This unattractive slice of country life does not appear in Bailey's Dictionarium Britannicum (1730). 4. Again, it is not surprising to discover that later dictionaries are more scientific than early. Scientific education of the general public proceeded gradually.8 Kersey's entry for abdomen: 'that part of the belly which is between the Navel and the Privities; the lower Belly', may be compared with Johnson's for the same word, quoting a long and technical paragraph of descriptive anatomy from John Quincy's Lexicon Physico-Medicum, using 8 G. S. Rousseau, 'Science Books and their Readers in the Eighteenth Century', in Books and their Readers in Eighteenth-Century England, ed. by Isabel Rivers (Leicester: Leicester University Press; New York: St Martin's Press, 1982), pp. I97-255. 6</page><page sequence="5">CAREY MCINTOSH terms such as 'peritonaeum' and 'hypogastrium'. The following sequence has interest because it incorporates research in biology, reflecting the century's gradual realization that, in spite of what Aristotle and Galen had taught, women (physiologically) are not just smaller men:9 I708: OVARIA (in Anat.) the Testicles of Females. 172 I: OVARIA [in Anatomy] the Testicles of Females. 1751: OVARIA [in Anat.] the Testicles of Females, so named, because they breed a Kind of Eggs. I755: Ovary, The part of the body in which impregnation is performed. 1775: Ovaiy, That part in which impregnation is performed; that part of a flower which becomes the fruit. One consequence of the scientization of western thought was the gradual disappearance of local weights and measures. Most weights and measures began as the names of common objects: foot, grain, yard (in an early sense, 'branch' or 'staff'), ton ('barrel'). The first steps in the quantification of common object-words can be illustrated in phrases such as 'half a head taller' or 'at arm's length'. De-quantification also occurs: a poke was 'a large bag or sack whose size varied according to the quality and weight of the product enclosed'.10 One sack was still in I708 either 364 pounds or 350, and sack was also a measure of volume, three and a half bushels of apples in Kent, four in Worcestershire. The gallon measure used for beer was standardized under Queen Elizabeth; the gallon used for wine was not standardized till I707, but by waiting a century it gained nine cubic inches. We can follow the quantification, de-quantification, and gradual disappearance of local weights and measurements in the dictionaries: 1658 I6761 1708 1721I 755 1775 1780 cark I/30 I/30 1/30 I/30 40 tod sarplar sarplar sarplar sarplar frail 701b basket basket basket basket basket fother 200oolb 20001b 20001b 200olb* - a tun gad 9- -oft 9-I oft wedge Ioft wedge pearch i61ft I6?ft** I6?ft i6?ft yds 5? yds pipe 26gal 26gal I 26gal 62gal 2hogshds 2hgs. 2hgs. sarplar 8otod 8ostone 8otod 40tod -sack tierce I /3pipe 42gal 42gal 42gal I /3pipe I /3pipe I /3pipe tod 2stone 281b 281b 281b 281b*** 281b 281b *'20001. at the Mines 22501. among the Plummers at London I9501.' **or more than 20ft. ***Johnson supplies quotations for gad, pipe and tod from Shakespeare, for tierce from Jonson and Dorset. 9 See Thomas W.

Menston: Scolar, 197 ). 2 7</page><page sequence="6">English Dictionaries and the Enlightenment The imprecisions in this table (e.g., more or fewer gallons in a pipe), and the disappearance of certain measures (e.g., cark, frail) are predictable from our knowledge of the history of science. Less predictable is the durability or reliability of the pearch, the tierce, and the tod. It is noteworthy that seven of these nine measures appear in Phillips (1658) and Cole (1676) in spite of how short those early word lists were (i I,ooo and 25,000 words respectively), and that (except in the case offrail) Johnson includes among his 40,000 words only those measuring terms that he found in literary texts. If we look for the words marked by Bailey with 'C.' ('Country Word') and 'N.C.' ('North Country') in Johnson, we may surmise that it was not only local weights and measurements that Johnson omitted, but local words of all kinds. Though encyclopaedias and dictionaries are now considered to be two different genres - one organizes our knowledge; the other our lexicon - the distinction between them was not clear in the Middle Ages, in the Renaissance, or in the eighteenth century. And, of course, it is still blurry in the twentieth-century American 'college' dictionary, with its bite-size portions of general knowledge, its one-sentence biographies, its illustrations and maps.'2 Thomas Birch, Johnson's friend and grubstreet colleague, co- authored A General Dictionary Historical and Critical in ten volumes (I 734-41 ), 'in which a new and accurate translation of [the encyclopaedia] of Mr Bayle is included': this was a so-called 'dictionary' that resembled an encyclopaedia; and the first edition of the Encyclopaedia Britannica seems very dictionary-like to a twentieth-century reader, with a great many pages devoted to brief entries for 'terms of art' in botany, religion, heraldry, 'sea- language', commerce, rhetoric, agriculture, and mythology.13 Encyclopaedic entries became a feature of English dictionaries in the seventeenth century, when Edward Phillips (i658) added information as a help for reading the classics and literature; Elisha Coles (1676) included proper names (Osselton, p. I946). Ephraim Chambers thought of himself as a 'lexicographer' and referred to his predecessors as 'former Dictionarists' (Preface, p. i). An objective shared by dictionaries and encyclopaedias is pedagogical; and the audience that both genres hope to inform or teach is a (more or less) popular one. Both aim to supply a comparatively unknowing readership with as much advanced and scholarly information as it is looking for. Both undertake to survey the present state of learning: they satisfy a need to self- assess, to take stock of the world of knowledge. D'Alembert's general preface to the Encyclopedie of 1751 announces intentions of summarizing, clarifying, and arranging all knowledge. Cassirer observes that 'for this age, knowledge 12 For full and enlightening information on 'encyclopedicity' in dictionaries, see Henri Bejoint, Tradition and Innovation in Modem English Dictionaries (Oxford: Clarendon Press, 1994), pp. 2 -76. 13 [William Smellie, Colin Macfarquhar, and Andrew Bell], Encyclopaedia Britannica; Or, a Dictionary of Arts and Sciences, 3 vols (i 768-7 ; repr. Chicago: Encyclopaedia Britannica, 1968). 8</page><page sequence="7">CAREY MCINTOSH of its own activity, intellectual self-examination, and foresight are the proper function and essential task of thought'.'4 I suspect that the tendency of dictionaries to take on the functions of encyclopaedias may have gathered momentum after 175 , when the first volume of the EncyclopIdie was published, and may be related to the growth of what we now call science. Though Harris (I704) and Chambers (1728) had demonstrated that there was a good market for encyclopaedias in England, only one of the five 'rivals to Chambers' listed by Frank Kafker was published before I75 , and three of those five appeared in I751-54 (Barrow, Owen, Crocker). George Lewis Scott's two-volume Supplement to Mr. Chamber's Cyclopaedia reached the reading public in I753.15 A measure of the way scientism and encyclopaedism affected dictionaries is Johnson's paragraph on electricity in the first edition of his dictionary. For Kersey, electricity was simply 'the Quality that Amber, Jeat, Sealing-Wax, &amp;c. have of drawing all sorts of very light Bodies to them, when rubbed', and Johnson's definition (attributed to Quincy) is not very different; but immediately following that definition Johnson writes: Such was the account given a few years ago of electricity; but the industry of the present age, first excited by the experiments of Gray, has discovered in electricity a multitude of philosophical wonders. Bodies electrified by a sphere of glass, turned nimbly round, not only emit flame, but may be fitted with such a quantity of the electrical vapour, as, if discharged at once upon a human body, would endanger life. The force of this vapour has hitherto appeared instantaneous, persons at both ends of a long chain seeming to be struck at once. The philosophers are now endeavouring to intercept the strokes of lightning. Surely Johnson's practice of quoting a long, technical analysis (from a recent, respected authority) of the word he is supposedly just defining (e.g., mallows, plant) is related to encyclopaedism and scientism in English dictionaries. Though Johnson's innovations carried lexicography a giant step forward, though Johnson read widely in what we now call science (especially medicine), his Dictionary overall is a curious mixture of old and new. As DeMaria has shown, Johnson 'habitually compared himself' to learn scholar-poets of the Renaissance such as Joseph Scaliger;16 his verbal universe was almost as much Latin as English, sixteenth and seventeenth as 14 Jean Le Rond D'Alembert, Preliminary Discourse to the Encyclopedia of Diderot, trans. by Richard N.

Together with modern, scientific entries like those on electricity, or on misy (illustrated from John Hill's Materia Medica of 1751), we find feudal terms such asfaldage (A privilege which anciently several lords reserved to themselves of setting up folds for sheep, in any fields within their manors') or allodium ('A possession held in absolute independence, without any acknowledgement of a lord paramount'), and rural words not in Bailey (I72 I), nombles ('The entrails of a deer'), noggen ('Hard; rough; harsh'), ped ('A small packsaddle'). One of the most encyclopaedic of eighteenth-century dictionaries is the final form of Bailey's 'Volume II'.17 The first three editions of this 'bookseller's freak' (Starnes and Noyes, p. Io8) were published in I727, I73I, and I737, ostensibly as a supplement to the dictionary of I72I, but also as an independent work and collection of odd words, including cant words and specialized or learned words not included in I721. The 'final form' of this much-revised volume was assumed in 756 (again, perhaps, as part of England's answer to the Encyclopedie) in its fourth edition, re-titled The New Universal Etymological Dictionagy. The New UED, as I beg leave to call it, was re-revised in 1759 by 'Mr. [James] Buchanan' and went through six more editions or issues by 1776. This late spin-off from the Bailey industry (Bailey himself had died in I742) makes a valiant effort to combine the genres of dictionary and encyclopaedia. It has a sprinkling of cuts, for example, to illustrate the coats of arms of the guilds. It omits a great many words (and the cognates of others) that appear in Kersey, Bailey (172 ), Johnson, and Ash. It ignores the conventions that govern length of entries in medium-sized dictionaries, printing a good deal of detailed information on certain subjects, for instance, anatomy; whereas Johnson defines nerve in two short squibs and illustrates it with three short quotations, the New UED offers us twelve paragraphs, listing the different kinds of nerves in the body, cervical, intercostal, and so on. Another form of cross-dressing between these two genres is that the New UED reprints some of Johnson's illustrative quotations (e.g., nestle, nice; see Starnes and Noyes, p. I I5). ii: Changes in Style I have been discussing a few general trends in the content of eighteenth- century dictionaries. It seems to me, however, that what is new and different about the later dictionaries is not only a matter of content but also a matter of form, or rather of style, which in language is usually a mixture of form and content. The way entries were written in the second half of the century reflected changing assumptions about how language can most truly express what is true or important about the world. I shall suggest four approaches to these changes, arranged in order of increasing speculativeness. 17 Nathaniel Bailey, The New Universal Etymological Dictionary, 6th edn (London, 1776). IO</page><page sequence="9">CAREY McINTOSH I. The definitions or entries in later eighteenth-century dictionaries are more 'written' and less 'oral' than those in early dictionaries. I have examined elsewhere, at length, what the evolution of print culture did to English prose in the eighteenth century.18 Here there is room only to sketch some principal features of this change: the move from colloquial language to formal and systematic; from physical to abstract; from less to more precise and differentiated; from informal to correct. My segue from science to print culture is not as abrupt as it may seem, since 'scientization' and the Enlightenment could scarcely have happened without changes in publishing, reading, and writing habits all over Europe. The standardization of weights and measures has close analogues in the standardization of languages.19 The earlier dictionaries are more colloquial in their use of language than the later ones: compare Kersey and Bailey, 'Plunge, to dip over Head and Ears' with Ash on the same word: 'To put under water, to put into any state suddenly, to hurry into distress, to force in suddenly'. The later dictionaries are more systematic and abstract. Kersey writes, 'Oblong, that is of a Figure, inclining to long'; Ash on the same word has: 'Longer than broad, having the form of a parallelogram'. A definition that Bailey adopted unquestioningly from Kersey, 'FASCIAE, [among Astronomers] are certain Rows of Spots in the Planet Mars, which appear like Swathes about his Body', is condensed, corrected, and depersonalized by Ash: 'the belts of Jupiter'. Words and definitions in the early dictionaries reflect a world which was more obviously physical than the world of Johnson and Ash; the early dictionaries confront a 'creatural reality' (it is Auerbach's phrase) more directly than the later ones do. Compare Kersey: 'Pituita, (L.) Phlegm, Snivel, Snot', with Ash: 'Phlegm, rheum'. Kersey defines mucus as 'Snot or Snivel'; Johnson's scientific definition takes place at a level of technicality far above such schoolyard terms: 'that which flows from the papillary processes through the os cribriforme'. Kersey includes 'Buggery, the coupling of one Man with another, or of a Man or Woman with a brute Beast'. Johnson omits the word entirely, and Ash euphemizes it: 'An unnatural intercourse'. Later dictionaries are more precise, make more distinctions, include more different sense of words, and discriminate more carefully among meanings. In general, Kersey (I708) recognizes homonyms but shies away from the task of distinguishing among different senses, for example: 'Bubo, (L.) the Owl, a Bird: Also the Groin [...]: Also a kind of Boil, or Botch in the Kernelly Parts of the Body'. (It is typical of Kersey's not-always-perfectly- organized text that kernelly does not appear in his own dictionary, though kernelled walls have 'Cranies or Notches'.) Here the three different 18 Some of what I say on this topic is drawn from The Evolution ofEnglish Prose, 700o-i8oo: Style, Rhetoric, Politeness, Print Culture (Cambridge University Press, forthcoming 1998). 9 James and Lesley Milroy, Authority in Language: Investigating Language Prescription and Standardization (London: Routledge, 1985). II</page><page sequence="10">English Dictionaries and the Enlightenment homographs spelled 'bubo' are listed seriatim in one entry, separated by colons; elsewhere Kersey describes homonyms in different entries (e.g., budge). Bailey sometimes incorporates several senses of one word in the same entry, and sometimes gives lists of synonyms that encompass more than one sense (Simpson, p. 188). Neither Kersey nor Bailey, however, seems to have appreciated that polysemy (the condition of having different senses or meanings) is a central feature of natural languages. Benjamin Martin's was the first English dictionary (I749) to number senses. Johnson set a new standard for clarity in definitions and for sensitivity to different sense of English words. He is especially good at displaying the different meanings that a common word carries in different contexts. 'Even the simplest and the most monolithic' words, says Stephen Ullmann, 'have a number of different facets depending on the context and situation in which they are used'; 'multiplicity of aspects' is a principal cause of the 'vagueness' of words and of polysemy.20 A good example of Johnson's skills are the seven senses of the noun taste: the act of tasting; the sense of taste; sensibility, perception; the sensation itself, 'intellectual relish or discernment'; a trial (in Shakespeare but 'not in use'); a specimen. To each of these definitions are attached one or more illustrative quotations, which greatly enhance the clarity of the definitions by furnishing a context in which that particular sense makes sense. It would be hard to see a clear difference, for example, between sense #3 of taste, 'sensibility; perception', and sense #5, 'intellectual relish or discernment', without 'I have almost forgot the taste of fears' (Macbeth) for #3, and 'he had no taste of true glory' (Addison) for #5. Not only are later eighteenth-century dictionaries more precise and abstract, they are also more correct than the early ones, in two ways: they prescribe correctness, and they are themselves more correct. People had been talking about 'correcting' the language at least since the I66os, when the Royal Society, or at least several of its members, advocated a national academy like the Academie frangaise. The climate of opinion in the I750s favoured prescriptivism. Johnson's prescriptivism is not as authoritarian or forceful or consistent as it is reputed to be.21 However, most dictionaries after 1755 were enlisted on the side of correctness of some sort. Ash, for example, takes his cue from Johnson in labelling bang, belabour, cajole, conundrum, and doings as 'used only in low or droll style'. The dictionaries themselves, the texts of their labels and definitions, also exemplify the new correctness of English prose of the later eighteenth century. In his definitions Bailey sometimes trips over pronoun reference: 'ABELINS, a sort of Christian Hereticks in Africa, who adopted Sons and 20 Stephen Ullmann, Semantics: An Introduction to the Science of Meaning (1962; repr.

Kersey, too, is sloppy with his pronouns: 'Ploce, [.. .] a Rhetorical Figure, in which a Word is so repeated by way of Emphasis, that it not only expresses the thing signify'd, but also the Quality of it'. Compare the neater, more correctly written definition ofploce in Ash (I775): 'A mode of speech in which a word is repeated by way of illustration and emphasis'. Bailey's definitions sometimes violate rules for parallel construction. In the fourth edition (1728): 'To ABATE [in Law] to come to nought, abolished, quashed or rendred to no effect'. Compare Ash on to abate: 'to diminish [.. .] In law, to defeat, to overthrow'. Or compare Bailey's ungrammatical (and erroneous?) definition of Abelins with Ash's Abelonians: 'A sect of Christians whose distinguishing tenet was to marry and yet live in abstinence'. 2. The definitions and entries in later dictionaries aspire more strenuously to logical form than do those in earlier. That is, they more frequently approximate to the genus-plus-differentiae form that contemporary lexicography still depends on.22 Kersey and Bailey are more likely to define by means of similes or comparisons than Johnson or Ash is. Kersey defines ferret as 'a little Creature like a Weesel'; Ash puts the same animal in a category: 'A quadruped of the weasel kind'. Where Kersey calls on two comparisons in 'Moose, a Beast common in New England, as big as an Ox, and headed Like a Buck', Ash locates his moose in a biological genus and differentiates it from its fellow-members: 'An American beast, the largest of the deer kind'. Linnaeus's major publications were well known in Britain by the I75os. 3. Associated with tendencies towards logical form are syntactic changes, including a tendency to nominalize the definitions of nominals. That is, in later dictionaries the definitions of nouns avoid finite verbs and verbals. Thus, taper in Kersey has three finite verbs: 'that is broader at the bottom, and grows less by Degrees, till it come to the top, like a Cone, or Pyramid'. Taper in Ash has zero finite verbs: 'Pyramidical, conical, regularly narrowed from the bottom to the top'. Thus in Kersey owelty or ovealty is 'an Equality of Services, when the Tenant Paravail owes as much to the Mesne, as the Mesne does to the Lord Paramount'; ovelty in Ash is 'A kind of equality of service in subordinate tenures'. I suspect that here syntax is an expression of the age's growing awareness of the importance not of particular categories but of categorization itself, as a way of'telling the truth': Ash is not interested in what tenants may or may not do under ovelty but in what kind of a thing or condition ovelty is. There is no evidence that the English language began to dispense with finite verbs in the late eighteenth century, but 22 J. R.

I3</page><page sequence="12">English Dictionaries and the Enlightenment nominalization does seem to play a role in general stylistic/semantic trends.23 4. From the reader's point of view, numbering and illustrating senses in a dictionary is primarily a formal change. But polysemy in Johnson's dictionary made it possible to think about language in new ways. In effect, the acuity and many-sidedness ofJohnson's definitions laid the groundwork for new approaches to language, including, of course, historical philology. Johnson's entries, taken as wholes, provide the substance on which some surprisingly modern semantic distinctions can be made. Gene Gragg traces 'the notion of a core or primary meaning which takes on an appropriate, derived or related meaning when transferred from its original domain to another' in Breal ( 897), Sperber (I 923), Bloomfield (I 933), and Ricoeur (I 973), among others; this is Johnson's strategy in organizing entries for polysemous words such as go, more than forty senses of which derive from or are related to sense #i, 'to walk'. Eve Sweetser has legitimized a recognition of the role of metaphor in historical semantics; Johnson recognized, implicitly, that certain sense of words were figurative, for example, sense #7 of taste, above. Elizabeth Traugott has shown that the 'speech-act' sense of some words (e.g., insist) is one of the latest to develop, historically; Johnson's three senses of insist include one that denotes a speech act, 'Not to recede from terms or assertions; to persist in'.24 II: Changes in Categories It has been recognized that the categories we think in terms of are not only 'natural' but also culture-bound and language-specific. Different cultures have different ideas for such seemingly fixed categories as 'green' and 'blue', not to mention 'vegetable' and 'fruit'. Categorization may depend on what we take as prototypical, not on necessary and sufficient conditions, on functional as well as on phenomenal attributes. 'Dirt' and 'chair' are 'cultural kinds'.25 Eighteenth-century dictionaries reflected and propagated a 23 Douglas Biber and Edward Finegan, 'Drift and the Evolution of English Style: A History of Three Genres', Language, 65 (i989), 487-517; Carey McIntosh, 'The Gentrification of English Prose, 1700-I8o0', in Language and Civilization: In Honour of Otto Hietsch, ed. by Claudia Blank (Frankfurt and New York: Lang, 1992), pp. 720-35. 24 Gene B.

Although we trace these changes in classifications for 'terms of art' and in the abbreviations and labels used by dictionaries, they seem related to the gradual metamorphosis of thinking called the Enlightenment. Early English dictionaries routinely listed on the title page a string of fields or disciplines or areas of expertise, promising to explain the 'terms of art' belonging to these fields. Kersey's title-page specifies the following natural sciences: Anatomy, Botanicks, Chymistry, Mathematicks, Pharmacy, Physick, Philosophy [i.e., natural philosophy], and Surgery; non-scientific fields: Divinity, Grammar, Law, Logic, Music, Old Law, Rhetoric; professions or crafts: Cookery, Confectionery, Fishing, Fowling, Gardening, Handicrafts, Hawking, Heraldry, Horsemanship, Husbandry, Hunting, Maritime, Military, Traffick. Bailey's title page almost exactly duplicates Kersey's, with the addition of 'Carving'. If we go back to Phillips (1658), we pick up 'Magick', 'Curiosities', several sciences (Staticks, Dialling, Physiognomy, Chiromancy, Geometry, Astronomy, Astrology, Perspective), and three crafts (Jewelling, Painting, Graving). Additional information about the categories for words in early dictionaries may be derived from the tables of abbreviations commonly found somewhere between the title-page and the first entry in the word list. These represent, of course, the first attempts to 'label' lexemes and to identify register, tasks that lexicographers continue to feel responsible for.26 Besides the foreign languages from which a word may be derived (Latin, French, 'British', Chaldee, etc.), such tables tend to make rough distinctions among regions ('NV.C. North-Country Word') and registers ('H.T. Hunting Term'; 'P.W. Poetical Word'; 'C. Country-Word'; 'Cant Canting Word'). Again, abbreviations in Bailey (1721) follow those in Kersey (I708) very closely. Both employ several abbreviations for words no longer in use, but the only significant descriptor here is 'old': 'O. Old Word'; 'O. P. Old Phrase'; 'O. S. Old Statute'. It is as if words had been conceived of, at least through the first third of the eighteenth century, as belonging pretty securely either in the general pool of ordinary language or in the domain of a specialist, whether theologian or farrier, navigator, chemist, poet, farmer, or thief. All words were either current or 'old'. Less acceptable non-standard locutions could be safely attributed to criminals, rustics, or provincials. Categories and labels in the earlier dictionaries were static and limited in number. The assumption was, presumably, that just as an apprentice farrier gradually learned a finite number of technical terms used in caring for horses, so a student of natural philosophy gradually learned a finite number of technical terms used in 26 R. R. K. Hartmann, 'Theory and Practice in Dictionary-Making', in Lexicography: Principles and Practice, ed. by R. R. K. Hartmann (London: Academic Press, 1983), pp. 3- I.</page><page sequence="14">English Dictionaries and the Enlightenment describing the natural world. Phillips at the head of his word list refers to the fields his dictionary will explain as 'the Arts and Sciences, Liberal; and Mechanick'. The reduction or diffusion of this machinery in Johnson (1755) is quite striking. Johnson's title-page is clean and uncluttered. The old categories have not disappeared, since many of them crop up in square brackets and in comments and labels attached at various places to an entry, but they are attenuated. They seem to have lost their sharp edges. Some of them appear in square brackets as labels: 'to Abate [In common law]'; 'to Abate [In horsemanship]';fill 'Used of a hawk', saucisse 'In gunnery';faldage 'Old Law'; 'To Spoon. In sea language, is when a ship being under sail in a storm cannot bear it, but is obliged to put right before the wind. Bailey'. As this last entry suggests, Johnson borrowed the definitions of some of his terms of art from Bailey. He borrowed others from more up-to-date or scholarly authorities: 'Arbuthnot on Diet' (s.v. Fetor); the name and/or expertise of the authority cited serves as label. By transferring the traditional list of special fields to labels, by multiplying fields, by naming an indefinite number of experts whose authority he is drawing on, and by quoting (an indefinite number of) particular books, Johnson in effect changes the nature of specialized knowledge, or of learning itself: makes it more open-ended, and blurs the distinctions between fields. By naming numerous authorities (e.g., on medicine: Sharp's Surgery, Wiseman's Surgery, Hill's Materia Medica, Quincy, Arbuthnot, James), Johnson implies that no one person or book has all the knowledge his reader needs even from a single field. What seemed in Bailey to be a definite, limited number of fields (e.g., Physick, Surgery) have begun to generate an indefinite number of sub-specialties and an indefinite number of authorities interpreting them. It is not simply knowledge that is changing in Johnson's hands; it is also the perceived attributes of words themselves.27 One senses that by avoiding some of the labels that were standard in I708 and 1721, he is trying to modernize his dictionary. He does not mention forest law in his entry for backcarry or disafforest; he omits the heraldic sense of pile that is prominent in Phillips, Kersey, and Bailey; he refrains from listing the standard cant sense of several standard cant words, cunningman, mort, nick. It is as if he had found the labels in Bailey narrow and confining and decided to make up his own: Enfeoff, 'low Latin'; Blobber, 'A word used in some counties for a bubble'. He mixes diachronics with frequency in his label 'Not in use'. He mixes the 'normative' with the regional when he describes thro' as a 'barbarous provincial word'. Judgements about currency, frequency, and speech 27 For a general model of labelling, see Franz Josef Hausmann, 'Die Markierung im allgemeinen einsprachigen Worterbuch: eine Ubersicht', in Worterbucher Dictionaries Dictionnaires, ed. by F.J. Hausmann, Oskar Reichmann, Herbert Ernst Wiegand, and Ladislav Zgusta, 3 vols (Berlin: de Gruyter, 1989), I, 649-57.</page><page sequence="15">CAREY MCINTOSH communities are combined in his comment on to doff: 'This word is in all its senses obsolete, and scarcely used except by rusticks'. It is in labels that seem to be 'normative' that Johnson is most creative and most unpredictable. In addition to 'barbarous' (wondrous as adverb), 'low' (ding; barley broth; to set by the ears) and 'very low' (yellowboy), he marks some words as 'bad' (fraughtage), some as 'familiar' (door 2.), as 'ludicrous' (deuce, which he spells deuse), 'solemn' (thyself2.), 'inelegant' (to pleasure), or 'not inelegant' (salliance). Never so is a 'solecism'. Johnson recognizes other forms of 'cant' than the argot of thieves: 'medical cant' (nervous 3.); 'the cant of the city' (plum 3.); 'Military cant' (Fascine). Fashionable slang terms are sometimes identified as cant:frowzy, poachy,fun. Many, perhaps most of these labels signify something other than just incorrectness; they express a set of attitudes that is compatible with Johnson's choice of illustrative quotations: literary, cosmopolitan, moralistic, and wary of recent innovations. Nevertheless, Donald Siebert has shown that Johnson was 'surprisingly receptive to post-Renaissance familiar language', including slang from the Beggar's Opera (brimmer, gull, cully, peel, betty), fashionable terms (spark, witling, fribbler, hipps), and London language (bubby, bum, clapt, selling bargains).28 Johnson's immediate influence on the way dictionaries treated categories and labels may be seen in Ash ( 775). On the verso of Ash's title-page is a list of more than a hundred 'Abbreviations', totally reconceived from similar tables in Kersey and Bailey. The words that Ash uses to explain his abbreviations: Arts, Active, Addison, Adjective, Adverb, Ainsworth, Apocrypha, Arabic, Arbuthnot, Article, Ayliffe, Bailey, Baruch, Blackstone, and so on, are, with few exceptions, labels that identify languages, grammatical classes, and authors or books the word may be found in, not terms of art (Architecture', 'Hunting Phrase') or register ('Country Phrase'). In the long run, however, labelling seems to have gravitated to a model less informal than Johnson and more systematic and discriminating than Bailey. The List of Abbreviations in Volume I of the OED, 2nd edn (1989), includes some of Bailey's disciplines, Astrology, Heraldry, Military, Music, Rhetoric, and Theology, plus numerous (modern) sciences; and the labels are less personal than Johnson's: catachrestical, colloquial, dialect, euphemistic, figurative, jocular, vulgar. Surely the Enlightenment was a dominating context for the changes in categories of knowledge and in labelling in Johnson. With the development of the natural sciences, dialling, jewelling, and chiromancy, not to mention magic and 'Curiosities', either faded out or were integrated into other fields. One can imagine that the growth of a general readership, the proliferation of printed texts of all kinds, brought a number of specialized vocabularies into general circulation; they no longer seemed like terms of art (for example, 28 Donald T. Siebert, 'Bubbled, Bamboozled, and Bit: "Low Bad" Words in Johnson's Dictionary', in Studies in English Literature 26 (1986), 485-96. I7</page><page sequence="16">English Dictionaries and the Enlightenment given the new popularity of travel literature, an understanding of ordinary 'Sea terms' would no longer have been restricted to sailors). The old lists of crafts and intellectual disciplines no longer sufficed for an age that required specialized skills from the manufacturers of a pin and had done spadework for the modern disciplines of physics, economics, anthropology, mineralogy, and literary criticism. The 'mechanical' arts were gradually transforming from crafts to technologies.29 This sampling of these dictionaries seems to open up new perspectives on the Enlightenment. During the course of the eighteenth century in England, scholarly prose became more analytical. Not only did the new print culture nourish enlightened minds by facilitating the distribution of information and ideas, as Darnton and Eisenstein have shown,30 it also seems to have changed the way ideas were expressed in English. The new 'writtenness' and logicality of dictionary entries reflected and promoted Enlightenment values of scientism and clarity. Secondly, the evolution of labels and 'Terms of Art' between i658 and 1775 is an index of new attitudes towards language and towards learning. As several scholars have suggested, the later eighteenth century saw a new 'ordering of the arts', and changes in the socio-academic categories used by lexicographers answered to a new orientation of intellectual disciplines and fields of knowledge.3' 29 Larry Steward, The Rise of Public Science: Rhetoric, Technology, and Natural Philosophy in Newtonian Britain, I660-1750 (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1992), pp. 3-27, 173. 30 Robert Darnton, The Literary Underground of the Old Regime (Cambridge, MA: Harvard University Press, 1982; Elizabeth Eisenstein, 'On Revolution and the Printed Word', in Revolution in History, ed. by Roy Porter and Mikulas Teich (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1986), pp. 186-205. 31 See Lawrence Lipking, The Ordering of the Arts in Eighteenth-Century England (Princeton: Princeton University Press, 1970); Michel Foucault, Les Mots et les choses (1966); trans. as The Order of Things: An Archaeology of the Human Sciences (New York: Random House, I970); Robert Flint, Philosophy as Scienta Scientarum and A History of Classifications of the Sciences (Edinburgh: Blackwood, 1904).
