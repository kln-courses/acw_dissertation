<plain_text><page sequence="1">Novum Testamentum XXXIII, 2 (1991) THE SPIRIT AND THE POWER OF JESUS' MIRACLES IN THE LUCAN CONCEPTION by MAX TURNER Aberdeen Traditionally Luke 4:18-21 and Acts 10:38 were understood to imply that Luke thought the Spirit was the power by which Jesus worked his redemptive miracles. But of late most of the more nuanced descriptions of Luke have asserted that he prefers to think of the Spirit as the power of inspired speech, and that he attributes miracles to other sources, typically to b6vaoLtg. This understanding of Luke has been so well received that those passages in Luke-Acts which indeed appear to connect the Spirit with the power of miracle1 have ipsofacto come under suspicion of being 'pre-Lucan.'2 The present article seeks briefly to review the arguments used to support this recent understanding of Luke (part I); and then to assess their validity (part II). Part I There are essentially five arguments for the position that Luke does not think of the Spirit as the power of exorcisms and healings: (1) The main argument can be stated quite simply in the words of E. Schweizer: 'Luke adopts the typically Jewish idea that the Spirit is the Spirit of prophecy....this prevents him from directly attributing to the vEluAoi ...the xapi(xasta r t iaC ov.'3 The Spirit of 1 We use this term pre-critically to denote any powerful manifestation of the Spirit in the physical realm, exorcisms, and charismata other than those of speech/revelation, or ethical inclination. 2 C. Tuckett, 'Luke 4,16-30, Isaiah and Q', Logia: Les Paroles de Jsus-The Say- ings of Jesus (ed. J. Delobel: Leuven: University Press, 1982), 343-54; esp. 347. 3 This 'quotation' conflates what Schweizer says in two separate sections of his dictionary article (one on Jesus' ministry, the other on the Spirit in the church: TDNT 6 (1968) 407 and 409), but remains entirely faithful to his meaning in</page><page sequence="2">THE SPIRIT IN THE LUCAN CONCEPTION prophecy (for Schweizer) means principally the power of inspired insight or speech (glossolalia, prophecy), especially of authoritative preaching,4 and this he sees as fundamentally different from a con- ception of the Spirit as the power to perform miracles and exor- cisms. Seeking to elucidate a similar distinction, Haya-Prats was to claim that Luke associates the Spirit with the realm of the 'intelligi- ble' rather than with the realm of the 'tangible'.5 The way this argument is stated in the literature appears to imply there is a measure of incoherence between the notion of the Spirit as the 'Spirit of prophecy' and that of the Spirit as the power of miracle; and a writer holding one is therefore the less likely to hold the other simul- taneously.6 R.P. Menzies, in an important Aberdeen thesis, has especially developed this last point with detailed argument to the effect that Intertestamental Judaism tended to refer divine Spirit terminology almost exclusively to 'the Spirit of prophecy', and con- sistently distanced the Spirit from the power to work miracle.7 (2) Luke distances tveixia from B6vaOitL, emphasising the latter as the source of Jesus' miracles, and conceiving of it in a magical way as a mana-like substance, or fluid, which can flow from Jesus to heal others (5:17; 6:19; 8:46; cf. Acts 6:8). For Luke 'power' is not a metaphor, 'but is that reality which carries the actual potency of the spirit world into our world'.8 Acceptance of this claim need not of itself distinguish 86va(JtL from xrvveuia, for it has been claimed by Bultmann that Luke was capable of conceiving the Spirit dynamistically as a fluid poured out on people (cf. Acts 2:17-18, 33; and compare the typically Lucan 'filled with' or 'full of' the Holy Spirit),9 and by Schweizer that Luke thinks of the Spirit as a respect of both. TDNT6 (1968) 409 actually by mistranslation ('This does not pre- vent him...' etc.) attributes to Schweizer a view opposite to that of the German original (TWNT 6 (1959) 407).

If this last is right, and we have argued so more fully elsewhere,1' then we should have to distinguish sharply between Luke's thoroughly Jewish pneumatology, and what would appear to be his very dif- ferent, and equally non-Jewish, conception of BuvaotuC. For Judaism divine B6vaL.t.L in a man is typically not an objective 'substance', 'there' in the world, obtainable by specific calculated means, and thereafter at man's disposal, nor an electricity-like potential ready to flash forth from him (or from his corpse) automatically, given the appropriate conditions; it is rather a way of speaking of God's own activity through chosen men.12 If we follow Hull (or rather Preisigke),13 Luke by contrast holds the hellenistic view of 'power'-most obviously in the story of the woman with a flow of blood (Luke 8:43-48), and this has nothing to do with his view of 'Spirit'. (3) Accordingly it is held Luke never directly associates an exorcism or a healing with the Spirit. To quote Schweizer again. Though the miracles are important for Luke, they are never ascribed to the Spirit. Healing power is associated with the name ofJesus, with faith in Jesus, with Jesus Himself, with prayer, with bodily contact through the disciple, his shadow or his 10 TDNT 6 (1968) 407. 11 M.M.B.

Schmitz, 'Der Begriff86uva0Iu bei Paulus', Festgabe Fur AdolfDeissmann (ed. K.L. Schmidt; Tubingen: Mohr, 1927), 139-67, especially 157-159. (For a more nuanced position see W. Grundmann, Der Begriff der Kraft in der neutestamentlichen Gedankenwelt, Stuttgart: 1932; or TDNT 2 (1964) 284-317). Schmitz agrees there has been a slight penetration of Greek ideas in this respect into Diaspora Judaism (see 151 f), especially in Philo's hypostatisation of U6va(tLt, but maintains that Paul's thought certainly belongs in the traditional Jewish category. He is less clear where Luke stands. Grundmann's view is that Luke has hellenised the concept of the Spirit by fusing it with a strongly hellenistic view of Btwvaxpi, especially in relation to Jesus' miraculous conception (see e.g. TDNT 2 (1964) 300-301), but also in that he sees Jesus' power in the Holy Spirit as 'substance'; particularly in 8:46; 6:19; 5:17 (TDNT 2 (1964) 301-302). 13 The description of quasi magical, but divine fluid bvjvaRut in hellenism goes back principally to F.

Though Luke can use B6vaJt.; and iv6pai almost as synonyms,14 the distinction between them is clear at this point. 15 Of course the distinction is not quite that clear, for a number of places-principally 1:17, 35; 4:14; 24:49; Acts 1:8 and 10:38-do appear to offer the terms in a relationship which suggests a degree of synonymy (as Schweizer was prepared to admit). But Menzies has recently argued for a more nuanced position. According to him, even when the two terms are collocated, 'Spirit' and 'power' are never simply synonyms, rather: ...When Luke uses the terms BuvaA.tt and mive,ul together he has in mind a com- bination of prophetic speech and miracles of healing and exorcisms, rather than the separate activities which are normally associated with xvt:iia and b8vae(? [pro- phetic insight or speech and miraculous power] respectively.... In these passages [scil. 1:17; 4:14; 24:49 and Acts 1:8] it is by virtue of its relationship to xv?il.a that 8uvautC; can refer to a broad range of activities including prophetic speech as well as exorcisms and miracles of healing.16 But the point remains that the Spirit is not directly related to the miracles. According to Menzies, the Spirit is directly related only to the phenomenon of prophetic speech, while 'power' is directly related only to exorcisms and miracles of healing. The closest Luke gets to attributing the miracles to the Spirit is that he occasionally protrays this 'power' as derived from the Spirit (e.g. 4:14); but then UVOaLLtt remains the buffer term between them'7 (and by the same token 'power' can also come to expression indirectly in speech acts (Luke 24:49; Acts 1:8 etc.)). Once again, Luke is seen as adopting 'typically Jewish' thinking for, as Menzies points out, in Judaism the Spirit is never directly associated with exorcisms,18 and Josephus (allegedly) has the same indirect relationship between tveo4*a and BvvoatLc (AJ 8.408).19 (4) Luke shifts the logion about blasphemy against the Spirit out of the Marcan and 'Q' context of controversy over Jesus' exorcisms 14 Scil.

He also changes the Q saying 'If I by the Spirit of God cast out demons, then the kingdom of God has come upon you' (so Matt 12:28) by substituting the words 'finger of God' for 'Spirit of God'. The two changes have a single explana- tion: that Luke cannot conceive of the Spirit as the author of exor- cisms, because he thinks of the Spirit as the 'Spirit of prophecy'. Menzies rejects as inadequate the various alternative explanations of Luke's change from 'Spirit of God' to 'finger of God'-whether because Luke could not regard the Spirit as an agent, only as an endowment (so Yates): or (more popularly) to enhance his New Moses and New Exodus Motifs (A. George; J.M. van Cangh; J.D.G. Dunn; etc.)-principally on the grounds that 'a plausible motive for Luke's alteration of Lk 11:20 must also account for this modification of Q [the changed setting of the 'blasphemy against the Spirit' logion] as well'.20 (5) Even Luke's programmatic use of the Q(?) tradition of Jesus preaching in Nazareth is altered to remove the prima facie connec- tion between the Spirit and miracles. Thus Luke has removed the words 'to heal the broken hearted' from his quotation of Isa 61:1-2 at Luke 4:18-21, in order to break the link between healing and the Spirit (so M. Rese),21 and in 4:23-27, 'the miraculous signs men- tioned in the quotation in v. 18 are specifically rejected as manifestations of the Spirit and only authoritative preaching is regarded as a fulfilment of the prophecy' (so Schweizer).22 Part II Before we plunge in amongst the trees of detail, we may perhaps take a provisional glance at the shape of the wood before us. No one disputes that in the apostolic church the Spirit was generally under- stood as the power of both the church's prophetic utterances and its apostolic preaching. But what we are being asked to believe is that 20 Development, 181 n. 326. 21 M.

Such a suggestion should at least provoke a measure of curiosity. Why should Luke revert to a specifically Jewish conception? And, rather more poignantly in respect of Menzies' case, why should Luke drop the general Christian view in favour of a more tradi- tionally Jewish idea, only then to alloy with it a concept that the Spirit is the source of a mana-like power, the very idea of which might be enough to make a good Jew's hair stand on end!? Unfor- tunately explanations are not forthcoming. It is perhaps not impos- sible to believe this hypothesis, but we should ask very carefully whether there is really sufficient evidence to make it probable. Let us look in more detail at the arguments: (1) Did Luke adopt a 'typicallyJewish notion' of 'the Spirit of prophecy'? And would this have motivated him to drop any immediate connection between the Spirit and miracle? We shall begin by dealing with these two closely related questions separately. (A) Did luke revert to a Jewish notion of the Spirit of prophecy? It is certain that some kind of concept of the 'Spirit of prophecy' is important for Luke,23 and obviously this idea of the Spirit is indeed 'typically Jewish' if the alternative is to affirm it is Greek, for the Greeks rarely associated :tve5za with inspired speech; however, Schweizer and Menzies, for example, mean it is 'typically Jewish' in the sense that it contrasts with the pre-Lucan Christian views held by e.g. Mark, Matthew and Paul-i.e. it is especially the power of 23 This has been one of the positive legacies of the scholarship of H. von Baer, (Der Heilige Geist in den Lukasschriften, Stuttgart: Kohlhammer, 1926); G.W.H. Lampe (from 'The Holy Spirit in the Writings of Saint Luke', Studies in the Gospels: Essays in Memory of R.H. Lightfoot (ed. D.E. Nineham; Oxford: Blackwell, 1955), 159-200, to God As Spirit: The Bampton Lectures, 1976, Oxford: Clarendon, 1977), as well as Schweizer, Haya-Prats and Menzies already mentioned. Cf. our own argument for this in Luke and the Spirit: Studies in the Significance of Receiving the Spirit in Luke-Acts (unpublished PhD dissertation, Cambridge 1980), chs. 4 and 5; and also 'The Spirit of Christ and Christology', Christ the Lord (ed. H. Rowdon: Leicester: IVP, 1982) 174-181. 129</page><page sequence="7">MAX TURNER prophetic speech and of authoritative preaching, rather than the power of miracle. But, as we have argued in detail elsewhere, this connec- tion between the Spirit of prophecy and the power of authoritative preaching if anything proves the opposite case: Judaism did not regard the Spirit as empowering this type of speech event, at least not in the way Luke conceives the connection24. In the great majority of cases Judaism portrays the 'Spirit of pro- phecy' as the power of charismatic revelation or wisdom (i.e. an event in the psyche of the charismatic, not a speech event at all): e.g. Moses conveniently sees 'by the Spirit of prophecy/Holy Spirit' that the Egyptian (Exod 2:12) has committed adultery with the Israelite officer's wife; that he intends to kill him, and that none of Egyptian's descendants were destined to be proselytes-so he may be dispatched with impunity (see Codex Neofiti and Fragmen- tary Targum on Exod 2:12 and compare ExodR 1:28; LevR 32:4)! This is entirely typical of how Judaism conceives the 'Spirit of pro- phecy' to work (even if the Spirit is not typically invoked to exculpate biblical 'heroes'): the Spirit of prophecy is primarily the organ of revelation to the charismatic. Of the examples that remain, a proportion pertain to charismatic speech, but this is of three kinds, each clearly distinguishable from what Luke characteristically means by the Spirit as the power of authoritative preaching. First we have prophetic speech which is 'charismatic' simply by virtue of substantially relating the content of some prior prophetic revelation (typical of e.g. the OT prophet who first receives a revelation, then addresses it to the target audience, and of the many occasions where charismatic revelation is subsequently narrated25); second we have 'invasive prophetic speech' in which the Spirit is conceived of as strongly stimulating the speech event and granting some kind of immediate inspiration of its revelatory content, even occasionally overwhelming or eclips- ing the speaker's natural faculties, so that the Spirit is the sole 24 'The Spirit of Prophecy and the Power of Authoritative Preaching in Luke- Acts: A Question of Origins', forthcoming in NTS. 25 The occasions of 'to say...in the holy Spirit' or 'to speak in the holy Spirit' are relatively rare, and when context allows it to be determined, always pertain to 'communication of prophetic revelation' or (less probably) to 'invasive pro- phetic speech', and virtually never to 'preaching'. See e.g. Midrash Haggadol Gen 717 (on Gen 41:38: praisingJoseph's miraculous insight, not his charismatic speech); j.Jom 73b; Siphre Zutta 319, and Targum PsJonathan Gen 30:25. 130</page><page sequence="8">THE SPIRIT IN THE LUCAN CONCEPTION author of the words spoken (e.g. Jub 25:14; 31:12; PsPhilo 28:6; 62:2; Josephus AJ 4.119 and Philo (e.g. Decal. 175; Spec. Leg. IV. 49), and third we have (rather rarely) 'invasive charismatic praise' (e.g. Targum Jonathan on 1 Sam 10:6; 19:20-23; ExodR 23:2). Luke knows of the Spirit as the author of charismatic revelation (Luke 2:26-27; Acts 2:17-18; 7:55; 8:29; 10:19-20; 19:21 and 20:22) or charismatic wisdom (Luke 12:12 (cf. 21:15); Acts 6:3, 5, and 10); he also portrays incidents of prophetic speech (either of 'communication of prophetic revelation' (Acts 7:55-56 and 21:11), or invasive prophetic speech (Luke 1:41, 67; Acts 21:4)), as well as of invasive charismatic praise (Acts 2:4, 11; 10:46 and 19:6), and to this extent he shares important components of meaning with Judaism's concept of the Spirit of prophecy. But these (apart from charismatic wisdom at Acts 6:10) have little directly to do with preaching. Luke does not think of preaching as a series of communi- cations of charismatic revelations, nor as invasive prophecy. For him, it is not primarily oracular speech at all, but a particular type of expository discourse (i.e. a discourse where the speaker evinces his own ordered reflection and deliberate interpretation of religious ideas, whether those ideas were received from tradition, or based in fresh revelation). Authoritative preaching for Luke is a form of charismatic expository address, in which the Spirit is conceived of as working in speaker or hearers (or both) to bring the immediate con- viction that God is at work in and alongside this speech event. Such a view is virtually never found in Judaism, but it was widely held in pre-Lucan Christianity: perhaps most notably in John (3:34; 6:62-63; 14-16) and in Paul (cf. 1 Thes 1:5; 1 Cor 2:4; Rom 15:19), but also beyond them (cf. Heb 2:4 and 1 Pet 1:12). As it is equally clear that in the circles of these writers the Spirit is understood to be the source of charismatic revelation and wisdom (cf. Jn 3:5-15; 4:8-26; 6:62-63; 14:26; 16:13; 1 Jn 4; Rev 1-3; 4:2; 19:10; 1 Cor 2:4-14; 12:8-10; 14 (passim); Eph 1:17-20; 3:15-20), it seems pointless to speak of Luke turning back to a typically Jewish view of the Spirit of prophecy as the power of authoritative preaching. This connection between 'the Spirit of prophecy' and 'authoritative preaching' was clearly distinctively and widely Christian. We shall draw out the significance of this conclusion after the next question has been faced. (B) Is it the case that someone who was inclined to think of the Spirit as the Spirit of prophecy would thereby be motivated to drop 131</page><page sequence="9">MAX TURNER the idea of the Spirit as the power of miracle? The question here is not whether the latter concept is relatively rare. Of course it is- because the issue of the means of revelation and 'wisdom' was far more significant than any theorising about the nature of the power of miracle! We need to beware too of the argument that this or that author prefers to attribute the miracles to faith, to prayer, or to God, rather than to the Spirit. These were not strictly alternatives: thus, for example, Matthew and Mark, who certainly attribute Jesus' exorcisms to the Spirit, can also see faith and prayer as play- ing a necessary part (e.g. Mark 9:29; Matt 17:20), and regard such work of the Spirit as part of the inbreaking of God's reign (cf. Matt 12:28!). The real question is only whether accepting the concept of the Spirit as the Spirit of prophecy leads to elimination of any reference to the Spirit as the power of miracle. Strikingly, those works that had by the far the widest 'reader- ship'-the LXX and the Targums-apparently found no problem in reasserting the OT position that the Spirit was the source of both charismatic revelation and miraculous power. The LXX translators, who have added a couple of references to the Spirit as the author of charismatic revelation (Zech 1:6 and Nu 23:7 [but here duplicating 24:2]), do not shrink from supplying nveu,~a xuptou in all those places where it would have to be under- stood as miraculous power (e.g. Judges 14:6, 19; 15:14), and the parallels in language used suggest the translators took Judges 3:10; 6:34; 11:29; 1 Kingdoms 11:6 (= 1 Sam) etc., in the same way. They could easily have supplied B6voa,ut xup(ou instead if there were a conceptual problem in attributing miracles to the Spirit. Similarly the translators allow that it is the tvsu6jia xuptou that picks the prophet up, or transports him from one place to another (3 Kingdoms 18:12; 4 Kingdoms 2:16; Ezek 2:2; 3:12, 14, 24; 8:3; 11:1, 5, 24; 37:1; 43:5), while at the same time (in some of the Ezekiel instances) as revealing God's message to him. The LXX also seems to go beyond the MT in associating the Spirit with creative activity. The rnn of Gen 1:2 is ambiguous in the Hebrew, and translated 'a wind' in the Targums, but the LXXal rendering rveuFoc O0eo would more obviously be understood as the divine Spirit (compare its use at Gen 41:38, and contrast the expressions in Gen 8:1 or Num 11:31 which might more readily have suggested something other than the divine Spirit). And while in Job 33:4; Pss 103:30, 32:6, and Judith 16:14 the word rcv&amp;pI0 could be taken as 132</page><page sequence="10">THE SPIRIT IN THE LUCAN CONCEPTION divine 'breath' (and so as metonymy for God's word of command), these would certainly have been obvious candidates for clarificatory emendation had there been a problem with associating the Spirit with creative power. The same sort of comments apply rather more forcefully to the Targums, where the translators' 'freedom' regularly makes The Living Bible look stiltedly over-literal. The Targums (for the tradi- tion behind which an early dating seems increasingly attractive) emphatically and regularly identify the Spirit as 'the Spirit of pro- phecy' (rt1l nMr); but that does not lead them to avoid the word rnn in contexts where 'power' is meant; indeed the connection is firmly established by the use of the expression 'Spirit of power' (1r'C rml) not only at TgJonathan Judges 14:6, 19; 15:14, where we might anticipate it in relation to Samson (though even here to the word mri could have been avoided altogether), but also at 6:34; 11:29; 13:25, 1 Sam 11:6 and 16:13-14. In these the meturgeman might easily have substituted either '-Spirit of prophecy' or 'Spirit of wisdom', but did not. Of course the 'power' concerned in these cases need not always have quite the same startlingly 'miraculous' quality the contexts demand for the Samson incidents; but nor is it merely charismatic wisdom and the power of revelation. The Targums can even associate the very term 'Spirit of prophecy' with miracles. We would not expect such a connection, because the col- location 'Spirit of prophecy' semantically focuses the Spirit as the power of revelation. Where some other activity of the Spirit is intended we might expect a different referring expression for the Spirit: e.g. 'Holy Spirit', 'Spirit of the Lord', or 'Spirit of power'. However, at 2 Kings 2:9 the Targumist clarifies that the Spirit on Elijah was the 'Spirit of prophecy', and Elisha duly requests a dou- ble portion of it. And it is then precisely when Elisha divides the waters that the sons of the prophets decide the Spirit of Elijah has indeed rested on Elisha (2 Kings 2:15). Similarly, the Targums appear to have no problem with the concept of the divine Spirit lif- ting a man up, or transporting him from one place to another (1 Kings 18:12; 2 Kings 2:16; Ezekiel 8:1; 11:1, 24; 43:5) and can occasionally even attribute this specifically to 'a spirit of prophecy from before the Lord': e.g. in Ezek 37:1, 'and He took me out by means of the spirit of prophecy, which had rested upon me from before the Lord, and He set me down in the midst of a valley' (and compare 11:24; 40:1-2), even when the MT had attributed this 133</page><page sequence="11">MAX TURNER function to 'the hand of the Lord' and not to the Spirit at all (as at 40:1-2). It might be argued the Targumist viewed all the occa- sions in Ezekiel as visionary phenomenon, rather than real transpor- tation (as must be meant in 2 Kings, and as the Lives of the Prophets understands Ezekiel (3:14)), but not only would such an interpreta- tion be doubtful, it would also miss the point. One would not por- tray the Spirit of prophecy as lifting a man up and carrying him around even within theframework of a vision, if that notion were concep- tually incoherent. We have dealt with the LXX and the Targums first because these were clearly the most influential writings in Judaism. Of the rest we must be brief. For the rabbis the Spirit is undoubtedly 'the Spirit of prophecy', but that does not prevent them from attributing miracle to the Spirit when the biblical context appears to require it (cf. the hilarious discussion in LevR 8:2 culminating in R. Nahman's (pA2) gratuitous proposal that when the Spirit came on Samson he clashed two mountains together as a man might pebbles in his hand). The first century Liber Antiquitatum Biblicarum ('Pseudo-Philo'), which is influenced by rabbinic exegesis, has a clear understanding of the Spirit as the Spirit of prophecy (cf. 9:10; 18:10-11; 28:6; 31:9; 32:14), and yet, according to this book, Kenaz, 'clothed with the Spirit of power' (27:10 = 'Spirit of the Lord' in 27:9), was 'changed into another man' and so struck down a host of Amorites (and similarly Gideon at 36:2).26 WhenJosephus describes certain incidents in which the LXX attributes miraculous power to the Spirit, he tends to omit mention of the Spirit (cf. Judg 14:6//AJ 5.287; Judg 14:19//AJ 5.294; Judg 15:45//AJ 5.301), but as Menzies rightly notes he also omits references to the Spirit as the source of revelatory gifts (e.g. AJ 2.87//Gen 41:38): the important point is that despite book after book retelling Israel's history he has a total of only seven (possibly eight27) references to the divine Spirit in his whole writing.28 One of these seems quite unambiguously to 26 This latter incidence is apparently overlooked by Menzies, Development, 63- 64, when he states there is only one such incident in the whole Palestinian Literature (outside the Targums and the Rabbinic Literature?), that in Pseudo- Philo 27:9-10. 27 In AJ 4.108 the reference to the approaching divine spirit may be to the angel, rather than to the 'Spirit of prophecy' (as Menzies takes it). 28 See E. Best, 'The Use and Non-Use of Pneuma byJosephus', NT 3 (1959) 218-25. 134</page><page sequence="12">THE SPIRIT IN THE LUCAN CONCEPTION portray the Spirit as both the Spirit of prophecy and the power of (punitive) miracle: in AJ 8.408 Zedekiah, throwing doubt on Micaiah's prophecy, urges Ahab to put it to the test, saying, 'But you shall know whether he is really a true prophet and has the power of the divine Spirit (xai toiU 0ou 7rvtjjaToc isXEt Tv 6uva,tv); let him right now, when I strike him, disable my hand as Jadaos caused the right hand of King Jereboam to wither...'.29 Again AJ 8.346 attributes Elijah's power to run with the king's chariot to his ev0eo; -yv61uxvoc, most probably a reference to the Spirit. Philo fre- quently enough emphasises the Spirit as the power of divine revela- tion, and he has made the divine Spirit the power of reason in a strik- ingly original way (cf. Det. Pot. Ins. 80-84; Leg. Alleg. I. 33, 37, 42; Op. Mundi 135, 144; Plant. 18, 44 etc.). This original development may explain his silence on the relation of the Spirit to miracles, and so he comes nearest to exemplifying the hypothesis under scrutiny-but even he allows that the oncoming of the divine Spirit might be attended by quasi-miraculous physical effects (in Abraham's case everything changes for the better, 'eyes, complex- ion, stature, carriage, movement, voice' (Virt. 217)), and it is of course only a brave man who would claim Philo as an exemplar of typical Jewish views of the Spirit. It would appear from this all-too-brief survey, that for a Jew to hold that the Spirit was received as the Spirit of prophecy did not preclude him from attributing miracles to the same Spirit.30 For the Jew, the two conceptions do not appear to have seemed as foreign to each other as they may look to us. Let us now draw together the conclusions from the last two sec- tions. It is maintained that because Luke reverted to aJewish con- cept of 'the Spirit of prophecy' he could no longer follow Mark and Matthew in attributing miracles to the Spirit. This must be rejected on three counts. In the first place Luke's connection of the 'Spirit of prophecy' with the power of preaching means he got his view of both from hellenistic Jewish Christianity, not from Judaism as 29 Menzies, Development, 114, claims Josephus distances the miracle from the Spirit here; but I cannot see how such a claim can be substantiated. 30 Menzies finds it 'significant' that the first century Palestinian Lives of the Pro- phets attributes many miracles to them, but never explicitly traces these back to the Spirit (Development, 63), but that work does not trace the prophets' many visions and revelations to the Spirit either. 135</page><page sequence="13">MAX TURNER such. Second, even in a Jewish environment to view the Spirit as the Spirit of prophecy did not necessarily entail rejecting the Spirit as the source of miracles, far less did it lead to emendation of the tradi- tions which did associate Spirit with miraculous power. Third, this was therefore likely even less to be the case in the hellenistic Jewish Christian circles with which Luke was acquainted. If Mark, Q and Matthew traced the power of Jesus' preaching and miracles to the Spirit (as most appear to admit), and if the Pauline churches too regarded the Spirit as both 'the Spirit of prophecy' and the power of miracles (cf. 1 Cor 12-14; Rom 15:19 etc.), it is difficult to see whence any pressure might have come to bear on Luke to make him dissociate 'the Spirit of prophecy' from the power of miracles, let alone to make him emend those traditions which did associate the two. If Luke distanced the one from the other, the explanation cannot be that culturally the combination was felt to be incoherent. So we must ask whether there is a better explanation. (2) Is it perhaps the case that Luke distanced nvtupia from miracles because he attributed the latter to SuovaotIL conceived fundamentally in magical or manistic terms? We shall pass over the more general and rather unnuanced claims of J.M. Hull to the effect Luke's writings are relatively heavily penetrated by magic31 to his more specific assertion that for Luke 6vqvajqL is miracle-working power, 'a substance, a mana-like charge of divine potency, spiritual in so far as it emanates from the world of spirits, but as actual, as vital as the beings who possess it....'Power'... is that reality which carries the potency of the spirit world into our world'.32 The basic conceptions here are adopted from Preisigke's thesis of a universal pagan popular manistic con- ception of power, which Hull believes explains Luke's material. But Preisigke's own thesis has probably considerably oversimplified 31 J.M. Hull, Magic, 87-115. See the criticisms of his work by J. Achtemeier, 'The Lucan Perspective on the Miracles of Jesus: A Preliminary Sketch', JBL 94 (1975) 547-62 (especially 556-559); H.C.

Sanders and Davies have offered a brief, but apposite response,34 observing (a) that Luke in fact uses sbvax.t polysemously, and that the majority of uses entirely conform in sense with LXXal usages; (b) that of the remaining texts a number might be thought to sug- gest manism-providing they are taken in isolation-but that a manistic explanation is not appropriate in view of Luke's more general understanding of the miracles as acts of God in creation and recreation; (c) that Luke also displays what could be considered as anti-manistic tendencies, thus for example Sanders and Davies comment, 'it is just because this power is not a mana-like substance that it cannot be sold (Acts 8.18)',35 and (d) that even those passages which at first come closest to manistic ideas (Luke 6:19 and 8:46) are corrected in non-manistic ways by 6:18 (the crowd come to hear and to be healed), and 8:48 (referring the healing to the woman's faith in God whose agent Jesus is). Each of these areas of argument deserves much more detailed attention than Sanders and Davies were able to afford within the scope of their work, but if anything they have been more than generous to Hull's sugges- tion. There is really only one passage which links BuvacCiL with con- textual features that might positively suggest a manistic concept (i.e as fluid power, discharging (independently of the wish of the bearer) towards those who deliberately touch 'the vessel' with the 'faith' that this act will ensure transfer)-Luke 8:46-and here the conception is taken straight from Mark! None of these distinctively manistic features is unambiguously present in the other two passages often cited as manistic (5:17 and 6:19) which are as easily interpreted within the dominating framework of Luke's belief that Jesus' miracles are part and parcel of the inbreaking of God's reign 33 Preisigke, Gotteskraft, 210-47. Preisigke artificially forges a unity of concep- tion across material from ancient Egypt to the church of the middle ages. The use of his criteria would inevitably lead to the conclusion that Christians in the Charismatic Movement, who lay hands on others and feel 'electricity' or 'warmth' flow through them, etc., also share that manistic conception (for examples of these and other no doubt typically 'manistic' manifestations of power see J. White, When The Spirit Comes With Power (London: Hodder 1988), 80, 92-94, 195, 203, 217-218). Needless to say they do not! It is a matter of a mixture of metaphor, and phenomenological use of language. 34 E.P. Sanders and M.

Even Luke 8:46, however, is (as Schmitz and Sanders and Davies rightly saw) corrected in the light of 8:48. It is not that Preisigke ignored 8:48 (as those writers could be taken to infer), but that he took Jesus' reported words (i Ticotc aou aiaoxiv a' opEuou e lpfplvrv) to mean merely that the woman is identified as having the 'faith' that Jesus is a source of manistic power.37 Taken in isola- tion from Luke's context that is a possible interpretation. But it is clearly not what Luke intends (nor Mark), which is rather to portray the woman's faith as paradigmatic of saving faith (cf. 8:12, 50), i.e. of faith in Jesus as the emissary of God's reign.38 If there are places in Acts where one might suspect manistic views, perhaps most noticeably at 5:15-16 and 19:11-12, it should be observed (a) that Luke does not attribute the miracles to 6uvaoit; there; (b) he marks those events as unusual (note the ascensive &amp;/=t xai of 5:15 and the explicit 8uvda(eLU...o &amp;ras ruXouaoa of 19:11), and indeed (c) that, in 19:11, Luke attributes the miracles directly to God's activity through the hands of Paul (Auvva&amp;ut; ... 6 Ot6 7xotEti...), and follows with a story designed to eliminate a purely magical understanding (19:13-16). We have to conclude that far from being central to Luke's concept of 86vatltS;, manistic and magical ideas are at most on the periphery, if there at all. We have thus no reason to assume Luke would be liable to divorce Spirit from miracles because of any alleged manistic concept of B6voaL(y as the source of the miracles. (3) Is it the case that Luke never associates e.g. exorcism or healing with the Spirit? No-one doubts Luke believes that Buvaorti enables miracles: that is brought out clearly in 4:36*; 5:17*; 6:19*; 8:46; 9:1*; 10:19*; Acts 3:12; 4:7; 6:8 (asterisked examples involve redactional addi- tion of the word i6vaoit;). It is this very connection which suggests 36 See e.g. A. George, 'Le Miracle', in Etudes (Paris: Gabalda, 1978), 133-48 (especially 147); U.

The difficulty for any form of this hypothesis is that Luke coordinates u6vaoltc and nvutja in a variety of ways that strongly relate them: Luke 1:17, 35; 4:14; 24:49 (referential coor- dination); Acts 1:8 and 10:38. (A) It would not appear plausible to argue that in these combina- tions Uvaoptl; relates purely to miracles and cvi?ua to speech. (i) This would suggest Luke considered John the Baptist to have worked many miracles (1:17), where in fact Luke knows of none, and has Jesus demonstrate he is the Coming One to John's disciples precisely by miracles which presumably differentiate him from their master (Luke 7:21-22); (ii) the division seems impossible at 1:35 where ivtup.a and 8UvaiLL; would appear to offer parallel references to the enabling power of Jesus' miraculous conception; (iii) similarly the division is impossible at 4:14a (certainly redactional) where iv t BuvodIL t 'oU O 'veujoTaroS derives 6vao?ttfrom the Spirit; (iv) the solution quite unwarrantably restricts the topic of Luke 24:49,39 and (v) it would appear awkwardly to distance nve6ua and 86vo.a.t in Acts 10:38 when Luke coordinates them so closely as one single anointing. (B) It is no more convincing to argue that in these combinations t8uvaoit refers to the power of persuasive speech and not to miracles. (i) This suggestion flies in the face of what we know of the colloca- tion pattern in Judaism. Outside Mic 3:8 virtually all occasions where buva0otA and nveu.Aat appear closely collocated refer to powerful or miraculous actions, not to speech (or at least, not to speech alone); cf. especially the not infrequent expression 'Spirit of power' in e.g. Pseudo-Philo and the Targums. And while pre-Lucan Chris- tianity collocated nF.Oir a with iuvaoltl as the power of preaching it was certainly not to the exclusion of miracle; rather a reference to preaching with power of the Holy Spirit would probably be taken to denote power of speech and accompanying miracle unless the lat- ter were excluded (cf. 1 Thes 1:5; 1 Cor 2:4; Rom 15:19). (ii) This view cannot account for 1:35 where no speech seems referred to at all. (iii) It requires an unnatural understanding of 4:14 in view of (i) above, and the fact that contextually the qy'/ (4:14b) of Jesus empowered by the Spirit (4:14a) appears to be based in the miracles he performed (4:23); and that after this, the first references to 39 Contra Hull, Magic, 107. 139</page><page sequence="17">MAX TURNER SvvavtL?

(iv) Similar problems face this interpretation of Acts 10:38 where the reference to Jesus 'anointed with Spirit and power' can barely be related exclusively to preaching in view of (i) above and the immediate clarificatory reference to the healing of those oppressed by Satan (10:38b cf. Luke 11:21-22; 13:16 etc.). (C) Not surprisingly, the most nuanced treatment to date-that of Dr Menzies (outlined above)-forgoes either of the above temp- tations. His hypothesis has the advantage of recognising that only violence can remove a reference to the power of miracle from the redactional+0 Luke 4:14a, and that here, as in 24:49 (and the col- locations of veutiao and u8va.uLL in Acts 1:8 and 10:38), 8uvaoits most naturally refers to a combination of powerful preaching and miracle understood to be afforded by the Spirit.41 As long as we do not try to apply this interpretation systematically to every collocation of nveut.a and BuvoctaC (as Menzies does42) it perhaps provides the least forced reading of the main passages. But if Dr Menzies is right about Luke 4:14a; 24:49; Acts 1:8 and 10:38 what becomes of his repeated assertion that because Luke regards the Spirit as the Spirit of prophecy he necessarily distances the Spirit from miracle which he attributes rather to U6v0atJt? It is no longer easy to see how his affirmation that the Spirit is Spirit of prophecy and the source of BuvaOt.l (which in turn is the source of miracles) differs meaningfully from the simpler affirmation that 'Luke regards the Spirit as both the Spirit of prophecy and the 40 Against Schiirmann's attempts to argue 4:14a was part of a pre-Lucan source see J.

Neirynck; Leuven: LUP, 1973), 203-23. 4' Development, 112-119. 42 This leads to problems at 1:17 and 35: for if, when collocated with 7CVtUia, both 86vae,ti and ivtGuae must refer to a combination of charismatic speech and miracle, Menzies is forced to refer u86vaott in 1:17 not merely to John's preaching but to the infant Baptist leaping in Elisabeth's womb (as the only 'miracle' one can dredge up for the Baptist!); and in 1:35 IveStuat (and 8uvaRt;t?) must be made to refer not just to the miraculous conception of Jesus, but also to charismatic speech-and so predictably to Mary's prophetic utterance of the Magnificat. But Luke does not refer to Mary as endowed with the prophetic Spirit, and, as an answer to Mary's question about how the incarnation can possibly take place, 1:35 cannot naturally refer to such an endowment. 140</page><page sequence="18">THE SPIRIT IN THE LUCAN CONCEPTION power of miracles'. Indeed this hypothesis requires an entirely unparalleled sense for fi B6vaC.Lts To5 viv,oajtoq (4:14a), namely 'the mana-like substance generated by the Spirit', rather than the natural meaning that the unmarked senses of the words would contribute, viz. 'the potency/ability afforded by the Spirit' (as at Rom 15:13). We submit that it is barely credible to assert Luke intended the former, and most unlikely that his readers would infer it. And what, in any case, could such a hypothesis explain? Why should it be thought that Luke's predilection for the Spirit as the Spirit of prophecy would make it any easier for him to countenance this new idea that the Spirit generated a mana-like substance than simply to retain the by-then-traditional Christian view that the Spirit was experienced both as the Spirit of prophecy and as the power of miracles? We are forced to conclude that the 'clear' distinction Schweizer envisaged between avOCaC (as the power of-inspired speech) and 86vai,u; (as the power of miracle) has not actually anywhere been brought to light nor shown to be convincing. And it is perhaps tell- ing that Schweizer himself seems to have abandoned it in his com- mentary when he asserts that Jesus' ' "anointing" with the Spirit can bring about the healing of "all those oppressed by the devil" (Acts 10:38)'.4 The most obvious sense of the redactional expres- sion 'i BuvacIxtI o tO rveucAtato is that the Spirit is the power with which Jesus returns from the wilderness and it stands for a nuclear sentence such as s'o tvOiac (mv)ouvauot o ' ov (= T6v 'ITouv)-in which case (given the denotation of buva0ot; here must include miracles as well as powerful speech) we simply cannot say Luke dissociated the Spirit from Jesus' healings and exorcisms. Once drop Schweizer's hypothesis that Spirit and buivalAt; are exclusive alternatives to explain Jesus' miracles and the remaining collocations of =v5u.la and B6vao(LL provide few further problems: (i) In 1:17 the addition of xat Buva&amp;le straightforwardly qualifies John's walk in the Spirit as a powerful one (without indicating how the Spirit's power is evinced beyond saying that it will promote repen- tance (1:17b)). (ii) In 1:35, in the evident parallelism between tvF.ia a&amp;ytov tXEk6cralt fst as and u6vaocut; uiatou 7CrLaxtiaol aot, the Buvao(LLC 6uJoou can be recognised as a co-referential expression for veioa ayLov, elucidating that the Spirit is the new creation/resur- 43 The Good News According to Luke (London, SPCK, 1984), 82. 141</page><page sequence="19">MAX TURNER rection power of God (cf. Rom 1:3-4; Acts 13:32-33 etc.). Indeed, it is virtually impossible here to avoid the conclusion that Luke (or his source) identifies the Spirit as the power of Jesus' miraculous conception,44 and this recognition makes it all the more difficult to claim he later dissociates the Spirit from the power of miracle with- out resorting to the implausible ruse (pace Conzelmann) of totally dissociating Luke from Luke 1-2! (iii) Similarly 4:14 no longer poses a problem: Jesus returns to Galilee 'empowered by the Spirit' and we need not artificially exclude either preaching or miracles from the denotation of 6uvaaVtq when the cotext appears to imply both (4:16-30 for preaching; 4:23, 36; 5:17 etc. for miracles). Finally, (iv), at Acts 10:38 we can allow that Jesus is anointed with just the one chrism widely known to pre-Lucan Christianity-the Spirit that empowers both proclamation of good news of peace and liberating miracles-not with two separate powers or an erstwhile unheard-of chrism of Spirit which affords mana-like power. (4) Is the best explanation of Luke's changes in Luke 11:20 and 12:10 that he cannot associate the Spirit with exorcisms because he views the Spirit as the Spirit of prophecy? This may be doubted. Indeed, one hardly needs at all to 'explain' why Luke has preferred not to set the logion about blasphemy against the Spirit in its Marcan or Q context. Unless we care to posit that there was a continuing and lively history of accusation against Jesus and the early church that their powers of exorcism were demonic, the say- ing was better freed from the particularity of the Marcan and Qset- ting if its relevance to the church was to be perceived. By placing it where he has Luke has indicated that the danger of blasphemy against the Spirit cannot be confined to the question of attributing Jesus' exorcisms to evil powers: it is present where the disciples encounter 'persistence in consummate and obdurate opposition to the influence of the Spirit which animates the preaching'45-a not 44 Menzies' case that Luke has added the reference to buvaptL here so that he can attribute the miraculous conception directly to 'power', and only indirectly to nveu.ta (which he associates rather with Mary receiving prophetic power) if ingenious is nevertheless special pleading (Development, 115-116). Why should the angel mix an irrelevant promise of a prophetic gift to Mary with his direct answer to her question as to how the Son of the Most High can be born to her (1:34)? 45 So Fitzmyer, Gospel, 964.

Menzies claims that only this second view adequately explains the difference between 'a word against the Son of Man' and 'blasphemy against the Spirit' (i.e. the first is committed by non- believers, the second by Christians) and that 12:8-9 demand 12:10 be taken as a warning to Christians. But 12:8-9 stresses the significance of everyday discipleship (as Mark 8:34-38); and in this setting 12:10 sharpens the issue of rejection of the Gospel. A trial scenario only first appears in 12:1 If, and a dire warning to believers not to resist the prompting of the Spirit in such circumstances could only be inferred if 12:10 followed it. Luke nowhere else suggests believers are liable to 'resist' the promptings of the Spirit and thereby fall into eternal danger, but it is a major motif of his work that unbelieving Jews do so (Acts 7:51; cf. 28:25-27): their unbelief often turns to malicious opposition (Luke 22:65; Acts 13:45; 18:6), and threatens precisely to cut them off from the 'people of God' (Acts 3:25). 47 C.K.

This, however, has been shown to be wrong by A. George who pointed out that Luke 21:15 has rephrased the Marcan logion (13: 11) about help from the Spirit in time of trial and excluded any explicit reference to the Spirit (contrast Lk 12:11-12).54 According to Menzies, Luke's Mosaic Christology is not enough to explain the change in 11:20 and the real motive for it is that Luke is trying to substitute a new referent as the power of exorcism because he cannot attribute this to the Spirit. But where is the evidence the change in referring expression from ,ve4uaJlt O ou to BaxxruXc OeoU implies a change of referent? In the only other place he has substituted alternative expressions for the Spirit (Luke 21:15 = Mark 13:11) Luke clearly still believes they refer to activities per- formed by the Spirit-that is convincingly demonstrated by the way he combines the wording of the promises in Luke 12:11-12 and 21:15 in his description of Stephen in Acts 6:10.

But we do not know this, and have so far discovered no evidence that makes it probable Luke's understanding of the Spirit as the Spirit of prophecy required him to dissociate Spirit from miracles; rather to the contrary. Luke 11:20 then appears itself to be the principle evidence on offer that Luke cannot associate the Spirit with exorcisms. But why should he not? There is little apparent 'incoherence' between the Spirit of prophecy and the power of exorcisms when it is allowed that the earliest Christians regarded the latter not as an encounter between bearers of different levels of mana-like charge, but as an authority struggle between per- sonal beings. And the exorcisms were accomplished by authoritative words of command, not the transfer of fluids (program- matically in Luke 4:36; cf. 8:31-32 etc.). It was recognition of this which led von Baer (who more than any saw the Spirit as 'the Spirit of prophecy' and the power of authoritative preaching) to believe Luke attributed exorcisms (and miracles) too to the Spirit.56 Menzies57 points out that Judaism did not attribute exorcisms to the Spirit, with the inference that Luke's 'Jewish' view of the Spirit of prophecy would naturally exclude it too. But, as we have argued above, Luke did not get his view of the Spirit of prophecy from Judaism; he got it from the church where the same Spirit was also considered the power of Jesus' exorcisms. The case of Schweizer, George, Haya-Prats58 and Menzies that Luke effected the change to Baxxru6X 0OwU in order to avoid attributing the exorcisms to the Spirit invites the good Scottish ver- dict 'Not Proven'.

The former is much more specific to Luke's concern to portray Jesus as the Mosaic Prophet and the church as the true disciples of Moses-a concern which is central to Luke's whole purpose in writing59 and so provides the most plausible motive for Luke's change. (5) Does Luke's handling of the Tradition about Jesus' preaching in Nazareth (Luke 4:16-30) suggest that he distances miracles from the Spirit? This is a complicated passage which has already spawned a very extensive secondary literature, but for the purposes of this paper our attention focuses briefly on three points:60 (A) It is alleged by M. Rese,61 G.J. Haya-Prats62 and R. Menzies63 that Luke has introduced three changes into the quota- tion of Isa 61:1-2 in order to focus the Spirit as the power of Jesus' preaching and simultaneously to eliminate reference to miracles from it: (a) He has eliminated Isaiah 61: d (d&amp;aoOt Tro'u oeuvrTpitlplvouc tj xap8oa) to remove any connection between physical healing and the Spirit, (b) he has changed the LXXal xaXkLat for x7puiEat to emphasise the Spirit's anointing is for pro- clamation, and (c) he has introduced the clause &amp;7ro=aTXact TpuopaupLvouq iv &amp;piart from Isa 58:6 for its suggestion of forgiveness of sins. These arguments are not persuasive. In the first place it is not obvious that Luke is responsible for any of the changes alleged, for there is clear linguistic and conceptual evidence the pericope is pre- Lucan,64 and nowhere else in Luke-Acts is there a mixed citation as here.65 But let us allow (for the sake of the argument) that Luke 59 See inter alios R.

With respect to (a), the suggested motive for the deletion of Isa 61: id is entirely implausible: the sort of 'healing' required by those who are uovre'pt.itvot f' xotapBi is not literal bodily healing at all- per contra, for such as these the balm of Jesus' Spirit-anointed preaching might be considered especially appropriate! Menzies66 tries to restore Rese's case by arguing that for Luke uto[xaa had become a technical term for physical healing, and so he had to excise it here in order to safeguard the Spirit as the Spirit of prophecy. But where has anyone who frequently uses a common word with its literal sense thereby become less able to distinguish (and less prone to use) its metaphorical senses? Luke must have been fully aware that no native speaker could possibly misunderstand i&amp;aaaotal Tou cuvT6xpAL4t vou; Vq xapSia as 'to heal the sick (who happen to be broken hearted because of their illness?)' unless as a mediocre joke, and indeed Luke himself plainly uses the verb metaphorically in Acts 28:27. With Bock, I do not think we really know why Luke removed Isa 61: Id (if it was he who excised it at all);67 but a motive as unlikely as the one suggested is not to be preferred to agnosticism. It would almost be more convincing to argue the opposite case, namely that Luke deleted the line here because it plainly referred to merely metaphorical healing, and he intended to apply the Isaiah quotation to literal healing (cf. 7:21f)! With respect to (c) the case is no more convincing. It is perfectly true that elsewhere in Luke-Acts 4cEato always refers to forgiveness of sins. But Luke cannot have added Isa 58:6 to the Isaiah 61:1-2 citation in order to emphasise that point. In order for &amp;peat; to carry that sense it must be collocated with &amp;aiapxtcjv (as indeed it always is in Luke-Acts outside 4:18-19).68 Collocated instead with ao%- XLaxc,Tot? it can only mean 'freedom', 'liberty'; and the same per- tains in the sentence &amp;7oioroT t reOpaui.ivouS^ v &amp;pla6t.

It follows from these observations that Luke (or more probably his source) added Isa 58:6 to stress the theme of Jesus- Liberator, and to clarify that he does not merely announce mes- sianic Liberty (as the use of Isa 61:1-2 alone might suggest) but also effects it.71 And as (for Luke) that liberation plainly includes heal- ings and exorcisms, the change in no way distances the Spirit from the power of healing and exorcism. With respect to (b) we need not demur. But the change in no way distances the Spirit from the power of miracles. Indeed, as Marz argued, Jesus is usually portrayed as effecting liberating miracles and exorcisms through a word of command, a speech-act.72 Menzies73 counters that Luke does not always attribute Jesus' heal- ings to a specific command (e.g. 6:19). That is true, but it remains the case he does typically so-programmatically at 4:35-36 and then regularly thereafter e.g. 4:39 (the speech-act redactionally added, as at 18:42); 5:25; 6:10; 7:7, 14 etc.), and these mentions are ten times more frequent than any possibly 'manistic' alternatives. In defence of his view that the Spirit is not connected with healings and exorcisms, Menzies goes on to affirm that these words of com- mand of Jesus are not specifically traced to the Spirit. He is of course right, but then which of Jesus' words are specifically traced to the Spirit? And will any reader really be expected to infer that 69 For the semantics of this see P. Cotterell and M. Turner, Linguistics and Biblical Interpretation (London: SPCK, 1989), ch 5, especially 135-39. 70 See especially J.-W. Taeger, Der Mensch und scin Heil (Giitersloh: Mohn, 1982). 71 As we have argued earlier: e.g. Tyndale Bulletin 32 (1981) 20-22. Bock, Pro- clamation, 111, suggests the addition clarifies that Jesus is not merely a prophetic figure (cf. Isa 61) but a regal one; but the connections between Isa 58:6 and kingship are less than apparent. 72 C.-P. Marz, Das Wort Gottes bei Lukas (Leipzig: St. Benno, 1974), 39; and compare J.N.

None of the changes introduced is well explained by the hypothesis that Luke made it because he could not attribute miracles to the Spirit. Ultimately such a hypothesis would require that Luke took the Isaiah quotation metaphorically, and in no way to pertain to physical healing. This is impossible. The words xal u,Xo6T &amp;va3pXeLtv (4:18) are plainly taken literally at 7:21 in Luke's redactional addition xxal TucXoT lWoXXoc Xappoarco [PXtitv which is then interpreted as a fulfilment of Isa 61:1 in Luke 7:22 (Q). The literal reference of these words of Isaiah 61:1 is also highlighted by Luke's redactional addition of the word of command &amp;va&amp;pX),ov in the healing at Jericho (18:42). (B) Schweizer allows that Luke 4:18 refers inter alia to miraculous healings, but implies that Luke later dissociates the Spirit from these physical referents by making Jesus announce fulfilment of the Isaiah passage (4:21) without signs (cf. 4:23). This indeed shows that the messianic liberation Jesus announces cannot be confined to healings and exorcisms, and may be present where they are not. But in no logical way at all can it serve to show that where healings and exorcisms are present these should not be attributed to the Spirit. Per contra, the admission that Isa 61:1-2 refers inter alia to miraculous healings means that the Spirit with which Jesus is anointed is programmatically related to Jesus' miracles and exor- cisms. Schweizer is aware that Luke 7:21-22 may constitute a problem for his view, but infers that that situation is different because Jesus does not there explicitly trace the fulfilment of Isa 61:1-2 to the Spirit.74 But if Luke has made the point that Jesus' anointing with the Spirit enables him to effect the messianic liberty of Isa 61:1-2 at 4:18, why should he be expected to repeat it at 7:21- 22? Such a pedantic repetition would be unnecessary and unparalleled (as well as awkward to introduce). (C) Tuckett also accepts that Luke 4:18 refers to miraculous acts of liberation, but argues this is not typically Lucan,75 and so evidence he is using a source (Q). He thinks Luke has used the tradition in its programmatic position simply for its mention of Jesus anointed 'to preach good news to the poor', and its inclusion of 9c&amp;otC (which 74 TDNT 6 (1968) 407 n. 484. 75 Tuckett, Logia, 346-51. 149</page><page sequence="27">MAX TURNER Luke, according to Tuckett, would understand as forgiveness). The rest of the quotation he merely tolerated for the sake of those expressions. Tuckett's point is partly that the various clauses of Luke 4:18 (with the exception of 'to preach good news to the poor') are not given special emphasis elsewhere in the Luke-Acts. Thus, Luke does not particularly emphasise that Jesus brings blind people to see, whether literally or metaphorically (Tuckett appears to overlook the redactionally important 7:21 and 18:42f. which focus the healing of the blind as specific fulfilment of the Isa 61 pro- phecy). Similarly Luke does not tend to present people as literally 'liberated' (&amp;9er0t1), whether politically or from prison, nor markedly to aver they are liberated from Satan (for Luke does not emphasise exorcisms more than his sources), nor to portray men as 'prisoners' of sin and 'oppressed' by it. We agree with Dr Tuckett that Luke was using a pre-Lucan tradition that included the Isaiah quotation. But it may be ques- tioned whether 4:18 is really so poor a reflection of Luke's own view. Granted, perhaps, that Busse76 over-pressed the evidence in the other direction, Tuckett's position appears to swing the pen- dulum too far back. The question is not, after all, whether Luke would freely have composed the elements of 4:18 if he himself were creating a summary of Jesus' ministry; it is simply whether he con- sidered Isaiah 61:1-2 (and 58:6) a 'fitting' summary for the whole of Jesus' ministry (including miracles and exorcisms), or whether, instead, he had to read it as little more than a promise that Jesus would preach 'good news' and bring forgiveness (= aceato) of sins. We have argued above that this last is linguistically most implausible, and that the acpEat in question must be 'liberation' of some kind. Tuckett considers such a meaning non-Lucan on the grounds that the evangelist has not emphasised any one particular kind of 'liberation', and so does not conceive of the Gospel as about 'liberation'. It is, however, abundantly clear that Luke believes the Gospel is about 'salvation', and as 'liberation' is evidently a partial synonym for this, it would seem to provide a perfectly adequate alternative to summarise the content of Luke's Gospel. We do not need to pin down the variety of ways in which Luke considers the Gospel to 'save' or 'liberate' men and women (far less to limit it to one!); the question now simply becomes whether or not Luke 76 U. Busse, Wunder. 150</page><page sequence="28">THE SPIRIT IN THE LUCAN CONCEPTION regards miracles of healing as prototypical examples of such 'libera- tion' and of the semantic extension of the remaining clauses of Lk 4:18. We should not demand Luke have more miracles or exorcisms than Mark before it may be allowed he regards the ones he relates as specific instances of acpaty, the freeing of the oppressed, as Tuckett requires. As we have seen above, Luke does indeed regard the miracles he adds redactionally at 7:21 as prototypical examples of the fulfilment of Isa 61:1 which he quotes in 7:22, and the tradi- tion in Luke 13:10-15, which describes a woman's illness in terms of Satan's bondage from which she should be 'freed', comes as close to saying she was 'oppressed by Satan' and needed acpyat as one could hope to find. While we agree with Tuckett that Luke does not equate all illness with demon possession, that does not mean that he rejected the more general and traditional view that Satan was (directly or indirectly) the cause of illness,77 and arguably he could have found the language of 'liberation of the captives' and 'setting free the oppressed' good metaphors for healing even if he had not believed Satan was the spiritual cause of disease and calamity. Acts 10:38 suggests, however, to the contrary, that Luke did attribute illness (in some generalising way) to Satan, and that he saw Jesus as a liberator from such affliction (inter alia, and if not yet univer- sally so). Schweizer and Tuckett, of course, dismiss Acts 10:38 as 'traditional', but little argument is offered for this except that it does not conform with Luke's view of the Spirit as the Spirit of pro- phecy, and Luke does not emphasise exorcisms and miracles as liberation from the Satanic realm and influence. We may, however, fully admit Luke does not especially emphasise that belief without accepting that it was 'non-Lucan' in the sense that he would either have rejected it or played it down. Per contra, it could be argued that the Lucanisms and the very marked parallels between Luke 4:14-21 and Acts 10:35-38 more strongly suggest it was Luke himself who shaped the latter78 to highlight Jesus as the one anointed with the Spirit to bring the messianic liberation earlier announced program- matically in the Nazareth pericope. We are not convinced by Dr Tuckett's evidence that Luke 4:18- 19 and Acts 10:38 are out of harmony with Luke's own view of the Spirit on Jesus. Indeed if we are not prepared to take these two 77 Cf. E. Yamauchi, 'Magic', 89-185. 78 For the argument see Turner, Tyndale Bulletin 32 (1981) 22-25. 151</page><page sequence="29">MAX TURNER passages seriously as indicators of Luke's understanding of the Spirit on Jesus it may be questioned whether we shall be able to discern it anywhere else. To be fair to Dr Tuckett, it is clear that the main reason for his affirmation that Luke 4:18 and Acts 10:38 do not represent Luke's view, but that of his sources, is that he starts with Schweizer's assumption that for Luke the Spirit is the Spirit of prophecy, and so is unlikely to be related to miracles. There are two problems with this. First it requires projecting Luke's view of the Spirit on the disciples in Acts onto Jesus, when Luke himself gives sufficient markers that Jesus' experience of the Spirit had uni- que elements (1:35; 3:21-22; Acts 2:33 etc.).79 Second, it assumes that Luke had a 'Jewish' idea of the Spirit of prophecy, and that this excluded the Spirit as a possible source of healings and exor- cisms. This the rest of the paper has sought to question. In sum, we have argued that Jews who viewed the Spirit as the Spirit of prophecy did not for that reason eliminate the connection between Spirit and miraculous power; that in any case Luke received his view of the Spirit as the Spirit of prophecy from Chris- tian circles already all but universally committed to the view that the Spirit was experienced as the Spirit of prophecy, the power of preaching, and as miraculous power of e.g. healing and exorcism. Luke has not significantly departed from this, and associates the Spirit with such power at Luke 1:35; 4:14; 4:18-19; 24:49; Acts 1:8 and 10:38. 79 See Turner, Tyndale Bulletin 32 (1981) passim. 152</page></plain_text>
