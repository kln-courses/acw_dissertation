The following discussion, by necessity limited in its scope, is divided into major types of signification these and other doors and gates have: functional, sexual, social, religious and political. 2. THE DOOR AS A MEANS OF DEFENSE Before considering its diverse symbolic meanings, one should remember that a door is usually a functional object: 'A movable barrier of wood or other material . ..', according to a dictionary [3]. The function of doors is strongly expressed in such styles as Art Nouveau (for example, C. R. Mackintosh's 'Door to the Room de Luxe of the Willow Tea-Rooms' (1904) [4, plate 41]) and Art Deco (for example, Jean Fig. 1. Lorenzo Ghiberti. 'The Doors of Paradise' of the Baptistery, Florence, Italy, bronze, 4.8 x 2.6m, about 1452. 1. INTRODUCTION This paper's purpose is to examine and clarify the multiple meaning of doors and gates in the visual arts. Signs and symbols are important vehicles of artistic expression of both a culture and an individual's psychology. Doors and gates have served as favourite sources of symbolization in the visual arts and in numerous literary and religious works. I have discussed the signification of walls, another class of a frequently used sign, in an earlier article in Leonardo [1]. A noteworthy door in Europe is the East Gate, called the 'Doors of Paradise', of the Baptistery in Florence by Lorenzo Ghiberti (1452) (Fig. 1). In the Middle Ages doorways in churches attracted numerous artists. Examples among these are the main portal (1164) of the Cathedral at Chartres [2, plate 38]; the bronze doors made for the Bishop Bernward at Hil- *Psychologist, Dept. of Education in Technology and Sci- ence, Technion, Haifa 32000, Israel.

Dunand's lacquered cabinet, exhibited in 1925, whose doors are decorated by Jean Lambert-Rucki's psychedelic dog and hedgehog [5, plate 241]). A splen- did collection of Art Nouveau style gates, doors and doorways appears in Ref. 6. It is with the function of 'movable barrier' in mind that other connotations must be viewed, and it is also this function that endows doors with an ambivalent meaning, for they are both barriers and means of admittance. Although they imply that passage is possi- ble, it is by no means certain: The door that is open today may be shut tomorrow. This ambivalence is further enhanced by the fact that, while a closed door provides defense, its very existence implies a potential for danger when open. A vivid example of the defensive function of doors is to be found in M. Chrichton's dramatization of the widely known Ibn Fadlan manuscript [7]. There the narrator explains why the Northmen had especially low doorways: 'If we are attacked, a single warrior may remain inside the house, and with his sword cut off the heads of all who enter. The door is low so that heads will be bent for cutting.' Remnants of more ancient Aegean gates indicate that they were designed so that the entrance was around corners, in order that attack- ers could be flanked. Among visual artists it was Rene Magritte who made a clear statement with regard to the dual character of doors. Referring to his 'La Reponse imprevue (Fig. 3) he wrote: '... it gives the solution to the problem raised by the Door by showing what it is: an opening ...' [8]. Magritte wrote similarly about his 'La Perspective amoureuse' (1935): 'This closed door is nevertheless open. An opening permits to pass through it as through an open door ...' [8]. The merging of indoors and outdoors, as well as their indeterminacy, is also the subject of his 'Le Poison' (1939), 'Germaine Mallens' (1962) and 'L'Enfant retrouv6' (1966). In Biblical times a city gate was so important that when speaking of a city's defense or its destruction, gate came to mean the city itself. This is a militarily sound metaphor, for those who controlled the gates, control- led the city. The Romans elaborated on this metaphor and placed heavy emphasis on its duality in the cult surrounding the two-faced god Janus. Many ceremonial gateways were built in Rome; the best-known was Ianus Geminus, a rectangular bronze structure at the north side of the Forum, with double doors at each end. When Rome was at war, the doors were open; when at peace, the doors were closed. 3. SEXUAL SYMBOLISM Among the numerous significations of doors, there are those in the realm of sex and anatomy. Analogies between openings in the human body and in the physical surroundings are encountered frequently in diverse cultures. While S. Freud was opposed to any precise designa- tion of sexual or other symbolism, he stated in his Interpretation of Dreams, that 'penetrating into narrow spaces and opening closed doors are among the com- monest sexual symbols' [9]. Indeed, long before Freud, the sexual signification of doors and keys was taken for granted, for example in the Song of Songs (4:12-16 and 8:9) and in such medieval allegories as 'Li Fablel dou Dieu d'Amours' and 'The Romance of the Rose'. Salvador Dali, an admirer of Freud, has made paintings based on Freud's psychoanalytic hypotheses; for exam- ple 'The Anthropomorphic Cabinet' (1936) shows a woman whose body consists of drawers, with the drawer corresponding to her loin having a keyhole. He has stated that 'The human body ... is full of secret drawers that only psychoanalysis is capable of opening' [10]. Another door-related symbol, the key, appears in many of his paintings, for example 'The Font', 'Mem- ory of the Child-Woman', 'Surrealist Poster' and 'Soft Alarm Clock'. Fernand Leger painted numerous key- compositions and among them is 'La Joconde aux cles (1930), about which A. Verdet wrote: 'It indubitably also constitutes a subconscious although positive sym- bol of an open sesame in the mind of the artist as creator' [11]. One aspect of these analogies is illustrated by St. Paul's architectural imagery of body orifices in the New Testament of the Bible and by the frequent anthropo- morphic interpretations of cathedrals [12]. An analogy between a house and the human body is pointed out by Freud in the Introductory Lectures on Psycho-Analysis [9, vol. XV, pp. 153-159], and in V. Nabokov's Lolita [13] there is a description of a 'raped little table with its open drawer, a key hanging from the lock ...'. Poetic lines such as 'Here's the way, bar not the door' [14] and 'Thus Damon knocked at Celia's door, / He sighed and begged and wept and swore ...' [14, p. 23]; 'I saw no coach before her gate, / But at her door I heard her moan ...' (said about a spinster [14, p. 50]) are in no need of clarification. 203</page><page sequence="3">Michael Moore 4. SOCIAL ASPECTS Through the access that doors provide they take on pervasive social significance. It is debatable whether this aspect is truly independent of the sexual one. It has been claimed that in some cultures the first barrier that a human meets is the parents' closed bedroom door; for example in J. Heller's Something Happened [15]: 'Maybe it was the day I came home unexpectedly ... and caught my father in bed with my mother that left me with my fear of doors, my fear of opening doors and my suspicion of closed ones.' (For other reactions to this situation, see Freud's From the History of an Infantile Neurosis, Ref. 9, vol. XVII.) Humans as social animals are in need of companion- ship. Often the need is blocked as indicated by Mrs. Yeobright in Thomas Hardy's The Return of the Native: 'He is at home; and yet he lets her shut the door against me!' [16]. At other times satisfaction of the need is unhampered. Thus Strindberg wrote in 'Jacob Wres- tles' about his urge to enter the Pantheon, with its 'great gate open, crying out an invitation to me, Come in' [17]. This social analogy lies behind the expression 'open- door policy'; this is what Maupassant's hero has in mind when he says: 'All hands and arms are held out to me. All doors and hearts are open to me' [18]. The hero of H. G. Wells' story 'The Door in the Wall' [19] is haunted by the childhood memory of a door leading to an enchanted garden. When he saw it later in his life, he did not go through it: 'My grip was fixing now upon the world. I saw another door opening-the door of my career.' Kafka's writings present many such socially signi- ficant doors, some of them invitingly open, some cruelly shut, some brutally forced open, while to others the key is lost [20]. A further important literary source of social doors is another existentialist, J. P. Sartre, many of whose stories revolve around this concept. His heroes, one after another, are struggling behind closed doors, alone, frightened, abandoned [21]. Among the visual artists there were two surrealists who similarly depicted the social significance of doors. Dali in 'Gala and the Angelus of Millet Immediately Preceding the Arrival of the Conic Anamorphosis' (1933) and Magritte in 'L'Espion' (1927) both solved the problem of separation caused by doors by depic- tions of eavesdropping and of spying through a keyhole, respectively. 5. RELIGIOUS ASPECTS The primal character of gate symbolism for indi- viduals is paralleled by its fundamental significance for groups. A striking illustration for this is that complex human institution, religion, in whose terminology and rituals gates and doors appear with a surprisingly great frequency. In Christian art [23] (with reference mainly to St. John in the New Testament 10:9, where Jesus describes himself: 'I am the door ...'), doors have come to signify salvation and atonement [24]. Dante refers to baptism as 'the portal of the faith' [25]. Doors may also refer to death (see Psalms 9:13), while the porta clausa may stand either for the prophet Ezekiel (46:1) or for Mary's virginity. In the 14th-century Florentine painting 'Annunciation', the centre is dominated by a closed door symbolizing Mary's chasti- ty [26, plate 62]. Yet another use of gates in the Christian art, more direct than the above, is their Fig. 4. Benvenuto di Giovanni. 'The Descent into Limbo', oil on canvas, 142 x 150 cm, 15th century. depiction in the 'Descent into Hell' theme, as in Benvenuto di Giovanni's painting 'The Descent into Limbo' (15th century) where the gates of hell are shown being trampled under Christ's feet (Matt. 16:18; see Fig. 4). 6. SOCIO-POLITICAL ASPECTS Similar to its relevance for the gregarious characteris- tic of individuals, door symbolism has significance for the social life of groups. Consider the ancient city gates mentioned above as having had an obvious defensive function. The same gates also served as a centre of activity beyond what would have been warranted by their military significance. Many activities occurred at gates: Elders sat there passing sentences, the stoning to death of some transgressors took place there and they were locations of joyous activities. The importance of city gates may be illustrated by some of the traditions and events associated with the gates of Jerusalem. The walls of this city used to be pierced by 80 gates, 11 of which are now recognizable in the outer walls of the Old City [27]. One of these, the Golden Gate, is an especially rich source of both legend and history. Both Jews and Moslems refer to this gate as the Gate of Mercy, separating eternal life, symbol- ized by the Temple to which it leads on one side from the city of death, or the cemetery, on its other side. According to Christian tradition, Virgin Mary's parents, Joachim and Anna, met at the Golden Gate of the Temple (not necessarily identical with the Golden Gate of the City). Later Jesus entered Jerusalem through this gate, but when Heraclius, King of Byzantine, attemp- ted to enter through it in 629 AD, the gates closed themselves and would not let him through until he 'entered humbly'. Some 900 years later the then ruling Turks decided to block up the Golden Gate to prevent the Messiah from entering the City. When the British conquered Jerusalem in 1917, the Commander-in- Chief, General Allenby, refused to enter through it, lest he be accused of messianic pretensions. Related to the social aspects of gates and doors are some other entrances, by far more symbolic than functional city gates. The Porta Santa of St. Peter's 204</page><page sequence="4">The Signification of Doors and Gates in the VisualArts Basilica in Rome (as well as the Sacred Doors of the other three great Basilicas of that City) are walled up for 25 years and are opened only in the Holy Year by the Pope himself. The Gate of Peace, built in Berlin at the end of the 18th century, and known today as the Brandenburger Tor has a socio-political significance (the 'trademark' of the City of Berlin) so great that publicly passing through it is considered tantamount to controlling Germany. This is what the Nazi SS torch- light procession did on 30 January 1933, the day Hitler was made Chancellor. 7. CLOSING COMMENTS The most fascinating aspect of signs and symbols is their versatility and their many-layeredness of significa- tion. It is both a strength and a weakness that objects such as doors and gates can give rise to so many associations, many of which are consciously intended, others subconsciously transmitted, while still others are strictly personal. I hope that my highly condensed and far from exhaustive analysis will provide readers with a common ground for understanding the signification of doors and gates. REFERENCES 1. M.
