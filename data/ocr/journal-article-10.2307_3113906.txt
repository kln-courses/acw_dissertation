Judith Vander's most recent study of Ghost Dance music follows her two previous publications, Ghost Dance Songs and Religion of a Wind River Shoshone Woman (1986) and her award-winning Songprints: The Musical Experience of Five Shoshone Women (1988). The present study is the culmination of Vander's invaluable attention to the music of the Wind River Shoshone of Wyoming within the context of Great Basin music gen- erally and reflects the considerable fieldwork and research behind it. In my mind, the most significant contribution to the study of American Indian music in the last decade, it clearly establishes its author as the authority on Great Basin music. Of all Indian musical areas recognized in North America, the Great Basin is probably the least understood. Early collecting was uneven and sporadic. A glance at Bruno Nettl's map, "Areas of North American Indian Music" (Nettl 1954:2) and my own discussion of the Great Basin some thirty years later for the Handbook of North American Indians (Vennum 1986:683) reveal a wide but empty swath down the central portion of the area. This shows the continuing poor understanding of Basin music, particularly that of the Northern and Western Shoshone and Southern Paiute (compared, for instance, to the Northern Paiute and Ute-the latter's music having been collected and studied by Frances Densmore [1922]). Vander's study is based on nearly 150 Naraya songs in the repertoires of Emily Hill and her half-sister Dorothy Tappay, collected over a six-year period on the Wind River Reservation. Their songs for the Naraya (the East- ern Shoshone version of the Ghost Dance) reach back to the 1920s when the sisters began attending dances as children. The size of their sample from this genre is significant, for only a handful of Naraya songs have been pre- viously recorded or published. (Had the present publication been available at the time of my own research, I would have adjusted some of my conclu- sions, especially regarding meter in Great Basin music.) One of Vander's significant discoveries was the connection between the Naraya and earlier traditions of the Great Basin Round Dance (she sees the Naraya as predating the better-known Ghost Dance of 1890). Given the great variety of Round Dance types throughout the area, considerable con- fusion has arisen in the literature for describing them or assigning names to them. For instance, two specific forms of the Round or Circle Dance-</page><page sequence="2">370 Ethnomusicology, Spring/Summer 1998 the Father Dance and the nu'akin-were closely related to the Naraya and have often been confused with it. The author's intent, "to place the songs and religion within the cogni- tive, conceptual worlds of Wind River Shoshone culture" (iii), is fully achieved. Her introduction and first chapter provide a succinct overview of Great Basin culture and beliefs, drawing on an enormous amount of data from appropriate sources (Mooney, Steward, Liljeblad, Lowie, Fowler, Sapir, and especially Shimkin, whose fieldnotes were available to Vander). Chapters 2 through 7, organized by topics and images (she finds 320 of them!), constitute the bulk of the text. Songs 101-21 (Chapter 6), for example, focus on various plants, buttressed by Vander's commentary on "Plants as Calendar Markers," "Plants as Names for Land and People," "Plants, Women, and Equality," and "Green/Grass" (covering a series of Shoshone associations between the color and beliefs about living things). Similarly, in a chapter devoted to animals, she delves into a discussion of traditional Shoshone beliefs concerning animals and their relationship to shamanism and personal power. She reviews Shoshone mythology, in which the major characters are anthropomorphic animals at a mythic time when all creatures were considered to be Indians and had the power of speech, and suggests that the many references to important animals in Naraya texts show the antiquity behind beliefs responsible for such songs. One such belief, for example, is the Great Basin tradition of antelope-charming through music and ritual, where shamans are thought to capture antelope souls and bring them to their death, leaving the hunters merely to finish the job. As more data from North American hunting peoples become avail- able, the close interrelationships between humans and animals expressed through song becomes increasingly apparent (see, for example, Brightman 1993). Vander's publication is particularly valuable for rescuing such a large body of Great Basin oral literature from oblivion. (At the time she recorded the sisters, they were probably the last of their people to believe in the Shoshone Ghost Dance religion.) The Naraya song texts represent a par- ticularly rich source of Native American poetry, reflecting as they do the intrinsic relationship of the Shoshone people to all aspects of the natural world around them. Where possible, each of these haiku-like verses (Song 47: "Our big mountains shining . .. lying while moving; Green water moun- tain shining . .. lying while moving") is translated and explained. Vander's published interchanges with the singers in trying to retrieve meanings from the texts indicate difficulties familiar to most collectors. To explain the meaning of "water rising" (Song 33), Emily offered, "when water gets kind of pool-like-it goes around." To Vander's query, "a whirlpool?", Emily responded "something like that. And some deep places."</page><page sequence="3">Book Reviews 371 The author modestly admits her linguistic shortcomings; hence the reader encounters frequent question marks in the translations or caveats that a clear translation from the singer was not forthcoming. In pointing out what seem to be differences between the sung texts and their ordinary Shoshone spoken versions, Vander properly leaves a complete analysis of the texts to linguists at some future time. Having concluded that certain words in performance often take different forms, she opted for phonetic over phonemic representations in order to remain true to their sounds. Perhaps anticipating criticism from purists over this, she nevertheless of- fers the following concern: "At some future time the forms that I ascribe to pure sound or aesthetic considerations may be shown to be morphemes and not phonetic play. At the same time, I am convinced that there will ever remain parts that cannot be analyzed, poetic and sacred parts that dictate form and push Naraya language to the edge and perhaps even be- yond the boundary of linguistic communication" (347). In thus leaving problems to future scholars, Vander echos the words of her predecessor, Frances Densmore, who once wrote, "Other students, scanning the mate- rial, may reach other conclusions. My work has been to ... open the way for the work of others in the future" (Densmore 1942:550). Students of Indian music will appreciate Vander's important discussion of vocables in Naraya songs (355ff). In considering word transformations, she draws on Hinton's work in Havasupai music, as well as Liljeblad's, Shimkin's, and Crum's in Great Basin music. She discovers the absence of "o" and the presence of nasal "n" to distinguish the vocable cadence of Naraya songs from those of other song genres. Specifically, she shows that the performance of the final "ena" as a vocable formula signals a Naraya cadence, contrasting sharply with the cadences of Wind River Sun Dance or War Dance songs. Vander's exhaustive analysis of the music may seem overly detailed to some but has a purpose. In the past, she feels, the Great Basin style has been characterized by its simplicity and symmetry (see, for example, Herzog 1935), which overlooks what she perceives as its considerably more com- plex makeup. She writes: "Because Naraya songs are miniature forms, only close attention to small details can bring individual irregularities into view ... A just characterization of [Naraya] music and poetry is incomplete and skewed without it" (379). Thus her transcriptions and analyses attempt to show "interrelationships between different musical sections... analo- gous to the interlinear relationship in the texts." One important thesis expounded in the text is the distinction now able to be made between Great Basin and more familiar Plains versions of the Ghost Dance. Based on their texts, Vander sees these as two separate tra- ditions: the Plains repertory's images resurrect Indian people from the ir-</page><page sequence="4">372 Ethnomusicology, Spring/Summer 1998 retrievable culture of the past-hunting buffalo, raising tipis, playing an- cient games-whereas the Naraya songs look to the future and draw their topics from nature (water, fog, snow, weather, rocks, mountains, etc.). Vander summarizes and concludes: "Plains Ghost Dance songs focus on people and their nineteenth-century Plains life. Naraya songs focus on the natural world ... The texts, and the religions they embody, stand in sharp relief to one another-worlds apart, or more accurately, world views apart" (521). Elsewhere, I raised the issue of the need for a reassessment of the Great Basin as a single musical culture area (Vennum 1986:682). Now that we have Vander's major contribution to our understanding of Eastern Shosho- ne music as well as the recent publication of important Southern Paiute material (Sapir 1994), we should encourage Vander to fill in the empty spaces still on our Great Basin map.
