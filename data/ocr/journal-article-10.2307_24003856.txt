<plain_text><page sequence="1">Rebecca West "A voce piena": An Introduction to Women's Voices in Italian Literature* When, in the 1987 issue, Adi first announced the topic of this volume, the editors wrote that the contributors themselves were invited "to define the boundaries of their criticai discourse" in order to avoid "exclusionary and dogmatic strictures." At that time, Dino Cervigni and I wished above ali that the issue might reflect the methodological, ideological, and theoretical diversity characteristic of women's studies. We also sought historical breadth in the texts and problems studied, and hoped for contributions from both European and American, younger and more established scholars alike. Our wishes have been fulfilled more completely than we could have imagined; the résultant issue reaches a level of individuai and collective excellence that far surpasses mere diversity and breadth. The response to our cali for papers was of such magnitude that we were forced, due to limitations of space and, in some cases, time, to exclude several articles of great interest. The décision to include more pieces than in any other past issue of Adi — twenty-three in ali — reveals our difficulty in setting limits, even regarding the volume's size, to what is undoubtedly one of the most stimulating areas of inquiry today. From the voluminous response to our proposai of two years ago, and from the excellent quality of the pieces, we can ali readily deduce that this forum was and remains an authentically needed one for Italianists both here and abroad. Although there is no dearth broadly speaking of published studies regarding women and literature, there have been many fewer publications entirely dedicated to women in Italian literature and culture. In 1987, the English journal The Italianist presented an issue entitled "Women and Italy"; and in 1988 Italica printed three articles and two reviews pertaining to women's studies under the title "Women's Voices." The "Editorial" of The Italianist points out that the special number, "unlike the earlier one on Pasolini (Volume 5), which was initiated by the Editorial Board" was, however, "much more the création of our contributors, a number of whom .. . submitted 4c I wish to thank Dino S. Cervigni for inviting me to work with him as co-editor of this issue. He was in all ways an exemplary collaborator, and his absolutely vital contribution to the existence of this volume, from first proposing the topic to soliciting, reading, and editing its contents step by step and side by side with me, must be recognized and praised. My thanks also go to our many contributors for their enthusiasm, patience, and professionalism, as well as to those colleagues whose equally excellent work could not be included due to constraints of space and/or time. Adi wishes lastly to acknowledge with gratitude the generous support of the Graduate Division of the Humanities at the University of Chicago, made possible by the Division Dean, Philip Gossett. Such institutional encouragement of our efforts is greatly appreciated.</page><page sequence="2">"A voce piena" : An Introduction to Women's Voices in Italian Literature 5 articles in the area of women's studies" (5). The same sort of "spontaneous création" resulted in the Italica issue. Adi 's éditorial initiative in 1987 was, therefore, both timely and responsive to what had become recognized as a lack within Italian Studies, i.e., pubhc récognition that numerous Italianists of many sorts were and are doing excellent work in this field, and that a spacious forum for the présentation of some of that work was overdue. Although the formai initiative was éditorial, it is nonetheless true in the case of this issue as well that the editors were responding to an existing need rather than seeking to stimulate new interest As might be expected, most of the contributors to this issue are women. Although expected, it is also, I believe, somewhat lamentable, for women's studies, whatever else they are, are non-exclusionary. Nonetheless, in Italian studies, men have not tended to enter en masse into the terrain of gender-related issues. No matter how it might be explained or interpreted, it is notable that this issue dedicated to "women's voices" is for the most part made up o/"women's voices." This fact serves to point to some of the most complex and debated questions underlying gender-related studies: What indeed is a "woman's voice"? What is most at stake: equality or différence? How can those stakes be understood, and with which instruments of analysis and modes of expression can they best be articulated? Are women's studies inevitably feminist studies? If so, is such a thing as "male feminism" possible? And on and on. There are no easy answers to these and a whole host of other questions pertaining to this field of inquiry. The essays that follow show once more just how far from univocality we are — and just how genuinely valuable serious plurivocality is to our shared criticai enterprise, whether centered on women's studies or on other areas of intellectual, ideological, cultural, and spiritual import. If gender-related scholarship has succeeded in agreeing on any one emphasis, surely it is in its highlighting of one of the most evident (indeed, self-evident, although not universally accepted as such) facts of both life and art: precisely the diversity of voices, and the alterity of experience and perspective informing them. Working against the dominance of any one mode of discourse (criticai or otherwise) or any one privileged window onto reality, women's studies remind us of the importance of différence while at the same rime implicitly or explicitly emphasizing that différence is not necessarily opposition, estrangement, or threaL The politicai, as well as sexual and criticai, implications of this openness to otherness are clear. Although diversity is the byword of "women's voices," for the sake of introductory clarity ITI seek to categorize and organize the essays that follow according to various criteria. First, the articles are presented in chronological order, from Victoria Kirkham's essay on Dante's Commedia to Maurizio Viano's considération of women's relation to contemporary Italian philosophical trends. Between these articles are included pieces pertaining to texts, authors, or issues of the Cinquecento, Seicento, Settecento, Ottocento, and our own Century. The</page><page sequence="3">Rebecca West majority of the studies deals with the Cinquecento and the Novecento; nor is this suiprising given the explicit and strong presence of texts and issues pertaining to women in these periods. In spite of these concentrations, however, the historical and genre-related breadth of the volume's contents provides an implicit history of women's cultural and literary presence in Italy through the last six centuries, whether as authors, literary characters, or objects of both female and male scrutiny. I might add that there is as well the criticai breadth that results in part from the contributors' American and European scholarly contexts: the mix of Italian, English, French, and American scholars assures methodological and ideological variety of the most dialogically stimulating kind. The essays can also be classified according to whether they concentrate on works by women; concepts of women in diverse historical periods and in female and male-authored texts alike; or représentations in texts of women and Woman as literary characters, poetic symbols, or figures of sheer alterity and/or mystery. In the first category are articles on the writers Gaspara Stampa, Moderata Fonte, sister Annalena Odaldi, Matilde Serao, Elsa Morante, Margherita Guidacci, Dacia Maraini, Biancamaria Frabotta, and others. In the second and third catégories can be included the articles on Dante's cast of women in the Commedia, Ariosto's Angelica, Goldoni's "bluestocking" Rosaura, Castiglione's court ladies, and women in Campanella's complex corpus; as well as on the women, real and literary, of Italian Futurism, of the Settecento, and of contemporary literary and philosophical texts. Women as authors, subjects, and objects — and even as conspicuous absence as argued by Maurizio Viano in regard to il pensiero debole : all of these approaches to and manifestations of women's voices in Italian literature and culture are présent in the following studies. There is a great variety of methodological approaches to the many authors, texts, and issues discussed in these essays. In briefly describing the individuai essays, FU loosely organize them according to whether their primary (although by no means exclusive) emphases are historical and/or philological, or theoretical and/or ideological. There are often many overlappings of these approaches and emphases within the same essays, so that my procedure should be seen as basically utilitarian, in support of certain groupings. It is true that the strongly historical and philological orientation of the Italian criticai tradition is most evident in the articles written by European scholars, while certain kinds of close readings and innovative theoretical perspectives reflect the training and préoccupations of many scholars on this side of the Atlantic. But there are many exceptions to this ostensible rule. That these methodological strengths interpenetrate, and any strict séparation of one from the other is ultimately impossible, is a heartening sign that a genuine dialogue is continuing to take place between American and European researchers, a "conversation" that Adi has always sought to encourage. (For a cursory but nonetheless useful summary of the transnational nature of feminism and women's studies from their inception, see the section entitled "La cultura delle donne" in Ceserani and De Federicis,</page><page sequence="4">"A voce piena" : An Introduction to Women' s Voices in Italian Literatur e 1 eds.) A strong interest in theorizing is especially evident in the contributions of Valeria Finucci, Carol Lazzaro-Weis, Lucia Re, Juliana Schiesari, Darby Tench, and Maurizio Viano. In her essay, "'Corteggiando la donna di corte': discorso istituzionale e realtà ne II libro del cor te giano di B. Castiglione," Finucci explores the presence of women, both within the court itself and within the textual space of the Corte giano, from criticai perspectives posited in the work of, among many others, Foucault and Lacan. That women are materially présent in the courtly context is undeniable; Finucci argues, however, that their presence is of the imaginary rather than symbolic realm (in Lacanian terms); in support, that is, of the dominant patriarchal discourse (Foucault's "fellowship of discourse") from whose création and shaping they are excluded. She explores in detail the ways in which women are effectively absent, although physically présent; talked about, but barred themselves from the possibility of speech. Remaining an object of discourse rather than a subject, the woman of the court conspires with the men on whom she is dépendent for her identity rather than actively participating in the formation of that identity. Finucci concludes that Burckhardt's déclaration that in the Renaissance "female émancipation ... was simply a matter of course" is too optimistic if reconsidered, as she does in her essay, in the light of contemporary theorizing about self-formation, mastery, and independence. Juliana Schiesari's essay, "In Praise of Virtuous Women? For a Genealogy of Gender Morals in Renaissance Italy," also focusses on the Renaissance; she seeks to continue "a relendess interrogation into the values and practices that situated the question of 'woman' paradoxically at both the center and circumference of Renaissance thought." Referring to much of the important recent criticai and theoretical work on redefining the so-called "émancipation" of women during the Renaissance, Schiesari concentrâtes on the issue of virtue. She argues that the worth of Cinquecento women was consistently measured according to a male standard of excellence and an approximation of masculine ideals of courage and intelligence. Subjected to a male gaze, the woman was praised, criticized, and ultimately defined by those objectifying eyes whose scrutiny sought likeness rather than différence. Ranging among a rich variety of texts, from encomia in praise of women to the Cor te giano, from Bruni and Machiavelli to Ariosto, Tasso, and the nun Arcangela Tarabotti's defense of women, Schiesari provides an excellent survey of Renaissance gender morals, and points the way to future elaborations of the problematics of concepts of female "virtue" not only in that period, but in earlier and later eras as well. With the essays by Lazzaro-Weis, Re, Tench, and Viano, we move to the late Ottocento and the Novecento. In "Gutting the Belly of Naples: Metaphor, Metonymy and the Auscultatory Imperative in Serao's City of Pietà ," Darby</page><page sequence="5">Rebecca West Tench reads II ventre di Napoli as "a clear instance of nineteenth-century écrire femme." Referring to the suggestive work of philosopher Richard Rorty, whose writings seek to question the validity of the traditional epistemological privilège granted to sight, Tench suggests that Serao's portrait of the diseased city of Naples similarly challenges the dominance of visually conditioned metaphoric processes of représentation, relying instead on métonymie linkage and auscultatory listening in order to recuperate the authentic life of the city and its people. That conversation and the genuine exchange of ideas and feelings depend more on the senses of hearing and touch than on sight has broad implications for cultural and literary studies, some of which are broached in Tench's essay. Her reading of Serao becomes a "note," therefore, in a much larger symphony of theoretical concems. Lucia Re's "Futurism and Feminism" does much to redimension what is standardly seen as futurism's overwhelmingly misogynist world view. Informed by new historicist as well as feminist theoretical acumen, Re rereads male futurists' déclarations from a Nietzschean perspective, and posits that, while deeply imbued with the philosopher's disdain for women, Marinetti's and others' futurist polemics had the merit of underlining the politicai and ideological essence of sexual, interpersonal behavior. The slogan seen today by many as quintessentially feminist — "the personal is politicai" — was, she argues, already implicit in futurism. Re then moves to a considération of futurist women — Valentine de Saint-Point, Maria Ginanni, Rosa Rosà, and Enif Robert — whose poetry and prose often collaborated in futurist contempt for women while at the same time positing alternative and liberating identities to those of vamp or mother. The recovery of these little known texts, and Re's ideologically résonant theorizing about their meaning and import, contribute enormously to the création of a more complete and informed criticai view of Italian futurism, as well as of the fascist ideology that is inextricably bound up with it. Don Juan, the traditional figure of the seducer, is also a symbol of the scandal of language's séduction in the work of Shoshana Felman. Taking off from Felman's argument, Carol Lazzaro-Weis méditâtes on postmodern feminist théories of language in her essay 'The Subject's Séduction: The Expérience of Don Juan in Italian Feminist Fictions." She provides a brief but rigorous summary of French and Italian feminist thought regarding modes of representing the self and experience in language; she then moves to an analysis of two contemporary Italian feminist prose fiction works: Maria Schiavo's Macellum: Storia violenta e romanzata di donne e di mercato and Dacia Maraini's II treno per Helsinki, in both of which the figure of Don Juan provides the possibility of examining male-female relationships and the ways in which language conditions and seeks to express them. There is a similar interest in women's "taking of the word" as is seen in Finucci's study of Castiglione's text; Lazzaro-Weis also emphasizes the complicity of women in their own prisons of silence and passivity, while probing the complex problem of postmodern myths of language</page><page sequence="6">"A voce piena" : An Introduction to Womeri s Voices in Italian Literature 9 and their place in feminist criticai and creative writing. Maurizio Viano's "Sesso debole, pensiero debole" is a multi-faceted piece that embodies the etymological meaning of "essay" as "attempt." By this I mean to emphasize the article's self-consciously autocritical stance by means of which its own identity as a male feminist's offering is as much at stake as the issue it conffonts: the place (or lack thereof) of women and feminist modes of expression and ideological concerns in the contemporary Italian philosophical trend known as "pensiero debole." Embodying in its own style and structure the very characteristics Viano sees as lacking in the majority of writings by "debolisti" — i.e., an explicit consciousness of gender as a conditioning factor in philosophy and politics alike; the répudiation of metaphysics' privileging of the acorporeal and abstract in favor of "writing the body" and highlighting the personal, contextual realities out of which discourse emerges; and the validation of the mythic, ludic, and fable-like potential of language, rather than the closed, elitist language of traditional académie philosophy, the former of which renders even highly complex theoretical elaborations broadly accessible — his essay both speaks of and is male feminism in action. In its eloquent critique of "pensiero debole," the essay will no doubt stimulate needed further debate on this trend; in its thoughtful view of feminism — female and male alike — it may perhaps encourage more men to venture into the thorny terrain of gender studies. I have dedicated substantial space to the above articles, not because I judge them in any way superior or privileged in relation to the contributions I shall now briefly describe, but because within them are detailed certain essential concerns that are discernible, implicitly or explicitly, in ali of the essays. These concerns include: 1) the redimensioning of historically traditional descriptions of women's roles, in literature and in life; 2) the rediscovery of texts by women and the création of opportunities for women to "speak themselves," to be subjects as well as objects of discourse and experience; 3) the awareness, as critics and theorists of literature and culture, of the interpersonal, politicai, and basically human implications and dimensions of our académie discourses: the relevance, in short, of theory to praxis. These and other underlying préoccupations that fuel women's studies are evident even in the least openly theoretical essays included in this volume. I'il now attempt to give necessarily brief descriptions of the contents of those essays that tend to stay closer to stylistic, philological, and historical concerns, insisting once more, however, that in choosing to follow a utilitarian organizational principle, I am by no means suggesting that the following pièces are theoretically barren or politically neutral. On the contrary, these essays show that even in the least explicitly theoretically or ideologically conditioned criticai méthodologies, the mere choice of subject matter is already a déclaration of certain allegiances, and the instruments of analysis and modes of argumentation are charged with the energy and power of the critic's implicit ideology. I'il follow a chronological order in presenting the remaining articles.</page><page sequence="7">10 Rebecca West In "A Canon of Women in Dante's Commedia," Victoria Kirkham Charts the female population of the great poem, explaining the principles of Organization underlying Dante's inclusions, and bringing forth the many recondite meanings ascribable to numerologically significant patterns of groupings as well as of individuai characterizations of women. We learn that five is the number of the flesh, for example, making Francesca's placement in Inferno V inévitable and iconic. The particular (and often negative) feminine connotations of many other numbers are shown, and Dante's use of these résonances in the construction of his poetic edifice is discussed in penetrating and exhaustive detail. Kirkham's conclusion that woman's lot in the Commedia rests on dominant scientific and moral principles of the poet's medieval world is amply supported by her rigorously and elegantly presented érudition. From Dante's Trecento, we move to the Cinquecento; along with the essays by Finucci and Schiesari discussed above, there are those of Zancan, Bassanese, Shemek, Collina, and Malpezzi-Price. Marina Zancan's piece is an extraordinarily informative and historically precise considération of women intellectuals of the early sixteenth Century in the Venetian republic. In a few pages, she paints a detailed portrait of Venetian culture and of women's politicai and cultural place within it. She then moves to a more specific considération of the social catégories for women delineated by patriarchal society: signora , meretrice, and the ambiguously situated cortigiana. These last were "transgressive" women who represented alternative and independent voices within the culture of their rime. Zancan then discusses Gaspara Stampa, a cortigiana , and Maria Savorgnan, a signora, showing how these women from very différent social classes and personal circumstances both sought to forge their own unique identifies and to give voice to their own dreams of presence and participation. Fiora Bassanese also considers the work of Gaspara Stampa, as well as that of Tullia D'Aragona and Veronica Franco, in her essay "What's in a Name? Self Naming and Renaissance Women Poets." Existing more or less on the fringes of polite society, these women had to construct positive identifies without recourse to aristocratie bloodlines or family influence. One of the ways in which they sought to do so was through self-naming. Bassanese explores the significance of their chosen names and of the many plays on naming in their poetry that, far from being mere poetic embellishments, were signs of their selfhood and emblems of their shared desire to transform themselves from object to true lyric subject: to poets. Paola Malpezzi-Price makes much the same point about Moderata Fonte's choice of pen name in her careful study of Fonte's II merito delle donne. Born Modesta Pozzo, Fonte maintained the allusion to water in her chosen name, but changed the enclosure of the "well" into the dynamic freedom of the "fountain." Malpezzi-Price performs a close reading of the "giornata prima" of Fonte's recently republished treatise, showing very convincingly the "hybrid" nature of its language, which is both a response to misogynist literature</page><page sequence="8">"A voce piena" : An Introduction to Women's Voices in Italian Literature 11 and an inscription of female intentions within dominantly masculine modes of discourse. Aggressively criticai of and yet implicitly conciliatory toward men, Fonte's work walks a tightrope stretched between patriarchal society's assumptions concerning women's worth and the forging of new structures, both literary and societal, that might challenge those assumptions. Beatrice Collina's piece on Fonte moves away from a close textual reading of the treatise in order to provide important information on its publication, reception, and dissémination within the culture from which it emerged. The biographically and historically dense material presented by Collina meshes well with Malpezzi Price's more textually circumscribed analysis; reading both in concert permits us to understand and appreciate the merits of this hithertofore relatively ignored figure of the Cinquecento. From these essays dedicated primarily to actual women of the Renaissance, Deanna Shemek takes us into the literary universe of Ariosto in order to concentrate on "that elusive object of desire": Angelica. Shemek posits that, like Ariosto's many other réfutations of the validity of polar oppositions underlying diverse areas of his era's dominant discourse, Angelica is constituted as a response to the polarized terms of the querelle des femmes. She is a signifier of pure and impossible sexual alterity, an unreachable otherness that is the most destructive force in the entire poem. When she breaks down Orlando's circular, self-seeking gaze and becomes a desiring subject in her own right, her function as a reference point for male desire and self-definition is revealed as illusory, and she disappears from the text. The importance of Lacanian thought concerning the imaginary and the symbolic is evident here, as it is in Finucci's and others' méditations on the female subject. Shemek's close reading of one female character's function and meaning in a poem written by a man has wide résonance for studies of the ways in which maie authors implicitly or explicitly grapple with the question of différence, and write into their texts the dangers and/or séductions of illusive images of alterity. Taking us into the Seicento and Settecento are the articles by Weaver, Bolzoni, Fido, Stewart, and Bonatti. Elissa Weaver writes of "Convent Comedy and the World," concentrating on the theatrical farces of Suor Annalena Odaldi, a nun from Pistoia who lived from 1572 to 1638. Having worked extensively to recover texts long buried in archives, Weaver has brought to light a fascinating body of literature written by and for nuns, among whom Odaldi, whose plays were composed for and performed at her convent's Carni val festivities. We learn that the nun's plays were completely secular in subject matter; Weaver suggests that they were tolerated as such precisely because of having been written in Carnival's spirit of the "world upside down." Marriage is a primary theme of the farces, a fact interpreted by Weaver as an indirect complaint by Odaldi regarding her "imprisonment" in the religious life as well as an expression of her abiding attachment to the world beyond its walls. The historical, cultural, and literary interest of this pioneering research into the hidden world of nuns' créations qui te</page><page sequence="9">12 Rebecca West literally unlocks the convent doors, and restores a voice to a long silent female population of the late Cinquecento and early Seicento. Lina Bolzoni's piece is an exhaustive analysis of Tommaso Campanella's fascination with and négation of female différence as manifested across his entire corpus. A contemporary of Odaldi (he lived from 1568 to 1639), Campanella moved and worked in a social and intellectual universe light years away from that of the nun, so that reading these two pièces together gives us the added bonus of recognizing again the radicai diversity of experience within any one historical period. Fascinated by the new discoveries and intellectual vistas of his time, Campanella's thought is characterized by his thirst for freedom and knowledge. Bolzoni discusses his strong belief in diversity and multiplicity, and his réfutation of a strictly anthropomorphic view of experience. Moving to the question of sexual différence, she carefully demonstrates that Campanella's acceptance of the duality of the sexes permeated his world view, and resulted in a polarization that endowed women with great metaphysical and cosmic power but also made of them "imperfect men," inferior and lacking versions of maleness. Campanella's fascination with fundamental universal duality and, at the same time, his négation of female différence create extraordinary tensions in his work, the implications of which are stili relevant to our own experience. The articles by Fido, Bonatti, and Stewart together form a rich portrait of Settecento attitudes toward women as expressed in diverse forms, from novels to theatrical pièces to journalistic and diaristic documents. Franco Fido writes in "Italian Contributions to the Eighteenth-Century Debate on Women" of the challenge during the siècle des lumières to the traditional alternatives for women of marriage or the religious life. Situating his discussion of Italian figures in the context of the influential French thought that was circulating in Settecento Italy, Fido first writes of the Neapolitan Giuseppe Maria Galanti, a great admirer of Voltaire and Rousseau, and a great aficionado of sentimental novels. While arguing against the criminalization of rape, Galanti also emphasized the social and politicai questions inherent in women's position, an emphasis that Fido writes is characteristic of the Italian enlightenment. Fido next turns to Milan and the Verri brothers, concentrating on Pietro Verri's Manoscritto da leggersi dalla mia cara figlia Teresa, and its remarkably caring practical advice to the young girl. He complétés his survey with mentions of women active in eighteenth century Venetian life, as well as of Goldoni's and Chiari's well-known contributions to the debate on women. Maria Ines Bonatti gives extensive attention to the novels of Chiari in her essay on female éducation in Enlightenment thought Positing that it was in the novel that the complications and contradictions pertaining to the éducation of women were best represented, Bonatti studies the "pedagogical theory" implicit in Chiari's novels while referring as well to the writings of Verri, Gozzi, Goldoni and other authors actively involved in the Settecento debate on women. Bonatti concludes that the novel, with its heterogeneous plots and characters and its flexible structure,</page><page sequence="10">"A voce piena" : An Introduction to Women's Voices in ltalian Literature 13 served to aid women in forming new self-awareness and models of comportment and accomplishment. And, lastly, in Pamela Stewart's essay on "Rosaura, the Blue-stocking Heroine of Goldoni's Donna di garbo," we are given a careful close reading of the play within the context of Goldoni's overall theatrical reform. Concentrating on the transformation of the Commedia dell'Arte's servetta role into that of Rosaura's as protagonist, Stewart argues that Goldoni Substitutes the principle of disguise with that of imitation, a change that has performative significance and thus serves as a key to interpreting both Rosaura's character and the whole play. Rosaura's imitations of the manners and speech of other characters are, according to Stewart, in fact parodies and caricatures of them that elicit the audience's sympathy with her. Neither tiresome know-it-all nor unappealing flatterer, Rosaura is a dramatic character of enormous appeal, a woman who displays her intelligence and wit with her talent for imitation. By paying attention to the element of parody and by considering the original as well as the subsequently revised versions of the play, Stewart argues that an over-simplified and artificial notion of the Goldonian reform is avoided, and the transformation of the Commedia dell'arte is better revealed as the subtle and painstaking process it was. The remaining articles, by Fanning, Pickering-Iazzi, Jeuland-Meynaud, Harwell, Frabotta, and Corti, all discuss texts and figures of the late Ottocento or Novecento. The first three center on women writers of prose fiction — Serao, Aleramo, Maraini, Fallaci, and Morante — while Harwell explicates the poetry of Margherita Guidacci. The Frabotta piece consists of translations by Keala Jewell of an essay first published in the seventies and a poem published in 1982, and Maria Corti gives us a wonderfully personalized account of her career as a scholar and creative writer in her "Autointervista." Although there are many other women's voices of the recent past and présent that are not included (excellent poets such as Maria Luisa Spaziani, Giulia Niccolai, and Amelia Rosselli; or prose writers of renown such as Natalia Ginzberg, Anna Banfi, and Grazia Deledda, as well as the many lesser-known literary women of our Century whose work is beginning to be recognized), these pieces collectively more than amply demonstrate the enormous contribution by women to modem and contemporary Italian culture, and the criticai seriousness with which that contribution is being described and assessed. Ursula Fanning opens an important area of considération in her essay on représentations of female friendship in Serao's work. One of the most sustaining forms of human interconnectedness, for men and women alike, friendship tends to be taken for granted in criticism as in fife. Fanning brings it to the fore demonstrating, through a sériés of close readings of épisodes in Serao involving women friends, that the characters define themselves through these intense relationships of similarity and opposition, while the novelist herself works through a process of self-definition by writing about friendships. As alternatives</page><page sequence="11">14 Rebecca West to heterosexual love relationships, marriage, and lesbian attachments (although these other forms of emotional connection condition and are conditioned by friendship), the bonds between women in Serao's novels are, according to Fanning, "undeniably politicai," and function as implicit challenges to the exclusive privileging of specific institutions, especially marriage. From friends to mothers: Robin Pickering-Iazzi explores the diverse images of motherhood painted in novels by Aleramo, Morante, Marami, and Fallaci. While ali of these writers refute the ideology of motherhood as women's primary and biologically determined destiny, they do not deny the importance and complexity of motherhood. Instead, in various ways their novels probe the realities of mothering, male-authored images of motherhood, and the broader social and cultural implications of alternative concepts of the mother/child relationship. Rather than being a given, motherhood is shown to be a process involving not only the nurture of the child but also the identity of the woman. By exploring motherhood in diverse and sometimes opposing images, the novels under considération provide new metaphors for women's actual experience and inner desires. Maryse Jeuland-Meynaud also analyzes the rôle of the mother in her essay on Eisa Morante's novels, but as part of a larger considération of portrayals of women in that corpus. Morante's books overflow with women characters of ail âges and social classes, although young and poor mothers are focal points of her cast of characters. Seeking ultimately to explain the negative fate typically ascribed to women by Morante (madness, isolation, sexual mania, death), Jeuland-Meynaud posits that these passive and victimized women, created, paradoxically, by "una donna di forte personalità," reflect Morante's early and sustained preference for a traditional, essentialistic, and innate theory of ontology of Woman rather than a dynamic, active, and existentially conditioned ontology, these being the two dominant formulas available in the post-War years when Morante was beginning to write. Her refusai of the existentialism evident in, among others, De Beauvoir's théories, and her acceptance of more traditional concepts of women instead of the futuristically oriented views of self-formation circulating in the late forties were choices determined perhaps by her strongly elegiac vein and her utter disdain for social realism. This is a reading of Morante that is sure to generate controversy; Pickering-Iazzi's analysis of La Storia , for example, proposes a very différent view of Morante's intentions, arguing that it is Ida's adhérence to patriarchally determined concepts of motherhood that leads to her hysteria and ultimate madness. Her sad fate is not, therefore, an inévitable, innate destiny but rather the resuit of social and cultural conditioning, and Morante's novel therefore functions as a critique, not an affirmation, of tradition. Margherita Harwell's essay on the origins and development of Margherita Guidacci's poetry describes the major influences on her art, the values that inform her poetry, and the major thèmes of her verse. Conditioned by the writing of her relative Nicola Lisi, by Giuseppe Ungaretti's poetry, and by Giuseppe de Robertis' intellectual guidance, as well as by her profound religiosity and love of</page><page sequence="12">"A voce piena" : An Introduction to Women's Voices in Italian Literature 15 nature, Guidacci conceives of poetry as a tree whose flowering dépends on deep roots and constant nurturing. Her main theme is the essential polarity of life/death; in a detailed reading of selected verses, Harwell highlights the interplay of these forces throughout Guidacci's poetry. The critic also provides us with an extensive bibliography of works by Guidacci by means of which we are made aware of her extensive translations ffom many literatures and her studies of Eliot and other American and English writers. Frabotta's essay and poem, and Corti's autobiographical portrait give direct access to two of contemporary Italy's most résonant women's voices. Both are scholars and professors of literature and culture, yet both are also dedicated creative writers whose careers exemplify the interpénétration of scholarly and creative activities, and the richness that results. Keala Jewell's excellent translations of the essay, "Writing with the Left Hand," and the poem, "Heloise," are themselves interpretive exercises of the highest order. For those readers not well-acquainted with Biancamaria Frabotta's many contributions to Italian feminism and to literature, it is hoped that this small sample of her work will stimulate further readings, including especially her very recent work, Velocità di fuga, an inventive and moving feminist novel. Our readers are, of course, already very well aware of and indebted to the enormously important work of Maria Corti in fields and on authors as diverse as medieval studies and semiotics, contemporary Italian literature and pedagogy, Dante and Manganelli. Fewer may know her as a highly accomplished prose fiction writer. (See the review of her latest novel in this issue.) Adi is truly honored to have her contribution, a gracefully written and densely pondered méditation on her career as scholar and novelist. For me, reading it was like re-experiencing the intellectual intensity and personal intimacy of conversations about literature and life that I have been privileged to have with Maria Corti in my apartment in Chicago, at the Fondo Manoscritti of the University of Pavia, and over dinner in quiet Milanese trattorie. It is hoped that, in reading the pieces that make up this volume, our colleagues will similarly enjoy that sense of intellectual Stimulation and personal connection characteristic of scholarly sharing at its best. These women's voices seek to converse, not to con vert; to posit, not to preach. Please listen well. University of Chicago Works Cited Baranski, Zygmunt G., ed. "Women and Italy."
