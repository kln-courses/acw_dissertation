<plain_text><page sequence="1">1907.] MAN. [No. 87. PROCEEDINGS OF SOCIETIES. Proceedings. British Association. Anthropology at the British. Association, Leicester Meeting, July 31 to R7 August 7, 1907. UN The Anthropological Section of the British Association met in the Trades Hall, Leicester. The papers were quite up to the usual standard, but a very marked feature was the predominance of archaeological communications. Two important set discussions took place, one on the Iron Age and the other conjointly with Section L (Educational Science) on Anthropometrics in Schools. The President's address dealt with Religious Survivals and will be found reported in The Times, in Nature, and in the Report of the British Association, Leicester, 1907. In the following resume' the final destination of each paper, so far as it is determined at present, is indicated in square brackets. PHYSICAL ANTHROPOLOGY. J. GRAY, B.SC.-Anthropometrics in Schools. [MAN.] F. C. SHRUBSALL, M.A., M.D.-The Aims and Function of Anthropometry in Relation to the School.-The chief need at present is to establish a series of normns and the allowable range of variation. The value of food supplies, surrounidings, houLrs of sleep, &amp;c., of children is being gradually determined, and it is probable that light will be thrown on the problems of the best forms of exercise for school children under different conditions, and possibly even on the arrangement of the curriculum. E. MEYRICK, B.A., F.R.S.-On the Practical Difficulties in Obtaining Measure- ments of Growth in Schoolboys.-[The School fW-orld.] The discussion on Anthropometrics in Schools opened witlh the papers by Mr. Gray, Dr. Shrubsall and Mr. Meyrick; there also spoke Sir Victor Horsley, Mr. Ramsay Macdonald, M.P., Professor M. E. Sadler, Mr. C. Hawkins, and Miss Wileman. T. C. JAMES and H. J. FLEURE.-A Preliminary Report on the Progress of the University of Wales Ethnographical Survey.-The survey was begun two years ago, and the measurements taken include the more important ones recommended by the Anthropometric Committee of the British Association. Any persons with any known non-Welsh ancestors are not measured. Attention has so far been concentrated on Cardiganshire, and some 700 subjects have been observed, 100 of these being women. The couinty has been divided into three districts, and a special study made of the central division, bounded on the east by the moors above Tregaron, and on the north by the hills just south of the Ystwyth and Wyre. The following preliminary analysis of this district will be of interest, the grouping being purely experimental:; (a) Average height, 1,693 mm. Average cephalic index, 76-1. Hair and eyes darker than medium brown. Face long and narrow. The group may perhaps be provisionally connected with lomo mediterraneus. (b) Average height, 1,682 mm., but with a wide range of variation. Average cephalic index, 78 2. Hair and eyes fair, reddish hair and blue eyes being a typical combination. The group may provisionally be identified with the "Northern Race," except that stature is low. (c) Average height, 1,680 mm. Cephalic index, 81. Hair medium brown and darker. Eyes grey or brown. (d) Moderately tall. Fair. Cephalic indices as in b, but grading into thc other groups. J. R. MORTIMER.- The Cephalic Indices and the comtputed Stature of the Pagan Saxons in East Yorkshire.-The data on which the paper was based was collected in various burial grounds of the mid-wolds of Yorkshire. The series of [ 139 ]</page><page sequence="2">No. 87.J MAN, [1907. interments may be considered as fairly representing the Anglo-Saxons of the district. Of the sixty-one skeletons examined, thirty-one were dolichocephalic with an average cephalic index of 72 3 and with a mean compu-ted stature of 5 feet 53 inches. Seven were brachycephalic, with an average index of 81, 1 and a stature of 5 feet 4 inches. Twenty-three were mesaticephalic, with an ilndex of 77 and a stature of 5 feet 31 inches. It therefore seems clear that the long headed people were taller than those with short heads. R. J. ANDERsON.-Racial Types in Connaught. T. E. SMuRTHWAITE.-The Six Races of Mankind. Report of the Committee to conduct Anthropometric Investigation in the British Isles.-The subjects which the Committee is called upon to deal with being so nunmerous and so diverse, it was deemed advisable to appoint five sub-committees, each of which would confine its attention to a particular branch of anthropometry and draw up a report to be submitted to the committee as a whole. The following are the sub-committees which were constituted: 1. An anatomical sub-committee. 2. A physiological sub-committee. 3. A psvehological sub-committee. 4. A photographic sub-committee. 5. An educational sub-committee. The reports which have been submitted by these sub-committees represent the work of the Committee for the past year. ETHNOGRAPHY. T. ASILBY, D.Litt., F.S.A.-Note on the Ethnography of Sardinia.-The opinions expressed by Dr. Mackenzie and myself last year in our Note on the Ethnology of Sardinia have only been confirmed by a subsequent visit to the island paid by myself and Mr. J. if. Baker-Penoyre in March last. It would seem that there is an opportunity for ethnographical research, conducted by scholars who have experience of the problems which present themselves in the Eastern Mediterranean with regard to the ethnological affinrities of the earliest inhabitants. Nor would it be well to lose sight of the fact that the prehistoric remains of the British Isles may supply important parallels. J. W. CROFOOT.- The Anthropological Field in the Anglo-Egyptian Sudan.- The dervish rule, which worked havoc in the Northern Sudan, left the pagan black zone to the south almost untouched. In the Bahr-el-Ghazal region anthropologists will therefore be able to work directly upon the foundations laid by Schweinfurth and Junkier; north of this, in Dar Nuba, they will find a virgin field which, though difficult to work, may yield most valuable historical results. To the east lies another district unknown until this year-the land of the Buruns. In the Northerln, or Muslim, Sudan the dervish period has completely changed the conditiolns. Whole tribes have been devastated, or transplanted, or nlixed with black slaves or Egyptian prisoners, and written records of the past have been destroyed. The three main lalnguage groups-Nubian, Bega, and Arabic-however, remain, and scientific controversy has hitherto turned upon the origin of the people using them, the most recent conclusion being that all are African in spite of their traditions. Similar debates were raised both in the Medieval and Roman periods, and the two facts of survival and invasion appear to be both established ; the issue is one of degree how far the invaders have modified their predecessors. As special fields in which to stuidy the plasticity of the various types and open problems of medimeval history which must be settled before ancient history can be approached I suggest the following: (a) The sedentary Ababde at Daraw and in Berber. (b) The families claiming Arab and Turkish origin in the district south of Halfa. [ 140 ]</page><page sequence="3">1907.) MAN. [No. 87. (c) Villages in the Shabluka cataract and on the Blue Nile claiming descent from the Anag, a mediaval people which held the Central Sudan before the last Muslim invasions. (d) The tumuli in the Bega district from Suakin to the Atbara and the Nile. E. TORDAY and T. A. JOYCE, M.A.-Notes on the Ethnology of the South- West Congo Free State. [Journ. Roy. Anthr.

PULLEN-BUIRRY.-A Study of the Conditions of the Maoris in 1907.- This study dealt with the population, distribution, and the Government representation of the Maoris, their transitionial condition, education, religion, character and health, and concluded with a sketch of the native land question. MARK SKYES.- The Iranian Tribes of the Ottoman Empire. 0. BAINBRIDGE.-Life and Custom in the South Seas. Report of the Committee appointed for the Collection, Preservation, and Systematic Registration of Photographs of Anthropological Interest.-The Committee issued with this report the second list of photographs registered with them. Religions and Sociology. L. R. FARNELL, M.A., Litt.D.-Dr. Ulsener's Theories concerning Sonder-Gbtter and "A ugenblick- G6tter" in his " Gbtternamen."-The Roman "Indigitamenta," transcribed by St. Augustine from Varro, present a long list of divinities or divine potencies that presided over the manifold and often momentary activities of man in the spheres of agricultural and domestic life. These powers are indicated by no proper personal names, but by mere appellatives that are invented to express their limited function: they appear to have a very slight degree of personality, no definite relations with concrete divinities, and no continuous life, but are merely invoked at the particular moment of a certain action. Also in the record of the Greek cults we find a species of divine beings. that seem to possess a similar character; and Dr. Usener has discovered a similar system of functional divinities designated by adjectival names in the old Lithuanian religion. A few examples have been recently gathered of cognate cult-forms among modern savage peoples. This system may be regarded as a peculiar form of animism. But Dr. Usener has coined the terms " Sonder-Gott " and " Augen- blick-Gott" to express the character of these vague, transitory, limited divinities. Dr. Usener's theory about these gains its chief importanee from two assumptions: (a) that these are the relics, in Greece and elsewhere, of a very primitive period when the religious imagination had not yet created the concrete personal figures such as dominate Greek polytheism, but only such shadowy half-personal forms as in the "Indigitamenta"; (b) that the Greek pantheon was deeply indebted to, this system, since its divinities attach to themselves and absorb many of these appellatives that once characterised independent and vaguely conceived "numina," and that now serve to express the complex individuality of a Zeus, Apollo, Demeter, &amp;c. But a critical examination of the Greek evidence, whatever may be said of his theory when applied to other religious areas, does not support his assumptions, and he fails to consider the other and opposing explanation that many of these Greek appellative " numina " may be creations of the personal polytheism, mere emanations of concrete divinities like Nike of Athena, coming into beiilg owing to the accidental detachment of an epithet from a personal god or goddess. The same epithet is often applied to many anthropomorphic divinities. Again, none of these Greek appellatives of " Sonder-Gotter " proper appear to belong to the earliest stage of the language, and many of the assumed " Sonder-Gotter" are not functional, and if they ever existed as independent powers in the popular imagination belong obviously as much to the anthropomorphic system as Apollo and Artemis. Finally, many of these appellative [ 141 ]</page><page sequence="4">No. 87.J MAN. [1907. " Sonder-G6tter " are probably late fictions, and are merely created to assist the festivals of the higher personal gods. Doubtless many of the divinities of the Hellenes took over the epithets and names of those whom they dispossessed. But there is reason for believing that a strong personal religion, a pervading belief in concrete individual divinities, was brought with them by the earliest Hellenic tribes, and that this character also attached to much of the earlier religion that they found in their Mediterranean homes. W. H. R. RIVERS, M.D.-Some Sociological Definitions.-Anthropology has now reached a stage in its development in which it has become imperative that its technical terms should acquire definite meanings, and some kind of collective action is necessary to do what is possible towards obtaining general agreement in the use of such terms. The following are to be regarded merely as suggestions for the use of any body which may undertake the task of defining terms on the sociological side of anthropology. I will begin with the terms for the different divisions of society. Tribe.-A group of a simple kind occupying a circumscribed area which has a common language, common government, and common action in warfare, etc. The words " of a simple kind " are inserted in order to distinguish the tribe from the nation. Sept.-The social group for which there is at present the greatest diversity of nomenclature is the exogamous section of a tribe, the chief terms in use being clan, gens, sept, and totem-kill. The last term is open to the objection that there is no difference from the social point of view between a section of a tribe which takes its name from a totem, and one which has a designation of some other kind. The term clan is perhaps the most widely used, but is rejected by some, and it will probably be least disturbing to adopt the term sept, which cannot be said at present to have. any definitely recognised meaning. Phratry.-A division of a tribe larger tha-n the sept, as in North America, including two or more septs (though it may sometimes happen that, owing to the disappearance of septs, a phratry may have only one sept). Moiety.-When there are only two phratries, and they are exogamous, so that a member of one division must marry a member of the other, the divisiolns may be called moieties. Class.-This term should be limited to the matrimonial classes of the Australians, or to any similar groups which may be found elsewhere. Caste.-This is not always easy to distinguish from the tribe even in India, but it may be defined as a section of a larger community which stands in definite relations to other similar sections, which usually has an occupational basis and a definite rule of endogamy. FJamily.-This term should be limited to the group consisting of parents and children. The term " extended family " may be used for a group of perso-ns descended from the same grandfather or grandmother or more distant progenitor (i.e., where the descent can be demonstrated genealogically and is not mythical as is often the case with the sept). Occasionally the sept and the extended family may correspond with one another. Kin and Kinship.-These terms should be limited to the relationship set up by ties of blood which can be demonstrated genealogically. Sib and Sibship.-The old word sib may be used for the relationship set up by membership of the sept. Terms connected with Marriage and Descent.-Those suggested by Mr. Thomas in his " Kinship Organisations and Group Marriage in Australia " may be adopted, with possibly the modification that the supplementary unions which make it necessary to dis- tinguish between similar and dissimilar polyandry and polygyny might be separated from [ 142 ]</page><page sequence="5">1907.J MAN. [No. 87. marriage proper, those in which a man has supplementary partners being called concu- binage, while those in which a woman has supplementary partners are called cicisbeism. Mother-right.-This might be adopted as a convenient term for a state of society in which there are two or all of the three conditions, matrilineal descent, matrilocal marriage, and matripotestal family. W. H. R. RIVERS, M.D.-Mlorgan's MValayan System of Relationship.-Morgan's concept of the " consanguine family" as the earliest stage in the development of human society was founded on his belief in the primitiveness of the system of relationship now existing in Polynesia. The characteristic of this "Malayan" system is the very wide connotation of the terms expressive of kinship, so that relatives are denoted by one term, for whom there are several terms in the more usual forms of the classifactory system of relationship. It is unlikely that people so advanced in culture as the Polynesians should have retained the most primitive of existing methods of reckoning relationship, and there is evidence that communities elsewhere, such as the islanders of Torres Straits and the Kurnai of Australia, possess kinship systems which are in process of modification in such a way that they are coming to resemble the Malayan form, and it thus becomes highly probable that the Malayan system is a late product of change rather than the representative of a primitive stage of the human famnily. This conclusion is strengthened by the fact that similar approaches to the Malayan form are to be found in North American tribes which show no indication of forms of social organisation earlier than those of their neighbours. G. L. GOMME.-Somne Considerations on the Origin of Totemisnm.-The author argued that totemism must have arisen from conditions of human life which were universal, and referred to the migrations by which marihood had spread all over the world as supplying these conditions. Migrations left the sexes differently constituted, the male being the moving element, the female the stationary element. Women in this way became more intimately associated with friendly animals, plants, and trees, and looked to them for food and protective power rather than to the males. This produced a sex-cleavage. Women influenced the totem names given to children, and the Arunta system in Australia and the Semang system in the Malay peninsula were given as instances. Natural exogany would come from difference in totems between the fathers and the mothers. Totemism began as an artificial association of groups of people and was not based on a kinship society. Technology. J. L. MYRES, M.A.-A Ternminology of Decorative Art.-Decorative art, as the subject of anthropological study, needs analysis, on the technological side, in order to describe and define the precise contribution made by the artist's hand to the decoration of the object. So long as the decorative motives are recognisable attempts to represent some actual object, such as an animal or a plant, or part of one, description in general terms is easy ; and, for all beyond this, graphic illustration is inevitable. But in the more abstract, and particularly for " geometrical" types of decoration, the actua[ pro- cesses employed by the artist stand in a more important relation to the completed work. Artistically the effects produced by drawing on the same surface a double series of alternate triangles and the limiting lines of a band of continious chevrons are practi- cally indistinguishable; but technologically their origin, affinities, and potential development are quite different. In such cases the mere graphic reproduction of the ornament is not an adequate description, still less a definition of it. On the other hand, a sufficiently precise terminology would enable a student at a distance to reconstruct from dictationi a pattern which was similar technologically, and actually more valuable for purposes of comparison than a photograph of the original design. [ 143 ]</page><page sequence="6">No. 87.) MAN. [1907. The basis of any such system, applicable to the description of abstract designs, must be strictly technological ; that is, it must be essentially a description (1) of what the artist did ; (2) as far as possible, of the order in which he did it, distinguishing motif from enhancement or filling; (3) if necessary, of the effect produced by the completed work, in cases where this differs from that of the artist's work while in progress. E.g., in figure (a) we have the motif of "' alternate series of reciurrent triangles," leading to a "chevron" efflect; in (c) these triangles are enhanced by "hachure" or " hatching" (a term borrowed from the engraver's art), and in (d) by "cross-batching." In (b), on the other hand, motif and efJect are alike " chevron." In composite patterns the minor elements must be located by reference to the major element which they enhance, or on which they are based, and subsequent phrases must define their relations to each other. The elaboration of such a terminology as is here proposed should, of course, be gradual; it should be based upon careful comparison of terminologies actually employed in the past by expert technologists; and it should conform in its syntax to the approved usages of heraldry, systematic botany, anid the like, which fortunately agree in essentials. It should take account, from the first, of foreign synonyms, and proceed-like other artificial terminologies-partly by the incorporation of brief graphic idioms from the vocabulary of the industries concerned, partly by judicious coinage of words, as in zoology, from Greek or other universal vocabularies. Much may be done in the meantime to fix current idiom by detailed descriptive analysis of some of the commoner geometrical forms, such as the triangle, the wavy line, the spiral, or the plait. A conspicuous instance of the confusioni produced by neglect of " terminological exactitude" is the greater part of the recent literature of basketry; and this is the less excusable, because in the allied art of weaving an ancient, idiomatic, and peculiarly accurate vocabulary exists in nearly every European language. F. H. NEWBERRY and T. H. BRYCE, M.D.-Door-.step Art: A Traditional Folh Art. F. H. NEWBERRY.-The Art Relations. T. H. BRYCE.-Some Remarhs on its Anthropological Bearings. Mr. Newberry stated that the early scribblings of children, though apparently meaningless, may be shown to be instinctive art products. As development, physical and mental, proceeds, the drawings become more purposeful and regulated, and forms are evolved that come under the heading of applied art. Illustrations of such fornis occur in many of the historic styles of ornament, notably in primitive and savage art, and the whole region of " door-step " art is filled with the designs and application of geometrical patterns and drawings created in this stage of artistic evolution. Patterns are produced in infinite variety, and are used chiefly to decorate door-steps, hearths, and the borders of rooms. Describing the chief points of interest in the examples of " door-step " art that have as yet been collected, Dr. Bryce pointed out that the designs are traditional in character, being handed down from generation to generation. They are purely geometrical and conventional. There is no zoomorphic motive and very rarely any attempt to represent natural vegetable forms. The art is practised entirely by women, and is entirely independent of any outside influence. The question arises whether the designs are, as Mr. Newberry interprets them, the expression of primitive art-instinct or whether they are a survival. PROFESSOR W. RIDGEWAY. - The Origin of the Crescent as a Muhammadan Badge. Primitive peoples were in the habit of wearing, as an amulet, claws or tusks of the most powerful and dangerous aniimals. These in time were placed base to base, and the crescent form resulted, and the Muhammadans therefore adopted a pre-existing symbol, and the connection of the crescent with the moon is a later development.
