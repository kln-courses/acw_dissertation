<plain_text><page sequence="1">Pantheism vs. Theism: A Re-appraisal If pantheism is by definition the belief in impersonal deity, then there is little point in exploring any interconnection with personalistic theism. Theism would exclude pantheism, and pantheism theism. To be sure, there are strong reasons why pantheism has insisted upon divine impersonality, and these need to be explored and assessed. That is our task in the first part of the paper, while the second part will introduce a way of considering the correlation of pantheism and theism in a new light. It will presuppose a different way of understanding the temporal modalities, but for the time being, in this first part, we shall make the ordinary assumption that only the present is fully real. The past is no longer, and the future is not yet. I. Pantheism Behind the question as to whether God is personal or impersonal lies the question of individuation. Should divinity be individuated? For many thinkers such as Tillich, this question is phrased: Is God a being? He is emphatic that God is not a being. Superlatives when applied to God become diminutives: God is not a being, even the highest being.1 I shall avoid this language of being because it prejudices the issue whether God should be conceived primarily in terms of being rather than in terms of becoming. God may be an individual in the sense of having a unified ex perience, without thereby being capable of objectification as a being. On the other hand, if divinity is individuated such that there is only one present and transcendent divine individual, by the theistic logic of perfection that individual would be conscious, capable of personal inter action, among other perfections. If divinity is not individuated, pantheistic alternatives become possible. There may be many forms of pantheism, depending on how divinity is interpreted, but they may all agree on this common thesis: divinity is non-individualized.

THEISM: A RE-APPRAISAL 287 If divinity is then non-individualized and universal, it would per meate all things. If objects, they would be derivative from it; if subjects, they would participate in divinity. In Biblical terms, every living thing would breathe the spirit of God. Their finitude, sinfulness, and mortality would preclude them from being gods, but nevertheless they could partake of divinity. This illustration is apt to be misleading, insofar as God's spirit, in the Bible, is thought to be derivative from an individual God, which is contrary to pantheism. I wish to bracket all questions of de rivation at this point, asserting simply that participation in divinity does not thereby make one a god. Note, however, that not only is it unnecessary to derive a god from non-individualized divinity, but participation in non-individuated divinity does not permit the existence of a theistic God, at least not for Western monotheism. If there were such a god, all other participants in divinity would also be gods, as in Hinduism. The Hindu gods are conceived to par ticipate in the underlying impersonal divine substratum of brahman. But this is inimical to monotheism. A pure pantheism would bypass the need for this personal god. Such a god would be limited. As an individual god would be limited by other individuals, both in terms of power and space. As Spinoza saw so acutely, the infinitude of God is called into question as long as God inhabits the same realm as us, which threatens to happen as soon as the traditional distinction between God the creator and the world as product is challenged. In order to make our examination more precise, let us consider two examples; Benedict de Spinoza and Henry Nelson Wieman. This requires some determination of the nature of divinity. Both propose that God be understood as that from which all other beings are derived. This deriva tion is nontemporal and necessary for Spinoza, so God may be designated the non-individuated originative power. For Wieman this derivation is un derstood temporally as a non-individuated creative power. Spinoza is usually not considered as espousing creative power, par ticularly as the word 'creation' hardly appears in his account, and then not favorably. It is customary to understand Spinoza as simply working out the implications of Descartes' famous definition of substance as that which requires nothing else but itself in order to exist. If things are inter related, as Spinoza thought, there could only be one substance, for two or</page><page sequence="3">288 LEWIS S. FORD more substances would be interrelated. If there can be only one substance, God or nature, everything else would have only derivative existence, mostly as modes of this one substance. Yet what prompts Spinoza to adopt, let alone absolutize, Descartes' definition? Descartes recognized that his definition required modification in order to be reconciled with Christian theism. He also recognized that God alone was truly substance by his definition. So he amended his defi nition as applying to God absolutely, and to other substances as requiring nothing other to exist except the addition of God*s creative act. Spinoza refused to accept this qualification. He may have thought that it was simply an ad hoc attempt to reconcile an insight into the nature of substance with traditional belief. The unqualified definition, on the other hand, provides him with a way of overcoming the dualism of thinking thing and extended things by transforming them into aspects or attributes of one cosmic actuality. If Spinoza is primarily understood as a student of Descartes, concerned to overcome difficulties proposed by his master, then his denial of creation is simply an implication of the identification of God with the one substance of the universe. As God is infinite and eternal, so must the world be. On the other hand, Spinoza may have been primarily a critic of tradi tional theism, who found in Cartesian philosophy a way to articulate that criticism in rigorous form. If we try to think of those objections without their Cartesian dress, however, they seem to concentrate on the question of anthropomorphism: God is too much conceived in terms of a human person. We can appreci ate the force of the objection, but question its extent. How much is too much? Surely the old man with a beard has to go. Yet what about will? personhood? consciousness? individuality? The creation of a finite world in time by an infinite, eternal creator requires an act of will. For what is created is less than what an infinite creator could have brought forth. Why this world instead of another? Yet medieval theology also held God to be immutable and eternal, incapable of doing otherwise. How could God create another world, or no world at all without becoming otherwise? Spinoza held the existence of the world should follow from the necessary nature of God, without requiring any factor of will. In claiming that the world has always existed, having no absolute beginning, Spinoza may have been aided by Descartes' notion of God's conserving activity. Descartes held that it required as much power for God to conserve the world in being as to create it. Or we could think of this</page><page sequence="4">PANTHEISM VS. THEISM: A RE-APPRAISAL 289 conservation as creating the world anew in every moment. From this it is but a short step to think of every moment of the world as indifferently either created or conserved by God, extending these moments backward indefinitely. Then this conservation can be understood as the way in which modes are derived from the originating substance to which they belong. The difference between originative and creative power, in terms of which I have specified divinity, primarily concerns novelty. Creation is the origination of something new. If what is created is absolutely new, then it must be created ex nihilo, a notion which is often found to be unintelligi ble. But that traditional acceptation should not preempt all forms of creation. It should designate whatever is in any way new, even if it is otherwise derived from the past. The precondition for novelty, however, is time. There must be the contrast between the old and the new, such that the old is prior to the new. Spinoza, however, ascribes the eternity and infinity traditionally attributed to God to the world as well. Infinite modes following necessarily from the nature of God accords better with his philosophy than time, which has more of the order of appearance. Spinoza's notion of "originative power" in terms of the logical rela tionship between basic postulates and that which can be deductively derived from it deductively provides an important alternative to the tradi tional idea of creation ex nihilo. Classically God was deemed to be immutable, and timelessness is the best guarantor of immutability. (If there is no before and after, there can be no difference between these temporal states, and hence no change.) Yet how can a nontemporal God create a temporal world? Is the act temporal or nontemporal? If temporal, then the actor acts temporally, and to that extent is temporal. If nontem poral, how can it create what is temporal and contingent? Spinoza concludes that it can only create the nontemporal; hence the relationship is best understood in quasi-logical terms. He writes: That which is finite and which has a determinate existence could not be produced by the absolute nature of any attribute of God, for whatever follows from the absolute nature of any attribute of God is infinite and eternal.2 We may affirm the principle that like can only originate or create that which is like (at least with respect to time), but reverse the argument: since what is created is temporal, it must be the outcome of a temporal creative act. There could perhaps be a single temporal act, but since we are witnesses to rich history of emergent novelties, it makes more sense to think of a temporal series of creative acts. Instead of one, problematical</page><page sequence="5">290 LEWIS S. FORD ly nontemporal, transcendent creation ex nihilo, there are many temporal immanent acts of creation building upon past acts. The term 'creation' (bringing into existence) should not be held hostage to the traditional meaning only. Henry Nelson Wieman proposes an understanding of God as non-in dividualized creative power. He reached this conclusion by an inquiry into the meaning of 'God', setting aside traditional preconceptions. God should stand for that which actually operates in human life to save it, that is, to save it from evil and to transform its creative potentialities. Now one could, like John Dewey, suppose God to be a symbol for the unification of the ideals which inform man's actions. This is the best that we can conceive or imagine. Does that preclude the possibility of any transfor mation of our imaginations, Wieman further inquires. We are responsible for anything we can imagine, but not for the transformation of our imaginations. Yet in creative endeavors we are fre quently able to transcend what we have heretofore anticipated. Our appreciation of the good may require further revision. The creative power enabling such transcendence and transformation is the ultimate source of human good. Wieman argues that it should properly be called God. This means that each of us "must hold everything that he is, values, and cherishes subject to the creativity which may transform it. To put any human ideal, however noble, in the way of this creative power is to construct an idol."3 Liberal religion often shades over into humanism. In Wieman's case, however, there is a sharp break, for he identifies an element not our own in human endeavour. Humanism, proclaiming the ultimacy of human ideals, obstructs the opportunity for divine transformation of our ideals. Our present ideals can only be 'created goods' which ultimately cannot guide us to what it is that we really depend on for the good. This is a kind of good which cannot be identified with any created goods but is the creative good which produces all those specific structures of qualitative meaning which we can identify as created goods.4 How should we best characterize this divine creative good? Early in his career Wieman called it 'growth', then 'creativity'. Later he specified it as the 'creative event': In The Source of Human Good, Wieman gives the fullest analysis of the creative event with its four sube vents; the emerging of new meanings, the in</page><page sequence="6">PANTHEISM VS. THEISM: A RE-APPRAISAL 291 tegrating of new meaning with the meanings inherited from the past, the expanding of the appreciable world, and the growth of a wider community of shared qualitative meaning.5 The focus is increasingly on human endeavour. Wieman seeks to set aside larger issues of metaphysics and philosophy. We need only commit ourselves to God as operative in human life. This distrust of speculative inquiry is rooted in his commitment to the empirical method, particularly to that which is empirically testable. Strictly speaking, then, Wieman is not a pantheist. He does not see God as an all-inclusive unity. It is not so much that God is not all inclusive, as that we lack the means of knowing whether God is so inclusive. The fact that Wieman rejects any speculative extrapolation of his theory need not preclude others from making that extrapolation, par ticularly if we can then employ rationalistic criteria to criticize it. In other words, Wieman provides the means whereby God as creativity can be conceived as an all-inclusive unity. In another sense, Wieman is emphati cally a pantheist in affirming a non-individualized divinity. How should this all-inclusive unity be conceived? Spinoza's unity was objective and nontemporal. It had two aspects; (a) The whole includes the part, both spatially and conceptually. Since God is conceived as extended, the whole being of God would include all spatial being as modes of the one substance. Conceptually the universal concepts include the more particular ones as genus includes species, (b) The parts can be said to include the whole, but in a different sense, the way in which the more concrete and contingent included the abstract and necessary. Wieman's unity is to be found in the fact that there is one creativity for all, pervading and operative in all things. This creativity is dynamic, immanent, and temporal, inclusive in sense (a). Spinoza and Wieman may be compared with respect to the distinc tion between natura naturans and natura naturata, nature naturing and nature natured. For Spinoza this is the difference between the one substance (God or nature) and the modes it implicates. The relation is non temporal, between what is original and what is derivative, as between fundamental postulate and the theorems deducible from it. For Wieman, the relation is temporal, creative, issuing into novelty. It is between cre ativity and that which is it creates. For both, however, it is between non-individualized divinity and the world. Alfred North Whitehead also employs the notion of creativity; in fact he may be one of those who originally coined the term.6 Creativity is un</page><page sequence="7">292 LEWIS S. FORD derstood as that activity productive of novelty which all present actuali ties exemplify. In fact each actuality is thought to create itself, at least partially, for it is as an act of self-creation that it instantiates creativity. Each actuality or event is conceived as the integration of all the causal in fluences impinging upon it. While each causal influence contributes to the determination of the actuality, the influences alone do not determine the way they shall be ordered together. There is still the element of self-de termination: However far the sphere of efficient causation be pushed in the determination of components of a concresence [the process of unification]?its data, its emotions, its appreciations, its purposes . . . beyond the determination of these components there always remains the final reaction of the self-creative unity. . . . This final reaction completes the self-creative act by putting the decisive stamp of creative emphasis upon the determinations of efficient cause.7 This notion of self-creation generalized to all events is the reason for Whitehead's alleged panpsychism, although it must be realized that his actualities all have physical as well as mental features.8 I understand mentality quite broadly as the capacity to be influenced by possibilities. It should not be confused with consciousness, which only very complex events possess. To the extent to which novelty is possible, however, there must be possibilities capable of being realized, and these possibilities can influence the process of self-determination. If there were only determina tion in terms of efficient causation, the present could only be determined by the past. From that which is old nothing new could emerge. Self-determination is self-creation, it is causa sui. Actual entit?s satisfy Spinoza's definition of substance, that it is causa sui. To be causa sui means that the process of concrescence is its own reason for the decision in respect to the qualitative clothing of feelings.9 Because of Spinoza's nontemporalist orientation, however, causi sui has a somewhat different meaning. Wolfson says that it primarily means to be causeless, which makes sense if we limit causation to the other-causation of efficient activity. But on a broader understanding of causation it can mean the way something is caused by that which is other than external causation; in Whitehead's case, the way the occasion feels, responds to, and integrates these external causes. For Spinoza, "if a thing be not in itself, it requires a cause to exist." Thus causa sui means that which is fully self-sufficient and requires no</page><page sequence="8">PANTHEISM VS. THEISM: A RE-APPRAISAL 293 other cause to exist; in other words, it is the one necessary divine ex istence.10 For Whitehead, every self-caused actuality also requires exter nal causes, for there must be a multiplicity of inherited factors which it creatively integrates in creating itself as a new actuality. Self-causation and external causes are not antithetical but complementary properties. Whitehead's creativity names the total activity of the present. The past, as already determined, lacks creativity. As the total activity, creativ ity is non-individualized. It is individual only in particular instances of self-creation. By the same token it is neither good nor evil, although indi vidual instances can be either. It is cosmic and all-pervasive, but because it is not necessarily good, it is not divine. Wieman's creativity is divine, for it not only produces novelty but it unfailingly produces goodness. This is particularly evident in his prefer ence for creative good over created goods. What creativity produces may not be the best according to our established criteria of goodness, but this could be a judgment against those norms. If we resist new ideals in the name of old ones, we run the risk of obstructing the transformative power of creativity. We run the risk of idolatry. If Wieman's creativity is necessarily the source of human good, whence comes evil? It can only consist in the human obstruction which thwarts this creative power. Wieman does not speculate on the sources of this obstruction, but it must be some power alien to creativity. If so, it cannot be identified with Whitehead's self-creation. Since Whitehead conceives of creativity in its self-creative instances as all-pervasive, an essential feature of all present activity, it must be more universal than Wieman's notion. While it intends to be cosmic in scope, Wieman's notion of creativity must omit that which obstructs it. If pantheism means that there is an all-inclusive unity, (and if we bracketed Whitehead's notion of God for the time being), his notion of creativity could be regarded as more pantheistic than Wieman's since it is the underlying activity of all present actualities. Wieman's is usually regarded as the more pantheistic, however, because he emphatically rejects the theistic element in Whitehead's philosophy. He was perhaps Whitehead's most enthusiastic supporter in the 1920's, until he discovered that Whitehead affirmed God's subjectivity and consciousness in Process and Reality. He found this to be a superfluous feature of Whitehead's metaphysics, "added on like dome and spire."11 This individualization of divinity undercut Wieman's affirmation of the non-individualized character of creativity.</page><page sequence="9">294 LEWIS S. FORD There is another form of all-inclusive unity to be reckoned with: sub jective inclusion. Past actuality can be included within present experience, perfectly in God's case. Therefore Charles Hartshorne has proposed pa nentheism as a synthesis of theism and pantheism. But subjective inclusion of this sort presupposes individuality, and runs counter to the in sistence upon a purely non-individualized divinity. Because what obstructs creativity must be independent of it, it is plausible to regard Wieman's creativity as an abstract feature of the concrete whole, designating that which in fact turns out to be productive of the new and the good.12 Yet we can also think of this creativity as an actual power surging through all things. But then it becomes highly prob lematic why it should unfailingly produce the good. How can this be, especially if on Whitehead's showing creativity can produce the greatest evils as well as the greatest goods? For him every actuality whatsoever is an instance of creative activity, whether it results in good or evil. There has been a reaction against Wieman on this point by those standing closest to him in the Chicago school. Bernard E. Meland advances the notion of the ambiguous God, if ambiguity be defined as a power which in its moral and aesthetic dimensions is more complex than a singular goodness or a singular unitary structure abstracted from the richness of the creative passage.13 Bernard Loomer's essay on "The Size of God," may be interpreted as embracing this ambiguous power of God. God's creative power is con stantly creating greater stature (size), but this is not unambiguously good.14 Of all the process positions, Loomer's is the most uncompromis ingly pantheistic, although the status of God as good is highly problematic. Meland's "version of the naturalistic God stands between Wieman's singular and undifferentiated goodness and Loomer's undiffer entiated power of nature."15 He argues that Religious commitment should not be given as some form of natural piety to the ambiguous whole within which God is included, but to the sustaining concrete behaviors or structures within the creative passage which produce value.... 16 To differing degrees, Wieman, Loomer and Meland all present cre ativity as divine. This is not true for Whitehead, but it is instructive, particularly with regards to non-Western religion, to examine his notion of creativity as if it were divine.</page><page sequence="10">PANTHEISM VS. THEISM: A RE-APPRAISAL 295 Some Hindus, particularly Advaita Vedantists, can make the asser tion, "I am divine," a claim shocking to many Western ears. Yet it is pred icated on two basic concepts, brahman and atman. Brahman is the underlying divine power whereby the many gods of Hindu piety exist and have their divinity. Hindu tradition recognized something like three hundred million gods. Even if organized in a pantheon of three, Brahma, Vishnu, and Shiva there are too many for exclusivistic monotheism. Hindu tradition in general avoids exclusivism, seeking to unify their gods in terms of an underlying spiritual power. The pervasive impersonal power of Brahman would be quintessential^ pantheistic, were it not for the other gods it supports. Meanwhile in the light of a pervasive belief in reincarnation individ ual Hindus came to understand their selfhood not in terms of the particular lives they were leading, but in terms of the constant features surviving from life to life in endless succession. Thus religious concern was directed toward the realization of the identification of their atman, shorn of all par ticularity, with the divine brahman which sustained and empowered them all. If my atman is part of the brahmanic whole, then I am divine. Translated into Whitehead's terms, this brahmanic creativity is at the heart of each event. I can use this activity of self-creation to further my own particular ends, but I could also seek to discipline myself to become one with the activity itself. That quest opens me up to the same concerns as the Hindu quest. The Hindu quest promises being, bliss, and con sciousness. Whitehead's understanding of creativity promises the dynamism of becoming, for its intrinsic temporality is ever productive of novelty. Buddhism manifests itself in a thousand ways, and it would be pre sumptuous to comment on it in any definitive way. But one influential version may be interpreted in terms of creativity. The quest is for the erad ication of the self. Since the doctrine is often expressed relentlessly in negative terms, it is difficult to determine what, if anything remains at the end of the quest. It most looks like a form of cosmic suicide. Yet in the end we know that the saint has compassion for all sentient beings. Perhaps what is left is pure creativity, with complete openness to others. What is eliminated could be all egoism, all self-centeredness, all individuality, leaving only a non-individualized creativity. This discipline has affinities with Wieman's philosophy. Humans obstruct the creative thrust. The Buddha offers a detailed discipline for</page><page sequence="11">296 lewis s. ford overcoming such obstructive behavior so that the divine can shine through. Neither construe the divine in personal terms, or even in terms of being, in the case of most Buddhist thought. They differ, however, with respect to the value placed on temporality and novelty. II. A Theistic Re-appraisal Whitehead's notion of creativity could be construed as pure pantheism in terms of a non-individualized divinity whose creative power undergirds all present activity, were it not for one thing: he was also a theist who always distinguished God from creativity. Even when God was first introduced as an impersonal principle, God was not identified with creativity, or as it was then called, with the underlying substantial activity of Science and the Modern World. For Whitehead was concerned that any identification of God with the underlying activity, as with an omnipotent creator, would lead to deterministic conclusions. Once creativity was reconceived as the empowerment of self-crea tion, it could no longer be capable of acting deterministically. That threat passed, only to be replaced by another: now that each occasion could act at will, there could be no assurance that self-creativity would proceed in a constructive fashion. Since the net result of the many acts of self-creation would be random, it could not properly characterize the divine. Whitehead writes that in his philosophy creativity is ultimate, and God is its primordial, non-temporal accident.17 That is to say, God is the one non-temporal instance of creativity, where all instances (actualities) are conceived as accidents of this generic activity. Yet what are we to make of the claim that creativity is ultimate? Does this mean that creativ ity is metaphysically ultimate, whereas God is religiously ultimate? That does not do justice to Hindu and Buddhist traditions, for which creativity could properly be deemed ultimate. John Cobb has proposed that God is the ultimate actuality, while Buddhist emptiness is not an actuality at all but the ultimate reality.18 Even if radically different, can we finally live with two ultimates? The more the role of creativity is emphasized, the more God's present activity becomes problematic. Traditionally a nontemporal God creates the world and all that is within it. The demarcation between creator and created is sharp and clear. But what about self-creation? If it is divinely created, what activity remains for the self? Traditionally, creation</page><page sequence="12">PANTHEISM VS. THEISM: A RE-APPRAISAL 297 is an exercise in unquestioned omnipotence. But if divine power is recon ceived in terms of persuasion, the power of activity passes over into the creativity exercised by the individual actuality. Traditionally, the timeless can produce the temporal, but this becomes problematic if the timeless is only a derivative abstraction from temporality. In the end Whitehead proposes a temporalistic process theism. In addition to a nontemporal nature, God everlastingly experiences all that happens, as it happens, in the world. This is a dynamic, temporally con tinuous present synthesis of all actuality, without end. God is thus synthesis of being and becoming.19 This is predicated on the assumption that the forms or eternal objects timelessly exist as uncreated, but that as sumption I question.20 If forms can be temporally emergent, even though purely atemporal if abstracted from all such emergence, the nontemporal side is reduced to the thin shell of metaphysical features all actualities must exemplify. Then God should be reconceived in terms of a single nature, as an everlastingly present reality. Where then is God in relation to all other events? If creativity is ab solutely pervasive, there would be a plenum of finite events. Every portion of spacetime would exercise its own bit of creativity, no matter how feeble it might be. There could be no present space within which God might lurk unmolested. Or if God did, the divine space would be finitized by all the other events crowding in upon it. Whitehead avoided making any pro nouncements as to God's relation to space, but some process thinkers such as Cobb propose that we consider God to be omnispatial.21 Then the cre ativity God exercises would be the creativity of the whole, with finite events exercising the creativity of individual parts. The problem here is that two distinct creativities would be operating within the same event: the divine creativity and the event's own self creation. Now it is possible for there to be two or more successive phases of creation progressively determining the same actuality, the initial ones determining it partially, with the final act completing the determinateness. On the other hand, it seems quite impossible for several acts of creation to operate simultaneously on the same spatiotemporal region. One would determine it one way; the other another. The actuality so created would simply be torn apart, not achieving any sort of determinate unity. Thus if divinity is creative power, and this creative power is non-in dividualized as the creativity which empowers every finite actuality, there seems no room for God as supreme individual creative power. Divine ere</page><page sequence="13">298 LEWIS S. FORD ativity is squeezed out of the present. On the other hand, if creativity is not accorded divinity, we may not be able to do justice to non-eastern religious traditions such as Hinduism and Buddhism. It seems impossible to fully participate in the divine unless the divine be impersonal. Thus we should think of Whitehead's notion of creativity in the present as non-in dividualized divinity, in other words, as a pantheism. As stated at the outset, however, we have been assuming that the present alone is real, that the past is over and the future is not yet. Many students of Whitehead have made that assumption, according the present ontological primacy, such that forms and the past exist only insofar as they are appropriated by present actualities.22 William A. Christian then pro posed that God must be the ground of the givenness of the past,23 which has been found by many to be highly problematic. All this would not be the case if the past were not regarded as ontologically derivative from the present. From another point of view, there has been a long-standing tradition which characterizes actuality in terms of concrete determinateness. For Whitehead, that which is concretely determinate is past, even if just past, for it is the outcome, the result of the present activity of determination. Instead of judging between these two very different notions of actuality, acting and concrete determinateness, both can be accorded actuality within different temporal modes. Acting is that which is ontologically primary in the present; concrete determinateness is ontologically primary in the past. In both cases forms would be secondary as abstractions from what is actual according to that mode.24 While the past could be actual, could God be properly conceived as a past actuality? Only a dead God could be purely past, and this violates all canons of divine perfection. Such a God would lack all subjectivity, as this is dependent upon the creativity of immediacy, and the past is devoid of all creativity. The creativity of determination is exhausted in the process of achieving complete determinateness. No further creativity can be derived from that which lacks creativity. The same is true for the eternal, the timeless, from which no temporality based on creativity can be derived, particularly as creativity involves the emergence of the new. The necessary contrast between the old and the new is necessarily absent from the eternal. Yet if God is squeezed out of the present, and cannot be past or timeless, where could God possibly be? There is only one other al ternative: God's activity is somehow future.</page><page sequence="14">PANTHEISM VS. THEISM: A RE-APPRAISAL 299 This is impossible if the future is the way it is ordinarily conceived. It is either considered as a nothing which will be filled with determinate being once it finally becomes present (and then is no longer future), or as a passive backdrop against which the present lays down conditions on the future, either in terms of the necessities to which it must conform or in terms of the imaginative possibilities we project upon the future. Such a future is either nothing or very passive. Lacking activity, it cannot express divine activity. On the other hand, if actuality is temporally relative, taking on different forms in the present and the past, could not the future mode have its own type of actuality? If we assume that determinate being is primary, as most traditional philosophy does, then there can be no future actuality, since the future has neither independent nor derivative being. Whitehead argues, however, for the primacy of becoming over being. Present activity as the essence of subjective immediacy becomes past being, but it is not itself reducible to being. Subjectivity is undoubtedly real, but as pure becoming it lacks the determinateness of being. Instead of being support ing becoming, as in theories of substance, becoming is the basis for being. Past determinateness is derived from the present activity of determina tion.25 Whitehead restricts his analysis of the subjectivity of the process of determination to the present immediacy of finite actual events or occasions, as he calls them. Could not this account of becoming be extended to the future, giving the future its own form of ontological primacy? In the first place, it is not being anything determinate. At best it is a means of experiencing, not something to be experienced. Also it could be a source of creativity, which determinate beings cannot be. If it exists, it would be a form of becoming. It would be less determinate than present acts of determination, because they must have something to determine further. Unlike present acts, which produce past beings, it could not produce anything determinate. Yet it could endow present events with the creativity for their self-actualization. By this analysis the actuality of the future would be the creativity which empowers each occasion to achieve its self-creation. But is there such an actuality? This depends on where we think creativity comes from. Whitehead suggests it comes from the past: The initial situation includes a fact of activity which is the reason for the origin of that occasion of experience. This factor of activity is what I have</page><page sequence="15">300 LEWIS S. FORD called Creativity'. The initial situation with its creativity can be termed the initial phase of the new occasion. It can equally well be termed the 4 actual world' relative to that occasion [i.e., all past actual occasions influencing it] .... This basic situation ... as a whole is active with its inherent creativity, but in its details it provides the passive objects which derive their activity from the creativity of the whole. . . . Thus viewed in abstraction objects are passive, but viewed in conjunction they carry the creativity which drives the world.26 In this passage from the later book, Adventures of Ideas, Whitehead is no longer content merely to allow creativity to inhere in each occasion. Some further explanation is needed. If so, however, some appeal to an external source is needed. The past is near at hand. Yet how can the past provide such creativity, since every individual past occasion or event is fully determinate it itself? Requiring no further determination, it has no further power of determination. In attaining its objective status it has exhausted whatever creativity it had. Hence Whitehead speaks of the in dividual objects as passive. Nevertheless he claims that the whole is active. His reasoning seems to be: creativity comes from somewhere, and the past is our only source, even though individual past actualities are devoid of creativity.27 On this account, the past seems to be individually inert, collectively active. If both past and future contribute to the present, however, we can distinguish between the past as purely inert, providing the materials which are actively appropriated and integrated by means of the creative power derived from the future. As we have seen, if the future is actual, it must be a reservoir of cre ativity. In order to be what it is, the present requires just such a source. The nature of creativity appropriate to both the future and the present is gener ically the same, but modally different. Future creativity is one, whereas present creativity is pluralized among the many actual occasions. Also, future activity passes along its indeterminate creativity to the present, while present occasions exhaust their creativity in the achievement of objective, determinate being. Present creativity constitutes a non-individualized divinity which excludes any possibility of a present divine individual. To that extent it is pantheistic. The monistic nature of future creativity, however, presents another option. It is capable of being individualized by a single cosmic in</page><page sequence="16">PANTHEISM VS. THEISM: A RE-APPRAISAL 301 dividual, which as individual can also be personal. If the future can be actual, having its own ontological primacy, then the future could be theistic while the present is pantheistic.28 On this view, to be sure, God is not the creator of the world in the ac customed sense. Determinate being is the joint product of divine activity and of the way present occasions create themselves. True creatures are the products of both present and future activity. In that sense the line of de marcation between creation and created runs through the present and the past, not through the divine future and the present. The relation between God and present occasions is not so much creation as emanation, for it is the same creativity that is passed over from the cosmic future to the par ticular present. Thus creation, as bringing into being new events, requires the intermediate phase of emanation infusing the present with its power of self-creation. In emanation the product proceeds from the source, and in some sense is identical with the source. In traditional creation God creates that which is not God. Creativity is a way of trying to make creation intelligi ble. It preserves the production of the new without absolutizing it as creation ex nihilo does. It explains how the new can grow out of the old. Yet how can we explain creativity? Could it be created? If present cre ativity were created by a transcendent act of creativity, would not that transcendent creativity itself need to be created, setting up an infinite regress? The present could only receive its power of activity by an emanation of the same creativity which the future possesses. The interface between the present and future is the occasion's initial phase, which Whitehead described as containing also its (past) actual world.29 It also contains that factor of activity received from the future. Instead of conceiving time as flowing in a single direction, such that everything is received from the past and donated to a future which does not yet have being, we conceive of the present as coming not only from the past but also as coming from the future, such that the synthesis of past beings and future becoming results in the being achieved by the process of self-creation. According to Whitehead's analysis of the process of actualization, the earlier phases are less determinate, the later phases more determinate. Since each actualization is an act of determination, it could hardly be otherwise. This means that the initial phase is the least determinate,</page><page sequence="17">302 LEWIS S. FORD although it contains the occasion's prehensions of all the particular deter minate actualities in its past. What is indeterminate is how they shall be organized together, and how the occasion shall respond to them. Since the earliest phase is the least determinate, we may consider what would be still earlier, according to the order of becoming. This earlier stage would lie in its future as the creative power whereby this transformation can take place. This sense of 'earlier', to be sure, is at odds with our ordinary sense of earlier, which indicates the order of past events (beings). The initial phase, since it contains the interface between the present and the future, affords us with the experience of grace. Bernard Meland has provided us with a meticulous, convincing phenomenological portrayal of the divine interaction with the human in The Realities of Faith30 Since he eschews all further metaphysical speculation, his account is compati ble with Wieman's pantheism, Whitehead's transcendent theism, and our modification. Eastern spiritual disciplines may be understood as efforts to uncover creativity in its purity. Since, however, ordinary present creativity fuels all sorts of finite activities, ranging from the noblest to the most base, and since they are the vehicles for unbridled expressions of human self-will, they are by no means appropriate to this task of purification. The quest for the underlying pure atman in Hindu mysticism would be best directed towards the recovery of creativity just as it comes from the divine future. The overcoming of self-centeredness which is the purpose of much Buddhist meditation could be the purification of all attachments to self decisions within the occasion, enabling it to experience the initial divine creativity without distortion. The interface between future and present may be described pantheistically as non-individualized divinity or theisti cally in terms of God's omnipresence.31 From a theistic perspective, present pantheism is helpful if for no other reason than to offer a way of correlating Western and non-Western religious traditions. In general, I see religions as contingent strategies whereby we can become reconciled with the ultimate. For the most part, there are so many different religions because there are so many different ways by which humans have learned to make their peace with the ultimate. In Western monotheism this ultimate has been conceived as a living person, God. That God is usually conceived in similar terms has not prevented there being many approaches of becoming reconciled with God. Judaism, Christianity, Islam, in all their many varieties testify to this diversity.</page><page sequence="18">PANTHEISM VS. THEISM: A RE-APPRAISAL 303 While from a theoretical perspective there is much unity in the way God has been conceived in Western theism, there are also radically different ways of conceiving the ultimate. I have here touched upon Hinduism and Buddhism as providing examples of the ultimate conceived in terms of non-individuated divinity. Philosophical Taoism of the Tao Te Ching has been proposed as an excellent example of pantheism. The prospects for working towards a common understanding of world religions is greatly enhanced if theism and pantheism can be reconciled. Unfortu nately within the domain of the present they exclude one another. If, however, divinity can also be future, these exclusions may be overcome. From the standpoint of pantheism, what is to be gained? For one thing, it gains a transcendent source of creativity. Is it sufficient to claim that creativity simply wells up within occasions, as a purely immanent source? Whitehead is committed to explaining all the factors constituting an occasion. It will not do merely to say: an occasion just comes with its own inherent creativity. Another important gain is an axiological thrust which is theistically grounded. Wieman insisted that creativity is always thrusting towards a creative good. Whitehead rejected creativity as divine because, as he conceived it, it lacked any valuative direction. This is true of ordinary present creativity as actualized by finite occasions, since it can produce evil as well as good. But it need not be true of future creativity, nor of the way divine creativity impinges upon the present. While God influences the present in terms of the creativity it passes along, in its own subjective privacy God experiences and responds to the world as it unfolds. This subjective dimension of God has been adequate ly depicted by Whitehead. Pantheists no doubt see this divine subjectivity as overly anthropomorphic. It is important to recognize that Whitehead does not simply ascribe human subjectivity to God. Only after God was conceived as temporal was God conceived to be subjectively responsive.32 His argument appeals to the subjectivity of present immediacy in contrast to the objectivity of past determinateness. (I extend this present immediacy to the subjectivity of the future.) Ultimately subjectivity presupposes individuality. Pantheism as non individualized divinity excludes any present cosmic individual, but such individuality is possible as future. And if individuality, there can be sub jectivity, and personhood. Such personhood can be non-anthropomor phically defined as a dynamic, responsive center of value. I have in mind Martin Buber's understanding of persons as embodiments of value. More</page><page sequence="19">304 LEWIS S. FORD precisely, subjectivity is the capacity to respond to contingent circum stances in terms of the values appropriate to them. Divine creativity is not the same as pure creativity. Pure creativity is devoid of value, operative in all actualities whatever. Divine creativity is informed by values emergent from the way God responds to contingent happenings, values which are then passed along with the creativity to par ticular occasions.33 In response to these values, as empowered by the creativity received, individual actualities are enabled to bring about what we experience. In this way God and present occasions create the world anew. Lewis S. Ford Norfolk, Virginia Old Dominion University NOTES 1. This is in sharp contrast to A. N.

In Whitehead's terms, God has two natures, a primordial nature which is comprised of God's conceptual feelings of all eternal objects, and a consequent nature constituted by God's physical feelings of all actual occasions. In this way God exemplifies the principle that all actual entities have both physical and conceptual feelings. 20.

I have challenged its thesis in "Nancy Frankenberry's Conception of the Power of the Past," American Journal of Theology and Philosophy vol. 14, no. 3 (September 1993), 287-300. If creativity were to be derived from the past, its power would run contrary to Whitehead's analysis of prehension. Ordinarily active causes produce passive effects. If this is reconceived in terms of events, however, we have the anomaly of completely past events possessing causal activity. Whitehead placed the activity in present events. Their prehension of past objectified events enabled them to be causally influenced by the past, but the activity lay in the receptivity of present occasions. Instead of the past actively re juvenating present occasions, these occasions actively appropriate the past. Whence comes this power to prehend? Hardly from the past itself, if the present must first empower it to be effective. 28.

New York: Oxford University Press, 1962. 31. In line with my critique of omnispatiality, I do not conceive of God and occasions as occupying the same spatiotemporal regions. But the interface between the future and the present is a three-dimensional, purely spatial, "plane" between two four-dimensional realities. Since this interface pervades all space, it is appropriate to describe it in terms of omnipresence. 32.
