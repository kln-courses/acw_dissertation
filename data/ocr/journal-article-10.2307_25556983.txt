<plain_text><page sequence="1">CIRCA 28 REVIEWS PER KIRKEBY Douglas Hyde Gallery, Dublin 6 May - 8 June, 1985 The surprising thing about this show is that it marks Kirkeby's first appearance in Ireland. He is a Danish artist ? painter, writer, sculptor, film-maker ? whose stature has been recognised for at least a decade on the continent, where his work has appeared alongside that of Baselitz, Immendorf, Kiefer and Fetting. In London Nigel Greenwood has been showing his paintings over the last five years, yet somehow Kirkeby has never there got the attention given to the major German and Italian painters. But for Ireland he is a natural. His concern with place ? local, rural place in particular, his fascination with traditional building materials, his insistence on landscape as a viable mode of making serious painting, and his history of involvement with performance and experimental writing and film-making, all these combine to ensure his relevance for an Irish audience; congratulations to the Douglas Hyde for bringing his work to Ireland. That said, it is an odd show. Outside Denmark, Kirkeby is best known as a painter of enormous brooding, painterly landscapes, and there are three recent (1983) examples of these in the Douglas Hyde, as well as a large five-panel piece made last year. But the remainder of the space is given over to a kind of selective retrospective; in the '60's and early '70s Kirkeby worked on 4'x4' hardboard panels and examples of these constitute the bulk of the show. In addition there are five small bronze sculptures from recent years and, dominating the gallery, a site-specific brick construction (sadly to be demolished when the show closes). The catalogue has been designed as a sort of apologia for Kirkeby's recent brick sculptures (most of which were temporary gallery installations, since destroyed); it does therefore provide a useful and interesting record. But both show and catalogue seem disputatious ? more concerned with arguing for the sculpture and early work than in presenting the best of Kirkeby's recent output ? and this comes across oddly here in Dublin which has no preconceptions or previous experience of Kirkeby. Kirkeby trained originally as a natural scientist, although he began to paint while still studying geology; from early on he was writing poetry, making films and keeping a journal, and a note-taking approach is evident in most of the early paintings on show. In, for example, the 1969 Temple of the Sun the colour of the hardboard is the ground on which are scribbled, painted and drawn various observations and ideas arising from a visit to a Mayan temple: the white hourglass-shaped temple is painted in a simplified personal shorthand and then elaborated with childishly careful detailing of its block construction; in lower left is a ruled and compassed diagram of the sun's movement, elsewhere there are scribbles of polyhedrons or crystal formations, and great green V-shaped brushmarks hover (birds, maybe or foliage) across the frontal plane. It is an attractive and interesting work but, like most of the other small paintings here, it seemed minor, lacking in gravitas, in comparison with Kirkeby's large-scale landscapes. One or two of the small paintings, particularly the one labelled Snakes in Dry Grass and Ruins with its build-up of blocks and linear marks in astonishingly subtle and varied colour relationship, do indicate Kirkeby's strengths; but on the whole I was disappointed that so many were included at the expense of more of the large recent works. Still, the three big horizontal paintings alone are good enough to make the show: Killeberg, Figures in the Evening and Abendstimmung (evening mood) were all painted in 1983. Unlike the small works they are spatially constructed, on the grand scale, from wide bands and blocks of subtle and inventive tone and colour which interlock to give a sensation of heroic landscape. Brooding foreground elements activated by sudden splashes of brilliant colour ? cerulean, white, orange ? open out to apparent distant vistas of dark sky or illuminated headlands. Imagine Claude or Poussin conceiving landscapes seven foot high by fourteen foot wide and handing them over to De Kooning or perhaps Hoyland to paint. But Kirkeby's colour is less sweet that De Kooning's and less brash than Hoyland's. He uses blacks, greys, sour greens and yellows to great effect, manipulating the texture of the paint from wrinkled gloss to wash, and scratching back and overlaying, so that the surface is always alive; he very successfully places patches of lovely blues in surprising places, and introduces whites and viridians where you would least expect them. I wasn't always sure about the streaks of hard orange but in Abendstimmung the horizontal stretch of orange is so apparently naturally anchored by the pink and grey immediately above, which in turn float out from the cool cerulean, ultramarine and chalky emeralds surrounding them, that it operates as a warm suffusion of evening light. In these three paintings Kirkeby achieves an almost halluncinatory presence of place, a pulsating atmosphere that very nearly convinces you that you can smell the smells and feel the temperature of the air against your skin. The one other large painting in the show is New Trees, a work consisting of five vertical panels, each a variation on the theme of staggered upward growth. The colours are cooler and the range narrower than in the horizontal paintings, and I missed the sense of mastery of large expanses which is so exciting in those works. The five small bronze sculptures were tucked away in a darkish corner and I found them uninviting, but that might have been due to awkward positioning. They were all table-top bronze casts of plaster and wood originals, with anthropomorphic titles like Arm &amp; Head, and their pulled and broken surfaces suggested an origin in clay modelling.

Oil on canvas, 2m x 3.5m. They were not unlike De Kooning's small bronzes and seemed to me to have the same problem of establishing sufficient tension between delicately observed but inherently awkward forms on the one hand and very vigorous but not obviously relevant surface action on the other. They were as different as chalk and cheese from the big brick piece, of which my only criticism is that it dominated rather than complemented the rest of the show. It occupied the central space in the gallery, reaching almost to ceiling height, and was designed by Kirkeby with reference to plans and elevations of the Douglas Hyde gallery. At ground floor level it functioned quite pleasantly as a kind of roofless summer-house or folly from which to view the paintings; from the entrance floor above, the viewer could inspect the stepped series of arches which were its main point of interest. It had none of the decorative brickwork arrangements (derived from Danish vernacular tradition) of many of the sculptures illustrated in the catalogue; and in the Douglas Hyde, where one descends to a rather claustrophobic gallery space, it didn't appear monumental or mysterious either ? a building or object viewed from above is rarely awesome. It is Kirkeby's paintings that are awesome; but he is obviously concerned not to be taken for 'just a painter'. Perhaps this is a hangover from the '60s and '70s when landscape painting was considered at best escapist, at worst the domain of the bourgeois amateur. (Except in Ireland, of course, where what Dorothy Walker calls the 'Irish Mist School' continued blithely to ply their palette knives.) But heroic landscape is now very much in favour ? vide the success of Oulton, Le Brun, etc. ? perhaps because of its very uncontroversiality no one has much to say for landscape as a mode of painting, but there is not much said against it either; and too many good painters have worked in it, or from it, like Avery, Bomberg, De Kooning, Diebenkorn, Lanyon, and Nicholson, for its validity to be denied. Kirkeby's strengths in this field are so exceptional that one hopes he will not abandon it in favour of sculpture. Perhaps he could be included in the next Rose to let us see where his independent mind takes his art over the next few years. Jill Nunn</page></plain_text>
