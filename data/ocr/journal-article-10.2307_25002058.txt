<plain_text><page sequence="1">"I WILL NEVER FORGET TO VISUALIZE THAT VAJRAYOGINI IS MY BODY AND MIND." Rita M. Gross This paper continues a presentation begun six years ago at the American Academy of Religion meeting in New York City.1 It is an attempt, within the limits of a secret tradition of initiation, stretching back at least a thousand years and across the cultural frontiers of north India, Tibet, and North America,2 to discuss my acquaintance with Vajrayogini as yidam,3 as my body and mind, as well as the body and mind of the phenomenal universe. I want to reflect here on the contrast and continuity between what I presented six years ago and my current situation. That earlier paper is in some ways very strange, though it has remained one of my favorites. The word "Buddhism" does not appear in the text; nevertheless, it was my first Buddhist paper. It consisted of two parts. The first is an experiential discus sion of finitude and suffering as major challenges to feminist theological theory. The second part is an attempt to illustrate the discursive theological points I was making by reference to an extended contemplative description The title of this paper is a quotation from an important section of the Sadhana of Vajrayogini. This vow is part of self-empowerment done on feast days, which occur on the tenth and twenty-fifth days of the lunar calendar. 1 "Suffering, Feminist Theory and Images of Goddess," Anima 13 (Fall 1986): 39-46. 2 The Karma Kagyu lineage of Vajrayana Buddhism traces itself to Tilopa (998-1069), an East Indian yogi who is said to have had direct encounters with Vajrayogini. The teachings were transmitted to Tibet by Marpa the Translator (1012-1097) who made three long trips to India to learn the teachings. Marpa's chief disciple Milarepa (1040-1123) transmitted them to Gampopa (1079-1153), who is generally considered to have systematized the Kagyu order.Thereafter the teachings were transmitted from generaton to generation by the major leaders of Kagyu order, most of whom are part of the line of so-called reincarnat ing lamas. Thus Chogyam Trungpa, who is one of the leading figures responsible for the transmission of Vajrayana Buddhism to the West, is the eleventh in the line of Trungpa tulkus ("emanation bodies"). Born in East Tibet in 1939, he was recognized in infancy and raised to be supreme abbot of a group of monasteries. After the Chinese takeover of Tibet, he fled and eventually came to the United States in 1970. The story of his lineage is both historical and mythic; historical in the sense that these people existed in space and time; mythic in that these biographies are direct models and inspiration to the student. 3 A yidam is a nontheistic personal deity. Yidam is an important term in my discussion. I will expand on its definition later in this article.</page><page sequence="2">78 Journal of Feminist Studies in Religion of the Hindu Goddess Kali, my favorite then and now.4 The first part is basic Buddhism-what I had been learning through samatha-vipasyana ("mind fulness-awareness") meditation and the study of basic dharma ("truth"). The latter part looks both backward and forward-back to my articles on Hindu Goddesses as a resource for Western feminism5 but also forward in that the description of Kali now reads to me remarkably like a description of a yidam in a sadhana ("liturgical text"). At that point, in 1979, I was about to go off to the three-month medita tion and study intensive known as "seminary" in Buddhist jargon. After seminary, one begins the practice of the Vajrayana preliminaries and then, after completing the ngondro, (Vajrayana "foundations")6 one may begin the practice of the sddhana of Vajrayogini as one's yidam. I did not yet know, as I wrote that paper, so much between the worlds, that a mere eighteen months later she would become my yidam. Sometime during seminary I did figure out that we Kagyu Buddhists do as a serious main practice the sadhana of a female yidam, which may partially explain why I practiced my Vajrayana preliminaries so intensely. The fact that I could have gone as far as I did without realizing that eventually my main practice would involve a female yidam shows how secret these practices are. It also explains why I will not guess at this point, in this context, what the practice connected with Vaj rayogin's consort will involve or bring up. But I also marvel that there is something so organic, such a natural unfolding in the three-yana7 journey, that, on the basis of the training I had already undergone, I was trying to construct some sort of sadhana for myself. I was trying to take the next step in the journey out of longing and my academic knowledge, without even knowing that's what I was doing. However, as I evaluate my own experience, there is a tremendous difference between what I was attempting in my paper six years ago and what is available to me now. Demonstrating that difference will be a major focus of 4 The best discussion of Kali's mythology is found in David Kinsley, The Sword and the Flute (Berkeley, University of California Press, 1975). An excellent selection of devotional poems to Kili is Rampradad Sen, Grace and Mercy in Her Wild Hair (Boulder: Great Eastern books, 1982). The iconographic representation of KAli that I used as a visual aid during my presentation, a devotional poster in my collection, has been reproduced in Rita M.

Vajrayogini is my body and mind" 79 this paper. For me, initiation into Vajrayogini practice was an incredible relief. In fact, I would say, that with the transmission of this practice I found what I had been seeking but always missing by a slight margin in my previous studies of and contributions to feminist theology. I did not know that anywhere in the modern world such practices were available in an unbroken line of oral transmission. No longer was I confined to art books, mythology collections, and my own imagination, coupled with my solitary contemplations and occasional writings. Here was an authentic lineage of oral transmission introducing me to myself and to the world as the body and mind of Vajrayogini-this incredibly powerful, magnetizing red woman danc ing on a corpse, sun, and lotus seat, naked, sixteen, wearing out the samskdric ("habitual intellectual patterns") of egoistic grasping and fixation as a garland of fifty-one heads, holding in her two hands the hooked-knife and kapala (skullcap) of blood-amrta, ("liquor of deathlessness") etc. The details of her iconography mean much more to me and are infinitely more vivid than were my musings on Kali six years ago, but to quote the sadhana text, "to speak is violation.... If this discipline is spoken of immediately I die and rot." Therefore I am not at liberty to quote long sections of the text or give a long description and explanation of her iconography.8 But I have never met anyone else like her and, if I do not forget, she is my body and mind, and the body and mind of the phenomenal world. Instead, what I can and want to do is to present some information about the meditative and ritual practices connected with Vajrayogini and to inter weave this information with some sense of my appreciation of these practices. This appreciation presupposes and is based upon my experience that, unlike the theology and symbolism connected with some other religious symbol systems heavily invested in feminine imagery, the symbolism and "theology" (if one can use that term regarding a yidam, nontheistic energy symbolized in anthropomorphic terms) of Vajrayogini in particular, and the feminine principle of Vajrayana Buddhism in general, is quite compatible with femi nism. In fact, I have found them more healing, more compelling and more cogent than some aspects of feminist theology. Since I have already published my description and feminist analysis of these materials elsewhere,9 it is unnecessary to repeat the basis for my appreciation here. In brief summary, anthropomorphic representations of spiritual reality are routinely pictured as of both genders and the non 8 The most extensive description of Vajrayogini in English, including extensive quota tions from the sadhana text and an extensive discussion of Vajrayogini's iconography, is found in Ch6gyam Trungpa, "Sacred Outlook: The Vajrayogini Shrine and Practice" in The Silk Route and the Diamond Path: Esoteric Buddhist Art on the Trans-Himalayan Trade Routes, ed.

The energies associated with the feminine and masculine principles have nothing to do with conventional gender roles or psychological stereotypes. Nor, in the long run, are either women or men more likely to manifest one or the other principle. The energy personified as female is briefly understood as space and wisdom, while that personified as male is briefly understood as activity and compassion. They are inseparable but never merge and they are co-equally necessary in enlightenment. In my estimation, this facet of Ti betan Vajrayana Buddhism is quite unlike its superficially similar Western counterparts and thus it is not subject to the feminist critique of those symbolisms. In general, the feminist critique of Buddhism finds more fuel in the traditional social and institutional fabric of Buddhism than in Buddhism's theoretical formulations and meditation practices.10 When I received the transmission to become Vajrayogini and to practice her sddhana, I was stepping into an old communal tradition. I received transmission from a (male) guru with whom I would trust my life and my sanity, who is himself, inseparable from the female yidam Vajrayogini-a set of teachings I still try to comprehend completely. He had done this practice himself and had transmitted it in Tibet. He began to transmit the practice to Western students in 1977. By 1981, I was still among the first three hundred Westerners to receive the practice from him. Transmission involved a mag ical and unexpected combination-trust and assurance, combined with a genuine transmission into feminine energy personified in Vajrayogini. I had already begun to trust Buddhism unconditionally as something that provided an important ingredient missing in all previous academic and religious training. But I still thought that my search for a trustworthy, dignified and empowering set of symbols, myths and icons involving female presence would go on alone. Then things came together in a way that I suspect many feminists still trying to reconstruct a broken lineage may well envy. I experi ence in Vajrayogini practice an impressive, all-encompassing, and empower ing representation of enlightened mind in female form. Because this was transmitted to me by a genuine spiritual master, I do not have to struggle to reinvent the wheel, discovering Kali or whatever, and then to spin out some personal private interpretation. And I do not have to be alone or in an artificially separated community to express all this richness. One of my great joys is that I can tap into the energy of the lineage of transmission and do the practice of Vajrayogini communally with both women and men. Participation in an old, well-established tradition that does not offend my feminist sensibilities, a tradition that offers modest spiritual lo Rita M.

Vajrayogini is my body and mind" 81 guidance, and that provides some community, is a special privilege. How ever, it must also be pointed out that the understandings and practices that I describe so enthusiastically and with such appreciation are much more available to me than they were or are to many generations of Asian Buddhist women. The impact of feminism on first-generation Western Buddhism, though largely unnoticed and ignored has been profound.11 It has been said, accurately, that the most significant difference between Asian and Western Buddhism is that when one steps into a meditation hall, one sees both women and men practicing. That is an all-important difference. Without it, Buddhism is not worth transmitting west. Thus the poignancy, urgency and potential of first-generation Buddhism in the West is explosive. Probably the most complete experiences of my life have been occasions of doing the sddhana of Vajrayogini in group practice, an opportunity I do not get often because of my geographic isolation from other Buddhists. These experiences are especially intense at Fire Pujas ("ritual services") at which a group of senior Vajrayoginl students do the practice in a special way, very intensively, for eight or more days. There is nothing like the deep chanting, bells and drums sounding precisely when they should, firelight blazing with offerings, liturgical text, and ongoing visualization. The group becomes as one; subtle shifts in energy are experienced by all and the chanting deepens, slows down or speeds up as one; eventually there is even unity with the phenomenal world and some response and interaction with it, as is claimed in all the books we historians of religions read about shamanism. I am trying to say, impressionistically, because it is difficult to be direct and discursive, that when a ritual or spiritual practice is genuinely transmit ted and practiced something really happens. One is not merely putting in time in a mechanical kind of way. Meditative rituals, properly done under the proper guidance, are genuinely transformative. They do not function merely to relieve the imagined anxieties of anthropological subjects written about by sociologists or anthropologists of religion. The lesson is clear: as highly trained scholars of religion, we need to stop assuming that reduc tionistic explanatory modes utilizing economic necessity, sociological need, or psychological trauma explain what happens in a profound ritual context. Why, scholars might ask at this point, am I so elusive and indirect in my discussion of what happens, so protective of the mysteries? I have addressed the necessity of such secrecy and carefulness in another context. 12 Here let me say only that it is necessary and completely comprehensible if one has any glimmering understanding of the process of transformation and of the nature of oral transmissions. 1 Ibid. 12 "Initiations and Oral Tradition in Tibetan Vajrayana Buddhism," unpublished man uscript.</page><page sequence="6">82 Journal of Feminist Studies in Religion It is also important to state that, despite the immense methodological difficulties engendered by the problem, there is a level of understanding beyond which observation cannot carry one and for which participation complete participation-is a prerequisite. Thus, at a certain level, this paper must fail. No matter what I say about Vajrayogini practice, most of its power and meaning will be missed by noninitiates. Nevertheless, an initiated scholar can say quite a bit; futhermore, I believe something is thus communi cated that cannot be communicated by an uninitiated scholar. I have also addressed this scholarly ambiguity in another context. 13 Vajrayogini is a major yidam for Kagyu Buddhists, often the first major yidam whose sddhana is assigned to the student. The performance of the sadhana becomes a meditation-ritual. I use the term "meditation-ritual" to refer to the fact that the practice involves chanting of the liturgical text combined with use of ritual gestures (mudrds), playing of musical instru ments, making offerings, and use of a rather complicated shrine with many ritual implements upon it. But this ritual process, which can be rather impressive when seen from the outside, is updya ("a skillful method") for generating meditative states of mind, both during actual practice sessions and in daily life. Thus, much more than "ritual" as performance of gestures is occuring. The ritual is accompanied by continuous visualization practice which could never be fathomed or experienced by the uninitiated. The two parts of the practice are equally essential and mutually enhancing; knowl edge of one without the other would be quite misleading. This meditation ritual continuously involves the "three gates" to the phenomenal world body, speech, and mind-which are essential categories in Tibetan Bud dhism. Body is involved through the continuous use of the meditative posture and frequent use of mudrds, speech through chanting or subvocal recitation of the mantra, and mind through the numerous visualizations that occur during a sddhana. What is observable is a small part of the entire process, which is both meditation and ritual, perfectly enmeshed with one another. When doing a sddhana, the above-described type of practice, called utpattikrama or development-stage or simply "form" practice, is begun, ended, and interspersed with periods of formless practice or sampan nakrama, fulfillment stage. This simple sitting practice is similar to basic foundation practices of all schools of Buddhism. The two, sampannakrama and utpattikrama must always be properly balanced; despite the vivid power and attraction of the ritual-liturgical side of sddhana practice, by itself such practice would be quite unbalanced. Such practice is demanding and time-consuming. The full practice, done only twice a month, usually takes six to eight hours. Called "Feast Practice," it involves an additional elaborate liturgy and meditation-ritual and a festive 13 Ibid.</page><page sequence="7">Gross: ". . . Vajrayogini is my body and mind" 83 meal at which torma, (the updya, skillful means, masculine, element made essentially of barley flour) and amrta (the prajnd, wisdom, feminine, ele ment made of liquor) are consumed with other food, often to the accompani ment of music, poetry readings, spontaneously written group poems, and dancing. However, the daily practice, with its alternating sampannakrama and utpattikrama, is itself time-consuming and demanding. No matter the shortcuts and abbreviations possible, it really can't be done in any adequate fashion in less than two hours. A two-hour session does not allow any significant period of time for mantra-recitation. To complete the practice and proceed to Fire Puja, one must complete a million mantra-recitations. One cannot just do the mantra without the accompanying liturgy and sampan nakramas. So completing the practice takes time and effort. Then comes "Amending the Mantra" Fire Puja-the practice of amend ing all one's mistakes. This version of Fire Puja involves eight days of extremely intensive practice at which one's understanding of the phe nomenal world and the self usually increases significantly. So one wants to do more Fire Pujas. Recently, my group has begun to practice a more advanced version of the Fire Puja-the Four Karmas Fire Puja-which involves begin ning to learn about the elemental cosmic energies of pacifying, enriching, magnetizing, and destroying. This practice is also done in eight days that stretch one beyond preconceived limits. One goes back for more because the word "realization" becomes less foreign and exotic. This sadhana is a yidam practice-a practice to which one is initiated only after considerable preparation and only after developing significant devotion to the guru, seen as inseparable from the yidam and the only possible means of introduction of the yidam. A yidam is a nontheistic deity and a personal deity. Both of these phrases need some explanation, which I will try to provide within the limits of my student's understanding and without breaking the samaya ("sacred vow") of not speaking of the hidden things. Visually, yidams are anthropomorphic, but often highly unusual in appearance. They are vivid primary colors, usually unclothed, but decorated and bejeweled, often with multiple arms or heads. To those relatively un schooled in Vajrayana Buddhism, the yidams are primarily available through books on Tibetan art; most books on Tibetan religion and culture are not based on enough initiated knowledge to present any real information about yidams. From these art books one can gain some intuitive hint about yidams, though the accompanying explanations are often vague or even misleading. Yidams are one of the major subjects of the thankas ("religious paintings") and rupas ("religious sculpture") collected by Western lovers of Tibetan art. However, someone who approaches yidams exoterically, through published art, should be aware that the art, which is completely based on spiritual discipline, portrays not only yidams but also gurus and dhar mapalas ("protectors") as well as other visual representations of the spiritual universe of Vajrayana Buddhism. It is relatively easy to tell them one from</page><page sequence="8">84 Journal of Feminist Studies in Religion another once one learns the language, but it could be confusing to the outsider. A yidam is a nontheistic deity. 14 But how does this fit with the general knowledge that Buddhism is a nontheistic religion? By "deity" it is meant that a yidam is an anthropomorphic representation of enlightened mind. It could also be said that, in some sense at least, a yidam is also a self-revealing and self-correcting projection. By "nontheistic" it is meant that this repre sentation is not regarded as an external reference point, as any kind of objectively externally existing reality, or as a savior. Rather these yidams, despite their splendor, are an aspect of updya or skillful method; they quickly bring the practitioner along to realize her own enlightened mind. They are also at the sambhogakdya ("enjoyment body") level, the intermediate "myth ic" level of the trikaya ("triple body of Buddha") between the absolute existence of dharmakdya ("truth body") and the relative and compassionate existence of the nirmanakdya-the form-body of enlightened mind in actual human existence as the guru. Thus the important teachings of the unity of guru and yidam become more comprehensible. The relationship between dharmakdya and sambhogakdya is well-expressed by a line in the text: "though dharmakdya is indivisible like space, rupakdyas ["form bodies"] ap pear individually like colors in a rainbow." They exist; they are very real in the experience of a practitioner and yet they are not solidly, objectively existing forms. Buddhism is very interesting in this regard, since the pos sibility of "deity" is not introduced at all until quite late on the path of spiritual development. One never hears of it at the hinaydna stage and only barely or vaguely at the mahaydna stage, even in devotional forms of Bud dhism. To me this seems to be an aspect of the skillful method (updya) of Buddhism that the notion of deity is brought up only well after the student should no longer be capable of objectifying the deity as a solidly existing independent form or external savior. Nevertheless, in the Vajrayana one meets the yidams. Vajrayogini is usually the first that one meets as a Kagyu Buddhist. Why bring up deity at this point? The anthropomorphic representation of enlightened mind seems to be quite relevant. Every detail of Vajrayogini's iconography means some thing, much as I saw significance in the details of Kali's portrayal in my 1979 paper. But with Vajrayogini I am not guessing or going solely on my own intuitions. She is my body and mind, as the text says. Thus diety in the Vajrayana is an anthropomorphic representation of one's own enlightenment and of the enlightenment of the whole phenomenal world. In the practice one relates with one's self as Vajrayogini and with the world as Vajrayogini. The text states that out of emptiness "instantly I arise as the Jetsun Va 14 For additional information on this point, as well as on Vajrayana Buddhism in general, I highly recommend Chogyam Trungpa, Journey Without Goal: The Tantric Wisdom of The Buddha (Boulder: Prajna Press, 1981).</page><page sequence="9">Gross: '. . Vajrayogini is my body and mind" 85 jrayogini with a red body, with one and two arms," etc. Other parts of the text state that "in the space in front appear clearly the five devis ["god desses"] of the Jetsun Vajrayogifii mandala" etc. Yidam practice in many ways seems to be the ultimate combination of the power of concrete symbolism with the power of abstraction beyond conception. This combination is, of course, in the service of one's personal transformation toward enlightenment by means of seeing one's self and the world as Vajrayogini-female, red, two armed, one-faced, bone-ornamented, dancing girdled by the oceans... The epithets go on and on, arising, with luminosity out of emptiness. Thus a yidam is a personal deity not in the sense that ultimate reality is personal, as in theistic religions, but that this nontheistic deity is intimately related with one's self as one's body and mind as well as one's world. Seeing one's self and ones world as yidam-as an anthropormorphic representation of enlightened mind-is a very interesting and useful practice, though by no means intro ductory or easy. At this point a historic event involving Vajrayogini practice is occurring. It is being transmitted from Asian culture to Western culture. Some day students will do historical research on this transmission just as people now study the transmission of Buddhism from India to the rest of Asia. I feel that scholars should not let this historic event slip by unnoted but should be examining this phenomenon as it occurs. There are now about a thousand people in the Vajradhatu15 sangha ("Buddhist community") doing this prac tice and probably some students of other teachers are also doing the practice. As previously stated, this is an old, well-established practice, undoubtedly constructed and preserved mainly by men, many of them monks. It is interesting that such people-mainly monastic males-would determine that the first yidam practice should involve a female yidam and the development of one's feminine energy. Why this practice must be first and some of the meanings of feminine energy in Vajrayana Buddhism are topics I have addressed elsewhere. 16 Here I simply want to point out the amazing fact that a new religious development is occurring here, now. This is probably the first time that this practice has been done so extensively by lay people and by women. At this point almost everyone in the Vajrahatu sangha is a house holder and well over half of the sddhakas ("sadhana practitioners") are women-a fact that is much noted and commented on. What happens when large numbers of laywomen practice a spiritual discipline largely designed by and for men? For that matter, what happens to Western men, raised in a chauvinistic culture, who find themselves being asked to develop their feminine energy and feminine being as an essential stage of their spiritual development? The practice is identical for women and men. Are the effects similar or different? 15 Vajradhatu is an international group of meditation centers under the direction of Ch6gyam Trungpa. 16 Gross, "The Feminine Principle."</page><page sequence="10">86 Journal of Feminist Studies in Religion I cannot say since I have not done the kind of research that would yield such answers. Furthermore, in this context, I do not wish to divulge what male friends have told me about their experiences of being Vajrayogini, beyond saying that they find it a positive experience. As a feminist, I cannot help but feel strongly, that such a practice could be a wonderful device (updya) for undoing a bias toward male superiority. This yidam practice, combined with the continual emphasis on gentleness and nonaggression which in the Buddhism I experience is not something preached by men and practiced by women-does not provide a very viable basis for chauvinism. And indeed, in my experience, though Buddhist men often have many misguided notions about feminism, they are not chauvinistic compared to the norm. Women seem to do very well with the practice, as evidenced by their large numbers in the ranks of senior students. In fact, a widespread impres sion in the Vajradhatu sangha is that women are, typically, much better practitioners than are men. One wonders, then, why, historically, their avenues to practice have been largely blocked, but discussion of that topic is a different paper. Not only are women now highly regarded as practitioners, but Buddhist women are generally much stronger and more self-determining than is the Western cultural stereotype. Many of them are not only senior students, but also highly regarded teachers and meditation instructors. Though the record of accomplishment is less impressive, there is also a widely perceived need for and some success at having women in important administrative positions in Vajradhatu. I will turn now to a discussion of the effects I experience from this practice, insofar as I can determine them. Some of the effects are what I expected, others are quite surprising. First, it is important to state that, however compelling and entrancing Vajrayogini practice may be (and it is experienced that way by virtually all students), this practice is not a relief from one's painful and troublesome patterns. Instead they become more vivid because one is so much more sensitive. That too is a virtually universal experience. Samsara ("cyclic existence") must be worn out; it cannot simply be repressed, and the wear and tear can be overwhelming. The obvious enthusiasm I express for this practice should not be confused with the idea that it brings a one-sided happiness, a dualistic happiness opposed to du alistic sorrow. Rather, by bringing up and including everything, this, like all genuine spiritual practices, begins to take one beyond that distinction al together. Second, as I expected, I find it incredibly empowering to have a practice of a female yidam. Though I have now chanted the liturgy literally hundreds of times, it is a rare occasion when I am not aroused and moved by some part of the text and the practice, despite real experiences of boredom and tedium. Much of the power of the experience relates to Vajrayoginrs femininity and the</page><page sequence="11">Gross: ". . . Vajrayogini is my body and mind" 87 way that empowers me. She is so strong and beautiful, so fierce and compas sionate, so permeates everything; she is my body and mind. This empower ment, however, involves a subtle edge. It is important to be clear about what is being empowered, what is being undercut, and how Vajrayogin's femininity relates to both. The point of yidam practice is definitely not to empower ones samsaric ego, one's conventional habitual patterns, at whatever level of development they occur. As much as possible, one arises out of emptiness as Vajrayogini, i.e., as all that she symbolizes-not as Rita Gross, or whomever, feeling empowered by identification with a powerful transcendent other. She empowers me-but not me as any conventional or limited identity whatever. She empowers me as seed of enlightenment, no one in particular, neither female nor male, neither feminist nor nonfeminist, and yet without limit. What are the links between the empowerment contained in Vajrayogin's femininity, what she empowers and what she does not? This practice was not designed to solve the problems inherent in Western patriarchal religion even though it has done that for me. Why? I believe that this has something to do with both the misery of being female (or male) in the context of patriarchy and with the healing power of nonpatriarchal, nonsexist an thropomorphic symbolism. It is impossible to avoid anthropomorphic and, therefore, genderized representations of ultimate reality.17 Under pa triarchal monotheism, we have lived for millenia with a supposedly nongen derized but highly male deity. Clearly, most feminist theology agrees that this is not healthy. It is not so clearly agreed that a better set of symbols and spiritual practices are essential to the healing process, but I have always found them to be completely necessary and more useful than conceptual abstractions, even though they are so difficult to find. Then I was introduced to Vajrayogini. However, though Vajrayogini does empower me as female, clinging to that empowerment and fixating on it would undo much of the attainment, at least from the Buddhist point of view. Though this practice heals, to some extent anyway, it also constantly pulls one further rather than encouraging one to rest where one is. Thus in a sense, a feminist comforted by this practice, will also be pulled beyond feminism, which does not mean that one is no longer a feminist. It only means that one no longer creates an "ego" (used in the Buddhist sense of a defense mechanism against basic existential groundlessness) out of being a feminist. That is quite simple, liberating, and useful. Lastly, I did not expect that combined with the sense of empowerment, would come such a sense of longing for completion, and going further, such longing to meet the consort and unite with the phenomenal world, such 17 Rita M. Gross, "Steps Toward Feminine Imagery of Deity in Jewish Theology," in On Being a Jewish Feminist, ed. Susannah Heschel (New York: Schocken, 1983), pp. 234-247.</page><page sequence="12">88 Journal of Feminist Studies in Religion longing to learn more about the compassionate activity that is spacious wisdom's partner.18 This feeling developed slowly and organically, almost unnoticeably; it has only become apparent and vivid in the last year, since I completed the counted practice and began to do Fire Pujas. This develop ment makes a lot of sense to me when I think about the unfolding of the path. Developing one's feminine energy is understood as developing the space in which enlightened activity can arise. Besides empowerment, that feels like devastation, which is precisely what is happening to ego or conventional mind and beliefs or any finite resting point on which one might attempt to land. Having opened up and given up at least to some extent, one has gone through an important process-and then there is the waiting and the long ing, which feels to me precisely right. At this point I am curious to find out what I will be like to meet and become Vajrayogin's consort in addition to being her, for clearly, one does not stop being Vajrayogini when one takes on the Cakrasamvara practice. Within six years I hope to have more to report. In conclusion, I will summarize some of my central impressions of being a woman initiated into this particular tradition involving the feminine princi ple. First, I feel extremely lucky to have had the karmic connections to find an unbroken lineage of transmission into such a spiritual discipline as the practice of Vajrayogini. The solace of being able to share communally with both women and men and to experience the leadership of teachers whom I feel to be trustworthy is one of the great joys of my life. I am so glad that I do not have to invent spiritual disciplines adequate to a feminist, so unre lievedly, one pointedly glad, that nothing I could say would convey the gratitude. Secondly, I feel both privileged and burdened to be among those pre serving this tradition and establishing it in the West. It is awesome to realize that a spiritual practice of such power and relevance, which arose in India more than a thousand years ago and survived only in Tibet for many hun dreds of years, is now being transmitted to and possibly preserved in one's own culture. And it is exciting to be one of the little cogs, one of the few out of 220 million in America, involved in that process. Most of us senior students feel that this particular generation of student-practitioners is critical in history. How did it happen that out of the devastation of Tibet came one teacher who could speak extremely accurately to the Western world and that we several hundreds are among his senior students who will be important in establishing or destroying Vajrayana Buddhism in the West? If there are miracles, that is a miracle-or else it is karma and karma actually operates, rather than being merely an Indian concept. Who knows? Finally, I personally feel very strongly about the "auspicious coinci 18 For those unfamiliar with Vajrayana symbolism, space and wisdom are the essential traits of the feminine energy personified in Vajrayogini.

Each of my last several AAR papers has dealt with that topic. 19 Time does not diminish my sense of urgency regarding this confluence of events. For the first time in many millenia, we have the chance to combine a deep spirituality with a nonsexist, egalitarian access to that spirituality. For Buddhism, even Va jrayana Buddhism, despite the importance of Vajrayogini, does not present such a historical model. Fewer, many fewer, among the senior students, perceive this need, not only to establish Vajrayana Buddhism in the West, but to establish it in a definitively nonsexist way. And so all the communal joy I tried to convey in this paper also has its lonely side. 19 A discussion of this topic is contained in my "Buddhism and Feminism: Toward Their Mutual Transformation."</page></plain_text>
