<plain_text><page sequence="1">VOLUME LV, No. 22 OCTOBER 23, 1958 THE JouRNAL OF PHILOSOPHY SYMPOSIUM THE PRESENT STATUS OF NATURAL THEOLOGY I. THE PRESENT STATUS OF NATURAL THEOLOGY IF we consider the status of natural or philosophical theology within the present philosophical or theological situation, three distinguishable problems confront us. There is first the rejection of all theological and metaphysical thought from the standpoint of logical empiricism and certain related types of analytic philosophy. From this extreme position natural theology has no legitimate status whatever since it falls beyond the boundary of cognitive significance. Whether all so-called analytic philosophers would accept this extreme conclusion is difficult to say, especially in view of the fact that the substantive position as regards the truth of religion and theology held by those who approach them through a study of language is often very far from clear. Secondly, there is the rejection of a philosophical approach to theological questions from the standpoint of the purely Biblical or dogmatic theologian. Here the use of philosophical concepts and methods is looked upon as a violation of the rights of theology, and the claim is made that the content of the Judeo-Christian religious tradition is unique and discontinuous either with ordinary experience and knowledge or with the conceptual framework of any philosophical system. Natu- ral or philosophical theology is thus set at such a distance from the classical religious tradition and its theological expression that there is no point of contact between the two. As those following the lead of Barth would say, there is no identity of meaning whatever be- tween the use of the term "God" by the Biblical theologian and its use by the natural theologian or metaphysical interpreter. Moreover, there is no way from the world and human experience to God. Thirdly, there is a more subtle problem presented which concerns not the rejection of a philosophical or natural theology from some outside dogmatic point of view, but rather a most sig- nificant difference in approach among those who accept the legiti- macy of philosophical analysis and argument in the treatment of theological questions. The difference is that between the onto- logical-religious approach represented by Tillich on the one hand 925</page><page sequence="2">926 THE JOURNAL OF PHILOSOPHY and the cosmological-scientific approach represented by Tennant on the other. Each way allows for some form of critical or philo- sophical treatment in confronting theological questions, but they rather sharply diverge as regards the exact nature of this treat- ment. The difference is not precisely the same as that traditionally existing between the ontological and cosmological arguments, since one of the issues dividing the two is the status of inference or argu- ment in the theological domain, and whether the proper import of the ontological approach is understood if it is taken as an argu- ment in the same sense as is characteristic of the cosmological arguments. In order to keep the discussion within manageable proportions and, even more important, to raise substantive ques- tions of philosophical theology rather than the question of its possi- bility, it is advisable to concentrate upon the third problem and to devote but brief comment to the other two. As the historical development of logical empiricism plainly shows, the basic meaning principle upon which it rests cannot be justified without the employment of an argument that is circular in the vicious sense or a persuasive appeal to the need for clarity if we are to have successful communication. On the other hand, the alternative of claiming that the positivist principle is in effect a recommendation for the use of language is generally thought to be too weak. Positivists want to do more than define the term "meaning"; they want to make a normative claim for their prin- ciple in accordance with which it is more than one proposal beside others for the use of language. But this normative claim is just what cannot be directly supported. In so far, then, as the rejection of theological discourse as meaningless is based upon the positivist meaning criterion, this rejection must itself be rejected as dog- matic. In doing so, however, we still leave undetermined the status of those approaches to theological questions through the analysis of religious language which are not admittedly based upon any explicit positivist meaning criterion. The discontinuity thesis of much current Protestant theology involves the denial of any rational way to God from either the cosmos or man's experience, and the consequent irrelevance of phi- losophy for theological inquiry. This position is mistaken in at least two important points. First, it can give no valid argument for holding that a God who in the religious tradition is conceived as having created man and nature cannot in any way be known through those creatures. Secondly, this position cannot con- sistently maintain that it avoids all appeal to philosophy and to natural knowledge in the elaboration of its religious doctrines. We have but to scrutinize any doctrine asserted within the frame-</page><page sequence="3">SYMPOSIUM-NATURAL THEOLOGY 927 work of the allegedly pure Biblical theology in order to discover its dependence upon concepts derived from both general experience (often presupposed as the "'common sense" meaning of a term) and philosophical refinement. For example, one of the most significant contentions of current neo-Protestant theology concerns the claim that the Christ repre- sents the unique, final, and only genuine revelation of God. In order to state this doctrine it becomes necessary to employ the con- cept of the unique. This concept at once involves intricate philo- sophical issues, and the theologian, no matter how rigorously he tries to confine himself to Biblical material alone, requires a philo- sophical theory at this point and such a theory is not available to him wholly from the religious tradition of revelation within which he works. The theologian who hopes to avoid involvement in gen- eral metaphysical problems by remaining within the confines of revealed fact is in no better position than the logical positivist. Neither can avoid either implying or asserting some thesis of a metaphysical sort which has alternatives of the same logical type. In confronting the purely dogmatic theologian, it is sufficient to show that in the very execution of his own project he is already involved in philosophical thought and is dependent upon that same appeal to general experience which it is his expressed aim to avoid. To the third or central problem of this symposium we may now turn. The issue more precisely stated concerns the distinction and relative merits of the ontological-religious way of approach and the cosmological-scientific line of argument. In order to focus the dis- cussion most clearly we shall take Tillich as representative of the former way and Tennant as representative of the latter. It will be most instructive to compare their views in the following respects: (1) their points of departure; (2) their conceptions of the source of the idea of God and their views concerning the relation between religious and philosophical elements; (3) their views of the nature of reason and its function in the theological context. I. THEIR POINTS OF DEPARTURE The point of departure for the ontological-religious type is the self, its consciousness both of its own being and of truth as pre- supposed in every inquiry and especially in critical doubt and questioning. In describing this way of approach as Augustinian, Tillich says of the scholastic developers of the position:- The Franciscan school of the 13th century . . . developed the Augustinian so- lution into a doctrine of the principles of theology and maintained . . . the ontological type of the philosophy of religion. Their whole emphasis was on</page><page sequence="4">928 THE JOURNAL OF PHILOSOPHY the immediacy of the knowledge of God. According to Bonaventura " God is most truly present to the very soul and immediately knowable; he is know- able in himself and without media. ... 1 It is important to notice that for this way the religious conscious- ness is presupposed; there is no going outside the self and its aware- ness of itself in order to find a proper beginning for reflection. "Enter the inner chamber of thy mind" is the first and chief text, and the aim is to discover or, better, recover the presence of God in the form of some ultimate such as truth immediately grasped. In referring to the eternal light as it appears in the logical and mathe- matical axioms and in the ultimate categorial notions, Tillich says, "These principles are not created functions of our mind, but the presence of truth itself and therefore of God, in our mind." 2 Hence through a process of reflection initiated by the individual self there is attained a recovery of what is always there and some- thing not confined wholly to any individual self. "These ultimate principles," Tillich continues, "and knowledge of them are inde- pendent of the changes and relativities of the individual mind; they are the unchangeable, eternal light." 3 There is a mystical element in this conception in virtue of the fact that the first prin- ciples are said to carry immediate evidence with them whenever they are noticed; Tillich sometimes describes this element as an apprehension of a point beyond the split of knower and known. To say that the religious consciousness is here presupposed is to say that the identity of this immediately grasped ultimate with God is already assumed. Thus God is said to be present in the apprehen- sion of the first rational principles; in the apprehension of the Holy; in the apprehension and acknowledgment of unconditional obligation. Since Tillich and Augustinian tradition generally understand the apprehension required as part of a reflective proc- ess which can be carried through only by each individual for him- self, the necessity of starting with the self is easily seen. The point of departure for the cosmological-scientific type is, on the other hand, the world of limited things and processes as they are known both through ordinary experience and the precisely formulated knowledge of the natural sciences. This way of ap- proach, often called the "way from Nature to God," begins the 1 Paul Tillich, " The Two Types of the Philosophy of Religion, " Union Seminary Quarterly Review, Vol. 1, No. 4 (May, 1946), p. 4. What Tillich is here calling " philosophy of religion " would be called by some " natural theology," although there are some who would reserve the latter term for the cosmological approach upon the assumption that it alone confines itself to the " natural " world and avoids " revelation. " 2 Ibid., p. 5. 3 Ibid., p. 4.</page><page sequence="5">SYMPOSIUM-NATURAL THEOLOGY 929 quest with a world of fact beyond the self, although this world is often said to include man as well. One of the problems to be con- sidered is the precise extent to which man and the whole range of his experience are excluded from or included in the starting point as part of the "nature" with which we are to begin. However this question may be decided, it is essential to distinguish within this general approach between starting with the fact of existence as given with finite things and starting with some particular char- acter of what exists. In the former case we have the approach through the contingency of existence as such, while in the latter case we are concerned not with the general fact of existence, but with the particular character of the natural world-that it forms an order of nature and presents an adaptation of structure and function which suggests that it is the work of a designer. F. R. Tennant, in his most comprehensive work, Philosophical Theology, has given systematic form to the cosmological-scientific approach in the second sense. His program is to defend a refined form of the argument from design under the title of a cosmic teleology. If the first way of approach begins with the self and presupposes the religious consciousness, this second starts with physical fact and presupposes the validity of science as a method and its picture of the world. "Natural Theology," says Tennant, describing his own approach, "sets out from facts and inductions; its premisses are as firmly established and as universally acknowledged as any of the stable generalizations of science." 4 And in so characteriz- ing his starting point Tennant means to claim that his approach is empirical and that it is not to be confused in any particular with that rational theology which, on his view, begins not with actuality but with a priori conceptions. "The empirically-minded theologian," says Tennant, ". . . would let the Actual world tell its own story and offer its own suggestions; not silence it while abstractive speculation . . . weaves a system of thought which may prove to conflict with facts." 5 In claiming to start with experi- ence, it seems clear that Tennant understands the term in the sense of the classical British empiricism in accordance with which experi- ence means the domain of sensible appearance. What is not so clear about his starting point is the status of man within the actual world aud the experience with which we are to begin; he often claims that this world includes man, but if this is true we may still entertain doubts as to the terms upon which man is taken into account. The central question is whether Tennant 's conception of experience is broad enough to permit consideration of the whole 4 Philosophical Theology, Vol. II, p. 79. 5 Ibid., Vol. II, p. 78.</page><page sequence="6">930 THE JOURNAL OF PHILOSOPHY range of distinctively human experience made possible by the fact that man is a subject or whether man will be included only as one object beside others in virtue of the fact that the scientific knowl- edge with which we are bound to begin is incapable of regarding man in any other way. II. THEIR CONCEPTIONS OF THE SOURCE OF THE IDEA OF GOD AND THEIR VIEWS CONCERNING THE RELATION BETWEEN RELIGIOUS AND PHILOSOPHICAL ELEMENTS Tillich's ontological approach aims at relating the "two Abso- lutes"- the God of the Judeo-Christian tradition and the philo- sophical conception of Being-in some determinate way. The most important consequence of this attempt for the present topic is that the idea of God is taken over from the religious tradition and is not the result of any induction from the facts of the known world. This does not mean that God is understood in any simple-minded or anthropomorphic way or even that the religious understanding of God undergoes no modification when it is expressed in olitological terms. It does mean, nevertheless, that the idea of God's nature is not derivative from the nature of the cosmos and is not sub- sequent upon an examination of what would be required for ex- plaining the existence of the world of finite things. Instead, the idea of God is presupposed as being given through the religious consciousness, and it becomes identified with Being itself by means of the concept of truth. In referring to what he has called the "two Absolutes" Tillich tells us: They coincide in the nature of truth. Veritas is presupposed in every pllilo- sophical argument; and veritas is God.6 Absolutely essential to and even more basic than any of these con- cepts stands the concept of the Ultimate or the Unconditioned; it is the presence of this common concept that enables Tillich to find a point of contact between the two sides. Both the philosophical quest and the religious affirmation find their essence in an ultimate that is unconditioned; this is, as in Kant's description, the condition or ground upon which everything depends while it is not itself con- ditioned by anything outside itself. Although the Ultimate forms the common ground for the synthesis of God and Being, we must not overlook the fact that each of these concepts possesses its own content from its own side. Thus God is understood in accordance with the classical Judeo-Christian conception, and Being is under- stood as that power in all things which makes them what they are and enables them to maintain themselves against the threat of dis- 6 Tillich, op. cit., p. 4.</page><page sequence="7">SYMPOSIUMI-NATURAL THEOLOGY 931 solution and distortion. The two Ultimates are made to coincide in a point which is described by Tillich sometimes as the point of identity beyond the split between being and knowing and sometimes as the prius which cannot be, directly expressed without introducing a point of non-identity into the formulation. Metaphorically, the prius represents the light itself in which everything is seen, al- though it is itself not always noticed as such and cannot itself be described in the same manner as finite things seen in and through it. For this approach the religious tradition and the philosophical enterprise are seen both as distinguishable and as related in an essential way. Neither is derived from the other but they are made to coincide in a point. The serious question which presents itself is this: since the idea of God is already presupposed from the re- ligious tradition and the contribution from the side of philosophy is rigorously confined to the ontological principles, what place if any can be given to nature and to cosmological description; in short, how shall we avoid the conclusion that the ontological approach, starting as it does with the self and attempting to reach God, is but one more doetrilne of God and the soul with nature left out of account? Moreover, what possibility is there in this approach for our knowledge of the natural world to enter into the description of the divine nature, and for our continuing experience both of the world and ourselves to exercise any critical influence upon tradi- tional conceptions, both religious and ontological? These are ques- tions to which we must return. Tennant's cosmological approach is distinguished by the fact that he refuses to begin with any idea of God derived from an historic or "revealed" religious tradition or indeed with any con- ception of God which he takes to be a priori. In this regard he states: The classical proofs of the being of God sought to demonstrate that there is a real counterpart to a preconceived idea of God, such as was molded in the course of the development of religion. . . . The empirically-minded theologian adopts a different procedure. . . . The expticanda which he investigates, and the results of his investigation, alone will determine the content or essence of the explicative idea of God to which he is led, as well as the grounds for belief that such an essence exists.7 According to this view the substantive meaning of the concept of God 8 is wholly derived from the facts which serve as a basis for 7 Tennant, op. cit., Vol. II, p. 78. 8 It is interesting to notice that Tennant claims to borrow from religion no more than the name when he identifies as God the Being required for ex- plaining his cosmic teleology (Vol. II, p. 121). This is legitimate only if we can defend the thesis that proper names are purely denotative and without connotation; I believe that this cannot be done.</page><page sequence="8">932 THE JOURNAL OF PHILOSOPHY the inquiry and there is said to be no initial dependence upon re- ligious considerations. Thus such concepts as creation, eternity, infinitude, perfection, and others can have no meaning for this type of theism which they do not receive from the cosmological facts re- quiring explanation. And although it is claimed that man no less than the world forms part of the starting point for this type of theology, there exists within it no tendency to allow man's religious dimension and experience to dictate the meaning of the theistic concepts. This is not to say that man is excluded altogether from the facts which determine the content of the divine idea, but Ten- nant is inclined rather to confine himself to the moral or esthetic aspects of human experience and to admit the religious only after his empirical theism has been established. In this regard religion may be said to be postponed or left out of account until the con- stitutive idea of God has been elaborated; it is then introduced only as a means of enriching and enhancing a theistic idea which it had no hand in shaping. God appears primarily as the explana- tion of the world conceived as a certain type of teleological system, and theology stands not as a discipline co6rdinate with philosophy or the theory of being but rather as an extension of or extrapolation from science. "Teleology," says Tennant, "is therefore a devel- opment from science along its own lines." 9 The difference be- tween Tillich's view and that of Tennant becomes particularly sharp and profound at this point; whereas Tillich tries to synthesize the ontological and religious ultimates, Tennant works not at all with ontological conceptions but begins instead with science and attempts to establish God as the explanation of the cosmic teleology; he then brings in the beliefs of the historic religious tradition as "the final phase of natural religion." Thus he does not confront the issue as to the identity of the two ultimates, although it is clear that he assumes and accepts this identity. III. THEIR VIEWS OF THE NATURE OF REASON AND ITS FUNCTION IN THE THEOLOGICAL CONTEXT The relevant distinction on this head between the two views we have been considering can be stated succinctly. The ontological way is the way of immediacy where apprehension, understanding, and acceptance are all one, and certainty comes, as Tillich says, "out of the things themselves without a medium. " This is intuitive rationalism operating, as in the Platonic dialectic, to bring the mind to a recognition of what was there all along but is only noticed upon reflection. For this approach God as the Unconditional or verita,s is the basic certainty and, as such, not a matter of faith; 9 Ibid., Vol. II, p. 120.</page><page sequence="9">SYMPOSIUM-NATURAL THEOLOGY 933 the "risk of faith" of which Tillich speaks refers not to any un- certainty or probability in the awareness of the Unconditional but rather to the relation between it and the world of contingent things including human life. Faith and its risk enter when the Uncondi- tional is identified with some concrete embodiment such as Jesus or the "God of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob." Throughout, however, there is a careful avoidance of any explicitly inferential process; the function of reason is that of grasping and understanding, not that of mediated proof. In keeping with this doctrine Tillich speaks not of the ontological argument but of the ontological way or approach. The cosmological way is that of inference from certain charac- teristies of the cosmic order to the being of a divine intelligence. Reason here appears in a discursive function, and whatever special thought processes may be involved in the performance of this func- tion, the basic consideration is that a mediated conclusion result and that this conclusion carry with it some coercive force. Unlike older proponents of the cosmological way, Tennant does not main- tain that the argument of empirical theism is demonstrative in nature. Demonstrative proofs are, in fact, criticized and rejected with the result that the final rational basis of this form of empirical theism is in "a cumulative argument for a reasonable, if indemon- strable, teleological interpretation." 10 Thus, though mediated ar- gument continues to be relied upon as the only possible rational ground, this is frequently taken to mean "common reasonableness"; and, in one place at least, we are told by Tennant that in using what he calls the esthetic argument for theism it "becomes more persuasive when it renounces all claim to proof and appeals to alogical probability." Thus, reason in the theological domain does not issue in deductive proof but rather in reasonable explana- tion, and as such it is said to provide a sufficient ground for reason- able belief. If the ontological way starts with an initial certainty and encounters uncertainty when it attempts to relate its basic ap- prehension to the conditioned and contingent world, the cosmologi- cal way starts with initial probabilities and tries to attain certainty through the cumulative force of mediate argument. First, as regards the respective starting points, the ontological way has a certain advantage. Since the idea of God cannot fail to contain some conception of the identity of thought and being or at least of their internal relatedness, we are driven at once to ask where there might be found some apprehension of or analogue for this identity. Whether such an identity is to be found in the world 1o Ibid., Vol. II, p. 83. II Ibid., Vol. II, p. 91.</page><page sequence="10">934 THE JOURNAL OF PHILOSOPHY beyond the self or not remains open, but it is clear that if there is to be an apprehension of it, we shall find that, if anywhere at all, only in ourselves. The only point at which we find the togetherness of thought and being directly is in man; we are led to the self as a starting point. In man as an existing being, however, the idenltity is not fully exhibited, since the being of man is not identical with his thought. But if the identity is not in man himself, may it perhaps be found present in a thought which is capable of being grasped by every individual? Such an identity is given to us, as the Platonic-Augustinian tradition has always held, in the logical and mathematical principles which are constitutive. We have at this point an apprehension within the mind of the required identity, but, and this is the crucial difficulty with the ontological approach, that this identity is God or the presence of God is not itself a matter of further insight. When it was said previously that the idea of God must contain some conception of the identity of thought and being, the necessity involved can be but an intensional one taking us back to the initial meaning of the idea. The justification of this meaning represents the contingent element in the ontological ap- proach and explains why it becomes necessary for that approach to appeal to the religious tradition at this point. Why, then, may we not appeal to the cosmological starting point? The answer is that although the cosmological approach must be allowed to make a much greater contribution to the deter- mination of the divine idea than has been acknowledged in the past, it is not correct to suppose that in this approach the idea of God is wholly a posteriori and derivative from external fact alone. Some idea of God is present at the outset in order for any inquiry to be possible. When Tennant says that this or that is the case for the world "as theistically interpreted," he cannot mean that the interpretation is made on the basis of an idea of God wholly sub- sequent to his argument. To investigate the cosmos for God re- quires that some antecedent conception of God be presupposed. Thus, in both approaches the idea of God is present at the outset; the superiority of the ontological way resides in the possibility it offers of some apprehension of a meaning in which God is exhibited. This apprehension can be direct, but it is not absolutely immediate as Tillich claims. Secondly, the main issue as regards the source of the idea of God is whether or not the idea of God can be determined apart from considering the nature of the world. And at this point the importance of the cosmological way becomes very great. While it is not true that the theistic conception maintained by Tennant, for example, is wholly derived from and subsequent to his analysis of</page><page sequence="11">SYMPOSIUM-NATURAL THEOLOGY 935 the world, it is true that no complete idea of God is possible apart from considering the structure of the world and even of cultural- historical existence. The way to the world cannot be simply, as Tillich maintains, a tracing out in nature of an Unconditional already fully apprehended. The nature of God is given throughout the full range of finite being, and such being must be consulted at every level if we are to be clear about the meaning of the divine attributes. Moreover, the ontological way, based as it must be upon a fixed point (sapientia), is unable to anticipate the actual develop- ments in knowledge (scientia) that come and cannot be denied to have bearing upon the nature of God. In this regard the cosmo- logical way has the superiority of being open to the novel in expe- rience. If the cosmological way runs the risk of losing the contri- bution of man's religious dimension, the ontological way runs an even greater risk of losing nature and its processes. Thirdly, as regards the issue posed by the contrast between the way of immediacy and that of argument, it is a matter too complex to be argued here. It is, however, worth noting that there is a curious instability in each position which continually drives towards the other side. The proponents of the ontological way eschew mediated argument, and yet, unless a complete mysticism is main- tained-a religion and philosophy of pure experience-the position falls back perpetually into an ontological argument involving one logical transition. The development from Augustine to Anselm forms the classic example. The way of immediacy can never be wholly self-consistent, for besides the ever-present tendency to state the position as an argument, there is dialectical interpretation in- volved in the process of recovering the uncreated light; this can hardly be styled immediacy. On the other hand, the proponents of the cosmological way defend the argumentative approach, but in the face of repeated criticism they have been forced to give up maintaining that the approach provides a demonstration or "knock- down" proof. Tennant retreats to providing "reasonable belief," and he more than once refers to his empirical theism as "teleologi- cal explanation" or "interpretation" of the cosmos from a "theis- tic point of view. " When the way of explicit argument turns away from proof and moves in the direction of interpreting the world from a certain perspective, an appeal is being made to direct appre- hension and the gap between it and the way of immediacy begins to narrow. The points of mutual involvement lead me to suggest in closing that not nearly enough attention has been paid in recent thinking to the possibility of synthesizing the two ways of approach-through the self and through the cosmos-by means of a more comprehensive</page><page sequence="12">936 THE JOURNAL OF PHILOSOPHY theory of being directed to the problem of the relation between man and the cosmos. If God appears in each pole and the two poles are themselves essentially involved in each other, then it seems likely that neither approach can be prior to the other and that we shall need both.
