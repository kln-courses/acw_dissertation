<plain_text><page sequence="1">PAULA GUNN ALLEN THE SACRED HOOP: A Contemporary Indian Perspective on American Indian Literature Literature is a facet of a culture. Its significance can be best understood in terms of its culture, and its purpose is meaningful only when the assump tions it is based on are understood and accepted. It is not much of a problem for the person raised in the culture to see the relevance, the level of complexity, or the symbolic significance of his culture's literature. He is from birth familiar with the assumptions that underlie both his culture and its literature and art. Intelligent analysis in this circumstance becomes a matter of defining smaller assumptions peculiar to the locale, idiom, and psyche of the writer. The study of nonwestern literature poses a problem for the western reader. He naturally tends to see alien literature in terms that are familiar to him, however irrelevant they may be to the literature he is considering. Because of this, students of American Indian literature have applied the terms "primitive," "savage," "childlike," or "heathen" to Indian literature. They have labeled its literature folklore, even though the term specifically applies only to that part of it that is the province of the general populace. The great mythic1 and ceremonial cycles of the American Indian peoples are neither primitive in any meaningful sense of the term, nor are they necessarily the province of the folk; much of the material on the literature is known only to educated, specialized persons who are privy to the philosophical, mystical, and literary wealth of their own tribe. Much of the literature that was in their keeping, engraved perfectly and completely in their memories, was not known to the general run of men and women. Because of this, much of that literature has been lost as Paula Allen was born in New Mexico, of ancestry including Laguna and Sioux. She received a B.A. and an M.F.A. in creative writingfrom the University of Oregon; a Ph.D. in American Studies from the University of New Mexico. She has held the chair of Native American Studies at San Francisco State University. She has published two collections of poems—The Blind Lion (Thorp Springs 1973) and Shadow Country (1976). Her articles and poems have appeared in many journals.

Most important, American Indian literature is not similar to western literature because the basic assumptions about the universe and, there fore, the basic reality experienced by tribal peoples and westerners are not the same, even at the level of "folk-lore." This difference has confused non-Indian students for centuries, because they have been unable or unwilling to grant this difference and to proceed in terms of it. For example, the two cultures differ greatly in terms of the assumed purpose for the existence of literature. The purpose of Native American literature is never one of pure self-expression. The "private soul at any public wall" is a concept that is so alien to native thought as to constitute an absurdity. The tribes do not celebrate the individual's ability to feel emotion, for it is assumed that all people are able to do so, making expression of this basic ability arrogant, presumptuous, and gratuitous. Besides, one's emotions are one's own: to suggest that another should imitate them is an imposition on the personal integrity of others. The tribes seek, through song, ceremony, legend, sacred stories (myths), and tales to embody, articulate, and share reality, to bring the isolated private self into harmony and balance with this reality, to verbalize the sense of the majesty and reverent mystery of all things, and to actualize, in lan guage, those truths of being and experience that give to humanity its greatest significance and dignity. The artistry of the tribes is married to the essence of language itself, for in language we seek to share our being with that of the community, and thus to share in the communal awareness of the tribe. In this art the greater self and all-that-is are blended into a harmonious whole, and in this way the concept of being that is the funda mental and sacred spring of life is given voice and being for all. The Indian does not content himself with simple preachments of this truth, but through the sacred power of utterance he seeks to shape and mold, to direct and determine the forces that surround and govern our lives and that of all things. There is an old Keres song that says: I add my breath to your breath That our days may De long on the Earth That the days of our people may be long That we may be one person That we may finish our roads together May my fatner bless you with life May our Life Paths be fulfilled. In this way we learn how we can view ourselves and our songs so that we may approach both rightly. Breath is life, and the intermingling of breaths is the purpose of good living. It is in essence the great principle on PAULA GUNN ALLEN 145</page><page sequence="3">which all productive living must rest, for relationships between all the beings of the Universe must be fulfilled so that our life paths may also be fulfilled. This idea is apparent in the Plains tribes' idea of a medicine wheel2 or sacred hoop.3 The concept is one of singular unity that is dynamic and encompassing, including, as it does, all that is in its most essential aspect, that of life. In his introduction to Geronimo's autobiography, Frederick Turner III characterizes the Anerican Indian cultures as static,4 a concept that is not characteristic of our own view of things; for as any American Indian knows, all of life is living—that is, dynamic and aware, partaking, as it does, in the life of the All-Spirit, and contributing, as it does, to the ongoing life of that same Great Mystery. The tribal systems are static in the sense that all movement is related to all other movement, that is, harmonious and balanced or unified; they are not static in the sense that they do not allow or accept change. Even a cursory examination of tribal systems will show that we have undergone massive changes and still retained those characteristics of outlook and experience that are the bedrock of tribal life.5 So the primary assumptions we make can be seen as static only in that they acknowledge the essential harmony of all things, and in that we see all things as of equal value in the scheme of things, denying the qualities of opposition, dualism, and isolationism (separatism) that characterize non-Indian thought in the world. Civilized Christians believe that God is separate from man and does as He wishes without the creative participation of any of His creatures, while the non-Christian tribesman assumes a place in creation that is dynamic, creative, and responsive, and he allows his brothers, the rocks, the trees, the corn, and the nonhuman animals (the entire biota, in short) the same and even greater privilege. The Indian participates in destiny on all levels, including that of creation. Thus this passage from a Cheyenne tale: Maheo, the All-Spirit, created four things out of the void—the water, the light, the sky-air, and the peoples of the water. "How beautiful their wings are in the light," Maheo said to his Power, as the birds wheeled and turned, and became living patterns against the sky. The loon was the first to drop back to the surface of the lake. "Maheo," he said, looking around, for he knew that Maheo was all about him, "You have made us sky and light to fly in, and you have made us water to swim in. It sounds ungrateful to want something else, yet still we do. When we are tired of swimming and tired of flying, we should like a dry solid place where we could walk and rest. Give us a place to build our nests, please, Maheo." "So be it," answered Maheo, "but to make such a place I must have your help, all of you. By myself, I have made four things. . . . Now I must have help if I am to create more, for my Power will only let me make four things by myself."6 146 CROSS CURRENTS / SUMMER 1976</page><page sequence="4">In this passage we see that even the All-Spirit, whose "being was a Universe,"7 possesses limitations on his Power as well as a sense of propor tion and respect for the Powers of his creatures. Contrast this with the Judeo-Christian God who makes everything and tells everything how it may and may not function if it is to gain his respect and blessing, and his commandments don't allow for change or circumstance. The Indian universe is one based on dynamic self-esteem, while the Christian uni verse is based on a sense of sinfulness and futility. To the Indian, the ability of all creatures to share in the process of life (creation) makes us all sacred. The Judeo-Christian God created a perfect environment for his crea tures, leaving them only one means of exercising their creative capacity and their ability to make choices and thus exercise their intelligence, and that was in disobeying him and destroying the perfection he had bestowed on them. The Cheyennes' creator is somewhat wiser, for he allows them to have unmet needs which they can, working in harmony with him, meet. They can exercise their intelligence and their will in a creative, positive manner and so fulfill themselves without destroying others. Together Maheo and the water-beings create the earth, and with the aid of these beings, Maheo creates first man and first woman and the creatures and environment they will need to live good and satisfying lives on earth. Of interest, too, is the way the loon prays: he looks around him as he addresses Maheo, for "he knew that Maheo was all about him,"8 just as earlier, when the snow-goose asked if the water fowl could sometimes get out of the water, she addressed him in these words: ". . . I do not know where you are, but I know you must be everywhere. . . ."9 In these words we see two things: that the creatures are respectful but not servile, and that the idea that Maheo is all around them is an active reality. As he is not thought of as superior in a hierarchical sense, he is not seen as living "up there." Here again, the Indian sense of space relationships is differ ent from that of the West. The one sees space as essentially circular or spherical in nature, while the other views space (and thus all relationships within that space) as laddered. The circular concept requires that all "points" which make up the sphere of being be significant in their identity and function, while the linear model assumes that some "points" are more significant than others. In the one, significance is significant, and is a necessary factor of being in itself, while in the other, significance is a function of placement on an absolute scale which is fixed in time and space. In essence, what we have is a direct contradiction of Turner's notion about the Native American universe versus that of the western: it is the Indian universe that moves and breathes continuously, and the west ern universe that is fixed and static. The Christian attitude toward salva tion is a reflection of this basic stance, for one can only be "saved" by belief in a savior who came and will never come again, and the idea that "once a saint always a saint" is an indication of the same thing. PAULA GUNN ALLEN 147</page><page sequence="5">In the Native American system, there is no idea that nature is some where over there while man is over here, nor that there is a great hierar chical ladder of being on which ground and trees occupy a very low rung, animals a slightly higher one, and man a very high one indeed—especially "civilized" man. All are seen to be brothers or relatives (and in tribal systems relationship is central), all are offspring of the Great Mystery, children of our mother, and necessary parts of an ordered, balanced, and living whole. This concept applies to what non-Natives think of as the supernatural as well as to the more tangible (phenomenal) aspects of the universe. Native American thought makes no such dualistic division, nor does it draw a hard-and-fast line between what is material and what is spiritual, for the two are seen to be two expresssions of the same reality— as though life has twin manifestations that are mutually interchangeable and, in many instances, virtually identical aspects of a reality that is, essentially, more spirit than matter, or that more correctly, manifests its very spiritness in a tangible way. The closest analogy in western thought is the Einsteinian understanding of matter as a special state or condition of energy. Yet even this concept falls short of the Native American under standing, for Einsteinian energy is essentially stupid, while energy in the Indian view is intelligence manifesting yet another way. To the non-Indian, man is the only intelligence in phenomenal exis tence (often in any form of existence). To the more abstractionist and less intellectually vain Indian, man's intelligence arises out of the very nature of being, which is, of necessity, intelligent in and of itself, as an attribute of being. Again, this idea probably stems from the Indian conception of a circular, dynamic universe: where all things are related, are of one family, then what attributes man possesses are naturally going to be attributes of all beings. Awareness of being is not seen as an abnormality peculiar to one species, but, because of the sense of relatedness (instead of isolation) the Indian feels to what exists, it is assumed to be a natural by-product of existence itself. In English, one can divide the universe into two parts—one which is natural and one which is "supernatural." Man has no real part in either, being neither animal nor spirit. That is, the supernatural is discussed as though it were apart from people, and the natural as though people were apart from it. This necessarily forces English-speaking people into a position of alienation from the world that they live in. This isolation is entirely foreign to Native American thought. At base, every story, every song, every ceremony, tells the Indian that he is part of a living whole, and that all parts of that whole are related to one another by virtue of their participation in the whole of being. Incidentally, the American practice of forbidding Indian children to speak their own language forces them into isolation from their sense of belonging, or at best, creates a split in their perception of wholeness. This practice was specifically undertaken in the last century as a means of destroying the person's adherence to "heath 148 CROSS CURRENTS / SUMMER 1976</page><page sequence="6">enish" attitudes, values and beliefs. It was felt that a person who spoke only English would necessarily forget his own way, and that one who spoke a Native language could not be assimilated into white culture. Those who decided on this policy spoke of "civilizing" Indian people, through the agency of alienation, isolation, and "individuation." Other aspects of this centuries-long process have included de-tribalization of land holdings and living arrangements, and prohibition of religious ceremonies and observances, forcing on American Indians the very sense of isolation that plagues and destroys other Americans. In Native American thought, God is known as the All-Spirit, and others are also spirit—more spirit than body, more spirit than intellect, more spirit than mind. The natural state of existence is whole. Thus healing chants and ceremonies emphasize restoration of wholeness, for disease is a condition of division and separation from the harmony of the whole. Beauty is wholeness. Health is wholeness. Goodness is wholeness. A witch—a person who uses the powers of the universe in a perverse or inharmonious way—is called a two-hearts: one who is not whole but split in two at the center of being. The circle of being is not physical; it is dynamic and alive. It is what lives and moves and knows, and all the life-forms we recognize—animals, plants, rocks, winds—partake of this greater life. It is acknowledgement of this that allows healing chants such as this from the Night Chant to heal (make the person whole again). Happily I recover. Happily my interior becomes cool. Happily I go forth. My interior feeling cool, may I walk. No longer sore, may I walk. As it used to be long ago, may I walk. Happily, with abundant dark clouds, may I walk. Happily, with abundant showers, may I walk. Happily, with abundant plants, may I walk. Happily, on a trail of pollen, may I walk. Happily, may I walk.1" Because of the basic assumption of the wholeness or unity of the universe, our natural and necessary relationship to all life is evident; all phenomena we witness, within or "outside" ourselves are, like us, intelli gent manifestations of the intelligent Universe from which they arise as do all things of earth and the cosmos beyond. Thunder and rain are specialized aspects of this universe, as is the human race. And con sequently the unity of the whole is preserved and reflected in language, literature, and thought, and arbitrary divisions of the universe of being into "divine" and "worldly," "natural" and "unnatural" do not occur. Literature takes on more meaning when considered in terms of some PAULA GUNN ALLEN 149</page><page sequence="7">relevant whole (like life itself), so let us consider some of the relationships between definite Native American literary forms and the symbols usually found within them. The two forms basic to Native American literature are the Ceremony and the Myth. The Ceremony is the ritual enactment of a specialized perception of cosmic relationships, while the Myth is a prose record of that relationship. Thus, the wiwanyag wachipi (Sun Dance) is the ritual enactment of the relationship the Plains people see between consec ration of the human spirit to Wakan Tanka in his manifestation as Sun or Light and Life-Bestower. Through purification, participation, sacrifice, and supplication, the participants act as instruments or transmitters of increased power and wholeness (which works itself out in terms of health and prosperity) from Wakan Tanka. The formal structure of a ceremony is as holistic as the universe it purports to reflect and respond to, for the ceremony contains other forms such as incantation, song (dance), and prayer, and it is itself the central mode of literary expression, from which all allied songs and stories derive. For the Oglala, all the ceremonies are related to one another in various explicit and implicit ways, as though each was one face of a multifaceted prism. This interlocking of the basic forms has led to much confusion among non-Indian collectors and commentators, and this complexity makes all simplistic treatments of Native American literature more con fusing than helpful. Indeed, it is the non-Indian tendency to separate things from one another—be they literary forms, species or persons, that causes a great deal of unnecessary difficulty and misinterpretation of Native American life and culture. It is reasonable, from an Indian point of view, that all literary forms should be interrelated, given the basic idea of the unity and relatedness of all the phenomena of life. Separation of parts into this or that is not agreeable to Native American systems, and the attempt to separate what are essentially unitary phenomena distorts them. For example, to say that a ceremony contains songs and prayers is misleading, for prayers are one form of address and songs are another. It is more appropriate to say that songs, prayers, dances, drums, ritual movements, and dramatic address are compositional elements of a cere mony. It is equally misleading to single out the wiwanyag wachipi and treat it as an isolated ceremony, for it must of necessity include the inipi (rite of purification) and did, at its point of origin, contain the hanblecyeyapi (vision quest)—which was how it was learned of in the first place.11 Actually, it might best be seen as a communal vision quest. The purpose of a ceremony is integration: the individual is integrated, fused, with his fellows, the community of people is fused with that of the other kingdoms, and this larger communal group with the worlds beyond this one. A "raising" or expansion of individual consciousness naturally accompanies this process. The isolate, individualistic personality is shed, and the person is restored to conscious harnony with the universe. 150 CROSS CURRENTS I SUMMER 1976</page><page sequence="8">Alongside this general purpose of realization of ceremonies, each specific ceremony has its own specific purpose. This specific purpose usually varies from tribe to tribe, and may be culture-specific—for example, the rain dances of the Southwest are peculiar to certain groups such as the Pueblos, and are not found among some other tribes, or war ceremonies which make up a large part of certain plains tribes' ceremonial life are unknown among many tribes of California.12 But all ceremonies— whether for war or healing—create and support the sense of community which is the bedrock of tribal life. This community is not merely that of members of the tribe, but necessarily includes all orders of beings that people the tribe's universe. It is within this context that the formal considerations of Native Ameri can literature can best be understood. The structures which embody expressed and implied relationships between men and other beings as well as the symbols which signify and articulate them are designed to accomplish this integration of the various orders of beings. It is assumed that beings other than the human participants are present at ceremonial enactments, and the ceremony is composed for their understanding participation as well as that of the human beings who are there. It is also understood that the human participants include those members of the tribe who are not physically present, for it is the community as community which enacts the ceremony, and not simply the separate persons attend ing it. Thus devices such as repetition and lengthy passages of "meaningless syllables" take on meaning within the context of the dance. Repetition has an entrancing effect. Its regular recurrence creates a state of conscious ness best described as "oceanic." It is hypnotic, and this exact state of consciousness is what is aimed for. The individual's attention must be come diffused. The distractions of ordinary life must be put to rest, so that the larger awareness can come into full consciousness and functioning. In this way, the person becomes literally "one with the Universe," for the individual loses consciousness of mere individuality and shares the quality of consciousness that characterizes most orders of being. The most significant and noticeable structural device is repetition, which serves to entrance and to unify—both the participants and the ceremony. In some sense, it operates analogously to a chorus in western forms, serving to reinforce the theme and refocus the attention on central concerns, while intensifying the participants' involvement with the enactment. One suits one's words and movements (if one of the dancers) to the repetitive pattern. Soon breath, heartbeat, thought, and word are one. The structure of repetition lends itself best to the purpose of integra tion or fusion, allowing thought and word to coalesce into one rhythmic whole that is not as jarring to the ear as rhyme but which unifies in larger units that are more consistent with the normal attention span of an adult. PAULA GUNN ALLEN 151</page><page sequence="9">Margot Astrov suggests that this characteristic device stems from two causes: one which is psychic and one which is magical. . . . this drive that forces man to express himself in rhythmic pat terns has its ultimate source in psychic needs, for example the need of spiritual ingestion and proper organization of all the multiform perceptions and impressions rushing forever upon the individual from without and within. . . . Furthermore, repetition, verbal and otherwise, means accumulation of power.13 She finds evidence of the First, or the need to organize perception, to predominate in some tribes' ceremonies such as the Apaches, and the second, a "magically creative quality"14 more characteristic of others, such as the Navajo. In other words, some tribes appear to stress form while others stress content, but in either case, the tribe will make its selection in terms of which emphasis is best likely to serve the purpose of fusion with the cosmic whole, which is dependent on the emphasis which is most congenial to the literary and psychic sense of the tribe. It is important to remember when considering rhythmic aspects of native poetic forms that all ceremony is chanted, drummed, and danced. Indians will frequently refer to a piece of music as a "dance" instead of a song, because song without dance is very rare, as is song without drum or other percussive instrument. It is also important to note that the drum does not "accompany" the song, for that implies separation between instrument and voice where no separation in the performing sense is recognized. These aspects combine to form an integral whole, and ac companiment is as foreign to the ceremony as is performance before an audience. Where the ceremony is enacted before people who are neither singing nor dancing, their participation is nevertheless assumed. For participation is a matter of attention and attunement and not of activity versus passivity. Repetition is of two kinds, incremental and simple. In the first, various modes will occur. Perhaps a stanza will be repeated in its entirety four times—once for each of the directions, or six, once for each lateral direction with above and below added, or seven, which will be related to those mentioned with the addition of the center of these. Alternatively, the repetition may be of a phrase only, as in the Yei be chi quoted above, or of a phrase, repeated four times with one word, the ceremonial name for each of four mountains, say, or significant colors, animals, or powers, inserted in the appropriate place at each repetition, as in this Navajo mountain chant: Seated at home behold me, Seated amid the rainbow; Seated at home behold me, Lo, here, the Holy Place! 152 CROSS CURRENTS I SUMMER 1976</page><page sequence="10">Yea, seated at home behold me.

The child learns early to remember complicated instructions, long stories verbatim, multitudes of details about plants, animals, kinship, and other social relationships, privileges and responsibilities, all "by heart." Since a person can't run to a bookshelf or a notebook to look up either vital or trivial information, reliance on memory becomes very important in everyday life. The highly developed memory of everyday is not likely to turn into a poorly developed one on ceremonial occasions, so the use of repetition for adequate memorization is not important. Another reason that is given by folklorists for the widespread use of repetition in oral ceremonial literature is touched on by Ms. Astrov in her discussion of the "psychic" basis of the device: A child repeats a statement over and over for two reasons. First, in order to make himself familiar with something that appears to him to be threateningly unknown and thus to organize it into his system of familiar phenomena; and, second, to get something he wants badly.18 It is assumed that repetition is childish on two counts: that it (rather than rational thought) familiarizes and defuses threat, and that the per son, irrationally, believes that repetition of a desire verbally will ensure its gratification. Let us ignore the obvious fact that shamen, dancers, and other adult participants of the ceremony are not children, and instead concentrate on actual ceremonies to see if they contain factors which are or might appear "threatening" to the tribe or if they simply repeat wishes over and over. There is nothing in the passages quoted so far that could be construed as threatening, unless beauty, harmony, health, strength, rain, breath, life unending, or sacred mountains can be so seen. Nor is there any threatening unknown mentioned in the songs and chants she includes in her collection; there are threatening situations, such as death or great powers, but while these constitute true unknowns to many civilized people, they are familiar to the tribes, And, by her own admission, death or severe illness are approached in positive ways, as in this death song: From the middle Of the great water I am called by the spirits.17 "Light as the last breath of the dying," she comments, "these words flutter out and seem to mingle with the soft fumes and mists that rise from the river in the morning," which hardly seems a threatening description. She continues: 154 CROSS CURRENTS / SUMMER 1976</page><page sequence="12">It is as though the song, with the lightness of a bird's feather, will carry the departing soul up to where the stars are glittering and yonder where the rainbow touches the dome of the sky.18 Throughout her discussion of Indian songs, she does not indicate a sense that the singers feel threatened by the chants, but rather that they express a serenity and even joy in the face of what might seem frightening to a child. Nor do there appear any passages in an extensive collection that are the equivalent of "God, Won't You Buy Me a Color TV?", which weaken the childhood-magic theory of repetition. The failure of folklorists to comprehend the true psychic nature of structural devices such as ceremonial repetition stems from the projection of one set of cultural assumptions onto another culture. People of western cultures, particularly those in professions noted for their "objectivity," are not going to interpret "psychic" in its extramundane sense, but rather in its more familiar psychological sense. The twin assumptions that repeti tion serves to quiet childish "psychic" needs and to give the participants in a ceremony the assurance that they are exerting control over external phenomena—"getting something they want badly"—are projections. The ceremonial participants do indeed believe that they can exert control over natural phenomena, but not because they have childishly repeated some syllables. Rather, they assume that all of reality is "internal" in some sense, that the dichotomy of the isolated individual versus the "out there" does not exist more than apparently, and that ceremonial observance can serve to transcend this delusion, unite people with the All-Spirit, and from a position of unity within this larger self, effect certain results such as healing one who is ill, ensuring that natural events move in their accus tomed way, or bringing prosperity to the tribe. The westerner's bias against nonordinary states of consciousness is as unthinking as the Indian's belief in them is said to be. The bias is created by an intellectual climate which has been carefully fostered in the west for centuries, and which is only beginning to yield to masses of data which contradict it. It is a cultural bias which has had many unfortunate side effects, only one of which is the deep misunderstanding of tribal litera tures which has for so long found an untouchable nest in the learned and popular periodicals which deal with tribal culture. In his four-volume treatise on nonordinary reality, Carlos Casteneda has described what living in the universe as a shaman is like. Unfortu nately, he does not indicate that this experience is rather commoner to ordinary people than extraordinary, that the state of consciousness created through ceremony and ritual and that detailed in mythic cycles is exactly that of the "man of knowledge." He makes the whole thing sound exotic, strange, beyond the reach of most persons; yet the great body of American Indian literature suggests a quite different conclusion. It is in the context of psychic journey that this literature can best be approached. PAULA GUNN ALLEN 155</page><page sequence="13">It is only in the context of the consciousness of the universe that it can be understood. Native American thought is essentially mystical and psychic in nature. Its distinguishing characteristic is a kind of magicalness—not the childish sort espoused by Ms. Astrov, but on the order of an enduring sense of the fluidity and malleability (or creative flux) of things. This is a reasonable attitude in its own context, derived quite logically from the central as sumptions that characterize tribal thought. Things are not perceived as inert but as viable, as alive; and living things are subject to processes of growth and change as a necessary component of their aliveness. Since all that is in existence is alive, and all that is alive must grow and change, all existence can be manipulated under certain conditions and according to certain laws. These conditions and laws, called ritual or magic in the west, are known to Native Americans as "walking in a sacred manner" (Sioux), "standing in the center of the world" (Navajo), or "having a tradition" (Pomo). Given this attitude, the symbolism incorporated in Native American ceremonial literature is not symbolic in the sense usually understood: that is, the four mountains in the "Mountain Chant" do not stand for four other mountains. They are those exact mountains perceived psychically, as it were, or mystically. Red, used by the Oglala, doesn't stand for sacred or earth, but is the quality of a being, the color of it, when perceived "in a sacred manner" or from the point of view of earth herself. That is, red is a psychic quality, not a material one, though it has a material dimension, of course. But its material aspect is not its essential one; or as Madame Blavatsky put it, the physical is not a principle, or as Lame Deer suggests, the physical aspect of existence is representative of what is real. . . . The meat stands for the four-legged creatures, our animal brothers, who gave of themselves so that we should live. The steam (from the stew-pot) is living breath. It was water; now it goes up to the sky, becomes a cloud again. . . . We Sioux spend a lot of time thinking about everyday things, which in our mind are mixed up with the spiritual. We see in the world around us many symbols that teach us the meaning of life. We have a saying that the wnite man sees so little, he must see with only one eye. We see a lot that you no longer notice. You could notice if you wanted to, but you are usually too busy. We Indians live in a world of symbols and images where the spiritual and the com monplace are one. To you symbols are just words, spoken or written in a book. To us they are part of nature, part of ourselves, even little insects like ants ana grasshoppers. We try to understand them not with the head but with the heart, and we need no more than a hint to give us the meaning.19 Not only are the "symbols" statements of perceived reality rather than metaphorical or "poetic" statements, but the formulations which are characterized by brevity and repetition are also expressions of that per 156 CROSS CURRENTS / SUMMER 1976</page><page sequence="14">ception. Life is seen as part of oneself; a hint to convey which particular part is all that is needed to convey meaning. This accounts for the "purity" and "simplicity" which apparently characterized Native American litera ture, but it is simple in the sense of what is known and familiar, not in the sense of childish or primitive. In a sense, all that exists is perceived as symbolic to the Indian; it is this that has given currency to the concept of the Indian as one who is close to the earth; he is close to the earth, but not as a savage (primitive form of civilized man), or as a child (another version of the same idea), but as a person who assumes that the earth is alive in the same sense that he is alive. He sees this aliveness in nonphysical terms, in terms that are familiar to the mystic or the psychic, and this gives rise to a mystical sense of reality that is an ineradicable part of his being. In brief, we can say that "the sun" or "the earth" or "a tree" is a symbol of an extraordinary truth rather than the other way around, as western critics understand it. This attitude is not anthropomorphism. No Indian would take his perception as the basic unit of universal consciousness (or as the only one). We believe instead that the basic unit of consciousness is the All-Spirit, the living fact of intelligence from which all other perceptions arise and derive their power. I live, but I will not live forever. Mysterious moon, you only remain, powerful sun, you alone remain, Wonderful earth, you remain forever. All of us soldiers must die.20 Nor is this attitude superstitious. It is based very solidly on experience, and it is experience which is shared to whatever degree by most of the members of the tribal group. It is experience which is verified by hun dreds and thousands of years of experience, and it is a result of actual perception—sight, taste, hearing, smell—as well as more indirect social and natural phenomena. In the west, if a person points to a building and says "there is a building" and other people, looking in the direction indicated agree, then we say that the building is there. If that building can be entered, walked through, touched, and this is done by many people, we say the building is really there. In the same way, metaphysical reality is encountered and verified by Indians. No one's experience is idiosyncratic. When the singer tells of journeying to the west and climbing under the sky, the journey is one that many have gone on in the past and will go on in the future. And every traveler will describe the same sights and sounds, and will enter and return in like fashion. This peculiarity of psychic travel has been noticed by many westerners, PAULA GUNN ALLEN 157</page><page sequence="15">who attempt to explain it in psychological terms, such as the "collective unconscious" predicated by Jung. But they are saying that our imagina tions are very similar; that the unconscious life of man is the same. The experiences, sights, sounds, and so forth encountered on psychic jour neys are presumed to be imaginary and hallucinatory, just as thoughts are believed to be idiosyncratic events of no real consequence. Nowhere in the literature on ceremonialism have I encountered a western writer willing to suggest that the "spiritual and the commonplace are one."21 Many argue that these hallucinations are good, others that they are the product of a diseased mind,22 but none suggests that one may actually be "seated amid the rainbow." So symbols in Native American systems are not symbolic in the usual sense of the term. The words articulate reality—not "psychological" or imagined reality, not emotive reality captured metaphorically in an at tempt to fuse thought and feeling, but that reality where thought and feeling are one, where objective and subjective are one, where speaker and listener are one, where sound and sense are one. There are many kinds of Native American literature, and they can be categorized in various ways, but given the assumptions behind the crea tion and performance of the literature, a useful division might be along functional lines rather than along more mechanistic ones. It might be said that the basic purpose of any culture is to maintain the ideal status quo. What creates differences among cultures, and litera tures, is how that system goes about this task, and this in turn depends on (as much as maintains) basic assumptions about the nature of life and man's place in it. The ideal status quo is generally expressible in terms of "peace, prosperity, good health, and stability." Western cultures lean more and more heavily on technological and scientific methods of main tenance, while traditional cultures such as those of American Indian tribes tend toward mystical and philosophic methods. Because of this tendency, literature plays a central role in the traditional cultures which it is unable to play in technological ones. Thus, the purpose of a given "work" is of central importance to understanding its deeper significance. The most basic division is ceremonial literature and popular literature, rather than the western "prose and poetry" distinction. Ceremonial litera ture includes all literature that is accompanied by ritual actions and music and which produces mythic (metaphysical) states of consciousness and/or conditions. This literature may appear to the westerner as either prose or poetry, but its distinguishing characteristic is that it is sacred, whether to greater or lesser degree. "Sacred," like "power" and "medicine," has a very different significance to tribespeople than to members of the "civilized" world. It does not mean something that is of religious signifi cance and therefore believed in with deep emotional fervor, "venerable, consecrated or sacrosanct," as Random House Unabridged has it, but rather 158 CROSS CURRENTS / SUMMER 1976</page><page sequence="16">that it is filled with an intangible but very real power or force, for good or bad, as Lame Deer says in his discussion of symbolism: Four is the number that is most wakan, most sacred. Four stands for Tatuye Tope—the four quarters of the earth. One of its chief symbols is Umane, which [is a rectangle with rays at each of the four corners.] It represents the unused earth force. By this I mean that the Great Spirit pours a great, unimaginable amount of force into all things—pebbles, ants, leaves, whirlwinds—whatever you will. . . . This force is symbolized by the Umane. In the old days men used to have an Umane altar made of raised earth in their tipis on certain special occasions. It was so wakan you couldn't touch it or even hold your hand over it.23 In this statement, Lame Deer isn't saying that one was forbidden to touch the altar. He is saying that one couldn't touch it. The Umane doesn't represent the power, it is the power. "Sacred," "power," and "medicine" are related terms. Having power means being able to use this extra force without being harmed by it—it is a particular talent possessed to greater or lesser degree, and "medicine" is a term used for the personally owned force which one has power through; medicine is powerful in itself, but its power can usually only be used by certain persons. So ceremonial literature is sacred; it has power. It frequently uses language of its own, archaisms, "meaningless" words, or special words that are not used in everyday conversation. It can be divided into several subcategories, some of which will appear in some tribes but not in others, and other types which will be found throughout Native America. Cere monial literature includes healing songs; initiation songs; planting, har vesting, other agricultural songs; hunting songs; blessing songs of various kinds, such as for new houses, journeys—new undertakings; dream related songs; war songs; personal power songs; food-preparation songs; purification songs; vision-seeking songs; and the major ceremonial cycles which include origin and creation cycles, migration and celebration of new laws, and legendary or "mythic" occurrences. Each of these serves the purpose of holding the society together; of creating harmony, restoring balance, ensuring prosperity and unity; and establishing right relation ships within the social and natural world. At base they all restore the psychic unity of the people, the terms of their existence, and their sense of reality, order, and propriety. The most central of these perform this function at levels which are far more intense than others, and these are the great Ceremonies which, more than any single phenomena, distin guish one tribe from another. Every people has a responsibility with regard to the workings of the universe; today as yesterday, human beings play an intrinsic role in the ongoing creation. This role is largely determined by the place where the tribe lives, and will change when that people changes its location. In the PAULA GUNN ALLEN 159</page><page sequence="17">Southwest, the Zuni dance Shalako every winter at the solstice so that the sun will turn in his course and move once again toward summer. Cosmic cycles such as Shalako or Wtiwuchim are related to life-processes on earth and, by virtue of natural relationship, within the universe. They are aimed toward forces far bigger than the community or the individual, though each is inescapably dependent on the other, "circles within circles" as Lame Deer says, "with no beginning and no end."24 The greater and lesser symbols incorporated into the ceremonies take their meaning from the context of the ceremony—its purpose and its meaning. Without knowledge of this purpose, attempts to understand ceremonial literature often have ludicrous results. The symbols cannot be understood in terms of another culture, whether it be of Maya or Eng land, because those other cultures have different imperatives and have grown on different soil, under a different sky, and within a different traditional context. "Owl" in one situation will have a very different significance from owl in another, and a given color—white or blue—will vary from place to place and from ceremony to ceremony in its signifi cance, intensity, and power. In other words, the rules that govern Native American literature are very different from those that govern western literature, though the enormity of the difference is, I think, a fairly late occurrence. Literature must, of necessity, express and articulate the deepest per ceptions, relationships, and attitudes of a culture, whether it does so deliberately or accidentally. Tribal literature does this with a luminosity and clarity that is largely free of pretension, stylized "elegance," or show. What are held to be the most meaningful experiences of human life, from levels which completely transcend ordinary experience to those which are commonplace, are those experiences celebrated in the songs and cycles of the people. The more commonplace experiences are in the area of popular tales and songs; these may be humorous, soothing, pedagogical, or entertain ing in purpose. Among those kinds of literature found in this category are lullabies, corn-grinding and ditch-digging songs, jokes, "pour-quoi" tales, "little" stories, and stories which are contemporary in setting. Included here too are those delightful dances called "49s."25 All but the latter appear in every collection of Indian lore, sometimes masquerading as true myths or simple songs. This masquerade, of course, does little to clear up misunderstandings regarding Native American literature, for frequently "myths" that seem childish are forms expressly for children, and bear only a slight resemblance to the true mythic forms. Between the trivial, popular forms and the ceremonial are songs and stories such as various "games," incantations and other simple forms of magic, prose cycles such as the "trickster" tales recorded by Paul Radin, and some kinds of journey and food-related songs and legends. It should be apparent that individual songs may be difficult to classify, 160 CROSS CURRENTS / SUMMER 1976</page><page sequence="18">though the level of symbology incorporated and the amount of pre scribed ritual and associated ceremony, the number and special qualifica tions of the celebrants and the kind of physical setting and costume used can help distinguish one kind from another. In order to do this for any given song, though, it is necessary to have more than a nodding acquain tanceship with the tribe whose song or story is under consideration and with the locality. Another unfailing clue is the relative secrecy of parts or all of the ceremony, especially in terms of the presence of "tourists" and cameras. This will vary to some extent from tribe to tribe, some being more open than others, but the rule is still a good basic one. Another such clue, particularly valuable for classroom work, is the source the song or story was found in. Only very erudite tomes are likely to have much that is really sacred, and even that has usually been altered in some way. Popular books are likely to carry mainly popular literature, with a little from the next more powerful category. It would be well to mention, in this connection, that the use of really sacred materials is pretty well forbidden to ordinary mortals and publishers, and they do not make good classroom materials for a variety of reasons: they are arcane; they are usually taboo; they lead to confusion on the part of the students (if non-Indian) and resentment (if Indian); they create questions and digressions that are usually beyond the competence of the teacher—or the academic situation-—to cope with. Frequently they lead to ridicule, disrespect, and belittlement; non-Indian students are not inclined by training or culture to view the sacred as that which has power beyond that of economics, history, or politics. For all its complexity, Native American literature possesses a unity and harmony of symbol, structure, and articulation which is peculiar to itself. This harmony is based on the essential harmony of the universe and on thousands of years of refinement—the essential sense of unity among all things that flows like a clear stream through the songs and stories of the peoples of the Western Hemisphere. This sense is embodied in these words of an old man, long ago: There are birds of many colors—red, blue, green, yellow—yet it is all one bird. There are horses of many colors—brown, black, yellow, white—yet it is all one horse. So cattle, so all living things—animals, flowers, trees. So men: in this land where once were only Indians are now men of every color—white, black, yellow, red—yet all one people. That this should come to pass was in the heart of the Great Mystery. It is right thus. And everywhere there shall be peace.26 So Hiamove said, more than fifty years ago. It remains for scholars of Native American literature to look at this literature fron the point of view of its people. From this vantage only can the richness, complexity, and true meaning of a people's lives be fully understood; only in this way can we all learn the lessons of the past on this continent: the essential lesson of respect for all that is.
