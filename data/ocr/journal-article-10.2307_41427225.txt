<plain_text><page sequence="1">"Hearing Hardy: Soundscapes and the Profitable Reader" David James The idea that urban experience can be "read" more accurately through the noises than through the spectacles of a city may sound like a critical com- monplace, but it nevertheless is one that drew the attention of Victorian commentators just as it still provokes the theoretical inclinations of today's cultural geographers. Writing for the Fortnightly Review in 1878, psychologist James Sully reiterates how urban hubbub remains synony- mous with unfettered technological progress: Our advancing civilization clearly tends to the growth and multiplication of dense centers of population. And in so doing it no less clearly tends to substitute a noisy for a quiet kind of life. According to ample testimony, ancient and modern, town life is beset with the plague of harsh and overpowering sound, whereas country life is first of all grateful by reason of its quiet. (710-11) The auditory onslaught that Sully traces with the help of "ample testi- mony" exemplifies a combination of reportage and pure opinion. Specula- tive references to the public sphere of everyday habitation coincide with his appropriation of certain insights from the so-called new psychology of the later 1800's - a rhetorical fusion of popularized philosophy and scien- JNT: Journal of Narrative Theory 40.2 (Summer 2010): 131-155.

As he implies, metropolitan spaces appeared not to constrain the recep- tion and cognition of sound, but to expand the spectrum of different sen- sory encounters through which populated places are at once collectively and personally known. The city, in effect, diversified the daily activity of negotiating the world by recourse to natural and mechanical sounds; and this diversification of the stimuli for acoustic perception in day-to-day life led Sully to warn that "if noises are a permanent - not to say continually increasing - factor in our environment, we must suppose that in time man's organism will become modified so as no longer to suffer from these sources" (711-12). Published the same year as Sully's prophecy, Thomas Hardy's iconic The Return of the Native (1878) transfers this geography of disorienting sound to the provincial setting of Egdon Heath, notionally located in east Dorset.1 That's not to say that Hardy would not have agreed with Sully over the human necessity of adapting to an increasingly cacophonous, and expansively urban, world. Rather, Hardy's interests had to do with the af- fective implications of perceiving - rather than acclimatizing to - spaces of sound, while exploring the way the countryside can be as acoustically complex as the city. Indeed, Hardy seemed less concerned than Sully with speculating about how our sensory capacities "will become modified" in years to come, than in developing strategies for alerting his readers to the way rural settings highlight connections between our emotional and cogni- tive responses to spatial sounds. Hardy's depictions of soundscapes are also, as we will see, intentionally ornamental, even hyperbolic; and they appeal today to an analysis of not only texture, distance, and scale, but also resonance, ambience, and their consequences for unpacking the lan- guage of his fiction. This sort of critical vocabulary - equipped to deal with the aesthetic ramifications of reading the textuality of sound - has re- cently been tested by Jenefer Robinson, who proposes an account of inter- pretive emotion as, above all, "a process . . . involving both affective and cognitive evaluations" (59). For Hardy's readers, acoustic aspects of spa- tial description often require a different level of imaginative commitment, occasioning new connections between the reader's visceral and intellec- tual responses to what we expect from fictional scenery. What follows is an attempt to trace how those connections are activated in order to dis-</page><page sequence="3">Hearing Hardy: Soundscapes and the Profitable Reader 133 cover what Hardy's diegetic engagement with hearing in his fiction might imply about the extradiegetic role that listening can play as an aspect of interpretation. Soundscapes invite a rather different hermeneutic procedure than liter- ary landscapes discussed purely in the visual terms of pictorial representa- tion. This is because a novelist like Hardy - anticipating the early-mod- ernist investment in evoking the mental effects of sensory impressions - so often manipulates our engagement with literary space by shifting between mimetic and highly metaphorical depictions of land sur- faces and the sensations they elicit in observing characters. As such, Hardy's anthropomorphized settings substantiate Robinson's claim that "an emotional response is a physiological response to something impor- tant in the environment," for he was keen to align our reading experience itself with the responsiveness of specific characters to their ambient sur- roundings (310). Curiously prescient of a recent critical interest in how we participate in the artifice of narrative description, Hardy capitalized on the fact that our immersion in the stylization of a fictional scene can intensify our intellectual and emotional reactions to the action it hosts. Hardy saw no discrepancy, therefore, between using landscape descrip- tion as an opportunity for verbal or syntactical innovation and the need to sustain his reader's interest in the personal or social dramas for which his landscapes provide animating backdrops. Indeed, he expected his audi- ence to not be concerned with, and convinced solely by, scenic realism: "The exact truth as to material fact ceases to be of importance in art," claimed Hardy in 1887, soon reiterating this sentiment in his famous as- surance that "Art is a disproportioning ... of realities, to show more clearly the features that matter in those realities, which, if merely copied or reported inventorially, might possibly be observed, but would probably be overlooked" ( Life and Work 192, 239). The implications here of refut- ing the functionalism of spatial verisimilitude are nowhere more explicitly discussed than in his subtle essay of 1888, "The Profitable Reading of Fic- tion." This essay has much to say not only about how we can better under- stand readerly enjoyment, but also about why we should be wary of claims made for the social or moral work performed by classic realism. Hardy thus takes as his premise the scrutiny of the rationale for interpreting fic- tion for purely instrumental ends. In terms of its aesthetic propositions, the essay is contemporaneous with his insistence that the artist's commitment</page><page sequence="4">134 J N T to "distorting, throwing out of proportion" familiar scenes need not repel his or her audience ( Life and Work 239). On the contrary, to defamiliarize space, as Hardy consistently claimed, is to simulate more intensively for the reader that feeling of wonderment in perceiving a scene that "would probably be overlooked." And in this respect, "The Profitable Reading of Fiction" speaks directly to Hardy's compositional concerns with literary setting as a basis for formal experimentation, as his acoustic mapping of landscapes commonly evoked with ocular symbolism create alternative perceptions of space - perceptions that are all the more affecting because of the way they have been subjected to that descriptive "distorting." "The Profitable Reading of Fiction" offers, then, a joint defense of the artist and his audience: a defense too, at a more implicit level, of the free- doms and responsibilities of stylistic invention (as he takes pains to stress that style is more than decoration) and of the plurality of interpretations that his work invites. By prioritizing, in this respect, the range of re- sponses provoked by fiction that is morally or politically non-prescriptive, Hardy liberates his putative reader from the constraining task of having to gauge a novel's purpose and utility. "The aim," he writes, should be the exercise of a generous imaginativeness, which shall find in a tale not only all that was put there by the author, put he it never so awkwardly, but which shall find there what was never inserted by him, never foreseen, never contemplated. Sometimes these additions which are woven around a work of fiction by the intensive power of the reader's own imagination are the finest parts of the scenery. ("Profitable Reading" 76) Pertinent here for exploring Hardy's soundscapes is the dual sense of ac- tivity: that what we find compelling "in a tale" is met in kind by "the in- tensive power" of our contact with pictured scenery. Hardy's reader is a maker, one who can profit from experiences provoked by the text but "never foreseen" by its creator. And if Hardy's acoustic sceneries compel us to look beyond what can be "reported inventorially" and to entertain a more sensuously stylized vision of material space, they ask us in turn to consider the nature of reading as giving rather than deciphering - a "gen-</page><page sequence="5">Hearing Hardy: Soundscapes and the Profitable Reader 135 erous" participation in the art of description, in not only watching but lis- tening to the known world made strange. Narrative Acoustics: From the Seen to the Heard Compelling as they are in inviting us to read by the ear, Hardy's land- scapes have nonetheless spurred a preoccupation with narrative visuality and perspective.2 Longstanding praise for the vivid pictorialism of his "Novels of Character and Environment" has tended - quite rightly - to celebrate Hardy's settings for the way they combine characters' percep- tions with broader panoramic prospects, moving from intimate reactions to wide-scale surveys, portrayed by a heterodiegetic voice. This mediation between focalization and external narration allowed Hardy to alternate be- tween zeroing-in on characters' states of mind and panning back to evoke terrestrial or meteorological events from a documentarían distance. Yet this emphasis on narrative vision in Hardy's prose somewhat detracts from our appreciation of just how multivalent his registration of spatial percep- tions can be. The now well-critiqued tendency to evaluate Hardy's topographies by recourse to the empirical veracity of "Wessex" place- names harbors the assumption that he was simply rehearsing the mimetic objectives of Victorian realism.3 Landscape portraiture, whether in literary narrative or painting, might seem to necessitate a focus on the primarily visual ways in which physical terrains are framed and rendered. Yet work on space in literary aesthetics would do well to take up the call from recent cultural geographers to appreciate what Steven Feld calls "the acoustic complexities of environments," developing a critical lexicon that reflects the fact that that political, ethnographic, and art-historical studies of loca- tion and inhabitation often rely upon visual terminologies that neglect "the interpénétration of auditory space and time" (183). Literary scholars have arguably shared this aural myopia, leaving un- explored the relationship between the figuration of sound and the way writers affectively involve their readers in depicted space. By virtue of its association with narratological terms (most obviously, focalization and perspectivism) and as a basis for discussing themes of viewpoint, surveil- lance, and (in)sight, vision has achieved something of a critical supremacy that has overtaken accounts of voice and its role in our apprehension of distance and scale in fictional settings. Hardy's acoustic geographies pre-</page><page sequence="6">136 J N T diet Felďs reminder that "experiencing and knowing place - the idea of place as sensed, place as sensation - can proceed through a complex inter- play of the auditory and the visual, as well as through other intersensory perceptual processes" (185). Moreover, as I also want to show, when we enter Hardy's settings we often find that his narratorial voice ruptures the perceptual dominance of vision that one associates with the documentation of pastoral locales. As Michael Irwin has shrewdly noted, Hardy's landscapes are far from neu- tral, rarely providing immutable backgrounds. Description itself mobilizes topography rather than reducing it to the stasis of bucolic idylls, and "Hardy's verbal pictures offer not only possible 'meanings' but a tacit commentary on the human tendency to seek or impose them" (317). Con- scripting us, then, into what is a purposefully self-conscious process of picturing spaces through sound, Hardy compels us to pay close attention to the rhetorical interdependency of vision and voice, illuminating the role that hearing itself plays in his multisensory poetics of place. Given Hardy's fascination with the affective impact of rural landscapes as a basis for understanding intimate human attachments to local environ- ments, it is tempting to set his fiction against the growing interest among Victorian philosophers, psychologists, and science writers popularizing the physiology of perception.4 His emphasis on the reciprocity between perceiving a landscape (by sight, touch, as well as sound) and negotiating one's sense of mobility within and across it dramatizes what Alexander Bain described in 1855 as the propensity for immediate or anticipated "movement" to elicit " sensations of various senses " (374, emphasis origi- nal). Doubtless Hardy was well aware that his readers were scarcely "the subjects of purely passive sensation," as Bain himself asserted, or drawn to "impressions languidly received" (317). Yet it is crucial to pinpoint Hardy's elective affinities not only with a burgeoning strand of physiolog- ical thinking, but also with physiologists who themselves turned to matters of aesthetic composition and response. G. H. Lewes is emblematic in this respect, shuttling across disciplines by swapping roles from physiologist to a champion of literary innovation. And just as Lewes claimed in 1865 that "a genuine style is the living body of thought," as the "sincere" and uncensored "expression of the writer's mind" (118), so Hardy would reit- erate the conviction twenty-five years later that a "writer's style is accord- ing to his temperament," inasmuch as "if he has anything to say which is</page><page sequence="7">Hearing Hardy: Soundscapes and the Profitable Reader 137 of value, and words to say it with, the style will come of itself" ("Art of Authorship" 103). How Hardy's descriptions of acoustic space might help us to distinguish between the intuitive and practiced aspects of his craft is a question that exceeds the scope of my commentary here, but such affili- ations between his and Lewes's statements about composition reveal how closely attuned Hardy was to current thinking about literary style in con- nection with the confluence of science and aesthetics.5 This intersection between physiological aesthetics and narrative aesthetics is what sets the scene for exploring Hardy's soundscapes. The importance of style in Hardy's practice of staging heightened re- sponses to spatial sounds has its own precedents, of course. Popular as- sumptions of the kind rehearsed by Sully about sound as a typically inva- sive aspect of urban experience informed the portrayal of aural phenomena offered by earlier Victorian novelists, especially those who tackled the idea - at once wondrous and ominous - of the expanding city. Amplifying mechanical sounds over semantic meanings, Dickens's ono- matopoeic use of linguistic aphasia is exemplified in the famous scene where Dombey is whisked out London by train: Away, with a shriek, and a roar, and a rattle, from the town, burrowing among the dwellings of men and making the streets hum, flashing out into the meadows for a moment, mining in through the damp earth, booming on in darkness and heavy air, bursting out again into the sunny day so bright and wide. (298) Labial and alliterative verbs proliferate in this kinesthetic passage, as though Dickens exploits the graphic as well as the phonetic intonations of each image to evoke perceptions of a landscape transformed by speed. Dickens's accelerating parataxis offers a syntactic correlative to the bewildering and intimidating rhythms of the metropolis that Dombey is rapidly leaving be- hind, but while Hardy would extend Dickens's awareness of the volatility of human hearing, he refuses to recycle this fearful notation of sounds as af- flictions. Elsewhere, Dickens gestures by analogy to mid-century wave the- ory, as in "Night Walks" (1860), where he envisions the chimes from a church spire "spreading circles of vibration" for "ever afterwards widening perhaps ... in eternal space" (78).6 Such portentous intimations of sonic im-</page><page sequence="8">138 J N T pact are memorably re-enforced in Far from the Madding Crowd (1874), when Bathsheba's departure to Budmouth is accompanied by the "whirr" of Weatherbury's own chapel clock, whose "notes flew forth with the usual blind obtuseness of inanimate things - flapping and rebounding among walls, undulating against the scattered clouds, spreading through their inter- stices into unexplored miles of space" (206). Hardy often dramatizes this apparent indifference, austerity, even hos- tility of acoustic spaces, evoking their tendency to thwart easy passage and contradict human aspirations. Yet he refuses to eliminate all personal agency from his landscape depictions, insofar as he values characters' manifest sensitivity to environmental sounds. Likewise, instead of deni- grating auditory perceptions of space in favor of visually rendered inclines or horizons, Hardy joined the fascination among later nineteenth-century philosophers with the body's responsiveness to energy flow.7 Underlying the process of acquiring the "generous imaginativeness" that Hardy saw in readers who remained attentive to "distorting" or disproportioned scener- ies is the hypothesis that our vulnerability in responding to exterior ele- ments results as pervasively from what we are inclined to hear as from what we are inclined to see. Active Listeners, Then and Now Rural settings were for Hardy as a technician, then, far more than impas- sive backcloths. Idiomatic sectors of Wessex - from the "undulating corn- lands" approaching Crestón of Desperate Remedies (1871) to the liminal Hintocks of The Woodlanders (1887) - are susceptible to the homology between rurali ty and tranquility (22). Places might seem all the more charming for remaining untouched by industrial sounds, and Sully himself fell prey to precisely this conflation of provincialism and restorative qui- etude. Despite his attempt to offer a more systematic typology of the so- cial and domestic consequences of noisy landscapes, Sully "hazard[s] the conjecture that, when compared with the lot of an inhabitant of a noisy city, that of a savage would be an enviable one" (710). Opposing this nostalgic romanticization of rural geography, Hardy im- pels us to imagine the dynamic resonance of his fictional settings. In Tess of the D'Urbervilles (1891), Hardy uses ambient spaces to refocus scenic descriptions from pictorial to aurally discerned features. The narrator</page><page sequence="9">Hearing Hardy: Soundscapes and the Profitable Reader 1 39 highlights the gradual conjunction in Tess's mind of cognitive reactions and sensory reflexes. This connection of feeling and intellect is part of Hardy's wider point that our deep-seated attitudes toward recognizable places can alter in accordance with immediate sensory responses, as we experience those surroundings anew. Tess is indeed Hardy's test-case here for exploring how this interaction of sense and cognition changes when the scene encountered is itself unknown. In one of several episodes in which Tess finds herself momentarily disoriented while at the same time somewhere strangely familiar, she reflects that she "had never before vis- ited this part of the country, and yet she felt akin to the landscape" (118). Finding uncanny bonds with place, even though it is apparently new, she develops an auditory communication with her surroundings more rapidly (and more usefully) than when having recourse to what she sees. Sounds overtake her visual scanning of the area for recognizable features. This level of aural intentness shows that "Active listening," as Paul Carter has put it, "is not simply psychological jargon"; rather, the kind purposeful lis- tening that Tess practices is "precipitated in circumstances of an imminent loss of personal and collective identity, its echoic poetics is both tactical and profoundly political" (45). In this model, the shift we observe in Tess's function as Hardy's focal- izer carries psychological and ontological consequences that inflect the style in which her spatial perceptions are relayed. Practical navigations ac- company deeper reflections, as Tess develops a self-conscious attention to her own sensations of immediate space when they seem to endorse pre-ex- isting and uplifting sentiments of expectancy: Either the change in the quality of the air from heavy to light, or the sense of being amid new scenes where there were no invidious eyes upon her, sent up her spirits won- derfully. Her hopes mingled with the sunshine in an ideal photosphere which surrounded her as she bounded along against the soft south wind. She heard a pleasant voice in every breeze, and in every bird's note seemed to lurk a joy. (119) Becoming engrossed "amid new scenes" intensifies her alertness to visual, tactile, and acoustic sources of appreciation. Environmental textures ac-</page><page sequence="10">140 J N T quire an aesthetic uniqueness beyond the physiological process with which they initially "mingled." Yet Hardy takes this process of intersen- sory discernment to a more practical level, since Tess's communication with the land's auditory features expedites her progress across it. Physio- logical and intellectual engagements with ambient space mutually inform one another, allowing Tess to capitalize upon the fact that it is "impossible that any event should have left upon her an impression that was not at least capable of transmutation" (119). A pivotal new conception of apprehend- ing and occupying place emerges here: aural notation, distinguished from other senses, facilitates new intuitions. As the narrative progresses, Hardy's implication becomes clear: that experiencing landscapes through their emanating sounds synchronizes the instinctual and the reflective, as decisions are made on the basis of aural aptitude. Sound and Perspectivism Prioritizing auditory space over pictorialism or place-names, Hardy was less interested in compromising the supremacy of visuality in his narration for its own sake than in dramatizing situations in which his characters sus- tain their environmental bearings only by suspending their reliance on what they see. While his perceptual representation of scenes of encounter certainly "gives us an insight," in Susan Stewart's phrase, "into the inter- subjective aspects of sense experience," Hardy was equally intrigued, as we've just seen, by the shifting connections between physical habitats and individual agency (67). Acoustic space plays a crucial role here, insofar as it emphasizes the distinction between characters adept at moving across twilight terrains using sound and those all but disabled by the onset of night. In this sense, to negotiate landscapes as soundscapes was a practical necessity in Hardy's world, rather than an occasion for aesthetic reverie. And Tess's emotive pause in the capsule episode quoted above is not sim- ply a moment of self-orientation, but a chance for Hardy to highlight the interaction of cerebral and somatic responses to the land. Tess stands as something of a technical culmination of this interface be- tween feeling and thought, involuntary reactions and considered introspec- tions. Such relations have narratological ramifications in terms of the line we can draw between Hardy's use of perspectivai narration and exterior- ized commentary. That latter mode of disseminating acoustic space is</page><page sequence="11">Hearing Hardy: Soundscapes and the Profitable Reader 141 showcased in Under the Greenwood Tree (1872), a novel punctuated by the sort of spectatorial register that Hardy would substantially modify over a decade later when chronicling indigenous knowledge in The Woodlanders . In this later novel, we find that the "artifices of the seasons" are traced from a "conjuror's own point of view, and not from that of the spectator" (327). However, in Under the Greenwood Tree a wholly methodical, distanced ex- position of soundscapes ensues from the outset, in which Hardy offers that famous portrait of the Mellstock native who possesses a singularly acute sensitivity to acoustic spaces, ever changing between seasons: To dwellers in a wood, almost every species of tree has its voice as well as its feature. At the passing of the breeze the fir-trees sob and moan no less distinctly than they rock: the holly whistles as it battles with itself: the ash hisses amid its quivering: the beech rustles while its flat boughs rise and fall. And winter, which modifies the note of such trees as shed their leaves, does not destroy its individuality. (11) A responsiveness to the resonant and vibrating exactness of things is ob- served as a communal rather than a subjective attitude. Yet Hardy's ex- plicitly anthropomorphic description of weather and flora swings the em- phasis away from his collected characters - undefined, of course, at this stage of the narrative - in order to lend primacy to idiosyncrasies of trees as the novel's opening protagonists. In contrast, by the time we reach The Woodlanders , Hardy has withdrawn into a more subjectivist idiom. Here the sensory delineation of terrestrial textures is refracted through his char- acter's immediate thoughts. Nonetheless, while Hardy's account of what it means to "read" organic matter is implicitly focalized by Giles and Marty together, we can still detect a more thoroughgoing commentary that shad- ows immediate events, a commentary on the aesthetic experience of nat- ural spaces with which his characters are intimately acquainted. In this re- spect at least, then, The Woodlanders inherits something of spectatorial mode of Hardy's earlier fiction, if only to integrate it with specifically fo- calized reactions: The casual glimpses which the ordinary population be- stowed upon that wondrous world of sap and leaves called</page><page sequence="12">142 J N T the Hintock woods had been with these two, Giles and Marty, a clear gaze. They had been possessed of its finer mysteries as of commonplace knowledge; had been able to read its hieroglyphs as ordinary writing; to them the sights and sounds of night, winter, wind, storm, amid those dense boughs, which had to Grace a touch of the uncanny, and even of the supernatural, were simple occurrences whose origin, continuance, and laws they foreknew. (326) Hardy seems to have been intrigued, then, by the question of how to dramatize that phenomenal interface of sensation and intellection without detracting from the more rudimentary chapter-by-chapter requirements of plot. He demands a kind of reader who can move between moments of im- mersion in diegetic events and episodes of potential estrangement as the narrator intervenes to explore how peculiar modes of perceiving certain "sights and sounds" constitute the possession of "common knowledge." In effect, the reader in question will be able to reconcile the artifice of Hardy's interjections with his or her compulsion to view given scenes for their own intrinsic interest. And to take this risk - to cultivate and com- promise our suspension of disbelief with equal measure - was for Hardy a justified one. It is a risk he took for the reader's benefit, not as a means of showcasing writerly panache. But it does require us, as Hardy intimated, to be willing to "discern, in delineative art professing to be natural, any stroke greatly at variance with nature," while at the same time sensing that we are "under the guidance of a mind who sees further into life" than we do and "who can throw a stronger irradiation over subjects already within [our] ken than [we have] been able to do unaided" ("Profitable Reading" 78, 79). Intonation and Involvement This kind of interpretive agility is almost relentlessly demanded of us throughout The Return of the Native. We move between episodes in which we are deeply involved in the response to scenic details to other moments when Hardy speaks for the scene before us, as though refraining from ad- dressing us under the assumption that we are impassive as an audience, al- ternately stunned and enthralled. In a typically portentous intervention of this kind, Hardy warns that "To dwell on a heath without studying its</page><page sequence="13">Hearing Hardy: Soundscapes and the Profitable Reader 143 meanings was like wedding a foreigner without learning his tongue" (123). This refrain is appropriate to a narrator who postures as our dis- tanced, though highly audible, guide to Egdon's terrain. Adopting and dis- owning this documentary register at will, Hardy moves from purposefully exaggerated spatial description to highly focalized sequences registering the varying subjective perceptions of inhabitants whose sensate reactions Egdon seems at once to elicit and control. Hence, the voluminous anthro- pomorphisms, which so explicitly embroider the iconic opening of The Return , attenuate as the narrative proceeds and the characters gain speci- ficity. Yet that figure of the choreographing external commentator - impersonal yet somehow prophetic - is scarcely absent. Indeed, even when Hardy's focus switches from a topographical task of describing place to a characterological one of relaying aural and visual impressions, he still grants himself the discursive freedom to intrude. So frank and un- sentimental as to enunciate terse asides, Hardy's occasionally gnomic tone detracts from the self-irony we detect in his interventions elsewhere. An episode well past the novel's exposition sees Hardy turning to the physical effects of his animate and animating setting in such a way as to showcase this ambivalent narratorial tenor vacillating between the tonal poles of im- personal reportage and apothegmatic assertion. This alternating tonality allows him to court a reductively gendered framing of the heath's inhos- pitable climate, when floating the assumption that Egdon, being the "kind of landscape and weather which leads travelers from the South to continu- ally describe our island as Homer's Cimmerian land, was not, on the face of it, friendly to woman" (104-5). The qualifying clause ("on the face of it") belies Hardy's self-reflexivity when dealing with Egdon's austerity, as he knowingly reinvokes stereotypical opinion. In effect, he colludes with the outsider's hasty first impressions before proceeding to disprove them by emphasizing how Mistress Yeobright claims a discreet form of personal agency through the acoustic acuity that she displays toward her surround- ings. For unlike Eustacia, on whom "The subtle beauties of the Heath were lost," Mistress Yeobright is consistently attentive to its seasonal cy- cles and their accompanying harmonics (123). And in witnessing the way the landscape's auditory spectrum mediates her navigation across it, we as readers are invited to listen more closely to modulations in the novel's dis- course.</page><page sequence="14">144 J N T Tonal undulations in Hardy's narrative voice thus combine with the de- scription of acoustic elements to plot Egdon Heath with reference to its surface reverberations. In this manner, Hardy's commentary shades into a more inclusive mode to observe a wider array of sounds, tracing each back to its inanimate source in ways that confirm the sensory intimacy, the im- plicit symbiosis, between characters and their habitat: It might reasonably have been supposed that she was lis- tening to the wind, which rose somewhat as the night ad- vanced, and laid hold of the attention. The wind, indeed, seemed made for the scene, as the scene seemed made for the hour. Part of its tone was quite special; what was heard there could be heard nowhere else. Gusts in innumerable series followed each other from the north-west, and when each one of them raced past the sound of its progress re- solved into three. Treble, tenor, and bass notes were to be found therein. The general ricochet of the whole over pits and prominences had the gravest pitch of the chime. Next there could be heard the baritone buzz of a holly tree. Below these in force, above them in pitch, a dwindled voice strove hard at a husky tune, which was the peculiar local sound alluded to. Thinner and less immediately trace- able than the other two, it was far more impressive than ei- ther. In it lay what may be called the linguistic peculiarity of the heath; and being audible nowhere on earth off a heath, it afforded a shadow of reason for the woman's tenseness, which continued as unbroken as ever. (105) Egdon's cacophony arrests the narration in a kind of meditative spell. As a stylist Hardy seems to relish these moments of pause, amplifying each sibilant-rich sentence to the point of euphony. There is a self-cautioning insistence on mere approximation over verisimilitude here, as Hardy hones language itself to the land's "general ricochet" rather than opting for spatially naturalistic details. Instead, topographical images and their rhyth- mic enunciation mutually inform one another in Hardy's attempt to impart a kind of firsthand record of what it means to hear the heath, even if that aural record strains toward metaphoric exaggeration. In a passage that de- pends to astonishing degree on the device that Hardy cherished "miracu-</page><page sequence="15">Hearing Hardy: Soundscapes and the Profitable Reader 145 lous animation," epithets peal forth in alliterative trios ( Literary Note- books 1: 63). They synchronize Egdon's resonating surfaces with the very syntax of observations, observations that swing away from visual coordi- nates to replace geophysical scales with musical scales. Hardy's building sentences thus distinguish "pits" and "prominences" by their radiating "pitch," implying that we can only fully appreciate the heathland's speci- ficity in pictorial and aural respects - matching the concentration with which we visually read this terrain with a keenness for things "heard" re- sounding off its "hard" and "husky" vegetation. Though occasionally lofty, this powerfully embodied prose deserves to be read aloud because Hardy actively integrates spatial description and syntactic rhythm to evoke a setting's heightened stimulation of the ear over the eye. Unafraid to take risks, Hardy brings nouns and adjectives into acoustic kinships. And in scenic descriptions of this intensity, he is adept at con- veying snapshots of physical space in a timbre that involves the reader in natural commotion. For while his symbolism equates the wind's impact upon rock and flora to orchestral voices, Hardy is careful not to allow his anthropomorphic comparisons to detract from his more literal evocations of surface and sound. Instead, he exemplifies his rhetorical control amid the cascading noise, even as he lends primacy to the "linguistic peculiarity of the Heath." Hardy commits to local detail over abstraction, allowing these acoustical and topographical features to occupy the focus of consec- utive events, exemplifying his sentiment that "Style ... is meant to ex- press something more than literary finish," as its "treatment depends on the mental attitude of the novelist" ("Profitable Reading" 85). It may sometimes seem as though Hardy appropriates this rugged environment as a platform for exhibitionism. But while assigning acoustical analogies to his settings, he sustains his discretion as a technician by giving us the im- pression that we are privy to a soundscape stumbled upon by chance, all but overheard, its "peculiar local sound" recorded afresh through the aural inflections of style itself. Participating in an Auditory Artifice "Let me repeat that a novel is an impression, not an argument; and there the matter must rest" - such was the blend of defensiveness and self-as- surance that characterized Hardy's famous response to Tess's severe recep-</page><page sequence="16">146 J N T tion ("Preface" 5). With this uncomfortable assertion, of course, he offered more than a self-acquittal or a glib vindication of aesthetic objectives. For Hardy, the "words" of his most favorable reviewers show that they, like the others, have only largely repaired my defects of narration by their own imaginative intuition. Nevertheless, though the novel was intended to be neither didactic nor aggressive, but in the scenic parts to be repre- sentative simply, and in the contemplative to be oftener charged with impressions than with convictions, there have been objectors both to the matter and to the rendering. (4) Resistant to the prospect of his work being appropriated as moral or social commentary, Hardy reflects in his shadow-written The Life and Work that his achievement was not to advance "a scientific system of philosophy" of the kind that contemporary critics accorded to his world- view, but to offer " seemings , provisional impressions only, used for artistic purposes be- cause they represent approximately the impressions of the age, and are plausible, till somebody produces better theories of the universe" (406). In this personal retrospective from 1917, Hardy evinces a commitment to representing perceptual experience that anticipates the Impressionism of Ford Madox Ford, Joseph Conrad, and Henry James. Seductive as such affinities are between Hardy and early-modernist prose, there remain im- portant stylistic distinctions to be made, in that Hardy arguably never pur- sued a style of free-indirect discourse with the consistency that we expect of Impressionist fiction. As we have seen in his approach to acoustic ter- rains, Hardy was more imposing as a narrator, his spatial panoramas ap- parently at odds with the impersonality and perspectivism that character- ize novelistic Impressionism. And Hardy seemed less interested in striving for authenticity where depicted impressions are concerned than in height- ening the reader's conscious awareness of the artifice of spatial descrip- tion. And by intensifying our alertness to the literariness of his settings, Hardy takes us a step further, whereby we are made aware not only of his embellished, even hyperbolized, language for evoking ambient spaces, but also of our own participatory role in envisioning them as they radiate from the page. Hardy, that is, demands something of leap of faith, insofar as he chooses to evoke the interplay of place and perception by reference to</page><page sequence="17">Hearing Hardy: Soundscapes and the Profitable Reader 147 acoustic events, compelling us to form a mental picture from sounds of landscapes that we expect to read in ocular terms. The picturing of sound thus transforms what it means to read the lan- guage of space in the novel. And as we have already noted, The Return of the Native dramatizes this reconfiguration of interpretive principles and expectations. Egdon elicits aural responses from its inhabitants as they confront unforeseen conditions, often reprioritizing the senses by dis- abling the primacy of sight. Auditory spaces affect self-orientation by dis- rupting the sensory hierarchies by which key characters locate themselves in spheres both familiar and unknown. For Eustacia, the heath is less straightforwardly a distracting source of noise than a plane of encounter, where personal judgments and decisions are mediated by natural occur- rences. Inhuman sounds impress upon her ability to verify human senti- ments. Overheard by Venn, the reddleman, attending the scene concealed by turves "as though he burrowed underground," Eustacia refuses to con- sent entirely to Wildeve's hatred for the heath, even as its "mournfully" windswept ambience diminishes the passion they fleetingly share (136). It is as if the landscape itself replies in place of her absent response: She did not answer. Its tone was indeed solemn and perva- sive. Compound utterances addressed themselves to their senses, and it was possible to view by ear the features of the neighborhood. Acoustic pictures were returned from the darkened scenery; they could hear where the tracts of heather began and ended; where the furze was growing stalky and tall; where it had been recently cut; in what di- rection the fir-clump lay, and how near was the pit in which the hollies grew; for these differing features had their voices no less than their shapes and colors. (139) Standard topographical nouns here are refused in favor of prosopopoeic verbs that render barely-visible signs of floral growth into "differing fea- tures" for us to discern. Hardy compresses into an audible list those traces of regeneration enduring resiliently yet invisibly between seasons. Again, our re-acquaintance with the heath via its "Compound utterances" alters the work of reading itself. Hardy challenges us to "view by ear," to map a territory in the mind with recourse to reported sounds rather than familiar</page><page sequence="18">148 J N T sites. In the absence of customary "shapes and colors," a synthetic process of aural visualization seems to offer the only way of specifying range, proximity, "direction" - spatial features usually envisioned with the aid of pictorial description. The episode is startling for the way it unsettles our expectations, an episode which "began and ended" in a profusion of sounds only to instruct us in a new method of imagining the spaciousness of its surroundings. Equally as forthright as this request to his readership, Hardy's technical ambitions can be felt most keenly here in his effort to amplify the aural distinctiveness of his prose, synchronizing its formal and figurative prop- erties. This interplay between renditions of sound on stylistic and thematic levels certainly anticipates Robert Frost's celebration of writers with ap- petites for the sonic vitality of syntax itself. Capable of harmonizing meter and picture, phrase-by-phrase rhythms and their radiating images, Hardy displays what Frost would praise as an attunement to sound as the very basis of sense. A generation in advance, Hardy's fiction exemplified Frost's maxim that "ear is the only true writer and the only true reader," anticipating Frost's imperative in 1914 to "Remember that the sentence sound often says more than the words" (113). And with precisely this em- phasis on the semantic importance of syntactic timbre, Hardy considered his task to be an "approximative" rather than a mimetic one. He never claimed to provide a full "transcript" of any given scene, the objective being to convey landscapes obliquely through their contrary effects of light and shade, clamor and stillness ( Life and Work 163, 229). The Return of the Native is preeminent for the way it intensifies rela- tions between selfhood and environment, as the ear gains ground on the superiority of eyesight. Peter Kivy has pondered the paradoxical invitation that sounds in literature present to us, exploring situations where acoustic details compel us, in effect, to visualize scenes as mental images by refer- ence to ambience rather than appearance. In his recent The Performance of Reading , Kivy remarks that "Ordinary language seems to have it that we see things but hear sounds " (125, emphasis original). He goes on to invoke Thomas Reid's influential deduction that we have difficulty extrapolating the "objective qualities" which are the local "cause" of sounds from the sensations that acoustic engagements stimulate in us (125). This leads Kivy to conclude that sounds themselves "are clear examples of qualities that we perceive as sensations. They have no being, for us, as perceivers,</page><page sequence="19">Hearing Hardy: Soundscapes and the Profitable Reader 149 apparently, except as sensations: as subjective states" (125-6, emphasis original). Kivy may be right to offer the commonsensical note that "We see trees, we do not see tree experiences; but we hear sound experiences and nothing more" (126). What Hardy facilitates, as I have tried to show here, is a mode of reading that allows us to recognize trees and terrains vi- sually but firstly by constructing them through the sounds that resonate off their surroundings. "Acoustic pictures" - actively registered in his craft, as in our processes of linguistic cognition - are thus the result of Hardy putting acoustic analogies before mimetic simulations, symbolizing rever- berations over visual referents. In January 1881, Hardy recalled William Wordsworth's "dictum" that "the more perfectly the natural object is reproduced, the more truly poetic the picture" ( Life and Work 151). He goes on to concur that this degree of "reproduction is achieved by seeing into the heart of a thing (as rain, wind, for instance), as is realism, in fact, though through being pursued by means of the imagination it is confounded with invention, which is pur- sued by the same means" (151, emphasis original). By homing in on the passage above from The Return , I have tried to reveal how Hardy amply fulfils this objective, when utilizing what we could call (albeit oxymoron- ically) a mode of auditory pictorialism, a mode that transcribes that "dark- ened scenery" into something more than itself - "distorting," in his fa- vorite way, that scene, by moving away from spatial realism to track its unpredictable effect upon different senses. While showing how the alert ear surpasses the inattentive eye, Hardy's fiction thus preempted and ful- filled his own advice in 1891 that novelists offer a vision of the world we experience that is necessarily perspectivai, yet all the more enriching for being precisely that: "To see in half and quarter views the whole picture, to catch from a few bars the whole tune, is the intuitive power that sup- plies the would-be story-writer with the scientific bases for his pursuit" ("Science of Fiction" 110). Intruding most audibly when weaving scenic descriptions alongside his protagonists' introspections, his own narratorial interludes allow him to perform an almost telepathic engagement with the countryside as though it were another percipient mind. Rural topography - thanks to the immedi- acy of our engagement with its magnified description in Hardy's prose - becomes a sensate presence that mandates a series of discrepancies be- tween seeing and knowing, reconditioning what it means to dwell upon its</page><page sequence="20">150 J N T volatile surfaces. And yet alongside his fascination with outwardly sensing and documenting space, Hardy was equally attuned to the flux of interior subjectivity, granting that "What cannot be discerned by eye and ear, what may be apprehended only by the mental tactility that comes from a sym- pathetic appreciativeness of life in all its manifestations, this is the gift which renders its possessor a more accurate delineator of human nature than many another with twice his powers and means of external observa- tion, but without that sympathy" ("Science of Fiction" 109-10). Hardy's concern thus lies not only with dramatizing the implications of dissociat- ing the observed from what is heard, but also in the potential for using his own artistic commitment to a "sympathetic appreciativeness" of the world as a means of exercising the "generous imaginativeness" of his au- dience. Against the backdrop of the dialogue between creator and reader, Hardy's provincial settings become dynamic auditoriums, where we can explore sounds that are verbally pictured as events in their own right, and whose semantic implications compel us to listen in. These are the profits and pleasures of that paradox of watching Hardy's noises. And while I have tried to particularize the formal procedures behind these sonic im- ages, over and above his resonance with larger issues in late- Victorian philosophies of aesthetic response, his soundscapes do point to a broader debate about the hermeneutic role played by our sensory experiences: speaking directly to the question of whether our capacity to see literary landscapes in our mind's eye relies equally upon the enchantment of our mind's ear. Notes 1. Given that only a selective coverage of Hardy's novelistic oeuvre is attemptable here, The Return will be the focal point for discussing aspects of aesthetic form. 2. Representative studies include Sheila Berge, Thomas Hardy and Visual Structures : Framing, Disruption, Process (1990); John Bullen, The Expressive Eye: Fiction and Perception in the Work of Thomas Hardy (1986); P. D. Edwards, Idyllic Realism from Mary Russell Mitford to Hardy (1988); J. Hillis Miller, Thomas Hardy: Distance and Desire (1970); Penelope Vigar, The Novels of Thomas Hardy: Illusion and Reality (1974). Although Bullen states explicitly that Hardy's "contribution to nineteenth-cen- tury intellectual life ... is characteristic of a mind which thinks in images rather than concepts," he does point to the need for a more differentiated notion of how percep-</page><page sequence="21">Hearing Hardy: Soundscapes and the Profitable Reader 1 51 tions operate in the novels themselves, an approach that can distinguish "the way in which Hardy's 'picturing' is but one aspect of a wider concern with the relations be- tween eye, mind, and word" (9, 10). 3. For an account of the critical tendency to evaluate "Wessex" in literal terms rather than as an imaginative arena for expressing regionalist concerns or as a platform from which to allegorize modernity's impact on provincial life, see Andrew Enstice's Thomas Hardy: Landscapes of the Mind (1979) and Simon Gatrell's authoritative use of manuscript evolution in Thomas Hardy's Vision of Wessex (2003). Compare also Ralph Pite's opening commentary in Hardy's Geography: Wessex and the Regional Novel (2001), chapter 1, with John Barrell's "The Geographies of Hardy's Wessex" (1982). 4. See Edmund Gurney's 1880 The Power of Sound. Aside from his incendiary Belfast Address, appearing in The Academy in 1874, John Tyndall continued to reiterate the necessity of inventive, imaginative thinking (and creative imaging) as a route to de- scribing the energies that operated upon and through our perception of the physical world. What was important to Tyndall's manner of heuristic inquiry was the interac- tion of emotional response and intellectual deduction. This was implicit in his British Association address at Liverpool in 1870, "On the Scientific Use of the Imagination," which was reissued the same year in Essays on the Use and Limit of the Imagination in Science (initially translated by Alexander Ellis as On the Sensations of Tone as a Phys- iological Basis for the Theory of Music, with its second edition appearing in 1885). Tyndall's concern with thermodynamics also reveals his effort to re-describe the logic of energy and matter in epistemological terms inspired by Helmholtz's account of sound. 5. Contemporaneous with Hardy's early career, popularizing writers such as Gurney and Tyndall were bringing into a realm of topical debate Helmholtz's foundational think- ing (even before the appearance of its first English edition) from On the Sensations of Tone, and Hardy's fiction certainly reflects this wider exposition of emerging theories of auditory physiology. Yet his acoustic spaces ultimately resist straightforward paral- lels with intellectual history, revealing more about the nature of their readers (includ- ing Hardy's twenty-first-century ones) than about topical neuroaesthetic debates of his time. While his fascination with spatial sounds evolved in proximity to affiliated sci- entific discourses, one should distinguish between the part that sound plays in how we read literary space and Hardy's relationship with the rise of the new psychology, espe- cially as his landscapes play host to a wide array of phenomenological and interpretive issues related to how we respond to the formal - and not simply figurative or rhetori- cal - aspects of literary settings.</page><page sequence="22">152 J N T 6. For Grant Allen, wave theory occasioned a reconsideration of the defining terms in which acoustical phenomena are aesthetically and psychologically understood. In a confessional, self-qualifying aside, he asserts that "I have carefully abstained from using the dangerous and misleading word Sound with relation to these aerial undula- tions, because that word really implies a reference to our sense of Hearing; and I think it important to impress upon the reader that these waves do not objectively differ from any others, but are governed by the ordinary mechanical laws of elastic fluids. It is only when cognized through the sense of Hearing that they become distinctively Sounds" (102). 7. Herbert Spencer's thought has an influential bearing on the depiction of perceptions in The Return of the Native. Moreover, Allen acknowledges his joint debt to Spencer's framework in The Principles of Psychology (1855) and Bain's companion studies, The Senses and the Intellect (1855) and The Emotions and the Will (1859), when elucidat- ing his own discursive approach to "aesthetic feelings." In Allen's view, artistic appre- ciation and dissatisfaction, as sensorial reflexes, are commensurate with our visceral reactions to nervous stimulation. Therefore we might think of the "aesthetically ugly" as that which "makes excessive and wasteful demands upon certain portions of the or- gans" (39). Allen cautions, though, that "since the pleasure or pain afforded by sepa- rate elements of sight and sound is so slight, and requires for its perception an exercise of attention, ... it results that in most cases the objects affording the sensations are merely intellectually discriminated as beautiful or ugly, without seeming to any no- ticeable extent pleasant or painful" (38).
