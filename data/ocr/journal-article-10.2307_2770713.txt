The continuing influence of Goethe, Emerson, Thoreau, Bryce, and Darwin upon Cooley's way of thinking is substantiated in de- tail; and yet the originality of the man in his chosen field is not thereby diminished. One sees ever more clearly how he brooded upon and felt the complex matrix of social relations and how he quickly moved beyond biological analogies to the empirical realities of social psychology. Jandy brings out clearly the fact that it was this man's artistic sensitiveness which made him aware of facts which more obtuse people could hardly glimpse. It is sometimes forgotten that the artist is an acute observer of compositions and values whose existence can surely not be denied, since they constitute the very nature of a work of art, but which are not readily appre- hended by unprepared and unattuned minds. But there need be no jealous rivalry in sociologi- cal matters, once it is realized how complex human society is and how many interacting levels constitute its being. The book is divided into two main parts deal- ing, respectively, with the biography and the theories of Cooley. The "Life" is, again, sub- divided into two chapters, which are devoted in a consecutive way to "Youth and Early Man- hood" and "Mature Years." Jandy is seeking clues for the correct appreciation of his subject's personality in the family antecedents and even in his precarious health. As is fairly well known, Cooley's father was Judge Cooley, the distin- guished constitutional lawyer. Cooley's well-kept diary is a mine of infor- mation on the early years. It took him long to find himself and his life-work. He was not pressed by his father to make up his mind, and so he tried one thing after another until the right subject appeared. It is clear that he had unusual opportunities, in many ways like those of William James, to travel and make social contacts. But, to use his own later terminology, his was an endogenous personality, extremely sensitive and introspective and yet withal per- spicaciously interested in the social scene. This introspective quality he counterbalanced in some measure by his training as an engineer and as a statistician. Jandy, I think, does a good job in this part and gives a really illuminating picture of Cooley's development and personality. It is soon evident that high admiration is tempered by scientific zeal. The query is never far absent as to why this man tended to ignore the quanti- tative side of his subject, despite the fact that he was professionally trained to handle it and had early made ecological investigations on transportation and communication. In any case it became clear that Cooley increasingly concen- trated on the mental side of society, upon ideas and attitudes. And here I quote from Waller's Introduction: "No one can be Cooley but Cooley himself. That bothers people. There is no royal road to Cooley's kind of wisdom." It is quite evident that Jandy is aware of this final- ity, though he cannot, as a good modern sociolo- gist spurred by the dominant scientific tradi- tion, help asking himself constantly these ques- tions: "Isn't this social philosophy as much as it is sociology? Isn't there too much of the Em- ersonian moralist about Cooley? How is the ought to connect up with the is?" But I must leave this biographical portion of the book with the warm recommendation that it deserves reading. I am myself, perhaps, prej- udiced, since I was an undergraduate member of the class in sociology which first had the pleas- ure of using the new text, Human Nature and the Social Order. That is already a long time ago. The part devoted to theory is at once exposi- tory and controversial. Here Jandy moves with competence, as both his handling of such topics as the growth of the self, and the self-idea, pri- mary groups and social classes, and his excellent Bibliography show. Always, the journal is used to throw additional light. A good instance of this use is to be found in his discussion of the term "primary group." I found illuminating his treatment of the genesis of the self-idea, begin- ning with James and Baldwin and proceeding through Cooley to Mead. Now, since the author has seen fit to bring in my name in connection with several points, I feel justified in making comments. In the first place, as a realist of an emergent or evolutionary type, I do think that in all this literature there is not sufficiently present the distinction be- tween the growth of the self and the growth of the idea of the self. It is indubitable that these two factors are interconnected, and yet they are distinguishable. The self, as I see it, stands more for capacities and abilities, many of which are realized only in social relations but which have a biological base. The idea of the self is an epistemic affair, which arises to awareness in the individual as this process of the growth of the self within social relations proceeds.</page><page sequence="3">BOOK REVIEWS 83 My impression is that Cooley reflected the philosophical climate of the time and of his fa- vorite sources of suggestion but that he was not an overt idealist in any technical sense, let alone a solipsist. It must be remembered that the or- ganic, or objective, idealism of the time was not strong in epistemology. There was much of the so-called objective mind about it and little clar- ity as to how one passed back and forth be- tween objective mind and private mind. And it is probable that Cooley long felt that the social mind could be known by individuals only as they creatively reproduced this social mind in terms of the ideas of other selves. Do we not know through ideas? For a very long time Cooley rather avoided epistemological distinctions and the methodological problems tied up with them. But, as I read Jandy and as I think back over my conversations with him about the time I published Evolutionary Naturalism, I would haz- ard the statement that he began to see that such questions were ultimately unavoidable. Was he mistaken in this? Sociologists must search their own consciences in such a matter, as must psychologists. Jandy is aware that Cooley was moving in a direction incompatible with extreme behavior- ism and with the Meadian and Deweyian type of experiential social realism. He is quite frank- ly puzzled by the situation. Now I think that I can tell what Cooley was driving at. He real- ized that man is unique in that he combines knowledge based upon external observation with a supplementary reflective self-awareness. There is integration and interplay, but the two supplementary avenues are distinguishable. "Imaginative intuition" is Cooley's term for the technique by which ideas of the self and of others are attained. But I am sure he would have held that such ideas must be verified and justified in their agreement with sensory obser- vation of social behavior. That is what I have called our "double knowledge" of minded or- ganisms. But this double knowledge, while dis- tinguishable, is mutually supplementary. That is why we finally conceive ourselves as minded organisms. Mead and his followers refuse to make these distinctions which involve the acceptance of ex- istentially private minds and consciousnesses. Theirs is a kind of experiential realism in which things are wrapped up in social interpretations of them. In my opinion this is more nearly akin to the tradition of idealism than is Cooley's view. I can never see how it can escape being a subtle form of anthropomorphism. Even to speak, as some do, of the "relational properties" of things or the "funded properties" is to forget that the real focus in human life is the way in which things affect the interests of human beings and how they are used and interpreted. I am in- clined to think that the increasing emphasis upon linguistics and semantics will lead to an awareness of the bases and implications of com- munication. Cooley knew that you had to have something in you to communicate, that you had to have ideas. In conclusion, I would say that Professor Jandy's study seems to me well worth reading. It is careful and sincere, and he is aware of the important problems. The passages from the journal seem to me judiciously selected and used with effect.
