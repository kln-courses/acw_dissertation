<plain_text><page sequence="1">THE AMERICAN JOURNAL OF THEOLOGY Volume vm APRIL, 1904 Number 2 THE PHILOSOPHY OF THE MOVEMENT FOR RELIGIOUS EDUCATION. By GEORGE A. COE, Northwestern University. EVERY profound stirring of the ethical or religious spirit on a large scale has two sides-an idea and an aspiration, a concep- tion of ultimate reality and an effort toward ultimate good. The spontaneity, extent, and earnestness of the agitation for religious education justify us in regarding it as a "movement" of this profound kind. It undoubtedly has an idea-side, a philosophy, as the implicit counterpart of its practical purpose. What this philosophy is we may hope to discover by noting the position which the movement occupies among the educational and philo- sophical currents of the time. EDUCATION AND THE TELEOLOGICAL VIEW OF THE WORLD. The general educational philosophy of our time is character- ized by two tendencies: (a) It gives ever-increasing recognition to natural law. This appears most prominently in the shifting of the point of view from the content of instruction to the child--- his physical and mental structure, his spontaneous impulses, the stages of his growth, and the relation of his development to the evolution of the species. We have learned to regard education 225</page><page sequence="2">226 THE AMERICAN JOURNAL OF THEOLOGY as a conscious carrying forward of a natural process.' (b) On the other hand, the end of education is defined in terms of social ethics. Education consists of acts performed by society for social ends. As far as the individual is concerned,it issues, not merely in intellectual power or worldly advantage, but rather in character. Each of these conceptions has a positive affinity for a particu- lar world-view. To regard education as the conscious carrying forward of a natural process is to include man's will-the will to educate-in the concept of nature. For the underlying thought is that of continuity between the biological processes that shape species in general and the school that shapes the human mind. If education is thus a part of the general cosmic process, it follows that here nature takes conscious charge and control of herself. Further, since education exists for the ethical ends of society, we may infer that here, at least, nature is not only intelligent, but also benevolent. One may, of course, deny the assumed continuity between evolution and education, or the benevolent character of educa- tion; but in so doing one would put oneself outside the pre- vailing currents of educational thought. Looking backward, we behold the race emerging from animality under the general laws of organic evolution; we see human society forming itself on the basis of natural instinct; and in education we cannot help seeing these same natural factors raised to a higher power. Thus, consciously or unconsciously, we admit teleology to a place beside law. With a little assistance from the theory of knowl- edge, it might be shown, further, that the purposed evolution that occurs through us cannot be regarded as merely sporadic or without significance for the cosmos as a whole. It is the part of the cosmic process that we know best. Here, where we are nature, we cannot help assuming that we have our clearest glimpse into the reality of things.2 z , Education is conscious or voluntary evolution. "-THOMAS DAVIDSON, History of Education (New York, igo9), p. I; cf. NICHOLAS MURRAY BUTLER, The Meaning of Education (New York, 1898), Lecture I. 2 The only writer, as far as I know, who has attempted a systematic analysis of the metaphysical implications of education is PROFESSOR H. H. HORNE, who dis- covers here the three ideas of traditional metaphysics--God, freedom, and immortality. See Philosophical Review, Vol. XII, p. i68.</page><page sequence="3">THE MOVEMENT FOR RELIGIOUS EDUCA TION 227 A teleological view of the world is thus the theoretical counterpart of education as a practical activity. The eyes of education are lifted up toward spiritual heights whence its strength comes. The philosophy of education in general, and of religious education in particular, is all one. Both conceptions have refer- ence to ultimate reality and ultimate good, and whatever truth controls one will control the other also. The religious-education movement is, indeed, simply one phase of the general advance in education. It manifests a quickened consciousness of the ethical end, and also of natural law as controlling the process. Religion as fact of consciousness has a place no longer outside but inside our notion of mind and its laws. Mind, in turn, is correlated with body, and so at last we connect religion with the entire evolution of life. In a real sense, the religious life of each of us is continuous with nature as a whole. Hence religious education is to be thought of as included in the "conscious evo- lution" which constitutes education in general. What dis- tinguishes the religious variety from any other is simply the fact that it explicitly recognizes the teleology that is implicit in the notion of education, and therefore undertakes to assist the child to identify his will with the universal Over-Will. We have now to note how this very general point of view is related to some of the current conceptions of technical philosophy. THE INTEREST OF EDUCATION IN METAPHYSICAL IDEALISM. Asking, then, not what philosophy is true, but what philo- sophical currents of our time move parallel with the general educational advance, we note, first of all, that the demand for religious education arises coincidently with the decline of dog- matic agnosticism and with the growth of certain types of ideal- istic metaphysics. Agnosticism has declined partly because a thorough application of its own critical method has revealed an ontological element in cognition; partly because of the newer directions taken by psychological study. Modern psychology connects the fact of cognition with the general ongoing of nature, especially the preservation of life and the evolution of social forms. There results a tendency to regard cognition no</page><page sequence="4">228 THE AMERICAN JOURNAL OF THEOLOGY longer as a subjective imaging of nature, but rather as participa- tion in the process of reality itself. This tendency is reinforced by the general recognition of the fundamental place of the will in all mentality. We no longer set ideas and realities apart from each other, and then ask how we can be sure that ideas are true copies of things. We regard the thinking of an idea as itself a will-act, and so as a part or phase of our total reaction upon reality. Reality is therefore regarded as not only knowable, but also actually known in all knowledge whatever.3 This newer phase of the theory of knowledge issues, of course, in an idealistic ontology. A non-mental universe is scarcely thinkable. In one way or another, mind-whether reason or will, conscious or unconscious, personal or impersonal-is ulti- mate reality. Perhaps the most influential type of idealism at the present time is that which tends to regard the cosmic mind as personal. Idealism of the Hegelian type has been swerved in this direction largely through the fuller recognition of will as fundamental.4 The "personal idealism" that results therefrom views reality as consisting of a society of persons having their being in and through one supreme person. The relation between this metaphysics and the new social ethics is direct and obvious. Its relation to the educational movement is not far to seek. The modern school reform is essentially an effort practically to fuse together nature, culture, and society. The undertaking is reasonable, provided that these three are genuinely continuous; i. e., if the individual realizes his individuality only in society, and is in himself also an index of the world that has brought 3Two recent statements of this point of view may be referred to: "There is no independent object outside of thought, and there is no 'thought in itself,' standing apart and in abstraction from the contents of experience and entering into only occa- sional and external relations to this content. We do not first have a mind and then become conscious of our relations to objects, but to have a mind is just to stand in those self-conscious relations to the objective realities. .... We are, of course, using the term 'thought' in its broad sense, as inclusive of the volitional and emotional aspects of the life of a rational being."-J. E. CREIGHTON, " The Standpoint of Expe- rience," Philosophical Review, Vol. XII, No. 6, pp. 593-61o; cf. F. C. S. SCHILLER, in Mind, Vol. XLVII, pp. 341-54. 4Perhaps the most prominent very recent example of this general tendency is JOSIAH ROYCE, The World and the Individual, 2 Vols. (New York, 19oo, 19or).</page><page sequence="5">THE MOVEMENT FOR RELIGIOUS EDUCATION 229 him forth. If reality is a society having the ground of its unity in a universal person, then, indeed, education and evolution are one process, and the social end of education is one with the cosmic laws involved.s EDUCATION AND THE IMMANENCE OF GOD. The philosophy of nature that moves within the realm of this idealistic ontology is largely summed up in the theological concept of the immanence of God. This means, among other things, that material things are forms of divine activity; that the laws of nature are simply the orderly methods of a rational will in complete control of itself; that evolution does not suffer any break when man, a self-conscious and moral being, appears; that the correlation of mind and brain is just the phenomenal aspect of the real correlation of our mind with the universal mind in which we live and move and have our being; that the develop- ment, physiological and mental, that man receives through nature and independently of his planning is yet a part of an educational plan, and that, in our work as educators, God is working through our reason and will to carry forward this same plan. Both "worldly " and " other-worldly" views are transcended by this conception. Narrowly "practical" notions of education may be widespread among the people, though they rarely become articulated into a theory. When this does happen, the s There are indications in many directions that educational thought is becoming conscious of the need of co-ordinating itself with a general world-view. A few typical quotations may be suggestive: " No education can reach its highest develop- ment until those having it in charge . . . . regard it from that standpoint of ultimate human good, and make the training of the child, in the truest sense, a religious act."- J. P. MUNROE, The Educational Ideal (Boston, 1896), p. 218. "In essence all educa- tion is religious, For what is religion but the consistent recognition that life has to be lived in the spirit of the whole, that we are not fragments, that the world is not a collection of fragments, but that our lives and the life of the world form a real whole ? " -J. S. MACKENZIE, "The Bearings of Philosophy on Education," International Journal of Ethics, Vol. VIII, p. 438. "Education . . . . is to develop the individual into a capacity for living in conscious unity with the sustaining power of the universe." -ARNOLD TOMPKINS, The Philosophy of Teaching (Boston, I895), p. 274. "Educa- tion is man's conscious co-operation with the Infinite Being in promoting the develop. ment of life."- BIsHOP J. L. SPALDING, Means and Ends of Education, 3d ed. (Chicago, 1901), p. 72.</page><page sequence="6">230 THE AMERICAN JOURNAL OF THEOLOGY theory turns out to be some form of materialism or agnosticism combined with hedonistic ethics of limited horizon. Yet every- thing that " practical " education can properly signify is provided for, on a higher plane, by the view that has been suggested. Nerve and sinew, physical forces and physical things, industry, commerce, politics - all these are included within the divine system of human education. We merely obey the divine decrees written in our members when we train hand, eye, and judgment to do the everyday tasks of life. Indeed it adds to the signifi- cance of all these things to see in them a divine presence and the means of a divine destiny. The danger of "practical" educa- tion is simply that of mistaking means for ends. " Other-worldliness," on the other hand, failing to recognize God in his world, robbed itself of the very means provided for our training into godliness. The pit from which education has been digged is well illustrated in Comenius, who, though himself one of the founders of the natural method, declared that this life "is not (properly speaking) a life at all, but only the prelude to a real and everlasting existence. .... Our only business on earth should be to prepare for the next world." Accordingly, he recommended that boys be taught " by the example of infants, boys, youths, and old men who are daily snatched away by death." 6 In the seventeenth century the nothingness of this life seemed to make education, as preparation for life hereafter, most important. In practice, however, the more distant the end in view, the more is education belittled. It is most exalted when it is seen to carry an exalted end within itself. Education, then is not mere means either for this life or for that which is to come; it is not mere preparation for life (though it is that), but rather life itself.7 Its method is not imposed upon the child, but derived from the laws of the child's self-realization. This is a truism in modern education, and the deeper aspect of it is the conviction that ultimate reality and 6JOHN AMOS COMENIUS, Thc Great Didactic, translated by M. W. KEATINGE (London, x896), pp. 184, 373. 7" I believe . . . . that the process and the goal of education are one and the same thing."- JOHN DEWEY, My Educational Creed (New York: E. L. Kellogg &amp; Co., I897), p. 13.</page><page sequence="7">THE MO VEMENT FOR RELIGIOUS EDUCA TION 231 ultimate good are not separate from our world, but realized therein; that the eternal is in the temporal, so that we may have eternal life abiding in us. The distinction between religious and secular education therefore lapses. The only real education is that which carries into life whatever meaning there is in the world that brings us into being. The problem of religious education is not how to add a feature to our school system, but to determine what education really is, and then to secure -not a kind of education, but - education.8 If this principle cuts to the quick the whole notion of secular education, it also penetrates to the joints and marrow of tradi- tional theories of religious training. For while it declares, as against secularism, that natural law expresses a spiritual reality, it also declares unto religious believers that spiritual life is lived in natural forms and under natural law. The opposition between education and grace, growth and conversion, is thus removed.9 Education is not a device of men; it is a divine operation in men. The inner spring of the movement, in both pupil and teacher, is the living God, who worketh even until now, while we also work. Of the effect of true education, not less than of sudden conversion, it may be said': "1By grace are ye saved, through faith, and that not of yourselves; it is the gift of God." THE PSYCHOLOGICAL POINT OF VIEW IN RELIGIOUS EDUCATION. Between modern psychology and the movement for religious education there are several points of contact. First, the "fac- ulty psychology" has been so completely superseded that any 8The American educational system includes three institutions -the family, the church and the school. Though the functions of these three are not interchangeable, the three must constitute a unit by being pervaded by a common feeling of the mean- ing of life. Otherwise we have no educational system at all. Though the state school may not teach dogma, its attitude, tone, and point of view should be religious. A school cannot, in fact, be neutral. To develop in the child a purely secular con- sciousness is to set up standards that compete with religion. Most of our state schools are probably pervaded by the spirit of religion, but many, apparently, are not. 9The difference between "growth cases" and " conversion cases " is not in their content, but in the rapidity of a process. See E. D. STARBUCK, The Psychology of Religion (New York, 1899).</page><page sequence="8">232 TlE AMERICAN JOURNAL OF THEOLOGY separation between religious and other consciousness, religious development and other development, is in principle impossible to present thought. In the next place, the extension of the field of psychology to the child-mind and to religion is begin- ning to furnish insight into the specific laws of religious devel- opment. The most significant general point of view thus secured is that the growth of self-consciousness is at the same time growth of the social consciousness, and that this ego-social con- sciousness has an ideal side, at once an ideal "self" and an ideal " other."'o0 Here religion has its root. Of more specific results the most fruitful are found in the psychology of adolescent religious phenomena, which is already helping to improve all methods of religious work with youth. This particular move- ment is so well known that a mere reference to it satisfies our present purpose. A word of caution, however, may be in order. Education is not applied psychology; it is, especially, not applied fragments of psychology. The psychology of religion is not a set of stencils with which to mark packages of humanity preparatory to railroading them to their spiritual destination. Education is the communication of life; and so into the mak- ing of education, as into the making of life, goes the whole of history, of philosophy, and of faith. A third point of contact between psychology and religious education is the clearer insight that recent years have brought with respect to the impulsive and instinctive factor in mental life. Of old the accepted definition of man was "a rational animal." Technically expressed, this is intellectualism, or the theory that cognition is the fundamental quality of mind. In general, this was the point of view of scholasticism. Through Thomas Aquinas it triumphed over the voluntarism of Duns Scotus, and it continued to dominate until Kant gave the primacy to the practical reason. The result was that intellectual training had a disproportionate place. The old-fashioned school, assum- ing that instruction is the essential part of education, cultivated almost exclusively the memory and the logical reason. Reli- xoJ. M. BALDWIN, Social and Ethical Interpretations in Mental Development (New York, 1897).</page><page sequence="9">THE MO VEMENT FOR RELIGIO US ED UCA TION 2 3 3 gious education consisted in teaching the catechism or the Bible. But because an essential function of mental life was here ignored, the practical outcome was that both the catechism and the Bible tended to become empty forms. Modern psychology regards the will (impulse, desire, and instinct included) as at least equally basic with intellect. Some writers go to the extreme of regarding intellect as a mere form or expression of will. Now, though we may suspect that mere will and mere intellect are mere abstractions, there can be no doubt that the voluntaristic tendency in psychology has enriched education. It has confirmed the principle of free self-expression upon which the educational reformers have laid so much stress. It has compelled us to attend to the whole circle of the child's spontaneous interests. We can no longer think of education as mere instruction. It consists, rather, in nourishing a self and bringing it to harmonious expression. We cannot impart educa- tion; we can only provide the means of self-training. The pro- vision of expressive activities in Sunday schools, the formation of self-governing clubs, the organization of practical service for young people, and similar innovations, are not merely improve- ments in "method;" they indicate a reversal of the point of view. Intellectualism is being abandoned. Since education is thus the self-training of the will, it is ethical in process as well as in purpose. The assumption used to be made that education, being a matter of intellect, is ethi- cally neutral, so that an educated thief (this was the stock example) is a worse thief because of his education. Today we are ready to say that a man with an untrained, unsocial will is not quite an educated man. In view of the universality of the religious impulse, the time may yet come when an irreligious man will likewise be regarded as undeveloped. In any case, religious education is ceasing to be identified with dogmatic instruction. It is taking into itself the training of the religious impulse, which manifests itself in feeling and act quite as much as in belief. The adoption of the evolutionary point of view into psychol- ogy creates a fourth point of contact with religious education.</page><page sequence="10">234 THE AMERICAN JOURNAL OF THEOLOGY We now realize that the spiritual unfolding of a child is not merely a growth from less to greater, but also a retraversing of the path (shortened, no doubt) from animality to spirituality. As a result, our standard of judgment with respect to the young has to be derived from young life itself in its various stages. The standards of maturity may no longer be used to justify the repres- sive training of other days. This change in point of view is most marked in its bearing upon the practical aspects of the dogma of depravity. In its complete and unrelieved form, this dogma leads to repression as the only method of training, whereas modern education aims at self-expression. Unless the child has native or germinal goodness, moral and religious edu- cation are simply out of the question. Yet it is perfectly evident that the native impulses of the child need readjustment. Some of them must be subordinated or overcome. Good character is an achievement that follows a struggle of a divided self after unity. The evolutionary point of view helps us to do justice to these facts. We are ceasing to think of human life in merely static terms. To the rigid "either-or," the "being and non- being," of good and evil, righteousness and sin, innocence and guilt, has been added the alternative of "becoming." Every child that develops normally is moving out of animality toward spirituality, out of egoism toward social self-realization, out of the life of sense into the life of the spirit. Every child is natu- rally depraved in the sense that there is always something in oneself to overcome; yet every child is naturally good because the impulse to overcome is also natural. THE ETHICAL REVIVAL AND THE MOVEMENT FOR RELIGIOUS EDUCATION. On its practical side the movement for religious education is a part of the general awakening of the social-ethical sense that has been going on for more than a score of years. But in point of theory the affinity is not so close. The distinctive feature of the newer ethics is its effort to express all ethical conceptions whatsoever in terms of human society. In its more radical form it asserts that society originated under the law of natural selec-</page><page sequence="11">THE MO VEMENT FOR RELIGIO US ED UCA TION 2 3 5 tion; that conscience is entirely accounted for by the pressure of the social will upon the individual; that the only ethical good is social health, progress, etc.; and that the only sanctions of morality are social rewards and penalties. The school, accord- ing to this, is simply an instrument for furthering the merely temporal process of social evolution. What is the relation of all this to religion ? According to some writers, religion is simply a naturally evolved means for the self-restraint of the individual in the interest of society.", One author holds that, having done its work, it will disappear." These are, of course, extreme views, yet they represent a ten- dency. Ethics independent of religion is in fashion, and hence education in morals has for this generation a kind of practical self-evidence that religious education hardly possesses. This is the fact even among religious persons. The dependence of moral education upon religion is aggressively asserted chiefly by the Catholic church. The obvious element of truth in this view is that, as the personality is one, so is education; so that reli- gious and other education belong together. Now, religion simply refuses to be a mere means to a temporal process like social evo- lution. It refuses to be co-ordinate with morals. It insists upon being a higher and inclusive principle; and if it cannot be that, it will be nothing at all. That Protestants are awakening to this truth after neglecting it arouses just pride among the Catho- lics, who have proclaimed it without ceasing.'3 Nevertheless, the question as to "dependence" is a complex one, and the different parts of it are often confused. The ques- tion may mean either, (a) Has the moral life of the race grown " H. R. MARSHALL, Instinct and Reason (New York, 1898); cf. BENJAMIN KIDD, Social Evolution (New York, 1895). 1" M. J. GUYAU, The Non-Religion of the Future (New York, 1897). '3 While Protestants are awakening to this, which may be called the major pre- mise of religious education, Catholics are awakening to what may be regarded as the minor premise, namely, the natural laws that underlie correct method. See, for example, a pamphlet, Religious Education and its Failures, by RIGHT REV. JAMES BELLORD (The Ave Maria, Notre Dame, Ind.). Another sign of the times is the recent establishment of the first Catholic magazine of education, the Review of Catho- lic Pedagogy, Chicago (now the Catholic Review of Reviews).</page><page sequence="12">236 THE AMERICAN JOURNAL OF THEOLOGY up under natural laws and forces ? or (b), Does the moral order in human life rationally imply a universal moral order, or God ? or (c), Is the content of duty known only by deduction from religion? or (d), Can the highest character be produced by social motives in the absence of religion ? The type of idealism already referred to, which is ethical through and through, answers both the first and the second of these questions in the affirmative, for it conceives the universal ideal as being realized through law, not in spite of it. As our impulses and emotions are included in the law of our develop- ment, dogmatic instruction is not the universal and necessary basis of good character. On the other hand, the highest char- acter must depend upon some realization--at least emotional appreciation-of the world-currents that flow through our being. Enthusiasm for humanity is little more than a fad or a reaction from the ennui of egoism, unless it is suffused with some realiza- tion that in social service one participates in the spiritual move- ment of the universe, and thus experiences the eternal in the temporal, God in us. Certainly morals are not a mere corollary of religious belief, yet moral education can complete itself only in religion.'4 RELIGIOUS EDUCATION AND THE PHILOSOPHY OF RELIGION. The philosophy of religion in its present form might almost be regarded as a philosophy of religious education. First, under the influence of Schleiermacher, it has adopted the psychological method of approach to both its historical and its metaphysical problem. The religions of the world are seen to be expressions of a constitutional fact of the human mind. The "tribe desti- tute of religion," which figured in the anthropology of the recent past, has disappeared, and the history of religion begins its story '4The ethical-society movement, organized to promulgate ethics independent of religion, quickly discovered that ethics must be raised to religion in order to be com- plete ethics. Mr. Salter, for instance, says that the moral life consists in making our- selves "the hands by which the eternal purpose realizes itself."-Address on "Ethical Religion," by W. M. SALTER, in Ethics and Religion (London, 1900), pp. 74-91; cf. address by W. L. SHELDON, on "'What Does it Mean to be Religious ? " in Ethical Addresses, First Series (Philadelphia, 1895); also W. R. W. SULLIVAN, Aorality as a Religion (London, 1898).</page><page sequence="13">THE MOVEMENT FOR RELIGIO US ED UCA TION 2 37 with the religious impulse as a datum.s5 As a consequence, not only must complete education include religion, but in the actual history of religion we behold an educational process on the largest scale. In the next place, the philosophy of religion discovers in the developing self-consciousness of man both a logical basis for belief in God and a growing content for the God-idea. That is, God progressively reveals himself through all the normal func- tions that reveal man to himself. Anthropomorphism, in this higher sense, is both inevitable and reasonable. It is the sole way in which the God-idea (or, for that matter, the idea of nature) obtains articulate content. In the individual and in the race the fact is the same. When conscience awakens, it moral- izes the gods as well as men. In proportion as the social instinct discovers itself, it socializes religion as well as morals. Any enlargement of the intellectual, ethical, or asthetic horizon enlarges in the same direction our ideas of the divine. Religion can be truly present, then, in all stages of growth, and religious education begins with the infant's first crude efforts at self-realization. This is education not merely for religion, but also in religion. New light is thus thrown upon Bushnell's famous dictum that "the child is to grow up a Christian, and never know himself as being otherwise." This is possible, not because a young child can attain to the inner side of mature Christian character, even in miniature, but because in any genuine devel- opment the highest is germinally present in the lowest. The free self-expression of the native religious impulse at any stage is a revelation of God; it is a stage in the growth of the plant whose flower and fruit appear in Jesus the Christ. One special feature of the dominant type of philosophy of religion, which is represented by the Cairds and Royce, has a peculiar interest for religious education. The cognitive function, it is said, is universally performed under a tacit assumption of a supreme mind to which the particular mind is related. It fol- lows that reflective or self-conscious performance of the cognitive IS See, for example, MORRIS JASTROW, The Study of Religion (New York, 1901), pp. 195 f., 293, etpassim.</page><page sequence="14">238 THE AMERICAN JOURNAL OF THEOLOGY function, which intellectual culture aims at, must bring the mind nearer and nearer to a fully explicit realization of the divine presence. Thus the traditional antithesis between intellectual and spiritual culture disappears, and from a new point of view the unity of education may be reasserted. RELIGIOUS EDUCATION AND THE PHILOSOPHY OF CHRISTIANITY. Divine revelation through the human self implies that human personality is the great objective as well as subjective force in education. The child finds himself only through society, and this is a foundation principle of all education, whether secular or religious. It is not the text-book or the laboratory that educates, but the contact of the child with persons. All such contact, whether in the school or out of it, contributes to the formation of character. The sense of the divine grows in the child through contact with other persons who show forth the ideal qualities of divinity. There is, to be sure, a native religious or idealizing impulse; else there had been no progress in the religious con- sciousness of the race. But the essence of education lies in the fact that native impulses are not left to find for themselves the painful path by which the race has toiled upward out of savagery. Education shortens the process through appropriate contact of the young with the products of past development. What civil- izes the child's native impulses is intercourse with the concrete civilization that surrounds him. Just so, religious training must come through concrete religion. No "methods," no catechizing, no written revelation, can do the work in the absence of a living revelation of God in human lives. The foundation of method is the sharing of life between the older and the younger. Now, the philosophy of Christianity is just the philosophy of this divine self-revelation through human personality brought into relation to the historic Christ. We are able, in some meas- ure, to understand him, because our self-consciousness, like his, bears witness to the God in whom we live and move and have our being. But he is at once the supreme man and the supreme manifestation of God, because what is dim and partial in us becomes clear and complete in him. For the same reason, he is</page><page sequence="15">THE MO VEMENT FOR RELIGIOUS EDUCATION 239 the supreme educator. Being the actuality of that which is only potential in us, he reveals us to ourselves and becomes an inner dynamic for the realization of our true self. He saves us by the sharing of life that is the essential fact in education. He is therefore both Teacher and Savior; but these two are one. Upon any theory of the divine self-giving for the world, the atonement becomes a dynamic in the human life by a method that is essen- tially educative. Whether one gradually assimilate the life of Christ as one grows in experience, or be suddenly converted from an already dominant lower self, the inner fact is the same. What moves us in either case is God manifested in a human person who shares our life. Thus we reach our final and highest conception of religious education, namely, that it is God's self-communication through Christ and through Christly men and women. "The glory which thou hast given me I have given unto them, that they may be one, even as we are one; I in them, and thou in me, that they may be perfected into one; that the world may know that thou didst send me, and lovedst them, even as thou lovedst me."</page></plain_text>
