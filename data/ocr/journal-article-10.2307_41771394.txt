But Egypt might just as well have been called Desert Land, for sand predomi- nates there. Journey up the Nile and you will see how quickly the soil surrenders to it. Histories and guidebooks make scant mention of the sand. As my wife and I discovered on one trip, it is as fluid as water and almost al- ways in motion. Sand blown onto the "steps" of Djoser's pyramid (ca. 2650 B.c.) at Saqqara may seem to be lying still, but it avalanches down on itself when the drifts grow too high. Let the wind blow, and you will see what a force sand can be. It scours and drills; it has worn away edges of ancient monuments, bitten into hard rock sur- faces and given them the pocked look of sponges. Indeed, the first "sphinxes" may have been desert outcroppings sand- blasted into anthropomorphic shapes. When I beheld Khufu's pyramid for the first time, I was struck not only by its size, but by how truly like a stone moun- tain it is, made an organic whole by the filing action of centuries of sharp-edged grains of sand. Get caught in a sandstorm, and you will not forget it. We had taxied from the Giza Plateau to Saqqara, boarding a jit- ney to take us to the Serapeum. But on our way to the underground burial place of the Apis bulls, the wind came bearing down on us, driving needles of sand into our faces and filling our hair. With relief, we descended the steps to the cavelike corridors where the mummified bulls had been lodged in enormous granite sarcophagi. We were alone, except for a white-robed guide who led us through the darkness in the halo of his lantern while the wind raged above. When we emerged, the storm had passed. The sand buries and unburies. Over time many bodies have come to light in shallow graves at the desert's edge. Some date back to the Predynastic peri- od, and it is easy to see how such natu- rally desiccated corpses - their hair, skin, and facial features intact - could have given rise not only to a belief in a continued existence, but to the practice of artificial mummification, which al- lowed the body to remain behind as a place for the free-floating soul to rest, ensuring its survival. Walking with Egyptian friends near the now moundlike pyramids of the Twelfth Dynasty pharaohs (ca. 1991- 1785 b.c.) at El Lisht, I was surprised when one picked up a bead exposed by the wind, but never so amazed as when I came upon a whitened human femur. Whose was it? Could it be a relic of Senwosret I who was entombed here? Bones and fragments of linen mummy wrappings protruding from the sand turn out to be more common in Egypt than I would ever have imagined, per- haps tossed aside by ancient grave robbers ransacking tombs for hidden treasure. Even in a picked-over area like the Valley of the Kings, a woman in our group retrieved a flake of gold leaf from the dust outside Tut's tomb and, after showing it around on the tip of her finger, dutifully presented it to our guide. Had it come from the tomb, breaking off when Tut's gilded posses- sions were removed? The sand insinuates. It gets into your ears, eyes, and hair, and even into your food. Biting into a piece of rough peas- ant bread still warm from an outdoor oven, I felt it crunch between my mo- lars. To many Egyptians, this must be a familiar sensation. To Ramses the Great, whose bread also contained grit from stone grinders, it was all too familiar. Over the course of his nine decades, his teeth wore down to stumps. The pha- raoh doubtlessly suffered great pain from toothaches, compounded by gum ab- scesses; he was, as the forensic specialist who studied his mouth wrote, "a dental cripple." Yet, while many of his monu- ments have been all but eroded into oblivion by the wind and sand, he sur- • vives to this day, mummified, his left hand raised as though about to brush a bit of sand from the corner of his eye. ■ Dale M.
