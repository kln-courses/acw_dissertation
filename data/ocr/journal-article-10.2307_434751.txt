<plain_text><page sequence="1">REVIEW ARTICLE THE COMPLEX ART OF BEOWULF THIS book' is the fruit of a lifetime devoted to the study of Beowulf, along with Old English and Old Norse literature in general. Comprehen- sive in scope, precise in detail, it examines vir- tually the whole range of matters pertinent to the understanding and appraisal of the poem as the product of a poet's art. The range is from language and poetic formula to the largest areas of organization, structure, and aesthetic achieve- ment. Brodeur's thorough mastery of the work of other scholars is no less evident than his judicious independence as interpreter and critic. Without distortion or bias, he takes due account of the contributions of Klaeber, Lawrence, Chambers, Malone, Tolkien, Bonjour, Magoun, and the rest. He begins where his predecessors leave off. If he rejects what he considers erroneous in their work, he builds firmly on the surer parts of their foundations. The book is comfortably arranged in eight chapters and three appendixes. Chapters are de- voted to "The Diction of Beowulf"; "Variation"; "The Structure and the Unity of Beowulf"; "Design for Terror"; "Setting and Action"; "Episodes and Digressions"; "Christian and Pagan in Beowulf"; and "Anticipation, Contrast, and Irony." The appendixes, chiefly pertinent to the first two chapters, deal with "The Varieties of Poetic Application"; "Check-list of Com- pounds Formed on the Same Base-words in Beowunf and in Other Poems"; and "The Limits of Variation." The first chapter discerningly examines the Beowulf poet's exploitation of the resources of the Old English language. Kinds and types of compounds are distinguished and analyzed; dic- tion is carefully related to context. The unique richness and variety in the vocabulary of the poem, previously acknowledged, is set out in representative fullness. From this sensitive sur- vey, together with the data in Appendix B, cer- tain valid conclusions are drawn. The Beowulf poet shows a preference for precise and vivid words; compounds designating objects, persons, or actions are sharper and more specific than in Old English verse as a whole. Nevertheless, the diction is remarkably restrained; the far-fetched metaphors found in some poems-as also in skaldic and metaphysical poetry-are almost totally absent. Important in connection with the dating of Beowulf is its comparative poverty in definitely Christian terms (as opposed to atti- tudes); even Genesis A offers far more. Thus the diction of the poem gives no support for a date later than the age of Bede. Altogether, Brodeur's discussion gives us a comprehensive insight into the diction of Beo- wulf, a convincing sense of the poet's words and how he used them. It implies also the value of a similarly careful study of other Old English poems. All this is, I believe, substantially exempt from controversy. Yet the chapter is strung on a controversial thread; Brodeur presents a care- fully considered challenge to the recent views of Magoun and his followers on two issues. First, citing the example of Cynewulf, he believes that a literate author could compose in "the tradi- tional, formulaic manner." The Beowulf poet, he maintains, was both a professionally trained scop and a man of literary education. Second, he is not convinced that the oral tradition left no room for originality in compounds or phrase- making. He emphasizes the variety, abundance, and frequently unique (in Old English verse) character of compounds in Beowulf. As evidence that the traditional vocabulary of poetry was not frozen, he points to the large number of com- pounds formed by religious poets to deal with specifically Christian conceptions-alongside the use also of inherited terms in a new sense. If in- novation was possible for a religious poet, why not also for a secular? "It seems reasonable, therefore, to regard the many unique compounds in Beowunf, finely formed and aptly used, as formed on traditional patterns but not them- selves part of a traditional vocabulary." Noting 1 The Art of Beowulf. By Arthur Gilchrist Brodeur. Berkeley: University of California Press, 1959. Pp. xii + 283. [MODERN PHILOLOGY, May, 1962] 276</page><page sequence="2">THE COMPLEX ART OF "BEOWULF" 277 that many compounds, both in Beowulf and else- where, are found in only one, two, or three poems, he concludes that "either the total poetic vocabulary was far richer than necessary to meet the need of any poet; or-and this is much more likely-individual poets allowed themselves much freedom in the formation of compounds." Brodeur's presentation will not convert those who believe that virtually the whole body of phrasing in Old English poetry is formulaic, although they may be wholesomely reminded of the uniqueness of every poem as a selection of poetic language. They will invoke the large body of untransmitted oral poetry: what appears to us as individual creation, they say, would be seen to be inherited if a larger corpus were available. They will no doubt set aside most of the innova- tions in the religious poems as the contribution of "learned" writers, outside the oral tradition. Thus is drawn a rather firm line between two views of Beowulf, a line likely to be maintained for some time. There is a danger of the develop- ment of stereotyped attitudes-less in the minds of the active opponents themselves, who are in position to see the notches in the razor as under the microscope, than among other readers and students. According to one stereotype, the poet was a man of letters who composed pen in hand; he had studied St. Augustine and Gregory the Great (in part, of course); he probably knew the Aeneid. Steeped in Germanic heroic legend and familiar with the oral poetry of the Anglo- Saxons, he freely used traditional phrasing when it suited his convenience; but otherwise his dic- tion is as independent as that of any other literary poet. According to the opposing stereo- type, Beowulf is the more or less accidental re- cording of some single performance of an un- lettered singer. Although he, of course, knew the story in advance, his composition and his per- formance of the poem were simultaneous; any other performance would have produced a dif- ferent "text." But the text of any composition- and-performance would consist almost wholly of word groups inherited in the oral tradition-- formulas and formulaic phrases. To add a touch of caricature to the stereotype, one might think of a long-distance telephone operator who auto- matically plugs in a series of ready-made num- bers along fixed circuits. Such a rigid, arbitrary, and mechanical con- ception of the activities of an oral poet receives important modification in Professor Lord's study of Yugoslav singers in the twentieth century, which appeared a year after Brodeur's book.2 This careful account is equally relevant for stu- dents of Homer and Old Germanic poetry. We must approach the ancient Greek or Teutonic oral poet by way of inference, conjecture, recon- struction of the image. His Yugoslav counterpart has been seen in the flesh, heard, recorded, and questioned. It is possible here only to mention summarily some features of Lord's collective portrait of the oral poet as he survived to our time. To begin with, Lord finds at least three stages in the (unregimented) training of the Yugoslav singers: listening and absorbing in childhood and youth; apprentice efforts, appar- ently solitary or without the kind of audience available to the mature singer; finally, attain- ment of a proficiency sufficient to hold an audi- ence. Beyond this, the artist continues inde- finitely the development of his talents. At no time, apparently, does he deliberately memorize fixed phrases or formulas; he absorbs them as he listens. Now, "not all singers whom the boy hears ... have the same formulas for a given idea or the same manner of treatment of formulas. There is no rigidity in what he hears" (p. 33). "But when he begins to sing, the manner of pre- sentation comes for a long time to the fore. Then the formula is born for him and his formula habits are acquired" (p. 33). Gradually he attains control of the language of poetry, including the pattern of the ten-syllable metrical line-though he would have no occasion to define it in those terms. The language of verse is thus a language within a language. "The speaker of this language, once he has mastered it, does not move any more mech- anically within it than we do in ordinary speech" (p. 36). As for the formulas, the young singer sometimes adjusts them "more or less con- sciously to his own needs" and sometimes un- consciously twists them. "They are not sacred, but they are useful" (p. 34). Trained singers apparently vary in their methods of adding to their repertory. Some, on hearing a song, can reproduce it at once-or, rather, tell the same 2 Albert B. Lord, The Singer of Tales (Cambridge, Mass., 1960).

Others prefer to take a day or two to think it over and get it in shape (p. 26). (We are reminded of Caedmon ruminant; or of Egil Skallagrimsson magically hindered during the night as he strove to save his life at the court of Eric Blood-Ax by composing Hofuth- lausn.) Part of Lord's description of the oral poet at work is of such importance as to warrant quotation in sequence: There is some justification for saying indeed that the particular formula itself is important to the singer only up to the time when it has planted in his mind its basic mold. When this point is reached, the singer depends less and less on learning formulas and more and more on the process of substituting other words in the formula patterns. Although it may seem that the more important part of the singer's training is the learning of for- mulas from other singers, I believe that the really significant element in the process is rather the set- ting up of various patterns that make adjustment of phrase and creation of phrases by analogy possible. This will be the whole basis of his art. Were he merely to learn the phrases and lines from his pre- decessors, acquiring thus a stock of them, which he would then shuffle about and mechanically put to- gether in juxtaposition as inviolable, fixed units, he would, I am convinced, never become a singer. He must make his feeling for the patterning of lines, which he has absorbed earlier, specific with actual phrases and lines, and by the necessity of perform- ance learn to adjust what he hears and what he wants to say to these patterns. If he does not do this, no matter how many phrases he may know from his elders, he cannot sing. He does this in per- formance, not before an audience at first, of course, but by himself [pp. 36-37]. [Italics mine, except for "merely."]. Again, since the young singer does not remember all the phrases needed, he is forced to form phrases on the basis of the patterns. Because they do conform to the patterns, they are indis- tinguishable from those which are remembered. Thus, a phrase is produced in one of two ways: by remembering it or by creating it by analogy with other phrases. "The singer cannot, and does not, remember enough to sing a song; he must, and does, learn to create phrases . . . I believe that we are justified in considering that the creating of phrases is the true art of the singer on the level of line formation, and it is this facility rather than his memory of relatively fixed for- mulas that marks him as a skillful singer in per- formance. ... New formulas are made by putting new words into old patterns" (p. 43). Conse- quently, it can be said of a representative Yugo- slav song produced by an oral poet that there is "nothing in the poem that is not formulaic" (p. 47). Yet, although all singers use traditional material in a traditional way, "no two singers use exactly the same material in exactly the same way.... We can differentiate individual styles in the epic technique of oral verse-making" (p. 63), says Lord, and proceeds to do it by the use of linguistic evidence. Is it unreasonable to find in Lord's account the basis for a reconciliation of the views of Brodeur and Magoun about Beowulf? It depends on the conception of the formula or formulaic phrase. If this is a pattern, or group of patterns, linguis- tic and metrical, rather than a fixed item in an inventory of inherited expressions, is there any objection to regarding the language of Beowulf as almost entirely formulaic? Apart from as- sumed defects of transmission, its verses conform to the patterns of Old Germanic meter. Linguistic and dictional conformity is no less complete; the "unique" compounds behave morphologically and syntactically exactly like the "traditional" ones. Lord's portrait of the oral poet, more com- plete and more intimate than any we have had hitherto, would seem to assure us of his freedom as an individual, creative artist. Apparently, ample opportunity for aesthetic distinction is available to the oral poet. Lord makes it clear that there are marked differences of ability among the Yugoslav singers. Brodeur's book, and especially the first two chapters, demonstrates the stylistic skill of the Beowulf poet alike in the use of inherited phrases and those which Brodeur regards as original. Both Lord and Brodeur attest the identification of individual characteristics among oral poets, the one among the Yugoslav singers, the other among the Icelandic skalds. Yet surely the selection and arrangement of phrases count for more than mere invention in the making and in the excellence of most poems. Perhaps this applies more fully to oral poems. It is chiefly the powerful ordering of thought and emotion in largely traditional metaphors that makes Egil Skallagrimsson's Sonatorrek as fine an elegy as Milton's Lycidas. At any rate, the "formulaic" point of view does not render study of the language of an "oral" poem or poet un- profitable for the critic, as some may have been inclined to believe. Once writing becomes a common practice in a</page><page sequence="4">THE COMPLEX ART OF "BEOWULF" 279 culture, the question arises as to the relationship between oral poetry and written literature. As indicated above, Brodeur thinks it possible for a man educated in books, to compose verse in the authentic manner of the oral tradition. Lord, who devotes a chapter to the general subject,3 is inclined to see a generic difference separating the two. Yet he acknowledges a considerable overlapping, or at least reciprocal influence. It is too early to attempt a deline- ation of the situation in Old English poetry as a whole. But certain tentative observations may be made. Cynewulf, as Brodeur notes, was apparently a man of clerical and therefore literary education; but his language is doubtless formulaic in the broad sense of the term set forth by Lord. It has generally been assumed that the composer of Brunanburh was lettered, though actually nothing is known about his education; this tenth-century poem appears to be thor- oughly formulaic, even in the narrower sense. At the other end of the time scale, Genesis A pre- sents us with the case of (1) an "early" poem, (2) a long poem, (3) a poem concerned wholly with a "foreign" content, (4) a poem composed in the formulaic manner, at least as defined by Lord. Genesis A is massive evidence of the assimilation of Christian matter by Germanic poetry. Now we know that almost from the begin- ning of Christianity among the Anglo-Saxons there were men who composed verse in both Latin and English. Aldhelm is only the most familiar example of what must have been a com- mon practice. This "personal union" of two poetic traditions is notable and significant. Un- fortunately the texts have not survived which would enable us to compare extensively the Latin and the English work of the same poet. But, obviously, Latin and Old Germanic verse are poles apart; one could scarcely find ex- amples of greater divergence among the nations of Indo-European origin. Let us imagine the situation of an eighth-century Englishman schooled in Virgil, Ovid, and the Christian Latin poets from Juvencus to Avitus. He wants to compose a poem in the native language of his people, most of whom are, of course, not trained in Latin. But what is poetry in his native lan- guage? It is a production made up of alliterative verse with fairly fixed rules, -of formulaic diction (in Lord's use), of development and expansion by "variation." This poetry has been created by the oral tradition, which perpetuates and sustains it. Our hypothetical book-learned poet is thoroughly familiar with the oral tradition also; he has ab- sorbed it from childhood onward, perhaps has practiced it. Naturally, he employs it; it would hardly occur to him to do anything else. If this was the situation of a poet who undertakes a long narrative drawn from the Bible, would it not be even more probable for one whose subject is Germanic legend, like the poet of Beowulf? Having dwelt at length on these matters of special and timely interest, I shall be obliged to treat the rest of the book with much less than symmetrical justice. Two appendixes reinforce and amplify the detailed study of style in the chapter on "Variation." With Heusler, as con- trasted with Meissner, Brodeur would restrict the term kenning to the figure in which a thing is called something which it is not literally: heofenes gim for "sun," banhus for "body." Compounds or genitive phrases which designate a person or object in terms of its characteristics he would call kend heiti, after the Old Norse practice: helm- berend for "warrior," y61ida for "ship," beaga brytta for "king." Perhaps epithet or character- izing epithet would be less formidable in English, though defective in exclusion. Such a distinction emphasizes the predominance in Beowulf of the characterizing epithet over the metaphorical kenning, which is so abundant in skaldic verse. In his discriminating correction of Paetzel's account, Brodeur defines variation as "a double or multiple statement of the same concept or idea in different words, with a more or less per- ceptible shift in stress." He makes it clear, as opposed to Paetzel, that variation can occur with or without syntactic parallelism: in Beowulf, lines 2-3, the noun "Prym" and the clause "hu 6a aebelingas / ellen fremedon" are in variation, both being objects of the verb "gefrunon." He dis- tinguishes variation from parallel enumeration, such as occurs in Beowulf, lines 333-34: "faette scyldas, / grege syrcan / ond grimhelmas." These distinctions are valuable; they should introduce more discrimination in our view of the 3"Writing and Oral Tradition," op. cit., pp. 124-38. I do not mean to make Professor Lord responsible for my use of his material in discussing the diction of Beowulf. His own brief discussion of the poem is found elsewhere in the book (pp. 198-202).</page><page sequence="5">280 JOHN C. MCGALLIARD ,Anglo-Saxon poetic. But the great achievement of the chapter is Brodeur's demonstration of the art and skill with which the Beowulf poet em- ploys the pervasive method of variation. It focuses attention, it emphasizes emotion; it lends stateliness to scenes of solemnity and ceremony. Unferth's speech thus becomes an elaborate per- formance suitable to the proud pyle of Hrothgar's court; his verb variations "convey admirably the niggling scorn" with which he regards the hero's undertaking. The factual and narrative portion of Beowulf's reply, on the other hand, is sparse in variation; but his conclusion, richly expressive of his confidence in himself and his contempt of Unferth, abounds in it. It has long been more or less clearly recognized that the Beowulf poet centers the emphasis of his narrative on the emotions and attitudes with which he surrounds the action itself. Brodeur shows that variation is one of the principal methods by which he does this. The temptation to add further illustration must be resisted. But no reader of Brodeur will henceforth regard the appositives and epithets of the poem as otiose padding; everything, or almost everything, is aesthetically purposeful and functional. In a period like ours, when critical attention is focused so sharply on the words of poetry, this should immensely enhance the reputation of Beowulf. The third chapter, dealing with the structure and unity of the poem, is a revision of an article published earlier. Adopting substantially the Tolkien view of a youth-and-old-age counterpart pattern, Brodeur locates the organic unity of the work in the character of the hero and especially in his relationship to Hygelac, alive and dead. Brief, partial comparisons are made with Achilles in the Iliad and Odysseus in the Odys- sey; these are not the less interesting in the light of the current inclination of classical scholars to regard Homer also as an oral poet. Brodeur rightly emphasizes the fourfold account of Hygelac's death; that event is of paramount im- portance for the character and career of Beowulf and for the destiny of the Geatish people. But it seems to me that he overstates a good case when he says that Hygelac's death "led to the over- throw of two peoples" (Geats and Danes). The usurpation by Hrothulf did not entail the de- struction of the Danish nation; indeed, it was not even a change of dynasty in the broad sense, though it altered the presumed line of succession within a single royal family. Moreover, although the terms of Beowulf's speech (11. 1822-39) do seem to imply his acceptance of something like "a firm military alliance" with Hrothgar, this was apparently directed against foreign enemies: "ymbsittend... swa J]ec hetende / hwilum dydon." To be sure, Hrethric will be welcome at the Geatish court, doubtless equally as princely visitor or political refugee. But I do not think Beowulf commits himself-or the Geats-to intervention in future internal struggle among Danes. Again, from Brodeur's point of view, apparent Geatish total abstention from the re- newed Danish-Heathobard war must seem a bit strange. For (1) here an external foe is involved, (2) Beowulf knows all about the situation and actually predicts an outbreak of hostilities (11. 2020-69), and (3) the war was serious enough to lead to the burning of Heorot, if the usual interpretation of lines 82-85 is right. The chapter "Design for Terror," also pre- viously printed in part, is a finely concentrated study of the poet's mastery of suspense and climax. Agreeing with preceding critics, Brodeur shows that suspense is not excluded by penulti- mate intimation of the outcome of the struggles with Grendel and with the female monster; varied from instant to instant, it is steadily built up until the decisive moment. Notably, and I think rightly, it is maintained that Beowulf did not callously wait for Hondscio to be devoured; he expected the sudden attack to be directed against himself. And, aesthetically, "Hondscio died so that the poet's audience might have final demonstration of the hideous power and fury of the foe whom the hero must now face." It is argued convincingly that, although the ogress is herself less powerful than her son, Beowulf's whole encounter with her is more perilous than that with Grendel-because of the situation, the circumstances, and the incidents themselves. Our experience of excitement, suspense, and ter- ror are less keen in the fight with the dragon, chiefly because the destruction of the hero (as well as his foe) is made so increasingly clear in advance. The chapter on "Setting and Action" covers fairly familiar ground. The greatly enriched back-</page><page sequence="6">THE COMPLEX ART OF "BEOWULF" 281 ground, the more careful motivation of the hero's exploits, are differentiated from the treatment in folklore and Scandinavian saga. Attention is given to the poet's handling of the "subplot"-- the destiny of the Danish and Geatish princes and people. "It is not the pageantry of the feast [in Heorot], but the manner in which the author places his personages within its setting and in- vests them with tragic meaning, which gives the scene its greatness." Contrast is a pervasive method of the poet: between the hall joy of Heorot and the gloom of the haunted mere; be- tween present glory and future disaster in the Danish and Geatish kingdoms; etc. Occasionally, as noted earlier, Brodeur may go too far. He sees an implicit contrast between Beowulf's success against the monsters and his failure in "the larger ends of statecraft": "all his courage and strength cannot save Hygelac, Hrothgar, or Hrethric, for God is not concerned to intervene in their quar- rels." But Beowulf, nephew and faithful thane, was not in a position to "save" Hygelac; he could scarcely prevent his lord from undertaking the arrogant assault on the Frisians. And Beo- wulf does not assume the kind of responsibility for Hrothgar and Hrethric which Brodeur im- plies. Should we not, like Hrothgar, allow the loyal and generous hero also the virtue of pru- dence? It seems to me, at least, that he rather carefully avoids biting off more than he can chew. Following Lawrence, Brodeur usefully reminds us of the poet's distinction of treatment among the monsters: Grendel and his dam are demonic figures as well as trolls; the dragon is regarded merely as a creature of a rather extraordinary but not unfamiliar species. The hero meets Gren- del in a dark hall and his dam in a supernaturally lighted underwater chamber; he encounters the dragon out of doors in broad daylight and with the help of Wiglaf. The fight is reported round by round, and the dragon's length is specified-- fifty feet. The extended chapter on "Episodes and Digressions" accepts Bonjour's view in general and most of his conclusions, then concentrates on a few topics. All will agree that, whereas the main plot of the poem derives from folklore, the "subplot" is based on Germanic heroic legend and historical tradition. Of the two latter, the first predominates in Part I of the poem, the second in Part II, with the Ingeld affair occupy- ing a middle position in relation to the classifica- tion as it does in the poem itself. Further, most or all of the "historical tradition" relates to events within the lifetime of Beowulf; it forms a unifying cluster of background for the final scenes and the outlook for the future of the Geats. Turning now to specific areas, Brodeur shows that the primary function of the dialogue between Unferth and Beowulf is to establish Hrothgar's confidence in the hero, so that he will entrust Heorot to the young foreigner-for the first time in his reign-as a champion against Grendel. It is attractively suggested that Un- ferth's probing of the visitor's claims, nowhere reproved by Hrothgar, was a part of the duty of the king's pyle. This view, Brodeur holds, is not negated by Unferth's ungracious manner, his envious nature, or his spotted reputation. Never- theless, the poet-unlike Beowulf, who responds courteously to his challenger's later overtures- steadily shows his dislike of Unferth. This is be- cause, unlike the hero, he knows that Unferth will later join disloyally with Hrothulf against Hrothgar (the inference here, shared by Brodeur with others, is based on 11. 1164-68). Coming to the still vexed Danish-Heathobard passage, Brodeur proposes, in line 2035, to adopt Grein's reading bi werede instead of biwenede and to take dryhtbearn as singular. Space forbids summary of his argument; the resulting translation of the line in context would give us: It can then offend the king of the Heabobards, and each of the thanes of that people [Para leoda-plural for singular] when he, a lordly scion of the Danes, comes into the hall with the maiden, past the ranks of the [Heabobard] veterans; on him shine the heir- looms of the men of old. This reading, of course, fortifies the view shared by most scholars, namely, that the scene is the Heathobard court, not the Danish court at Heorot. In the interpretation of the entire fore- shadowing passage, which the poet presents as a speech of Beowulf at the Geatish court, Brodeur introduces a nuance--but an important one. There are two objections to the usual classifica- tion of the speech as prophecy: such specific and definite foreknowledge is out of character for Beowulf; and the "prophecy" is erroneous, for in the tradition it was surely Ingeld himself who</page><page sequence="7">282 JOHN C. MCGALLIARD renewed the feud, not an anonymous young thane. Beowulf's prediction is therefore presented as a shrewd conjecture of what might happen. He was a bit off the mark, as the poet and the poet's audience knew; but "correction" would be in- artistic. The long survey of "Christian and Pagan in Beowulf" focuses chiefly on a refutation of part of Tolkien's view and on the problem of the great "inconsistency" in the poem-the moral (and to some extent theological) presentation of Danes and Geats as Christians alongside the clear state- ment that they were heathen. Brodeur rightly denies any evidence in the poem for a division between pagans and Christians among the Danes or for the view that, once converted, they-or any part of them-had relapsed under the stress of Grendel's depredations. By abundant cita- tions, he disposes of any proposed contrast be- tween Hrothgar as Christian monotheist and Beowulf as pagan halep ; he shows that Beowulf's language is as fully Christian as Hrothgar's. Having dismissed at the outset Klaeber's sug- gestion that Beowulf is a partial analogue of the Christian "Savior," he also rejects Tolkien's con- ception of the hero as an analogue or parallel to Odin's champions at Ragnarok. Here a mild demur might be offered. We do not know to what extent, if any, the English, before conver- sion, shared the Scandinavian myth of the end and regeneration of the world. Certainly Grendel is a giant or troll, assimilated to Biblical tradition as a descendant of Cain, not a cosmic monster like the Fenris Wolf. If he makes war on God, it is only by attacking men on earth. Yet the poet does associate him, through the lineage of Cain, with a comprehensive list which includes figures of greater magnitude than the demonic character of the poem: "untydras ... eotenas ond ylfe / ond orcneas, / swylce gigantas, /]a wib Gode wunnon / lange ]rage" (11. 111-14). Of this number are the giants destroyed in the flood depicted on the sword hilt taken from Grendel's cave (11. 1688- 1693). Now, as the scholarly translator of the Prose Edda well knows, seeking out and van- quishing giants was virtually the regular occupa- tion of the highly anthropomorphic Thor. Not all of these were on the scale of the Midgard ser- pent. Although we must not turn the thoroughly human Christian hero into a Norse god, despite the strength of thirty in his grip, it may not be totally irrelevant to remember that fairly recent ancestors of the poet and his audience had known Thor's English counterpart. As for the major ideological "inconsistency" mentioned above, Brodeur's solution is one that many students of the poem have tacitly accepted. The poet clearly places on record the paganism of Danes and Geats; he even laments the ignorance which pre- vented the Danes from appealing to the true God against Grendel. But, "having conceived Hroth- gar and Beowulf as good and noble men, he must of necessity represent them as speaking and act- ing as his hearers would expect good and noble men to do." Brodeur cites partial parallels from Chaucer-and might have cited them from Shakespeare. But when he tells us that the poet, having noted the pagan condition of his people, from then on (i.e., after 11. 188) ignores "all that was pagan in his story," is he not momentarily forgetting the three funerals of Scyld, Hnaef, and Beowulf? To be sure, Sutton Hoo has taught us much about the combination of Christian and pagan in Anglo-Saxon England. Incidentally, Brodeur's interpretation of the poem entails a wholesome dismissal of alleged interpolations. It may be hoped that we have heard the last of this outworn device to "explain" an imperfectly understood work of art. Different readings of particular lines are another matter. Returning to Holtzmann, Brodeur takes he in line 168 as referring to Hrothgar: because of Grendel, the king could not approach his own throne. The de- fense is impressive; in the nature of the case, probably no argument for any view could be wholly convincing. The final chapter, "Anticipation, Contrast, Irony," is in part, at least, a recapitulation and reconsideration of topics treated earlier. Minor in- consistencies in the narrative as well as the major problem of the history of the wealth in the dragon's barrow are also discussed. Lack of space prevents a proper examination here. But, like all the rest of this master work, it rewards attention. The University of Iowa JOHN C. McGALLIARD</page></plain_text>
