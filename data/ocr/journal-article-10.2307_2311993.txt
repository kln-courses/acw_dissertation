<plain_text><page sequence="1">SOME SIMPLE CALCULATIONS BASED ON VARIATIONAL PRINCIPLES DAVID SHELUPSKY, Princeton University One of the first encounters with the calculus of variations that most students have is the mention made of it in the elementary physics classroom in connection with the principles of least action in mechanics and the principle of least time of Fermat in optics. Since at this first meeting even the simplest deductions of the calculus of variations may be unfamiliar to most students, the following discussion may prove useful. The method that we shall use is that of Daniel Bernoulli in his solution of</page><page sequence="2">784 CLASSROOM NOTES [October the problem of the brachistochrone [1]. In this treatment the problem of the curve of quickest descent is treated as a problem in ray optics. If the positive y-axis is in the downward direction and a bead is set to sliding on a smooth frictionless wire then the conservation of energy gives us the usual relation v = (2gy) 1/2 for the speed of the particle when it is at the point (x, y) if the starting position is at the origin. Using the principle of least time in optics the problem may be stated as follows: to find the path of a light-ray in an inhomogeneous medium which has a variable index of refraction which is given by the law n(x, y) = c/v = c(2gy)-12 (where c is the speed of light in a vacuum). Having formulated the problem in this way Bernoulli solves the equivalent optical problem by dividing the ma- terial into a large number of thin slabs parallel to the x-axis, each of which is sup- posed to have a constant index of refraction. Across the boundaries of these slabs the index is to vary discontinuously so as to approximate the above varia- tion of n(x, y) and here the Snell law of refraction is applied at each boundary. This process gives Us in the limit of thin slabs the differential equations of the desired curve, the brachistochrone. This calcuilation, which is bypassed by the calculus of variations, is suited to the solution of many problems in mechanics and optics as involve indices of refraction and potential energy functions which are functions of one cartesian coordinate. Here we shall consider the case when these functions are dependent on the radial variable r in the usual (r, 0) plane polar coordinates. Thus, one of the problems which we shall be able to treat using the principle of least action will be the problem of planetary motion. Let us begin by considering the Fermat principle of least time, according to which (in geometrical optics) a beam of light moves so as to extremize the time of travel between two points, pi and P2, on its path, rP2 T= f ds/v. P1 We shall need Snell's law, the only result of a variational nature in our discus- sion, and which is frequently given as an exercise in textbooks on elementary calculus: if a ray of light passes through a boundary between two media which we label with the numbers 1 and 2 and in which the speed of light is vi and v2, respectively, then we have sin 01/vl=sin 02/v2, Oi being the angle between the interface normal and the ray in the ith medium. Let us begin with a medium in which v, the velocity of light, is a function of the distance from a given point 0. It is clear that every ray path will be a plane curve; if p is the initial point of the path then the plane of the ray will be the plane of the initial direction of the ray and the vector from 0 to p. In this plane we introduce polar coordinates (r, 0) with 0 as the origin. Following Bernoulli we divide the plane into thin rings of material in each of which the velocity</page><page sequence="3">1961] CLASSROOM NOTES 785 function is supposed to be constant. The typical one of these rings is the region with r-coordinate between r and r+dr. Considering such a ring, it is clear that the angle at the point (r, 0) which is made by the radius vector to the point and a curve in the plane passing through the point is 4, with tan 4 = rdG/dr. With this formula we can apply Snell's law. The typical light ray enters the ring at (r, 0) making an angle 4 with the ring normal (the radius vector to that point) and moving with the speed v=v(r). It leaves the ring at the point (r+dr, 0+do) making an angle with the ring normal at that point of 4+d4+dO and moving with the speed v+dv. Here dO is the angle change due to the convergence of the radii vectors at the two points of comparison and do is the change in the angle between the ray and local ring normal due to the actual curvature of the path. Snell's law becomes sin +/v = sin (4 + do + dO)/(v + dv). Neglecting differentials of higher than the first order we have sin (c + do + dO) = sin b + (d4 + dO) cos 4, so that Snell's law may be written as dv(sin q5) = v(cos c)(do + dO) or as dv/v = cot 4'(dc + dO). By the above relation for 6, namely tan 4 = rdO/dr, we have that cot 4.dO = dr/r, so that the equation becomes dv/v = drlr + cot fbd+, which is a differential equation to be integrated. We find, as our fundamental relation, the equation v =arsin 4 where a is the constant of integration. On using the relation sin 4 = r(r2 + r'2)"1/2 (where r' = dr/do), our fundamental equation becomes the differential equation (r2 + r'2)1 /2v(r) = ar2, which we may integrate as I v(r)dr = 0 - Oo. r(a2r2 -v2(r))l/2 Of particular interest is the set of power laws v(r) =cr8, c being a constant. The differential equation becomes 0 - Oo = cr a2(a2 -c2r2a-2)-12dr which is immediately integrable, the resulting equation being r =-I 3 C sin ((s - 1)(O - 00)) (where C = a/c).</page><page sequence="4">786 CLASSROOM NOTES [October One of the chief attractions of this equation is that for various values of s we get almost all of the curves which are studied in the discussions of polar coordinates in analytic geometry [2 1. We remark that the integration performed above is not valid if s = 1, for then a logarithmic integration enters, the result being r = roeb(O-0o) (where b = (a2/c2 - 1)-1/2) Let us consider the first of these relations. For s = 0 we have r sin (G-Go) - C which is the straight line, as we would expect in a medium of constant index of refraction. For s I we get the exponential spiral as we have seen above, and for s= 2 we have r = C sin (0-Go) which is the general equation of the circle in polar coordinates which passes through the origin. If we are given any two poinlts in the plane then we can put one unique circle through them which passes through the origin, provided that the three points, the two given points and the origin, are not collinear. If they are collinear then the circle they deter- mine degenerates into the straight line which they determine. Consider the case wheni they are not collinear. The circle which passes through the two points is divided by them into two arcs on one of which lies the origin. If two rays of light are sent out from one of these points in opposite directions tangent to this circle so as to move along it, then the ray that moves toward the origin will slow down and will spend an infinite time approaching the origin. This is seen if we consider that sufficiently near the origin we can replace the circle by its tangent through the origin. The time it takes for the light to move from a distance r=e to the origin is then roughly f6dr/cr2 dr/v, which is infinite. It is only if the points are on opposite sides of the origin that they cannot be connected by a proper light path, that is, one which has a finite transition time associated with it. The circle in this case, as we have mentioned, tends to the straight line through the origin which connects these two points. Light moving away from the origin moves faster and faster but never gets back to the neighborhood of the origin, while light moving toward the origin slows downi and never gets through the central point. Continuinig, now, we set s=3 and get the curve r2=C sin 2(0-0o) which is the general lemniscate of Bernoulli. In this case we see that a given point p in the mediunm can be connected with light paths to points whose 0-coordinate differs from that of p by less than 2r radians. For s = 3/2 we get r'12 = C sin 1(0-0o) so that r = C2 sin2 I(0 - 00) = -C2(1 - COS (0 - )) which is the equation of the cardiod, another famous subject of study in analytic geometry classes. In the case s = - 1, for which for the first time v(r) is a de- creasing function of r, we get the curve</page><page sequence="5">1961] CLASSROOM NOTES 787 K = r2 sin 2(0 - 0o) 2r2 sin (0 - Go) cos (0 - 00) = 2xy, where x and y are rectangular cartesian coordinates the axes of which are inclined at an angle 0o to the 0=0 radius vector. This is the equation of a rectangular hyperbola with asymptotes passing through the origin. The curve here is convex toward the origin, an indication, if we may be permitted the anthropomorphism, of the attempt of the light to make the greatest part of its journey in the high-speed region without putting in too much extra distance. In the previous examples the curves have been concave toward the origin. These curves illustrate that both maxima and minima occur as solutions of the least time principle and may not exist in some cases (as the illustration of the lemnis- cate indicates). The case s = 1 indicates to the student that there may be a large number of relative extrema, for the exponential spiral may wind an arbitrary number of times about the origin before coming to a pre-selected target point for the light signal. It may not be out of place to remark that the advantage of these calculations as a classroom demonstration lies partly in the large number of familiar curves which appear as solutions of the above problem. Let us consider, now, the principle of least action in mechanics and how our technique may be used to perform calculations here. According to this principle, if we have a system in which the energy is conserved, then of all the paths be- tween two points in space-time (xi, yi, Zi, ti) and (x2, Y2, Z2, t2), a particle moves so as to extremize the path integral f2 pds where p is the momentum of the particle. This principle, like the Fermat principle of least time, can be general- ized to describe the motion of systems in general. We see that we can use the formulas developed in our optical considerations if p, the momentum, is identi- fied with the velocity function 1/v(r). The differential equation of path which we developed earlier can now be written after this substitution as {r dr Jdr(a2r2p2 1) 1/2 0- . The function p(r) can be expressed as a function of r, so that this equation can be integrated, by using the equation of the conservation of energy, according to which the total energy, E, of the particle is the sum of the kinetic energy and the potential energy: 2MV2 + V(r) = p2/2m + V(r) = E (since p = mv) in which V(r) is the potential energy function. Thus the path equation becomes rt dr I -0-00.f Jr(a2r2*2m(E - V(r)) - 1)1l2 A mechanical interpretation of the Integration constant, a, can be gotten by considering that our fundamental equation in the mechanical case is to be written as l/a= pr sin q so that it is clear that 1/a is the angular momentum of</page><page sequence="6">788 CLASSROOM NOTES [October the particle, the moment of momentum about the central point, and this is a constant in a central force field. We shall replace 1/a by the letter L, the usual notation for the angular momentum. For the case of Newtonian planetary motion we take V(r) = GMm/r. Here G is the gravitational constant and M is the mass which is associated with the fixed attracting center at the origin. If we introdtuce the variable u -1r then the path integral takes the form - (2mE/L2 - 2GMm2u/L2 - u =)-1/2 _ - 0o, which we may integrate to get u + (GMM2/L2) = (2mE/L2 + G2M2m4/L4)"12 cos (0 0)- which we may write as r = (L2/GMM2)/(e cos (0 - O)-1), where e= 1+2EL2/G2M2m3. This is the well-known conic orbit of Newton with e and the major axis depending in the usual way on E and L. In this way we can derive the equations of motion of a mass in any central force field, the results being the same as when these are arrived at by the direct application of Newton's laws [3 ]. The results which we have arrived at in the optical case are, of course, not unknown. For derivations of these results which are based on more general optical equations, [4] should be consulted. As we mentioned earlier, the work of Bernoulli can be used when the po- tential energy in the mechanical case or the index of refraction in the optical wording of the problem can be written as a function of one cartesian coordinate. This lets us solve the problem of the harmonic oscillator, for example, and of the projectile in a constant gravitational field. The radially symmetrical prob- lems treated here, however, seem to the author to have more appeal. References 1. R. Courant and H. Robbins, What is Mathematics?, London, 1941, p. 383, or R. C.
