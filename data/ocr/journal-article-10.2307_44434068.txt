ABSTRACTS 1</page><page sequence="2">910003-910011 910003. (P-238) Magnetostrictive type torque sensor. Yoshihiko JJtsuiy Hiroshi Satoh, and Yasuyuki Makigawa, Mitsu- bishi Electric Corp. A highly sensitive, non-contact torque sensor was developed using amorphous magnetic alloy. A thin strip of amorphous mag- netic alloy was bonded onto the surface of the shaft, formed into a chevron shape, then the torque applied to the shaft was detected from the difference in the inductance of the detection coil wound around the strip. A highly sensitive torque sensor having outstanding linearity could be made by selecting a magnetic working point and stress working point to apply to the amorphous magnetic alloy and by optimum arrangement of the heat treatment and bonding pro- cesses. Temperature characteristics, twist resistivity, and noise resistivity were also evaluated to prove performance in practical use. 910004. (P-238) Speed sensor integration in hub units. Steven Brown and Christian Rigaux, SKF Bearing Ind. Co. Advancements in vehicle wheel speed sensing technology present automotive engineers with unique design opportunities. Both the integration of speed sensors into wheel bearing hub units and the introduction of new speed sensor technologies will be dis- cussed. 910005. (P-238) A parametric study of SI engine efficiency and of energy and availability losses using a cycle simulation. Lu Zhecheng, INRETS ; Maurice Brun, Laboratoire de Machines Thermiques, Ecole Centrale de Lyon ; and Francois Badin, INRETS. A parametric study of SI engine efficiency was carried out using a two-zone cycle simulation. The simulation models are first validated and then used to study the effects of different engine function parameters on the engine efficiency and on energy availability losses. The following parameters are consid- ered in this study: combustion duration, spark timing, spark plug position, combustion chamber heat isolation and compression ratio. The availability balance has been developed with the pur- pose of recovering the energy lost. It indicates the percentage of energy that could be recovered out of the total energy lost (in the exhaust system, for instance). This study requires detail informa- ti in on the gas state (temperature, pressure) and on the tempera- ti. res of the combustion chamber walls and of the cylinder head. Some of these temperatures are almost impossible to measure experimentally with the material available at this time. That is why we resort to cycle simulation. 910008. (P-238) Development of the variable valve timing and lift (VTEC) engine for the Honda NSX. Takefumi Hosaka and Minoru Ha mazaki, Honda R&amp;D Co., Ltd. The Honda variable valve timing and lift electronic control sysíem (VTEC) is incorporated in the engine of the NSX sports car that is scheduled for sales in Europe this year. In the process of advancement of Honda's engine technology, VTEC was developed for much higher output and higher effi- ciency. This is actually the first system in the world that can simulta- neously switch the timing and lift of the intake and exhaust valves. This system has made improvements in maximum out- put at high rpm, and also improved the low rpm range, such as idling stability and starting capability. 1991 SAE Transactions Section 3 910009. (P-238) The variable valve timing system - Application on a V8 engine. A. Titolo, Fiat Auto SpA. Analyzed are the final test results obtained on the Ferrari V8 engine featuring engine heads having the Fiat variable valve tim- ing system. Maintaining the base architecture of four camshafts overhead and four valves per cylinder, the VVT (regarding the intake and the exhaust) has provided record-level results at medium-to-low engine speeds, without penalizing the engine performance at high engine speeds. Improvements have also been made in fuel consumption as well as reducing the exhaust pollutants. Under analysis is the improved effect on both the "effective compression ratio" and the "expansion ratio" which together with the "volumetric efficiency" justify the high levels of the brake mean effective pressure (BMEP) obtained. Introduced here is the concept of the "sluggish area" of the standard sport engine performance, comparing the immediate response of the VVT to the partial loads at low-to-medium engine speeds. The final considerations on the racing engine applications complete this study. 1991 SAE Transactions Section 3 910010. (P-238) Volvo's MEP and PCP engines - Combining environmental benefit with high performance. J. E. Rydquist, O. Backlund, and P. R. Keen, Volvo Car Corp.; andK. Giselmo , and L. Sundin, United Turbine AB. In two research programs, Volvo has investigated high perfor- mance tubocharged versions based on the new 3-litre inline six- cylinder naturally aspirated engine. Power and torque targets were 180 kW and 385 Nm respectively, with a wide usable torque range. The MEP (methanol environment performance) project was linked to alternative fuel studies and focused on methanol (M85) and flexible fuel vehicle (FFV) development. With alternative fuels, it is important to investigate not only the emissions and fuel efficiency, but also the performance poten- tial, in particular when used in turbocharged engines. The MEP- engine could be reduced to 2.5 litre displacement, due to the good specific performance with M 85 fuel. Higher charge pressures could be used compared to gasoline. An M85 turbocharged high performance engine must be designed for higher peak combus- tion pressures. For the MEP-engine a series-sequential turbo system was developed, resulting in particularly good low end torque charac- teristics. The PCP (power concept project) program was focused on the development of a high torque, wide operating range engine ver- sion, with high fuel efficiency and low emissions, running on unleaded 95 RON gasoline. The PCP version retained the 3-litre swept volume, and a par- allel (bi-turbo) twin turbocharging system was developed for good overall efficiency. Both the PCP and MEP engines easily attained 200 kW and 400 Nm. In practical use, both engines can be compared with much larger N/A versions in regard of usable transient perfor- mance. The PCP engine had nearly the same fuel efficiency as the N/A reference engine, showing only 2-3% increased fuel consumption in cycle testing. Better efficiency and considerably more power could, there- fore, be obtained with the MEP version, compared to the refer- ence engine. 910011. (P-238) An approximate lap time minimization based on Indy style racing car geometry. Gene McNay and Lisa Southw- ick, University of Michigan. At the Indianapolis 500, racing teams expend a great deal of effort to shave hundredths of seconds off of lap times. This paper concerns the use of a simple model to provide an optimal combi- nation of design parameters, such as wing induced downforce, available engine power, tire slip angle characteristics and aerody- namic drag which will give a minimum lap time. The model is 3</page><page sequence="3">910011-910019 based upon experimental data mainly from the 1988 racing sea- son. (This data is presented in its entirety.) Analysis indicates that the limiting factor of fast lap times is the allowable tire slip angle. Based upon this model a minimum lap time of 40.8 seconds is calculated which corresponds to a speed of 354.90 km/hr (220.57 MPH). In an attempt to further characterize this optimum point, some parameter studies are performed which yield design curves illustrating the car's sensitivity with respect to changes in vehicle mass, engine power, air density and minimum aerodynamic drag. 910012. (P-238) Emergency braking dynamics of ground effects open-wheeled racing cars. L. D. Metz, University of Illi- nois. In all forms of racing, driver safety is of paramount concern. This is particularly true in the case of open-wheel, single seat vehicles such as Formula One and Indy cars, for which there is only minimal structural protection surrounding the driver. In the present work, we analyze the dynamics of emergency braking with and without the possibility of a spin. Aerodynamic drag and lift are included, and realistic vehicle properties were used to predict deceleration rates and associated vehicle dynam- ics (e.g., spin rotations&gt;180°). Reduction of ground effects down- force, changes in drag properties due to large changes in vehicle yaw angle of attack and kinetic energy of rotatory masses of the vehicle are discussed. Results include time histories of velocity, vehicle position -v-time trajectories and the associated kinetic energy required to be dissipated by the vehicle structure at vari- ous speeds. Results show that surprisingly large amounts of energy are dis- sipated through simple aerodynamic losses, and that the amount of kinetic energy remaining to be dissipated after even reasonably short braking maneuvers may be quite manageable from a vehi- cle design point of view. Finally, suggestions regarding rules mod- ifications and vehicle configuration requirements are developed in light of the results of the simulations. 910013. (P-238) Cooling and aerodynamics simultaneous optimization. Bruno Bonis, Carlo Delia Rolle, and Chris Bangle, Fiat Auto SpA. Beginning from the mid-70s a clear trend emerged in car aero- dynamic design and styling which dictated the lowering of the hood profile and a corresponding reduction of grill openings, while the nose surface remained dedicated to the bumper impact area and car number plate. On the other hand the increasing power of the engines requiring the treatment of exhaust gases, increased air conditioning system diffusion, combined with a front wheel drive layout, have all acted to crowd underhood space, making the cooling problem more complicated than ever. The aim of this paper is to demonstrate that an aerodynamic approach oriented to low drag coefficient is not in conflict with good cooling efficiency. To do this on existing modern car models different front mod- ifications were applied: air duct, opening displacement in a more favourable area, structural modification to carry bumper loads etc. Through these improvements substantial gains in drag reduc- tion, virtually with the same cooling effectiveness, were obtained. 910014. (P-238) Development of electric power steering. Yasuo Shimizu and Toshitake Kawai, Honda R&amp;D Co. A new electric power steering (EPS) was developed which uses an electric motor to provide assistance. It is a system combining the latest in power electronics and high power motor technolo- gies. The development was aimed at enhancing the existing hydraulic power steering's energy efficiency, driver comfort as well as increasing active stability. This paper describes the overall concept of EPS and outlines the components and control strategies using electronics. The EPS was tested on a front wheel drive vehicle weighing 1000kg in front axle load. The results showed a 5.5% improvement in fuel econ- omy. The EPS has also achieved returnability that gives the driver more moderate feelings matching the vehicle in action as well as the active stability control strategy for high speed driving. 1991 SAE Transactions Section 6 910015. (P-238) Joint force and moment analysis of a three- dimensional suspension mechanisms. C. H. Suh, University of Colorado. Despite its wide use and many years of engineering research and development, most suspensions, particularly "The McPher- son Suspension", have not been investigated as truly three- dimensional mechanisms. In this paper the McPherson Suspension, which is modeled first as a three-dimensional guiding mechanism, is analyzed for the forces and moments at each of the joints with its continuous displacement pattern of the suspension, in three dimensional space. With the development and use of effective software such as "nonlinear simultaneous equations solver" and "displacement matrix method" this paper, for the first time, presents an analysis of forces and moments of joints of rubber bushings to evaluate accurately the compliance effects. 910016. (P-238) Emergency maneuver experimentation using a driving simulator. Daniel Lechner, INRETS MA; and Gilles Malaterre, INRETS LPC. This research was carried out by INRETS (France) using the Daimler-Benz driving simulator (RFA), in order to analyse the behaviour of 49 drivers, when faced with an unexpected emer- gency situation at a junction. This experiment enables us to collect driver reaction times, and to validate our previous work dealing with the choice of an emergency maneuver. Most drivers resorted to braking. Only 1 out of 5 drivers succeeded in avoiding the collision, whereas an appropriate and correctly performed maneuver, in particular a wider use of lateral swerving, would have allowed a higher success rate. The advantage of ABS, the influence of the obstacle move- ment with regard to the outcome of the emergency situation, and the poor benefit obtained by reducing reaction times are also dis- cussed. Therefrom the main objective of driving aid devices should be to prevent the driver from being faced with such a situ- ation. 910017. (P-238) Suspension analysis with instant screw axis theory. C. H. Suh, University of Colorado. Currently all or most suspensions and their motions are assumed to be planar, and are kinematically modeled as two dimensional mechanisms. Therefore, the instant rotation centers, including the instant rotation center of the vehicle body with respect to the ground (commonly known as the "roll center") and the instant rotation center of a suspension with respect to the vehicle body, are all on the same plane. In this paper all suspensions will be assumed truly spatial or three-dimensional, and then the instant screw axis theory and the associated computational and kinematic methods will be devel- oped to replace all the instant rotation centers and roll axes by the instant screw axes, for a much accurate three-dimensional kine- matic analysis. To present the theory and methods in more detail, the three major suspensions, namely, Double-Wishbone, McPherson, and Multilink suspensions, are used as illustrated examples with numerical data, equation derivations, and computational results. 910019. (P-238) Development of a mobile tire test fixture and lateral force variations due to large camber angles. T. J. Drach and David C. Holloway, University of Maryland; and B. Mohanty, U.S. Dept. of Commerce. 4</page><page sequence="4">910019-910035 A mobile tire testing machine (MTTM) was designed and built with several unique features. This machine measures forces and moments of passenger car and smaller tires throughout large ranges of parameters. It can steer and camber up to 45 degrees, test on any surface, and continuously steer and camber without tire scrub. This last feature benefits acquisition of transient tire data since any external forces due to tire scrub are minimized. Typical passenger car tire test results are presented along with tests conducted at camber angles up to 25 degrees where the cor- nering force due to the camber angle offsets the cornering force due to slip angle. Trends noted in these high camber angle tests are discussed. 910020. (P-238) Stages in the development of four-wheel drive systems in Audi passenger cars. Bernd Hessing and Ernst Muller ; Audi; and Jurgen Stockmar, Germany. In terms of vehicle dynamics, four-wheel drive exhibits great capabilities as a power transmission system for high-performance passenger cars. There are now numerous different concepts for four-wheel drive configurations. To provide an overview of the different systems and their characteristics, this report first defines the design requirements for four-wheel drive systems. It then compares the alternative concepts in schematic form. Finally, the results of simulations and measurements are given to describe the characteristics of the quattro system developed by Audi in the various stages of its development. 1991 SAE Transactions Section 6 910021. (P-238) Modern automotive technology as exemplified by the Mercedes-Benz 300/500 SL. Guntram Huber, Mercedes- Benz AG. The successful tradition of exclusive and comfortable sports cars from Mercedes-Benz continues with the current roadster. The roadster offers a maximum in safety technology and operat- ing comfort. Sophisticated aerodynamic measures are enhanced by a new wind deflector which reduces wind disturbance in the open vehicle. New climate control features include a dust filter and the residual heat utilisation system. The soft top is electro- hydraulically operated. Active safety and ride comfort are com- bined on a high level by the adaptive damping system, which reg- ulates damping forces to correspond to the momentary require- ments of wheels and car body. The completely new seat design with integrated belt system enhances the structural safety fea- tures; the belts are easy to fasten and comfortable to wear due to ergonomie design. Occupant safety in the event of roll-over is increased by the set-up roll-over bar. Engines and catalyst sys- tems provide minimal exhaust levels in combination with long- term stability and low noise emissions. 910022. (P-238) Dynamic characteristics analysis of brake pipings. Hirohiko Ogino, Shyoji Shiokawa, and Hirotsugu Yamaguchi, Nissan Motor Co., Ltd. A new analysis procedure have been developed that evaluate a brake system performance based on analyses of the transient characteristics and frequency characteristics in the brake piping. Using this procedure, analyses were made of the effect of ABS operation on brake pressure changes and of the influence of the orifice on the pressure transmission characteristics. As an exam- ple of a frequency analysis, the pressure transmission characteris- tics were analyzed when pulse pressure occurred in the brake pip- ing as a result of variation in the wall thickness of the brake rotors. This paper presents the results of these analyses and shows the validity of the new procedure through a comparison with experimental data. 1991 SAE Transactions Section 6 910023. (P-238) Vibration isolated cabin by active suspension - Requirements, concept, and first results. A. Wiesm- eier and F. Uffelmann, IVECO Truck Engrg. Due to long working hours at the steering wheel of a long haul- age truck great attention has to be paid to the driving comfort. The possibilities of passive suspension systems are widely exhausted. It is shown by results of measurements that an active suspension system is well feasible with commercially available hydraulic components, though naturally still to be improved. An appropriate concept is presented including necessary changes of the existing test vehicle taken from series, sensorics and safety considerations. Also basic features of the control strategy and a first test rig for evaluating the control parameters of the hydraulic system are described. 910024. (P-238) Finite element stress analysis of rubber auto- mobile parts including friction. Etienne Jankovich and Medhi Jomaa, Hutchinson S.A. A new method is proposed to comput by the 3D finite element method ARC3D, the contact stresses of rubber automobile parts. It is based on a surface-to-surface friction contact algorithm. The contact tractions over the quadrilateral surface segments are computed. Coulomb's law of friction is enforced globally over a surface segment. A standard sliding block specimen is com- puted. Compared with photoelastomeric results, relatively accu- rate results are obtained. A car door seal is also analyzed. Finally car window seals are stress analyzed. The results correlate well with the experimentally obtained pull-up force. 910025. (P-238) Anti-bounce engine mount and its application to a four cylinder turbo charged diesel-engine. Michel Ferrand and Claude Vilain, Automobiles Peugeot. The suspension of the power train unit has a very substantial effect upon the vehicle's comfort in terms of noise and vibration. As it plays a rather complicated role and as the functions that are to be fulfilled are often conflicting, the designer is continu- ously searching for the best compromise. The suspension of the power train unit must: 1) position the engine in relation to the nearby structure and components, and within a usually restricted suspension travel; and 2) convey to the structure the stresses from the engine's weight and torque, while filtering and absorbing: the vibrations linked to the thermody- namic cycle and to the inertias of reciprocation masses. This vibration is within the 30 to 200 Hz frequency band, and is trans- mitted by solid means to the structure and intensifies the "hum- ming sound" inside the passenger compartment, the medium- wave vibration generated by the transmitted motions (squealing of gears and belts) 100 to 600 Hz frequency range, and low fre- quency vibration: engine idle vibration -20 to 30 Hz; torque pick-up when accelerating and decelerating; and the power train unit's specific mass on its supports -8 to 15 Hz. 910026. (P-238) Recycling a necessity in the design of automo- biles. Rolf Buchheim and Siegfried Brildgam, Volkswagen AG. Worldwide but especially in industrialized nations the deposit of waste is a problem. The automotive industry has to contribute to relax the waste problem by designing automobiles and help creating the infrastructure which reduces amount of waste- deposit of scrap cars. Design considerations for easy dismanteling, selection of recy- clible materials and deproduction facilities are important aspects. Research and pilot facilities in these areas are described. 910035. (SP-860) Heavy duty drivetrains - The system and component application. Charles R. Jones, Dana Corp. Heavy truck drivetrains, while comprised of components pro- duced by various manufacturers, must perform as an integrated system. The system has primary responsibility for transmitting engine power to the ground in a manner that will propel the vehi- cle over widely varying conditions. In doing so, it must provide long, trouble free life, while optimizing vehicle performance. The 5</page><page sequence="5">910035-910041 properly matched drivetrain system will complement the engine in minimizing vehicle fuel consumption. Standardized component-to-vehicle and component-to- operator interfaces assist the vehicle manufacturer in simplifying his assembly process. Humanistic consideration for driver comfort, and public health and safety further illustrate the necessity for matching and integrating drivetrain components into a system. This paper addresses first, various system traits, then a detailed review of component considerations when matching components and integrating them into a drivetrain system. 910036. A robotic driver on roller dynamometer with vehicle performance self learning algorithm. Akinobu Moriyama , Isao Murase, Tohru Takeuchi, and Akira Shimozono, Nissan Motor Co., Ltd. A robotic driver has been designed on the basis of an analysis of a human driver's action in following a given driving schedule. The self-learning algorithm enables the robot to learn the vehicle characteristics without human intervention. Based on learned relationships, the robotic driver can determine an appropriate accelerator position and execute other operations through sophis- ticated calculations using the future scheduled vehicle speed and vehicle characteristics data. Compensation is also provided to minimize vehicle speed error. The robotic driver can reproduce the same types of exhaust emission and fuel economy data obtained with human drivers with good repeatability. It doesn't require long preparation time. Thereby making it possible to reduce experimentation work in the vehicle development process while providing good accuracy and reliability. 1991 SAE Transactions Section 6 910037. Performance of a mechanized driver for measure- ments of automobile exhaust gas and emissions and fuel economy on chassis dynamometer. Norbert Holschuh, Jürgen Winckler, Hendrick Probst, and Kurt von Gliński, Volkswagen AG. The technology applicable to the measurements of exhaust gas emissions and fuel economy of motor vehicles still becomes more and more complex and complicated. Accordingly, the accuracy of the respective test results becomes more decisive. Therefore, it is necessary to minimize or even to eliminate possible measurement errors. The driver of a motor vehicle is known as one source of statis- tical and systematic errors. However, these errors can be reduced by replacing the human driver by a mechanized driver, a "robot driver". This report summarizes the results of the optimization work on such a robot driver, and it delineates the experiences collected on the systems now in use for about three years. Very sufficient performance and good durability have been observed. 910038. Official fuel economy testing some practical aspects of dynamometer matching of the vehicle roadload. Jo Ivens, Ford Motor Co. Official fuel economy tests in Europe and the USA are based on setting the dynamometer to simulate the vehicle roadload at steady speeds. Roadload is determined by a track test, generally coastdown (USA), or a drive test using wheel torquemeters (Eu- rope). Computer models of these procedures were constructed, mainly to show the effects of ambient weather conditions. It was concluded that the accuracy of both procedures could be improved, particularly in respect of correction to reference ambi- ent conditions. 1991 SAE Transactions Section 6 910039. In actual use car testing: 70,000 kilometers and 10,000 trips by 55 French cars under real conditions. Michel André, Insti- tut National de Recherche sur les Transports et leur Sécurité. Two measurement sets were performed by the INRETS (Insti- tut National de Recherche sur les Transports et leur Sécurité -Na- tional Research Institute on Transport and their safety) on vehi- cles under actual use conditions: 35 gas-engined passenger cars, selected amongst 7 French representative models, manufactured between 1979 and 1981, from 6 French geographical areas, were studied from 1983 to 1985; 20 gas-engined vehicles selected amongst two recent models widely sold between 1988 to 1989, in the Paris area and in the provinces were studied between 1989 and 1990. In both cases, the vehicles selected were private cars, equipped with on-board measurement and data acquisition systems and sensors. They were driven by their owners in the course of their day by day use. Vehicle and engine speeds, throttle position, fuel consumption, engine oil and water temperatures, as well as uses or operation of the manual choke, headlamps, wipers, rear- window heater and the engine cooling fan were recorded at sec- ond time intervals. During the second experimental set of mea- surements, outside ambient temperature, power consumption of the vehicle electrical system and brakes use were recorded too. 10,000 trips were recorded for 71,000 kilometers covered which represented 1,260 hours of vehicle running. This signifi- cant amount of data allowed obtaining a very accurate statistical basis as relates to the actual use of vehicles. A short description of the method used is given. Vehicle uses and running conditions are analyzed through all the data recorded, taking into account the geographical areas, the vehicle models, the drivers and the trip distribution according to time: the vehicle uses: frequency of daily uses, trip durations and dis- tances covered, trip distribution within the day or the week; the trip characteristics: duration and length, speeds used, number of intermediate stops, etc.; and the engine and vehicle running con- ditions: engine speeds used, engine load, gear changes, running thermal conditions, fuel consumption, etc. A great stability can be observed between the two sets of mea- surements (average trip of 11 min. 30 for 7 kilometers covered and of 10 min. 30 for 7.3 kilometers covered, for the first and sec- ond set respectively; with very similar duration and distance dis- tributions), but a significant increase of vehicle daily uses can be noted. Such a stability confirms the validity and representativity of these measurements, even if they were carried out on a limited sample. Use distributions show a significant number of very short trips. 1991 SAE Transactions Section 6 910040. Data recorder for automotive diagnosis. Satoshi Neg- ishi, Kenzo Takahashi, and Toshio Yuyama, Automotive Elec- tronics Systems Div., Toshiba Corp. A data recording system which is useful for malfunction diag- nosis of ECUs (electronic control units), such as those for engine control, has been developed. It has thirty-four input channels (21-digital, 8-analog, 2-event, 3-interval) and features independent direct recording of ECU output signals and sensor signals. Since this recorder is designed to memorize these signals in two time domains as before and after a malfunction occurs, the source(s) of failure can be shot eas- ily by analyzing the recorded data. The input data can be recorded over long periods of time, because this system uses memory card(s). A system with these functions will prove an invaluable aid for failure shooting of ever more complicated elec- tronic units in the future. 910041. The effect of crank angle resolution on cylinder pres- sure analysis. Michael F. J. Brunt and G. Gordon Lucas, Lough- borough University of Technology. The effect of crank angle (CA) resolution on the analysed cyl- inder pressure data has been investigated using both simulated and experimental engine cylinder pressure data. This revealed that the noise levels in some of the derived parameter data can be greatly increased by low ADC and high CA resolutions. A 6</page><page sequence="6">910041-910049 method for reducing the noise spikes by dynamically adjusting the calculation CA resolution at each point in the engine cycle is proposed and shown to be very effective. The accuracy of the calculated imeps has also been studied using experimental pressure data. The sensitivity to both CA res- olution and integration period phasing was found to be small. Overall, this work has shown that the best CA resolution to use depends on the application. A CA resolution of 0.5° to 1.0° should be most suitable for a compression ignition engine increasing to 1.0° to 2.0° for most spark ignition engine studies. For real time imep calculation, a CA resolution of 10° could probably be used with only a small loss in accuracy. 910042. Measurement of cylinder bore deformation during actual operating engines. Hiroya Fujimoto and Yuji Yoshihara , Musashi Institute of Technology; Takaharu Goto , Nissan Motor Co., Ltd.; and Shoichi Furuhama, Musashi Institute of Technol- ogy- One of the phenomena accompanying the lightweight/ compact/high power output feature of engines is the cylinder bore deformation, which may readily cause increased oil consump- tion, gas leakage, unusual wear, scuffing, etc. The authors have had experiences that piston rings had generated contact failure during engine operation. Such deformation is generated as a com- bination of the static deformation due to head bolt tightening, crankshaft installation, etc., and the deformation by the operating factors; thermal load and combustion pressure. Countermeasure of design have been made for the former, and prediction of the deformation during actual operating have been tried using FEM analysis, etc. for the latter. Therefore, the accurate measurement result have been required strongly, for a long time. But it could not be realized in the past. In this study, the unique and special method has been devel- oped in order to measure the whole cylinder bore shape directly from a piston ring land under the operation upto high-speed and high-load. 1991 SAE Transactions Section 3 910044. (SP-850) Advances in toughening of phenolic compos- ites. Michael L. Boroson, Bruce B. Fitts, and Barbara A. Rice, Rogers Corp. This paper describes work aimed at the development of tough- ened granular fiber reinforced phenolic molding compounds for use in high speed injection molding processes for the automotive industry. Two aspects of toughening were investigated, resin modification and fiber length and type. A proprietary impact modifier was studied to determine the effect of modifier level and glass fiber level on the toughness and flexural properties of short glass reinforced phenolic composites. To determine the effect of fiber length and type, a new proprietary compounding technique was developed to produce granular molding materials with fiber lengths previously attainable only in bulk molding compounds. New toughened phenolic composites were developed based on these studies and are compared to commercial composites based on unmodified and rubber toughened phenolic resins. 910045. (SP-850) Structural thermoplastic composites for inte- rior energy management to meet FMVSS 201 and 208. Patrice Gerault, Exxon Chemical Co.; Mark Huber, Chrysler Motors Corp.; and Mike Rosser, Exxon Chemical Co. More stringent federal regulations (FMVSS 201 and 208) have been established to limit injuries of car passengers in case of acci- dents. Materials with good energy management capability, such as structural thermoplastic composites, are being given the first roles in instrument panel, kneebolster and seat applications. 910046. (SP-850) New polymethylpentene compounds for automotive applications. Mary Jane Hagenson and Edwin Bou- dreaux, Phillips Petroleum Co. In recent years plastics have been finding increasing applica- tion in underhood performance parts due to good thermal perfor- mance, weight reduction, cost savings, and design flexibility. Downsized cars with lower hood lines and smaller engine com- partments as well as an increasing dependence on sophisticated electronics have placed stringent demands on the performance of plastic components. Automotive materials have an increasing demand for higher heat, humidity, and chemical resistance. Polymethylpentene (PMP) is a semicrystalline "engineering polyolefin" which melts at 240°C. It has a density of 0.835 g/cc, one of the lowest of all polymer resins. PMP also exhibits high optical clarity, good thermal and chemical resistance, outstand- ing electrical properties, and good processability. Mechanical properties at room and elevated temperatures are improved by the addition of glass reinforcement. The resultant compounds have excellent electrical properties, high strength, and good ther- mal and chemical resistance, which are beneficial in a variety of automotive applications. The preliminary properties of several glass reinforced com- pounds of PMP are presented in this paper. These properties are compared with those of several engineering plastics presently being used in the automotive industry. 910047. (SP-850) Polymer composite processing: Factors influencing process selection. Walter J. Lee, GE Plastics; and Jan- Anders E. Mânson, Ecole Polytechnique Federale de Lausanne. A variety of composite processes are described in terms of composite processing maps. Process selection depends on several factors, including required performance, material processability, process economy, complexity, and part size.

(SP-850) Injection/composite molding of glass- reinforced thermoset composites for automotive under-hood applications. Lenny Peterson, Bucher, Inc. The advantages of the injection/compression molding process for thermoset composite materials will be addressed as follows: 1) thermoset composite history and transition of compression molding to injection and injection/compression molding pro- cesses; 2) advantages of automated injection/compression mold- ing to reduce labor, scrap rate and product cost; 3) machine design requirements for efficient and consistent injection/ compression molding; 4) mold design examples will include moveable core pins to eliminate weld lines, gate-cutters used to balance flow, and other standard injection/compression con- cepts; and 5) current and future under-hood applications for ther- moset composite materials. 1991 SAE Transactions Section S 910049. (SP-850) Effect of fiber and property orientation on "C" shaped cross sections. Christopher L. Clark, Corrine K. Bals, and Mark A. Lay son, G E Plastics. Glass fiber reinforced bumper beams are being used on increasingly more automobiles due to the weight and energy management advantages the materials have over steel. Current bumpers are manufactured using basically three fiber orienta- tions or combinations thereof: 1) random, chopped and continu- ous; 2) unidirectional, continuous along the length of the beam; and 3) 0.90, continuous on the length and perpendicular, woven. For the purpose of this paper, the composite used for all FEA models and sample moldings is a 40% continuous glass fiber rein- forced, polypropolene resin based, sheet stampable thermoplas- tic. It is possible to assume that the results can be generalized to other composites. 7</page><page sequence="7">910049-910057 The finite element analysis found that significant increases in performances were achieved over the conventional fiber orienta- tions. The ±45° fiber orientation over the entire beam showed the greatest improvement in stiffness over the random orientation, however, this was not considered by optimal result due to manu- facturing difficulty discovered in sample molding. The computer modeling was performed using ABAQUS software. The model used is a half model with dimensions similar to that of a bumper for a 3000 pound car. The samples molded for correlation were formed in a "C" section test tool modified to have the same pro- portions as the FEA model. The automotive industry continues to demand quality and performance improvements. In order to supply higher perfor- mance parts we must not be content with current designs and technology, but must continue to maximize the quality and per- formance not only of materials but design. 910051. An infrared telemetry technique for making piston temperature measurements. G. L. Barn a, D. B. Brumm , and C. L. Anderson , Michigan Technological Univ. An optical telemetry technique has been developed for obtain- ing piston temperatures in reciprocating engines. The technique employs a transmitter mounted on the underside of the piston which transmits the temperature information as frequency mod- ulated infrared pulses. This signal is picked up by a photodetector mounted in the crankcase which is wired to an external receiving unit. The transmitter consists of a thermocouple or thermistor, voltage-to-frequency converter, calibrating circuitry, and an infrared light-emitting-diode. The receiver consists of a photo- transistor, frequency-to-voltage converter, calibrating circuitry and voltage readout. The transmitter is powered by lithium bat- teries. The signal has been successfully transmitted at speeds up to 4500 rpm in a 2-stroke engine and up to 5000 rpm in a 4-stroke engine. The accuracy of the infrared telemetry device using ther- mocouples is ±2.8°C (95% confidence level). 910052. An expert system based approach to internal combus- tion engine experimentation. Gloria M. Tsao and T. H. Chang, College of Engrg. and Applied Science, University of Wisconsin- Milwaukee ; and Keh C. Tsao, Dept. of Mech. Engrg., University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee. Artificial intelligence and experimental design techniques have been applied to internal combustion engine testing. The integration of these technologies resulted in a computer based system non-experts can use to design efficient test strategies. The user may select standard tests and design two-level full factorial and half fraction experiments. The engine experimentation system developed can set up stan- dard engine tests, define initial test conditions, design full facto- rial experiments, design half-fraction experiments, eliminate redundant tests and reject inadequate experimental designs. The engine experimentation system is an expert system that is easy to use, maintain and enhance. It was implemented using the IBM expert system environment software. 910053. Research engine for evaluating the effects of variable compression ratio (VCR) and/or variable valve timing (WT). G. J. Larsen, Retired, FMC Corp. The design of a single-cylinder Otto-cycle test engine is described in which the timing of both intake and exhaust valves, as well as the volume of the compression space can be indepen- dently varied within wide limits during operation. The proposed engine is of all-welded construction and uses stock engine components where practical to minimize produc- tion cost. Valve opening and closing is by positive cam action (desmodromic) with a differential gearset providing the phase shift between these functions. The upper portion of the engine, comprising the cylinder head and block, is connected to the crankcase through a hinge parallel with the crankshaft axis and a pre-loaded hydraulic actuator. This arrangement allows variations of the minimum distance between the top of the piston and the cylinder head without affecting the valve timing significantly. An oscillating counterweight, in line with, and 180 deg. out-of- phase with the piston, eliminates vibration due to first and sec- ond order inertia forces, thus allowing the 0.72 liter displacement engine to be run at high speeds without requiring a heavy test bed foundation. A simplified form of the valve mechanism, offering a reduced range of adjustment, as well as the "hinged-block" construction which enables VCR, are readily incorporated in production-type engines. 910054. VW's gasoline direct injection (GDI) research engine. Herbert Schäpertöns, Klaus-Dieter Emmenthal, Hans-Joachim Grabe, and Winfried Oppermann, Volkswagen Research. Volkswagen's research team created a prototype vehicle called "Futura". The power unit is a low-consumption, low-emission unthrottled petrol engine employing a high-pressure pump to inject petrol directly into the combustion chamber. At partial load, evaporation cooling additionally helps to reduce consump- tion because component and oil temperatures are regulated to suit engine output. This concept represents a solution to CO2 problems in spark ignition engines. At this stage, it is impossible to say whether this concept could be developed into a mass- production engine. 910055. Hot corrosion of nickel-base exhaust valves in a natu- ral gas engine. Julia A. Schauer, Valve Div., TRW, Inc. Many heavy duty valve applications require high strength materials to survive servere loading and dynamic conditions. In some applications, the engine environment may dramatically reduce the useful life of the valve to a fraction of the required life- span. Inconel 751 exhasut valves failed at low hours of operation in a natural gas engine. The valve separated at the stem blend caus- ing extensive damage in the cylinder. The valve failure was caused by liquid phase hot corrosion. Sulfate deposits left by burned engine oil provided the sulfur source to start the corrosion reaction. The combination of the sulfate deposits and rich fuel-air ratio created the proper conditions for valve failure. The recommended course of action entailed changing the valve base material to an iron-based austenitic stainless steel alloy (23-8N). The 23-8N alloy is resistant to hot corrosion attack. 910056. Application of turbulent combustion model to a spark ignited L-head engine. Yong Xu, Yu Dong, and Keh C. Tsao, Dept. of Mech. Engrg., University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee. The developed k-e-R model for computing the mean in- cylinder gas motions is being applied to a spark-ignited L-head engine of three different chamber designs. The theortecially cal- culated burned gas fraction is significantly affected by the flame front radius, the spark location and the squish area of the engines. The basic concept of the spherical flame kernel was employed in the early stage of flame development and later super-imposed with the in-cylinder gas motion to define the flame front radius. The calculated pressure rise was then compared with the mea- sured pressure for its practicality in engine design. 910057. Digitally controlled fuel metering pump for small gas turbine engines. T. Krepec and A. Labbate, Concordia Univ.; and M. Taylor, Bendix Avelex Inc. There is a need in the gas turbine industry for an inexpensive fuel control unit for the new breed of high performance small gas turbine engines. To answer this demand, it is proposed to couple an automotive type fuel pump with a stepper motor driven in 8</page><page sequence="8">910057-910065 microstepping mode. The speed of the motor and the fuel flow rate can be controlled by the frequency signal from the computer. This concept is particularly well suited for the gas turbine engine fuel supply where the fuel pressure at low speed is low and the fuel leakage in the pump is not high. The stepper motor driven by a microstepping driver can reach high speeds of several thousands rpm. The unit can be installed inside the fuel supply tank, as is the case with electric fuel pumps found in automobiles. Proto- types have been made and tested. Both steady state and transient response are showing an impressive performance of such an elec- tronic fuel metering pump. Also, the price, as compared to that of existing fuel control units for gas turbine engines, is favorable and has the tendency to go down with the spread of stepper motor drive technology. 1991 SAE Transactions Section 3 910060. (SP-858) Man-machine interface and the control soft- ware for automobile navigation system. Yorihiro Matsuda, Yas- uomi Fujita, and Yoshinobu Kobayashi, Vehicle Systems and Electronics Dept., Vehicular Technology Lab., Sumitomo El. This paper describes the man-machine interface and control software of a navigation system for private automobiles. The sys- tem shows the accurate position of the vehicle on a CRT map dis- play and can also provide useful information such as the loca- tions of hotels, golf clubs, etc. The man-machine interface of this system consists of a menu display and touch-sensitive switches on the screen. Due to safety considerations, some of the displays and operations are prohib- ited while the vehicle is in motion. A multi-tasking software system controls these functions. Most of the programs were written in "C", but assembly language was used for some basic input/output control programs. The total program size is about 384 Kbytes. This navigation system was installed in Mitsubishi's Dia- mante models in 1990. 910061. (SP-858) A simulation system to optimize map- matching techniques on a vehicular navigation system. Ken Ikeda and Ryoubun Tachita, Tokyo Research Lab., Matsushita Electric Industrial Co., Ltd.; and Akihito Shibata, Matsushita Communi- cation Industrial Co., Ltd. One of the most important technologies for navigation system is to improve the level of accuracy of vehicle's location. So an autonomous dead reackoning system is effective as a first step, map-matching technique is necessary to eliminate accumulated location errors. For practial use, however, the map-matching technique should be evaluated and improved for various driving condi- tions, because conventional map data are not accurate enough, and there is a wide variety of road conditions. So we have been working to develop a new simulation system to optimize map- matching techniques with a higher degree of efficiency and with- out so many actual driving tests. This system was designed to make pseudocircumstances of indoor field tests, which allows map-matching techniques to be evaluated more efficiently, and it reduces practical tests to evalu- ate navigation system. And using this system, we can estimate a goal of specification of sensors. This paper describes the above-mentioned simulation system. 910062. (SP-858) Integrating business listings with digital maps for use in vehicles. Alan Norman, Walter B. Zavoli, and Mike Heide m an, E tak, Inc. Digital maps have been used in vehciles since 1985, primarily for navigation and driver guidance. A natural evolution in advanced driver information systems (ADIS) is the development of a variety of in-car computer application programs that will run on a reconfigurable display. Navigation will be one of the most - if not the most- significiant menu item, along with such offer- ings as: business listings; tourist attractions; a personal database and dialing directory; and stored and real-time diagnostics infor- mation. These in turn will be augmented by other intelligent vehi- cle/highway system (IVHS) services, such as real-time traffic and weather reporting. The integration of business listings with a digital map, and presentation of this amalgamated information to the driver is an important first step in the evolution of ADIS. In this paper we propose a user interface for accessing listings data, the organiza- tion of the map and listings data required to support such an interface, and the resulting requirements imposed upon the list- ings data itself. ABQueries include standard text based searches such as locating a listing by name or by subject, along with geo- graphic queries such as finding the nearest listing to a location for a given subject, and finding all listings within a given proximity to a location for display on a map. Finally, the distinction between static and dynamic listings query is discussed. The advantage of dynamic listings are pointed out as well as its attendant implications to data structures. 910063. (SP-858) Design considerations for the implementa- tion of an automotive dot matrix display subsystem. Lori D. Markatos and Timothy R. Nixon, Ford Motor Co. Automotive display designers are faced with the task of pro- viding more information to the driver through the implementa- tion of an increased amount of on-board vehicle electronic sys- tems. Package space in and around the instrument panel, how- ever, is at a premium. One remedy to this situation is the imple- mentation of a dot matrix display with enough flexibility to fulfill several potential applications. Once a dot matrix display is inte- grated into a vehicle, information can be reformatted for presen- tation to the driver without redesigning the display device or its associated electronics. The system designer can then concentrate development resources on the remaining display subsystem com- ponents and issues such as user interface, display lighting, and packaging requirements for a specific application. A dot matrix display subsystem was placed within the elec- tronic instrument cluster of a test vehicle for the purpose of dem- onstrating the capability of presenting text and graphic informa- tion within a relatively limited package space. This paper will focus on the design efforts for prototyping a dot matrix display subsystem as well as some recommended enhancements for a future application. 910064. (SP-858) A dot matrix display software development environment. Richard C. Berry, Ford Motor Co. An efficient, integrated development environment for a dot matrix display system can permit software and hardware to be developed independently and simultaneously. Such a system can directly spawn a host of development tools that expedite the con- figuration of dot matrix display systems for many varied applica- tions. A dot matrix display simulator provides a means for soft- ware debug as well as an end-product that can be used in lieu of physical display hardware. By developing systems that satisfy the criteria for application-independence, a development link can be established between the simulation tools and the physical hard- ware target. This results in a shorter display development cycle by enabling new features to be tested and added to the physical target with a minimum of difficulty. 910065. (SP-858) Development of color STN LCD for automo- tive information display. Motoyoshi Itoh, Mitsunari Yoshida, Toshiyuki Terada, Masatoshi Horii, and Seiyu Kuniyasu, Stanley Electric Co., Ltd. We have developed an automotive information display which provides high resolution and high display quality by using a newly developed film compensation STN LCD (FST). 9</page><page sequence="9">910065-910071 The key issue of this FST development is optimization of compensation film, LC mixture, color filter and cell design for automotive application. Further, in order to realize bright and highly visible display, compensation conditions of FST is care- fully examined, and a newly developed warm cathode fluorescent lamp (WFL) is adopted for a backlight. WFL has advantages of both cold cathode fluorescent lamp and hot cathode fluorescent lamp, and provides a high light intensity with dimming capabil- ity. Such new technologies of FST and WFL are combined with peripheral technologies which integrate those key components into a total display system. Prototyped display based on these technologies and its results are reported in this paper. 910066. (SP-858) Development of thick film electrolumines- cent lighting for automotive application. Takahiro Saida, Ken *ichi Kondo, Shuichi Taya, Uruo Kobayashi, Katsunori Kawano, and Osamu Miyata, R&amp;D Lab., Stanley Electric Co., Ltd. A "thick film electroluminescence (EL) device" has advan- tages in its thin structure, light weight, uniform lighting, and mechanical flexibility (bending). From these advantages the thick film EL can be regarded as the optimum light source for recent cars which require a high packaging density consisting of various components to be mounted in a small space. EL is now being used for light sources for both interior and exterior light sources for automotive applications utilizing its fea- tures. However, it has not yet reached a satisfactory level of per- formance and had only limited application areas because the thick film EL device up to today has a tendency that its luminous intensity rapidly decreases when used in a high temperature and high humidity environment. This time, we prototyped an EL device utilizing a transparent conductive film which can give moisture proof effect and unfirm luminous intensity, and we evaluated and analyzed its perfor- mance. Consequently, we confirmed that the degradation of luminous intensity is caused by moisture invasion from outside EL to resolve the phosphor. Based on the above findings, we have developed a new thick film EL device with new structure and materials which extends its life twice as long as conventional one under a high temperature and high humidity environment. Also, a high performance inverter has been developed which controls its output along with the impedance variation of the EL device over its life in order to safisfy automotive specification. 1 991 SAE Transactions Section 6 910068. An advanced methodology for projecting field repair rates and maintenance costs for vehicle electronic systems. James H. Derr and Robert J. Louch, Ford Motor Co. The continued increase in complexity of automotive electron- ics has further necessitated for systems to be designed for optimal testing and servicing in the field. Locating failures within com- plex, interactive electronic systems can create conditions of both high warranty costs and customer dissatisfaction. Decisions about levels of system integration and diagnostics early in the design phases are fundamental parts of these considerations and are addressed in this paper. The approach focuses on projecting field repair rates and maintenance costs using a Monte Carlo computer simulation method given various component parameters such as part costs, reliability, labor time, and field diagnostic strategies. Results of the projection technique were shown to be quite accurate in proj- ecting field warranty costs of a complex electronic system. Simu- lation studies of several vehicle electronic systems show that large reductions in field maintenance costs can be achieved through proper selection of diagnostic strategy and levels of design inte- gration. 1991 SAE Transactions Section 2 910069. A mathematical model based method for diagnosing failures in automotive electronic systems. William B. Ribbens, EECS Dept., University of Michigan. With the increasing use of complex electronics in automobiles, diagnosis of failures (including calibration shift) of components has become a major issue. This paper presents a method which has the capability of diagnosing failures of any component at any level of failure for automotive electronic systems. The method presented here is based upon mathematical mod- els for the system under diagnosis. These models are run onboard the vehicle in a digital computer and implemented with such highly efficient algorithms that real time diagnosis is possible onboard the vehicle. Although the details of the method are spe- cific for failures in each major class of component (e.g. sensor, actuator, controller), this paper demonstrates that any failure which can be represented in the model can be diagnosed uniquely and distinguished from other failures. 1991 SAE Transactions Section 2 910070. Mean value modeling of a small turbocharged diesel engine. J. P. Jensen, A. F. Kristensen, and Spencer C. Sorenson, Lab. for Energetics, Technical University of Denmark; N. Hou- bak, Lab. for Energetics, Technici University of Denmark; and Elbert Hendricks, Institute of Automatic Control Systems, Techni- cal University of Denmark. A mean value model is presented for the transient operation of a 1.6 liter turbocharged indirect injection diesel engine. The model consists of a series of sub-models for the compressor, tur- bine and engine which result in a number of coupled, nonlinear algebraic and differential equations. The equations are solved using a standard numerical solution package on a personal com- puter. The initial model calibration was performed using manufac- turer supplied data and experimental data from steady state oper- ation. Additional refinements of the model and its associated parameters were obtained through comparison with dynamic measurements on the engine. A comparison between simulated and experimental performance parameters is presented for both steady state and dynamic operation. 910071. The dynamics of valvetrains with hydraulic lash adjusters and the interaction with the gas exchange process. Patrick Phlips, Ford Motor Co.; and Andreas Schamel, Ford Werke AG. Models are presented for: 1) the dynamics of valvetrains with hydraulic lash adjusters. The effects of the adjuster can be split, the elasticity being included in the dynamics model, and the leak- down solved explicitly. This eliminates the numerical difficulties encountered with straightforward formulations; 2) the gas force on exhaust valves. The exhaust flow and the valve dynamics are solved simultaneously to obtain the full effect of cam modifica- tions. Advantage is taken of the positive displacement flow in four-stroke engines to avoid numerical difficulties associated with throttling flow; and 3) the efficient generation of accurate lift curves for gas exchange predictions. In this paper we describe developments of a model for the dynamics of valvetrains presented at this Congress two years ago. This model was very successful for mechanical valvetrains under the action of spring and inertia forces. Numerical difficulties were, however, encountered when simulating valvetrains with hydraulic lash adjusters. Moreover, no model was available to simulate the gas force on exhaust valves, a third important source of valve vibrations. This caused us to study the properties of val- vetrains with hydrualic lash adjusters, and to examine the effect of the exhaust flow on valve dynamics. Finally, we show that the small deviations of the valve lift from the kinematic lift have a substantial effect on the gas exhange, both at idle and full load. We therefore outline a simple model, based on what we learned 10</page><page sequence="10">910071-910076 for the detailed dynamics model, for generating accurate valve lift curves. 910072. Fluid dynamic and acoustic modeling of concentric- tube resonators/silencers. Thomas Morel , Ricardo North Amer- ica; Josette Morel, Roosevelt Univ.; andDwightA. Blaser, General Motors Research Labs. Two models used for the prediction of noise attenuation in silencers have been evaluated. One is a full nonlinear one- dimensional fluid-dynamic model, representing the entire engine (from the air cleaner to the tail pipe). The other is a linear acoustic model, representing a silencer and the exhaust and tail pipes. The evaluation was made by comparing the models' predictions to transmission loss measurements obtained with a set of concen- tric-tube resonators under speaker excitation at room tempera- ture. This represents a test of the models in the linear range (small pressure pulsation amplitudes). The comparisons showed that both of the models performed well under these conditions. For the nonlinear model this comparison represents validation for only one special case, since the main application of the model is to prediction of engine performance, insertion loss in silencer, absolute level of noise radiated from tailpipe and engine back- pressure. 1991 SAE Transactions Section 3 910073. Dynamic modeling of the Stiller-Smith mechanism in an application of a four-cylinder plunger pump system. Wenguang G. Wang, Victor H. Mucino, and James E. Smith, West Virginia Univ.; Donald W. Lyons, Dept. of Mech. and Aero- space Engrg., West Virginia Univ.; and Mary Corley, West Vir- ginia Univ. The development of a mathematical model of Stiller-Smith mechanism for the application of a four-cylinder plunger pump system is presented. The magnitude and direction of the internal dynamic load are obtained by solving a set of equations using the overall geometric parameters, prescribed motions, inertia distri- bution, and applied torques on the system. The simulation pres- ented here yields the history of the internal loads, which are then normalized with respect to the required peak output load on the plungers, through an entire rotary cycle. The approach allows for the development of further design criteria through parametric sensitivity studies. 910074. Intake and ECM submodel improvements for dynamic SI engine models: Examination of tip-in/tip-out. Ronald Douglas Matthews, Shekhar Dongre, and Joseph J. Beam an, Uni- versity of Texas at Austin. Improved submodels for use in a dynamic engine/vehicle model have been developed and the resulting code has been used to analyze the tip-in, tip-out behavior of a computer-controlled port fuel injected SI engine. This code consists of four submodels. The intake simulation submodel is similar to prior intake mod- els, but some refinements have been made to the fuel flow model to more properly simulate a timed port injection system, and it is believed that these refinements may be of general interest. A general purpose engine simulation code has been used as a sub- routine for the cycle simulation submodel. A conventional vehi- cle simulation submodel is also included in the model formula- tion. Perhaps most importantly, a submodel has been developed that explicitly simulates the response of the on-board computer (ECM) control system. Within this ECM submodel, calculations are performed to determine the requested equivalence ratio, the delivered equivalence ratio, the duration of combustion, and the spark advance. Analytical techniques for predicting the combus- tion efficiency and CO emissions are also presented. The pre- dicted trends for the combustion efficiency, CO emissions, spark advance, and duration of combustion are physically reasonable and thus these modeling techniques may be of general interest. It is concluded that three characteristic delays are responsible for unwanted air/fuel ratio excursions during tip-in and tip-out. These are the time delay of the computer control system, a physi- cal delay in air delivery due to storage of mass in the intake mani- fold, and a physical delay of the fuel flow which results from the finite rate of evaporation of the fuel film on the intake manifold walls (which is important during the first few cycles of tip-in and tip-out due to the large change of mass of fuel injected). The phys- ical delay in the air flow is more significant during tip-in, the physical delay of the fuel evaporation process is more significant during tip-out, and the ECM delay is equally important during both tip-in and tip-out. 910075. Quasi-dimensional computer simulation of the turbo- charged spark ignition engine and its use for 2 and 4-valve engine matching studies. Zoran Filipi, Dept. of Mech. Engrg., University of Belgrade ; and Dennis N. Ass anis, Dept. of Mech. and Industrial Engrg., University of Illinois at Urbana-Champa. A quasi-dimensional computer simulation of the turbochar- ged spark-ignition engine has been developed in order to study system performance as various design parameters and operating conditions are varied. The simulation is of the "filling and emp- tying" type. Quasi-steady flow models of the compressor, inter- cooler, manifolds, turbine, wastegate, and ducting are coupled with a multi-cylinder engine model where each cylinder under- goes the same thermodynamic cycle. A turbulent entrainment model of the combustion process is used, thus allowing for studies of the effects of various combustion chamber shapes and turbulence parameters on cylinder pressure, temperature, NOx emissions and overall engine performance. Valve open areas are determined either based on user supplied valve lift data or using polydyne-generated cam profiles which allow for variable valve timing studies. A detailed friction model is used which predicts rubbing losses from the crankshaft, reciprocating and valvetrain components and auxiliary losses from engine accessories. The simulation has been calibrated and validated against experimen- tal data from a 1.1 liter engine. It has been shown that the model is capable of predicting combustion process parameters as well as total system performance over the entire operating range. Fur- ther, to demonstrate the utility of the simulation, a series of matching calculations has been carried out for a new 1.4 liter engine. The benefits of using a 4-valve, fast burn combustion chamber design on high-speed performance have been demon- strated. Operation of the 4-valve engine with only one of the intake valves active has also been investigated as a strategy for increasing low speed torque. 1991 SAE Transactions Section 3 910076. Multizone modeling of a fumigated diesel engine. Pradheepram Ottikkutti, ColTec, Inc.; and Jon Van Gerpen, Iowa State Univ. A phenomenological, multizone, transient spray model has been developed to simulate the performance and nitric oxide emission characteristics of a turbocharged diesel engine fumi- gated with alcohol. The effects of speed, load, alcohol proof, and the fraction of the engine's power supplied by the alcohol have been investigated. The multizone model is designed to account for the heterogeneous composition of the cylinder contents by dividing the cylinder into a number of locally homogeneous zones. The model includes the interactions between the fuel spray and swirling air in the cylinder and the effect of wall impingement on fuel-air mixing and combustion. A complete thermodynamic analysis has been applied to the individual zones to obtain cylin- der pressure data. The indicated mean effective pressure and indicated thermal efficiency derived from the pressure data, esti- mated exhaust temperature, and the exhaust nitric oxide level are compared with data obtained from a four-cylinder turbocharged diesel engine over a wide range of operating conditions. 11</page><page sequence="11">910076-910081 The values of indicated mean effective pressure, indicated thermal efficiency, and exhaust temperature predicted by the model matched closely with experimental data. The exhaust nitric oxide emission predicted by the model matched reasonably well for diesel-only operation. With alcohol fumigation, the model over predicts the reduction in nitric oxide. This is attri- buted to the inability of the single-zone wall impingement model to accurately simulate the temperature and composition of the regions within the wall zone where nitrix oxide is formed. 1991 SAE Transactions Section 3 910077. A p remixed turbulent burning velocity model based on dimensional reasoning. Changyou Chen and Ali Veshagh , Univer- sity of Warwick. Based on dimensional reasoning of classical turbulence the- ory, a phenomenological turbulent flame velocity model is pro- posed. The model explains the whole process of flame develop- ment from the inception, through the growth stages to saturation in a simple and unified form. Two sets of mathematical formulae are presented. In formulating the model, the ratios of turbulent to laminar flame velocity are given as functions of the reynolds numbers based on the integral scale and taylor microscale, respec- tively. Comparison of fully developed turbulent flame velocity with experimental results shows good agreement. This model can be easily incorporated in phenomenological models of spark- ignition engines for simulation studies. 1 991 SAE Transactions Section 3 910078. Theoretical analysis of mixture stoichiometry in engine carburetor./. Szczeciński and T. J. Rychter ; Warsaw Uni- versity of Technology. A theoretical analysis of the stoichiometry of the mixture pro- duced in a main fuel system of the engine carburetor is presented. The analysis made it possible to develop a computer code which was applied to the particular Weber type carburetor from a small, two-cylinder car engine. The operation of the carburetor in the regimes of the steady and unsteady flow, including the influence of back flows, was investigated. It is concluded that the air pres- sure pulsations and, in particular, the existence of the back flows cause the significant enrichment of the mixture produced in the carburetor. 910079. A fractal-based SI model: Comparisons of predictions with experimental data. Ronald Douglas Matthews and Young- Wook Chin, University of Texas at Austin. A quasidimensional engine simulation which uses the con- cepts of fractal geometry to model the effects of turbulence on flame propagation in a homogeneous charge SI engine has been developed. Heat transfer and blowby/crevice flow submodels are included in this code and the submodels chosen are found to be reasonable. The model predictions of cylinder pressure histories are then compared with experimental data over a range of loads, equivalence ratios, and engine speeds. The model is not adjusted in any manner to yeild better agreement with the data, other than by tuning the simple turbulence model used so as to yield agree- ment with data for the nonreacting flow. However, current infor- mation about the flame wrinkling scales in an engine is inade- quate. Therefore, predictions are made for three different assumptions about the flame wrinkling scales which span the range of physically possible scales. It is found that the fractal burning model yields predictions of the rate of early pressure rise that agree extremely well with the data for all operating condi- tions investigated independent of the assumption made about the flame wrinkling scales, and that over the complete range of loads and equivalence ratios examined the assumption that the ratio of the flame wrinkling scales is approximately equal to the ratio of the integral length scale to the Kolmogorov scale yields very accu- rate predictions of the peak cylinder pressure, the position of peak pressure, and the cylinder pressure history. It is not claimed that the excellent predictions resulting from this assumption have a physical basis, but this result is interesting and perhaps useful. The model predictions are consistent for all loads and equiva- lence ratios, but the character of the trends is different for the sin- gle data set available at a different speed. More experimental data are needed for comparison with the model predictions. Most importantly, it is shown that use of fractal geometry to model tur- bulenet combustion in SI engines is a promising new engineering tool. However, many unresolved issues regarding the fractal char- acteristics of flames in engines remain unanswered and merit experimental investigation. 1991 SAE Transactions Section 3 910080. Study on variable injection pattern control system in a spark ignition engine. Yoshishige Ohyama, Toshiharu Nogi, and Mamoru Fujieda, Hitachi, Ltd. Mixture formation technology for multipoint fuel injection systems in spark ignition engines has been reviewed regarding reduced exhaust emissions, fuel consumption and improved engine performance. In conventional systems, under light load conditions, the mixture of fuel to suction air is not uniform due to a short injection pulse width against a long duration of suction stroke. Under heavy load conditions, fuel spray is apt to be deflected by the air flow through the intake port and the injected fuel clings and remains onesidely on the cylinder wall during the combustion cycle. Under cold start conditions, the fuel on the intake manifolds and ports is not evaporated quickly enough so that it is evaporated in the cylinder after the temperature rises due to the compression stroke. A lot of fuel is injected to compensate for the small evaporation rate. To overcome these problems, a new fuel injection system with variable injection pattern control in accordance with engine oper- ating conditions was investigated. The control could optimize mixture formation and reduce HC emissions under a wide range of engine operating conditions. Also, engine speed fluctuations under light load conditions could be minimized, engine response under heavy load conditions could be improved, and fuel econ- omy could be improved due to zero unburned fuel. The functions of the systems are as follows. Under light load conditions, the fuel mixing time to blast air flow is lengthened to get a uniform mixture as the fuel is injected into swirlers and then it is gradually atomized by the assist air. The spray pattern is wid- ened using swirlers to reduce both spray penetration and impingement on the intake ports and valves. Under heavy load conditions, the fuel is directly injected toward the intake valves and not deflected by the air flow through the intake ports as the blast air flow is minimized. The fuel is mixed uniformly by the air through the intake valves. Under cold start conditions, the duration of blasting fuel against suction air duration is length- ened by using the swirlers and good atomization of fuel is attained with a suitable configuration of the nozzles under condi- tions where the blast air velocity is not enough to atomize fuel in conventional systems. 910081. The development of an automotive drive-by-wire throttle system as a research tool. A. L. Emtage, P. A. Lawson, M. A. Passmore, G. Gordon Lucas, and P. L. Adcock, Loughbor- ough University of Technology. This paper describes the development of a drive-by-wire throt- tle system as an automotive research tool. The microprocessor based controller samples engine speed and driver demand (via accelerator pedal position) and utilises look-up-tables to deter- mine the throttle position as a function of both of these input parameters. The inclusion of engine speed as an input to the func- tion facilitates infinite freedom in the design of the 'demand map' within the constraints of the engine's performance limits. The system scheme is described, including a novel safety circuit which disables the engine in the event of a system failure. The principle of calibration is described along with a quick technique of vali- dating a new demand map design on a sophisticated DC chassis 12</page><page sequence="12">910081-910090 dynamometer. The importance of the 'demand map', especially in relation to driveability, is discussed along with the prospects for exploiting this technology in vehicle development and on pro- duction vehicles. The issue of safety is tackled and it is concluded that a drive-by-wire system could be made as safe as a conven- tional mechanical linkage. The work of this paper was commis- sioned by the Ford Motor Company. 910082. An engine and transmission control system with new 16-bit single chip microcomputer. Shigeru Kuroyanagi, Toyota Motor Corp.; Takayuki Ono, Nippondenso Co., Ltd.; Tetsuro Wada, Toshiba Corp.; and Brad Cohen, Motorola Inc. The microcomputer is the most powerful component avail- able at this time for application to highly functional and high- precision electronic control systems in automobiles. Toyota Motor Corporation recently improved an 8-bit micro- computer and this has now been followed by the development of a new 16-bit microcomputer to permit major expansion of the functions available in such systems. This is a single-chip VLSI which is flexible and sophisticated, quite suitable for real-time control systems in automobiles. It provides large memory, both ROM and RAM, a powerful instruction set appropriate for use in real-time control, high-speed and intelligent input/output (I/O) functions, and higher speed of data communication func- tions for intercommunication between microcomputers. This microcomputer has realized the development of a high- speed and high-precision combined control system centered upon engine and transmission control. 910083. Requirements and performance of engine manage- ment systems under transient conditions. N. F. Benninger and G. Plapp, Robert Bosch GmbH. Becasue of the big influence on driveability and exhaust emis- sions one of the most important challenges of modern fuel injec- tion systems is to ensure a very good constancy of the air/fuel ratio. A precise feedforward control especially for dynamic transi- tions is necessary because a feedback control of the air/fuel ratio based on an oxygen sensor in the exhaust gas is not able to avoid dynamic deviations. Therefore, in this paper a new fuel injection technique is presented which is founded on a simultaneous con- trol of air and fuel in connection with algorithms based on mathe- matical models of the different physical effects. 1991 SAE Transactions Section 3 910084. Development of nest-structured learning control sys- tem. Shimpei Nakaniwa, Junichi Furuya, and Naoki Tomisawa , Design Dept., Japan Electronic Control Systems Co., Ltd. With the recent movement to attack global environmental problems, regulations on everything from vehicle emissions to mileage are becoming stricter year by year to reduce noxious emissions. In order to meet these regulations, it is necessary to achieve higher reliability in those automotive parts which may affect emissions. Since there is a limit to how much the reliability of parts can be increased against aging and deterioration, software such as learning control utilizing air-fuel ratio lambda control, has been used. However, it has proven difficult to compensate for accu- racy, by subdividing areas to memorize the results of learning, and have a higher learning speed. This paper describes the nest-structuring of learning areas which, unlike conventional air-fuel ratio learning, realize both faster learning and improvements in the compensating accuracy by subdividing the learning area. These achievements reduce the noxious emissions from automobiles and establish a system for compensating for deterioration with long-term durability. 910085. New approaches to electronic throttle control. Werner Huber, Bernd Lieberoth-Leden, Wolfgang Maisch, and Andreas Repp ich, Robert Bosch GmbH. An electronic control of throttle angle is required for safety systems like traction control (ASR) and for advanced engine management systems with regard to further improvements of driving comfort and fuel economy. For applications, in which only ASR is required, two versions of a new traction control actu- ator (TCA) have been developed. Their function is based on con- trolling the effective length of the bowden cable between the accelerator pedal and the throttle. Besides retaining the machani- cal linkage to the throttle, the concept has no need for a pedal position sensor, which is necessary for a drive-by-wire system. Design and performance of both actuators are described and their individual advantages are compared. Moreover, the communica- tion of the system with ASR and its behaviour with regard to vehicle dynamics are illustrated. In contrast to the TCA concept, drive-by-wire throttle control is able to perform many other functions, as for instance idle speed control, cruise control, negative and positive dashpot or throttle- to-pedal angle-mapping. After a brief survey over systems, which are already in production, a new actuator concept with several novel features is presented. Furthermore, the state-of-the-art of engine and vehicle related functions is described and the poten- tial for further improvements is discussed. 910086. Controller for exprimental vehicle using multi- processor system. Hideaki Ito, Hideo Arakawa, Kazumasa Sumi, and Hiroyuki Yamaguchi, Toyota Central Research and Develop- ment Labs., Inc. Recently, active control technology of vehicles has extensively been developed. An experimental vehicle with independent hydropneumatic suspensions was constructed in our laboratory for the improvements in vehicle dynamics and ride-comfort. The vehicle includes a controller, mainly consisting of a multi- processor system with 5 CPUs. By combining this new system with a common bus, all CPUs can immediately access peripherals impartially without particular software. The CPUs can also acquire the data of sensors from the memory in the A/D module at any time without special software. The CPUs are shared to synthetically control the attitude and vibration of each vehicle wheel. Therefore, high capacity is exhib- ited by a simple system at low cost. The performance of the controller was examined by actual running tests using the experimental vehicle, confirming the improvements in vehicle dynamics and ride-comfort, such as reudction in roll angle and vibration. 910089. The evolution of the electrostatic application of water- borne paint. Michael J. Diana, Binks Manufacturing Co. Due to recent breakthroughs, spraying waterborne paint elec- trostatically in an automotive environment is now not only possi- ble, but desirable. In pursuit of that goal many techniques were tried and discarded over the past two decades; current state-of- the-art waterborne application consists of old approaches enhanced by the new methods that today's technology makes pos- sible. 910090. One component polyurethane coatings and sealants - Innovative automotive applications. Richard R. Roesler and Ran- dall S. Dearth, Mo bay Corp. The uses of blocked polyisocyanates in automotive coatings and sealants has progressed rapidly in the recent past in both the European and American markets. The use of blocked polyisocya- nates with polyols provide the performance advantages of a two component system with the simplicity of a one component sys- tem. In addition, one component systems based on blocked poly- isocyanates have an extended pot life. This paper summarizes the chemistry and applications of blocked polyisocyanate technol- ogy. A review of polyisocyanate types and blocking agents and description of the automotive applications for sealants, primers and top coats is made. 13</page><page sequence="13">910091-910102 910091. Spray application of low-VOC coatings using super- critical fluids. Kenneth A. Nielsen , David C. Busby, Charles C. Glancy, Alex C. Kuo, Chinsoo Lee, Kenneth M. Perry, and Ken- neth L. Hoy, Union Carbide Chemicals and Plastics Co. Inc. New spray application technology has been developed that uses supercritical carbon dioxide to replace the volatile solvents in conventional low-solids and high-solids coatings so that vola- tile organic compound (VOC) emissions can be reduced by 50 to 80% with existing polymer systems. The spray is formed by a new atomization mechanism that gives air spray quality from an air- less system. Thermosetting, thermoplastic, air-dry, and two- package polymer systems have been demonstrated in clear, pig- mented, and metallic form for applications such as automotive components, clear coats, base coats, chip-resistant coats, and automobile refinish. 1991 SAE Transactions Section 5 910092. Painting TPO. Ken Krueger Davis and Peter D. Clark, BASF Corp. Thermoplastic polyolefin (TPO) is used extensively in the automotive industry. Various methods have been used to improve paint adhesion properties. New adhesion promoter technologies offer significant improvements in solvent emissions and final product appearance. These adhesion promoters are designed to allow the use of various topcoat technologies. Water- borne basecoats offer the ultimate appearance with the lowest VOC. 1991 SAE Transactions Section 5 910094. Waterborne basecoat applications. C. Brian Fox, ICI Autocolor. The combined forces of environmental protection, consumer- ism, energy conservation and productivity are completely alter- ing the nature of coatings used by the automotive industry. Waterborne basecoats allow application at low volume solids, thus producing optimum metallic effect while maintaining com- pliance with emission regulations. In order to control rheology and thereby sag resistance and metal flake orientation, a novel aqueous microgel polymer has been developed. Processing of these basecoats is similar to present solvent-borne finishes with the exception that stainless steel equipment must be used and water must be removed before application of clearcoat. The production feasibility of waterborne basecoats was first established in a Canadian truck assembly plant and in the next two years several other production facilities are expected to con- vert to this new technology. 910095. Alternative coating methods - Application of automo- tive "paint films". Thomas C. Balch, BASF Corp.; and Ronald W. Seemann, 3M. The paint film concept is a method of covering plastic and metal parts with a preformed, multilayer film that performs the functions of traditional coatings, that is, to protect and decorate the part. It offers significant advantages over spray applied coat- ings. These include reduced solvent emissions, fewer manufac- turing steps, and potential lower overall coating cost. Development of this concept includes identifying the critical application requirements and merging them with the film proper- ties. Inherent limitations to this approach arise from strain pro- duced in the film during application. Application methods by hand, vacuum forming, in-mold, and laminating followed by post forming are discussed in terms of these requirements and compared to the spray operations they would replace. 1991 SAE Transactions Section 5 910097. New polypropylene composite for automotive instu- ment panels. Shi gej i Ichikawa, Kanto Seiki Co., Ltd.; and Hideo Arai, Kantus Engrg. Corp. Reinforcing filler materials used with polypropylene for auto- motive instrument panel applications are changing from talc to glass. Recently, an improved polypropylene composite material has been developed that successfully overcomes concerns associ- ated with warpage. A brief development history of this new material is reviewed. In addition, a summary of design considerations to be addressed when using this material for automotive instrument panel appli- cations is provided. 1991 SAE Transactions Section 5 910098. Correlation of dimensional configuration to manufac- turing performance. Frederick D. Kneisley, Davidson Instrument Panel - Textron . Undesirable levels of scrap and rework have been a chronic problem in the manufacting environment. This study was con- ducted to determine the relationship of part dimension, and its process variability to manufacturing performance. Because man- ufacturing variability is usually evaluated in detection and attri- bute terms, a quantifiable and early prediction performance mea- sure was desired. This study utilized a variety of statistical meth- ods to establish a dimensional link to manufacturing perfor- mance so that a quantifiable indicator (dimension) could be evaluated and controlled for better manufacturing performance and yield. Additionally, the relationships understood from this study will provide significant design input for future product manufacturability of automotive instrument panels. 910099. Design guidelines for heat resistant expanded bead foam in interior components. Roxanne L. Chatman, Automotive Sales and Marketing, ARCO ChemicalCo. An understanding of the nature of heat resistant expanded bead foam is necessary for designing instrument panel compo- nents using this material. This paper will focus on properties and design parameters of foam molded from high heat expanded sty- rene maleic anhydride copolymer. 910100. Polyphenyl processing aids for glass reinforced poly- mers and alloys. Jean Pierre, Monsanto European Technical Cen- ter -Louvain La Neuve ; and Willy Piret, Owens Corning Fiber- glas. Monsanto and Owens Corning Fiberglas Europe have evalu- ated a new class of polyphenyl based polymer processing aids for glass reinforced thermoplastics and alloys. Liquid partly hydroge- nated polyphenyls and solid polyphenyl waxes have been evalu- ated in glass reinforced formulations based on acrylonitrile- butadiene-styrene copolymers, rubber modified styrene-maleic anhydride copolymers, polypropylene, polycarbonate/abs and polypheny lene oxide/high impact polystyrene alloys. In all cases, the addition of polyphenyls improves the melt flow of injection moulding formulations without affecting the mechanical charac- teristics of the products. Generally, an improvement in flexural and tensile properties is observed when polyphenyls are added. In rubber modified sty- rene-maleic anhydride copolymers, the addition of polyphenyls results in a definite increase in notched izod impact. In general, the heat distortion temperature of the products is not very affected and we observe an improvement in surface appearance of the molded parts. Finally, due to the chemical inertness typical of polyphenyls, the products modified with these processing aids have demon- strated a better hydrolytic stability than products containing ester or amide based processing aids or lubricants. 910102.

Norris, Dow Corning Corp. 14</page><page sequence="14">910102-910109 Fluorosilicone elastomers are a material of choice for fuel sys- tems designed for use with alternative fuels, such as methanol- gasoline blends. Fuel-immersion results show that not all fluoro- silicones behave alike when immersed in methanol-gasoline blends. Information on the specific fluorosilicone being evalu- ated must be obtained by the fuel-system engineer to make a cor- rect selection. 1991 SAE Transactions Section 5 910103. High temperature resistance of fluoropolymers in automotive fuels. Mary S. Carpenter ; E. I. du Pont de Nemours &amp; Co. Inc.; and Sandra E. Chillous and Rod R. Will , E. I. du Pont de Nemours and Co. Materials used in automotive fuel line constructions must offer dependable and predictable performance when exposed to a variety of fuel compositions at high temperatures. This paper presents data from a comprehensive study which demonstrates the high temperature chemical resistance of fluoropolymer resins after exposure to several fuel compositions at various tempera- tures. Fuel exposure tests were performed at temperatures rang- ing from room temperature to 120°C (250°F). The test included six different plastics, exposed to four fuel compositions. The exposed samples were tested for weight change, volume change, and retained physical properties. Tensile property testing was conducted at temperatures ranging from room temperature to 204°C (400°F). This data demonstrates that the superior high temperature properties and outstanding chemical resistance of fluoropolymer resins make them well suited for use in fuel han- dling systems. 910104. Fluoropolymer resins: Permeation of automotive fuels. D. Roy Goldsberry , E. I. du Pont de Nemours and Co., Du Pont Polymers; and Sandra E. Chillous and Rod R. Will, E. I. du Pont de Nemours and Co. This paper presents the permeation rates for fuel hose and tub- ing made from nylon and fluoroplastics when exposed, primarily, to M20 fuel. Room temperature permeation rates were obtained using several types of commercially supplied hose and tubing. The permeation rate for fluoroplastics was found to be about 10 times lower than that for nylon. 910105. Designing for chemical and thermal resistance with polyphenylene sulfide (PPS) compounds. Dave W. Madden, Phil- lips 66 Co. Automotive designers and engineers are requiring greater per- formance from all components that go into today's automobile. Materials must be able to meet those higher performance require- ments, but not increase cost in a price sensitive market. Resistance to automotive fluids, and particularly the new gen- eration of alcohol-based fuels, is essential to today's engineering materials. PPS materials have displayed excellent resistance to a wide variety of chemicals, including automotive fluids. This paper will discuss the resistance of PPS, including the new toughened PPS compounds, to this wide range of automo- tive fluids, including alcohol-based fuels such as M30 and M85. It will also discuss guidelines for engineering applications based on the fluid resistance data and thermal property data. All of this information shows that the challenges and problems posed by applications with long-term elevated temperature exposure to automotive fluids can be met and overcome by the use of PPS compounds. PPS compounds have excellent chemical resistance to nearly all automotive fluids and have excellent mechanical properties at elevated temperatures. 910106. Effects of methanol blend fuels on fuel hose perme- ation. James R. Balzer, 3M; and Alan L. Edmonson, Ford Motor Co. Since about 1977, fluorocarbon elastomer copolymers (66%F) have been widely used for automotive fuel-hose applications. However, with the growing use of oxygenated gasolines (blends containing methanol, MTBE, ETBE, and ethanol) oxygenate resistant fuel-hose constructions must be considered to meet increasingly demanding emissions regulations. In addition, there is a widespread revival of "flex-fuel" vehicle development activ- ity which dictates methanol compatibility for fuel system compo- nent materials. This study compares the fuel permeation rates of several fluoroelastomer veneer fuel-hoses in gasoline/methanol blends, simulating "flex-fuel" exposure. 910107. The aging behavior of oil resistant elastomers in hypoid gear lubricants containing conventional and thermally sta- ble additives. Michael A. Fath, Polysar Gulf Coast Inc.; and Mohamed G. Fahmy and Philip R. Scinto, Lubrizol Corp. Gearbox oil leakage is one of the largest warranty items for commercial vehicle manufacturers. The ASTM Oil Seal Task Force has identified two common seal failure mechanisms: 1) seal lip hardening caused by a chemical interaction between the elas- tomer and lubricant; and 2) seal lip deposits caused by high tem- perature lubricant/additive breakdown. Significant improvement in seal performance can be expected by reducing the formation of these deposits through the use of thermally stable gear additives. This paper focuses on the aspect of seal lip hardening and loss of elasticity caused by interactions of the elastomer with the lubri- cant additives. Elastomers include: polyacrylate, ethylene/ acrylic, fluoroelastomer, nitrile rubber and hydrogenated nitrile rubber. Statistical screening techniques were used to isolate the effect of aging time, temperature, and lubricant type on each elas- tomer. Laboratory data suggest that the fully saturated, peroxide cured hydrogenated nitrile rubber exhibits the best elasticity retention characteristics for a seal in contact with both thermally and non-thermally stable hypoid gear lubricants. 910108. Flocking of elastomeric alloy thermoplastic rubber profiles. Anton Van Meesche, Robert D. Banning, SatishJ. Doshi, and Charles P. Rader, Advanced Elastomer Systems, L.P. Flocking embraces the coating of an extruded rubber profile with short (0.3 -3 mm) monofilament textile fibers, to enable seal- ing against automotive surfaces (e.g., glass, metal, finish) moving against and over the rubber surface. Flocking of thermoset rubbers- EPDM, SBR, CR - is well established with automo- tive profiles. New technology has been developed for flocking extruded profiles of elastomeric alloy thermoplastic elastomers (EA-TPEs), to give belt line seals, automotive glass run channels and other sealing profiles. These flocked EA-TPE profiles have a number of practical advantages over ones from thermoset EPDM rubber, including: 1) the efficiency and economy of ther- moplastic over thermoset rubber processing; 2) closer dimen- sional tolerances, to enable the fabrication of more intricate pro- files; and 3) superior long-term aging in air. 1991 SAE Transactions Section S 910109. Microcellular polyurethane elastomers as damping elements in automotive suspension systems. E. Christoph Prol - ingheuer and P. Henrichs, Bayer AG. Microcellular cast polyurethane (MC-PUR) elastomers and rubber are widely used as damping components in automobile suspension systems. MC-PUR materials have the following advantages over rub- ber: high volume compressibility; lighter weight; better flexibility; small size; and resistance to dynamic fatigue. The handling of the vehicle can be improved by using MC- PUR helper springs rather than buffers. These spring elements require a MC-PUR elastomer with excellent dynamic perfor- mance. 15</page><page sequence="15">910109-910117 Naphthalene-1.5-diisocyanate (NDI) has proved to be the most suitable raw material for this very demanding application.

Effect of a head-up versus head-down digital speed- ometer on visual sampling behavior and speed control perfor- mance during daytime automobile driving. Raymond J. Kiefer ; Human Factors Dept., General Motors Systems Engrg. Center. General Motors has recently introduced production automo- biles which are capable of presenting information to the driver by way of head-up displays. Although there has been some research reported to compare driver performance with head-up relative to head-down displays in an automotive context, continuing research is warranted. The research reported here provides an on- the-road comparison of automobile drivers' behavior with a head-up versus head-down speedometer during daytime driving. 1991 SAE Transactions Section 6 910112. Info-mobility: A concept for advanced automotive functions toward the 21st century. Sadayuki Tsugawa, Agency of Industry Science and Technology, Ministry of International Trade an; Kozo Kitoh, Volvo Car Corp.; Haruki Fujii, Association of Electronic Technology for Automotive Traffic and Driving (JSK); Kohei Koide, Toyota Motor Corp.; Toshiro Harada, NEC Corp.; Kunio Miura, Nippondenso Co.; Seiji Yasunobu, Hitachi Ltd.; and Yasuyuki Wakabayashi, FUJIFACOM Corp. This paper proposes a new concept of the info-mobility in which the information plays a key role in the future automobile with advanced functions. The basic "driver-vehicle-road envi- ronment" system could be reorganized by using three informa- tion systems, i.e. in-vehicle, roadside and wide area ones. Nine info-mobility functions, including those of judging abnormal conditions of driver and vehicle, supporting driver's manipula- tion, detecting obstacles and external disturbances, recognizing environment, route guidance, etc., are described. TVenty-seven specified functions selected for respective functions and related technological subjects are also discussed. 910113. The driving simulator with large amplitude motion system. Takamasa Suetomi, Akinori Horiguchi, Yoshihisa Oka - moto, and Shuji Hata, Mazda Motor Corp. An advanced driving simulator has been developed at Mazda Yokohama Research Center. The primary use of this simulator is to research future driver-vehicle systems. In an emergency situ- ation, a driver must respond rapidly to perceived motion and visual stimulus to avoid an accident. In such cases, because the time delay associated with the perception of motion cues is shorter than visual and auditory cues, the driver will strongly rely upon perceived motion to control the vehicle. Hence, a driving simulator to be used in the research of driver-vehicle interactions in emergency driving must include a high performance motion system capable of large amplitude lateral motion. The Mazda simulator produces motion cues in four degrees of freedom, pro- vides visual and auditory cues, and generates control feel on the steering wheel. This paper describes the merit of the large amplitude motion system and the features of this newly developed driving simula- tor. 1991 SAE Transactions Section 6 910114. The concept of future man-machine system and the evaluation method of vigilance. Atsuhide Kishi and Shuji Hata, Mazda Motor Corp. We have proposed a human mimetic machine, using electron- ics control technology, which is quasi-human like an android equipped with volition as a new technical concept for man- machine systems. The machine determines the driver's physio- logical and pyschological conditions and, in response, controls surrounding stimuli, such as sounds and vibrations. In this way, the relationship between the driver and the vehicle is made more human like. To determine the significance of the human mimetic machine, we have been developing a biofeedback vigilance control system, which maintains an optimum vigilance level during driving by controlling stimuli. In the first stage of the study, we have devel- oped an accurate method to determine vigilance level using mul- tiple regression analysis of electroencephalograms. 1991 SAE Transactions Section 6 910115. Overview of a study on direction-of-motion stereotype strengths for automobile controls. Walter W. Wierwille and John McF ariane, Vehicle Analysis and Simulation Lab., Virginia Poly- technic Institute and Stat. Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University recently conducted an SAE sponsored research study investigating direc- tional stereotypes of six types of automobile controls: power mir- rors, power windows, manual windows, stalks, generic controls, and power door locks. The objective was to determine stereotype strength and the reasons for the strengths. Two hundred subjects participated in this study. This paper provides an overview of the results of the study and recommendations made therefrom. 1991 SAE Transactions Section 6 910116. Physiological and psychological evaluations of driver fatigue during long term driving. Thomas B. Sheridan and John E. Meyer, Dept. of Mech. Engrg., Massachusetts Institute of Tech- nology; Serge H. Roy and Kirk S. Decker, NeuroMuscular Research Center, Boston Univ.; and Takayuki Yanagishima and Yoichi Kishi, Vehicle Research Lab., Central Research Labs., Nis- san Motor Co., Ltd. In designing an automobile seat, it is important to minimize the fatigue experienced by the driver resulting from long-term sit- ting. We have utilized the following measurement techniques to quantify driver fatigue during actual road-test conditions: 1) sub- jective evaluations of fatigue based on multi-dimensional scaling; 2) measurement of body movement by an electromagnetic field transducer; and 3) electromyographic recordings (EMG) of mus- cle activity. These methods were used during four hour driving tests involving five subjects in each of four seats which differed in design. For each subject, a weighted fatigue index based upon responses to a questionnaire was calculated. Body movement was analyzed by using a position transducer attached near the iliac crest. The EMG median frequency and amplitude were analyzed for eight muscles of the back. By recording these measurements simultaneously, we have provided a means of comparing subjec- tive indices of driving fatigue with objective physiological param- eters. 910117. An investigation of driver discomfort and related seat design factors in extended-duration driving. Matthew P. Reed, University of Michigan Transportation Research Institute ; Masat- sugu Saito and Yasuo Kakishima, Ikeda Engrg. Corp.; Nahm S. Lee, Korea Standards Research Institute ; and Lawrence W. Schneider, University of Michigan Transportation Research Insti- tute. A study of automotive seating comfort and related design fac- tors was conducted, utilizing subjective techniques of seat com- fort assessment and objective measures of the seat/subject inter- action. Eight male subjects evaluated four different test seats dur- ing a short-term seating session and throughout a three-hour driving simulation. For the latter, subjects operated a static labo- ratory driving simulator, performing body-area discomfort eval- uations at thirty-minute intervals. Cross-modality matching (CMM), a subjective assessment technique in which a stimulus is rated by matching to the level of another stimulus, was used during the long-term driving simulation to evaluate discomfort. Subject posture, muscle activity in the lower back and abdomen, and pressure levels at key support locations on the seat were mon- 16</page><page sequence="16">910117-910123 itored. In addition, a sonic digitizing system was used to record seat indentation contours and to characterize the subjects' spinal contours. 1991 SAE Transactions Section 6 910118. (SP-853) Determination of vehicle crush from two photographs and the use of 3D displacement vectors in accident reconstruction. Ronald L. Woolley, Karen A. White, Alan F. Asay, and Jon E. Bready, Collision Safety Engrg. Given two or more photos of an accident vehicle (non-stereo pairs such as police photos) an estimate of the deformation (crush) of the vehicle may be obtained by application of camera reverse-projection, using two or more cameras and an exemplar vehicle. A single camera technique familiar to accident scene investigators is modified for this application. The methodology is described within the context of an experiment comparing results obtained by camera reverse projection to actual measured crush. A method of displaying crush results known as "displacement vectors" is presented and examples are illustrated. The technique has been found useful for measurement of 3-dimensional crush. 1991 SAE Transactions Section 6 910119. (SP-853) Stiffness parameters for vehicle collision analysis. Gustav A. Nystrom, Garrison Kost, and Stephen M. Wer- ner, Failure Analysis Associates, Inc. Two widely used computer programs developed for the analy- sis of vehicle collisions are CRASH and SMAC. This paper reviews stiffness parameters which are used in the application of these programs, and methods to select these parameters. The paper also introduces a rational method to select stiffness param- eter KV for the SMAC program. The CRASH program expresses the vehicle force-crush rela- tionship as FC = A+B*CR, where FC is the force per unit width, and CR is the vehicle residual crush. The "stiffness parameters," A and B, define a linear relation with a zero-crush intercept. For collinear impacts, these parameters are used in determining crush energy, which in turn is used in determining changes in velocities of the impacting vehicles. Over the years, considerable effort has been expended by numerous researchers to determine A and B for a variety of vehi- cles, and a substantial body of vehicle crash test data has been developed and analyzed to this end. The SMAC program permits time-history dynamic analyses of vehicle collisions. It expresses the vehicle force-deformation rela- tionship by the linear equation, FS = KV*CT, where FS is the force per unit width, KV is the stiffness parameter, and CT is the vehicle total crush. The KV stiffness parameter is usually varied for different vehicles or different classes of vehicles, and, as shown in this paper, should also be varied as a function of vehicle crush. The method suggested in this paper for the selection of KV is based on 1) the premise that the analyst accepts the vehicle force- crush relationship FC = A + B*CR, and 2) the idea that KV should be chosen such that the crush energies under the force- deformation curves FC and FS are equivalent. This approach allows the SMAC stiffness calculations to benefit from the exten- sive database of A and B parameters that has been collected. In addition, the method provides a rational basis for selection of stiffness KV that is dependent on crush distance. 1991 SAE Transactions Section 6 910120. (SP-853) Rear stiffness coefficients derived from bar- rier test data. Ronald L. Woolley, Charles E. Strother, and Michael B. James, Collision Safety Engrg. Rear impacts in the crash test data base compiled by the NHTSA are analyzed and compared to the CRASH3 rear stiff- ness coefficients. The CRASH3 values do not represent the test data adequately. This is because the values were derived from limited data, and because some of the rear moving barrier test data were miscoded as fixed barrier tests. A review of the larger NHTSA data base does not support the CRASH3 assumption that vehicles of similar size (wheelbase) have similar rear stiffness characteristics. Therefore, it is important when reconstructing individual accidents to use crash test data specific to the vehicles involved. Repeated rear fixed barrier test data on four vehicles are ana- lyzed to study the data trend at speeds below and above the NHTSA test data. Constant stiffness and constant force models are compared and a combination of the two is shown to fit avail- able test data. 1991 SAE Transactions Section 6 910121. (SP-853) Missing vehicle algorithm (OLDMISS) reformulation. Aloke K. Prasad, Transportation Research Center of Ohio, Inc. The OLDMISS computer program is used to estimate the AV's of vehicles in a collision, when the damage to one of the vehicles is unknown. The program estimates the energy dissi- pated in the structure of the missing vehicle based on the knowl- edge of the generic structural characteristics of automobiles, and certain assumptions. OLDMISS has been found to be less accurate for certain impact configurations, especially side impacts. This paper exam- ines the possible sources of errors in the OLDMISS algorithm. This paper also details an alternate algorithm for estimating the energy absorbed by the missing vehicle. This proposed method by passes the need for estimating the damage profile on the missing vehicle. It also takes into account the presence of induced damage (for side impacts). The new algorithm is vali- dated by reconstructing six vehicle-to-vehicle staged impacts, and twelve RICSAC tests. 1991 SAE Transactions Section 6 910122. (SP-853) Light truck inertial properties. A. M. Cur- zon, N. K. Cooperrider, and D. A. Limbert, Failure Analysis Asso- ciates, Inc. The vehicle inertial properties used as input parameters in handling, braking, and accident dynamics analyses are difficult to measure and are rarely reported by manufacturers or research- ers. Frequently, estimation techniques are used to extrapolate from the few values reported in the literature. Inaccurate experi- mental measurement of inertia properties and inappropriate groupings of vehicles can introduce large errors into such esti- mates. This paper presents measured inertial properties of sport util- ity vehicles, pickup trucks, and vans and describes analytical esti- mation techniques for moments of inertia applicable to most light trucks. The measurement techniques and estimates of their accuracy are described. Comparisons of results with values reported in the literature for similar vehicles also are made. The moment of inertia estimation equations are presented and their agreement with measured values reported here and by others is discussed. 1991 SAE Transactions Section 6 910123. (SP-853) Linear and rotational momentum for com- puting impact speeds in two-car collisions (LARM). Rudy Lim- pert and Dennis F. Andrews, Prosource Software. The limits associated with the use of linear momentum proce- dures in impact speed predictions of two-car collisions are well established. A combined linear and rotational momentum proce- dure is introduced which makes it possible to compute the impact speeds of each vehicle based on the post crash data of only one vehicle, or based on only the angles rotated of each vehicle. The limitations of the combined procedure are discussed. A speed sensitivity analysis is presented which offers a methodology by which reasonably accurate speed predictions can be made. A number of actual computer applications are shown which dem- 17</page><page sequence="17">910123-910130 onstrates the usefulness and simplicity of the procedure pres- ented. 910124. (SP-853) A two-dimensional model of a "falling" vehi- cle. Garrison Kost, Gustav A. Nystrom , Greg Olsen, and Angela Steffen, Failure Analysis Associates, Ine . A number of accidents involve a vehicle going off the edge of the road and becoming airborne. In these types of accidents, the engineer is typically faced with the problem of estimating the velocity of the vehicle at launch, based on evidence defining the launch position and point of impact at the end of the flight. Two options have been available to evaluate the dynamics of such problems. The first is to treat the vehicle as a point mass, and use simple trajectory equations to define the flight path. This approach considers only the two translational degrees of freedom of the center of mass of the vehicle, and neglects effects of tire contact during launch. The second option is to carry out a full three-dimensional analysis. This approach treats the sprung mass of the vehicle as a rigid body, accounts for the four tire contact conditions, and possibly models the suspension and unsprung masses. Situations may occur, however, where the engineer requires more detailed information about the launch and path than can be obtained from the simple first option, yet cost considerations or problem geometry do not warrant the expenditure of effort necessary to use the complex second option. To address this situation, a dynamic model of intermediate complexity has been developed. The vehicle is represented by a two-dimensional model with two translation degrees of freedom and one rotation degree of freedom. This approach can be used to simulate a vehicle travelling approximately forward or later- ally off the edge of the roadway. This two-dimensional model provides information not avail- able from a point mass model. First, it provides a more realistic model of the trajectory by incorporating motion during the time interval when only one set of tires is on the road. Second, it pro- vides information about the rotational motion, which can be used to infer the speed of the vehicle while on the roadway. 910125. (SP-853) The calculation of motorcycle speeds from sliding distances. Richard F. Lambourn, Metropolitan Police Forensic Science Lab. Tests have been performed to investigate how the average deceleration experienced by a motorcycle sliding to rest on its side from high speed compares with the friction measured in a low-speed drag test. This has been done both by launching motor- cycles from a low platform, and by allowing them to fall to their sides from an upright position, from speeds between 32 and 90 km/h. It was found that the friction measured in the low-speed drag tests gave a value close to the high-speed sliding value. The fric- tion was affected by the road surface texture, the presence of prominent side projections, and the wearing away of these projec- tions during the slide. Some speed dependence was noted in the upright-launch tests which appears to be due to the "digging-in" of the machine as it falls to the road, rather than an effect of the sliding friction itself. 1 991 SAE Transactions Section 6 910126. (SP-853) Heavy truck deceleration rates as a function of brake adjustment. Ronald B. Heusser, National Transportation Safety Board. When reconstructing a highway accident involving a heavy truck, an accurate deceleration rate is often an elusive piece of the puzzle. This paper presents a method for calculating the decelera- tion rate of a heavy truck equipped with an air-mechanical brake system. Traditionally a deceleration rate had been more an esti- mate of the percent of wheel lock-up based on the brake adjust- ment, and then proportioned to the loading on the axles. Equa- tions for two configurations of brake chamber size and slack adjuster length were written by engineers at the National High- way Traffic Safety Administration's (NHTSA) Vehicle Research and Test Center (VRTC) to describe braking torque as it varies with pushrod stroke. These equations were developed by means of a regression analysis, to fit a curve to dynamometer data pro- duced at the VRTC in East Liberty, Ohio. Once this braking torque is converted to a braking force, it can be compared to the braking force available at the tire/road interface. This compari- son allows the ^constructionist to evaluate which wheels will lock and to calculate an accurate deceleration rate. Another method for calculating braking force is based on a commonly used brake sizing formula. Comparing the dynamom- eter data to results from the brake sizing equation, allowed the brake sizing equation to be modified to account for all variations of brake component configurations. The increase of pushrod stroke due to brake heating and drum expansion is examined using another set of equations also written at VRTC. When this temperature effect is combined with a mathematical model to predict brake temperature on downgrades, as developed through projects funded by the Federal Highway Administration (FHWA), a reliable deceleration rate can be calculated for a heavy truck descending a grade of variable length and slope. Computed deceleration rates are compared to actual mea- sured rates from stopping tests of tractor semi-trailers. These road tests provide validation for the discussed methods and demon- strate the expected range of accuracy. 1991 SAE Transactions Section 2 910127. (SP-853) Determination of collision configurations from vehicle deformation patterns. Masaru Ueyama, Hiroshi Makishita, and Shuji Saito, Mech. Engrg. Section, National Research Institute of Police Science. The severity of vehicle crush and occupant injury is explained in terms of the changes in kinetic energy or change in velocity during impact. The works are calculated by mathematical models such as CRASH III program on the basis of vehicle damage infor- mation collected from the accident scene. In application of CRASH III, the impact orientation and the direction of the prin- cipal force, etc., must be inputted by user himself, in his personal experiments. Therefore, it is one of the most important task to estimate the collision configuration from physical evidence. In generally, the vehicle collision proceed to the three process, that is, when the vehicle contacts to the other vehicle, the maxi- mum deformation of the vehicles occurs, and then second colli- sion happens depend on collision configuration. This paper pro- vides an experimental discussion for determination of collision configurations from vehicle crush dynamics and the resulting deformation patterns. A series of oblique full-scale collision experiments were carried out, and a quantitative description of vehicle deformation was conducted using stereo type camera sys- tem. Practical application also will be presented in this paper. 1991 SAE Transactions Section 6 910128. (SP-853) Photographic documentation and analysis in vehicle accident reconstruction. Dror Kopernik and Crispin Hales, Triody ne Inc. The use of the camera has become increasingly important in vehicle accident reconstruction work. A number of practical tech- niques have been developed which go beyond simply document- ing what is seen at a particular time. The camera may be used for making measurements, for establishing lines of sight and for ana- lyzing photographs taken by others. This paper briefly reviews photographic methods currently in use in accident reconstruction and presents several techniques which have been developed to expand the use of the camera. Photographs taken from actual accident cases are used to illustrate these new techniques. 910130. (P-240) Diesel particulate control around the world. Michael P. Walsh, Consultant; and Ron Bradow, EPA. 18</page><page sequence="18">910130-910137 Worldwide concerns with global climate change and reducing oil consumption have increased interest in expanding the global light duty diesel penetration, adding to the already dominant role of diesels in commercial vehicles. The major impediment has been concern over the adverse health effects associated with die- sel exhaust. This paper will review the status of these concerns, summarizing recent studies conducted by the World Health Organization, the US EPA and the California Air Resources Board. In response to these concerns, various countries have adopted controls on both diesel vehicles and engines and their fuels. The current status of these efforts as well as the state of control tech- nology will be summarized. 910131. (P-240) The influence of lubricating oil and diesel fuel on ash accumulation in an exhaust particulate trap. Marty A. Bar- ris, Susan B. Reinhart , and Fred H. Wahlquist , Donaldson Co., Inc. A diesel generator set was used as a long term durability test for an exhaust particulate trap oxidizer system. The single trap (wall flow monolith) system was exposed to two 3000 hour tests. The tests included 20 minute engine cycles of varying speeds and loads, with complete monitoring of trap performance during loading and regeneration. The two tests differed in the type of lubricating oil and fuel used. The first test used a relatively high ash oil and regular sulfur fuel. The second test used an ashless oil and low sulfur fuel. The affects on the ceramic filter performance over the extended test times were dramatically different. The reg- ular sulfur fuel and high ash of the first test resulted in a trap almost completely filled with ash. The low sulfur fuel and ashless oil of the second test had only 6% by mass of the ash collected in the previous test. The use of an experimental ashless lubricating oil and low sulfur fuel resulted in only modest noncombustible deposits in the exhaust particulate trap system, and hence had lit- tle detrimental effect over the trap system's design service inter- val. 1991 SAE Transactions Section 4 910132. (P-240) Status of particulate trap system for a heavy duty diesel truck. Atsushi Matsunuma, Takayuki Takizawa, Koichi Takeuchi, and Katsuhiko Yokota, Engine Advanced Research Dept., Isuzu Motors Ltd. Two types of particulate trap systems for heavy duty diesel truck have been newly designed and bench tests were conducted. The first is single wall flow type trap and a burner-assisted regeneration system in which exhaust gas is by-passed during regeneration. Even though maximum temperature in the trap could be kept low by controlling both burner gas temperature and the amount of particulate collection, there was a problem of trap failure, cracks developing after a certain period. The other type is a cross flow type trap where collected partic- ulate is blown out periodically by high pressure air from rear side of trap for burning by an electric heater. This system features that the trap can be regenerated without heating the trap body itself. After conducting basic tests it was found that this system had a high potential. This paper details this new concept. 1991 SAE Transactions Section 3 910133. (P-240) Cleaner diesels full flow soot filter regenera- tion system. Peter Kugland, Ernst Krieger, and Enrique Santiago, Research and Development, Zeuna Stärker GmbH &amp;. Co. KG. A recent accomplishment is a selfregenerating soot filter sys- tem developed largely for city bus application. The design con- sists of burner and a subsequent soot filter, which together form a complete system. The burner does not require an extra air supply as it utilizes the remaining oxygen contained in the engine exhaust gas. The burner system is microprocessor controlled and provides for automatic filter regeneration during regular vehicle operation. Since there is full exhaust flow through the filter system the design requires no moving components. A treatment of the filter body by catalyst materials is not required, neither are fuel additives for assistance with the regen- eration process. This ensures highest environmental safety. Despite the high power of the burner system, the fuel con- sumption of approximately 0,5 1 per regeneration cycle (approxi- mately every 6 to 8 hours) is relatively low in consideration with the overall fuel consumption. Consequently, the exhaust emis- sion increase is likewise negligible. 910134. (P-240) A diesel particulate filter system using assisted regeneration for mechanical handling equipment. D. L. McKinnon and J. W. Miller, Engine Control Systems Ltd.; and D. J. Boyle, Consolidated Freightways, Inc. A cooperative R&amp;D program involving Engine Control Sys- tems Ltd. (ECS) and Consolidated Freightways, Inc. (C-F) has resulted in a diesel emissions control system for small to medium sized mechanical handling equipment. This paper outlines the design specifics of the system with an emphasis on the manner in which forktrucks can relatively easily be retrofitted. Both laboratory and in-field test results are out- lined. The particulate filter system uses electric power to induce regeneration when backpressure rises to unacceptable levels. 910135. (P-240) Dynamic fatigue data for cordierite ceramic wall-flow diesel filter. S. T. Gulati, Corning, Inc.; and D. L. Sher- wood, Corning Inc. The dynamic fatigue data for two different cordierite ceramic wall-flow diesel filter compositions, EX-54 and EX-66, are obtained at 200° and 400°C using the 4-point bend test. These compositions offer larger mean pore size and experience lower pressure drop than the EX-47 composition, and hence are more desirable for certain applications. Their fatigue behavior in the operating temperature range is found to be equivalent or superior to that of EX-47 composition which helps promote filter durabil- ity. The fatigue data are used to arrive at a safe allowable stress, which would ensure the required 290K vehicle mile durability. The paper also discusses the impact of mean pore size on high temperature strength and fatigue properties and their effect on fil- ter durability. 1991 SAE Transactions Section 5 910136. (P-240) Electric heating regeneration of large wall- flow type DPF. Jun Kitagawa, Toshihiko Hijikata, and Satoru Yamada, NGK Insulators, Ltd. Ceramic wall-flow type diesel particulate filters (DPF) are being investigated for the aftertreatment systems of heavy duty engines. To use ceramic DPF more reliably and easily, electric heating regenerations are studied varying combustion air flow rates and amounts of accumulated soot. Despite electric heater capacity limitations, it is possible to regenerate DPF at a certain combustion air flow rate without thermal shock failure. The maximum withstood temperature against thermal shock failure of electric heating regeneration is similar to that of diesel burner regeneration on DPF with a nine inch diameter and a twelve inch length. 1991 SAE Transactions Section 3 910137. (P-240) A trap oxidizer system for the turbocharged diesel engine. K. N. Pattas and A. M. Stamatelos, Dept. of Mech. En gr g., Lab. of Applied Thermodynamics, Aristotle Univ. of The. This paper presents the experience gained by testing a trap sys- tem on a turbocharged bus engine. The trap is placed before the turbo in order to fully exploit the high regeneration potential of the turbocharged engine. This of course necessitates a new con- sideration of the turbocharging system, in order to keep a good turbocharger response. The quick temperature response of the 19</page><page sequence="19">910137-910143 lightweight exhaust manifold installed with the system, partially offsets in this respect the thermal inertia of the ceramic trap. The effects of the use of cerium or copper-based fuel additives enhanc- ing regeneration capability are presented, in order to allow pre- liminary assessment of optimization capabilities for the final ver- sion of the system to be used with the bus. Regeneration of this system is effected through the application of exhaust throttling before the trap. The bypass technique is also applied for trap pro- tection. Testing on the engine test bench confirmed trap and regeneration system effectiveness and on-road testing with an experimental bus is now underway. 910138. (P-240) Development of a diesel particulate trap sys- tem for city buses. Tatsuki Ig aras hi, Masatoshi Shimoda, Tetsuya Otani, Keiichi Tsuchihashi, and Masashi Shigemori, Hino Motors, Ltd. Diesel particulate trap systems are one of the effective means for the control of particulate emission from diesel vehicles. Hino has been researching and developing various diesel particulate trap systems for city buses. This paper describes two of the sys- tems. One uses a wall flow filter equipped with an electric heater and a sensing device for particulate loading for the purpose of fil- ter regeneration. Another makes use of a special filter named "cross flow filter" with an epochmaking regeneration method cal- led "reverse jet cleaning", by which it becomes possible to sepa- rate the part for particulate burning from the filter. Both systems roughly have come to satisfy the functions of trap systems for city buses, but their durability and reliability for city buses are not yet sufficient. 1991 SAE Transactions Section 3 910139. Material alternatives for the automotive crankshaft - A competitive assessment based on manufacturing economics. Narayan V. Nallicheri, IBIS Associates, Inc.; and Joel P. Clark and Frank R. Field, M.I. T. The automotive crankshaft, one of the more metal intensive components in the engine, provides an attractive opportunity for the use of alternate materials and processing routes. Although performance requirements are important in the choice of a partic- ular material or fabrication route, the final decision is usually dic- tated by cost. This study evaluated the cost effectiveness of various material alternatives for the crankshaft. The technique of "technical cost modeling" was utilized to estimate the manufacturing costs of the various material alternatives. Four processing routes for the man- ufacture of the automotive crankshaft were evaluated: steel forg- ing, nodular casting, microalloy forging and austempered ductile iron casting. The results indicate that although nodular cast iron is the most widely used material today, it appears that, with changing engine design, microalloyed steel can effectively compete in this applica- tion. Further, given a choice between forging or casting-and-heat- treating, engineers would rather forge a crankshaft, if perfor- mance exceeding that of nodular cast iron is necessary. This is mainly attributed to the current processing problems with austempered ductile iron (ADI), which make it a very unattrac- tive choice for crankshafts, especially when enhanced properties can be more cost effectively achieved with microalloyed steel. The primary attractiveness of steel forgings is that they offer bet- ter specific performance in this application, which current designs do not exploit. Suppliers should promote forged crank- shaft designs which offer components with lower weights than cast crankshafts. Any process improvements which would reduce machining requirements could have a major impact upon fin- ished part cost in this application. 910140. Assessment of bending fatigue limits for carburized steel. R. E. Cohen, Advanced Steel Processing and Products Research Center, Colorado School of Mi ; P. J. Haagensen, Dept. of Civil Engrg ., Norwegian Institute of Technology ; and D . K. Matlock and G. Krauss, Advanced Steel Processing and Products Research Center, Colorado School of Mi. This paper reviews the bending fatigue endurance limits reported in the literature for carburized steels. Almost an order of magnitude difference in fatigue limits (210-1950 MPa) is reported. The reasons for this wide range are not clear because of the complexity of interactions between the microstructural, test- ing and manufacturing systems associated with carburized com- ponents. In well characterized specimens, two types of micro- structures and fatigue crack mechanisms associated with moder- ate and high levels of fatigue performance have been identified and are described here. Finally, the effects of selected engineering parameters on the measurement of bending fatigue limits are dis- cussed. The need for more complete experimental characteriza- tion of fatigue performance is stressed as a critical step to produce consistent bending fatigue performance at the upper end of that attainable in carburized steels. 910141. A comparative evaluation of mechanical properties and machinability of austempered ductile iron (ADI) and microal- loyed steel. Debanshu Bhattacharya and P. K. Rastogi, Research Labs., Inland Steel Co. Austempered ductile iron (ADI) samples were heat treated to produce materials with tensile strengths in the range of 100 ksi to 170 ksi. Microalloyed steels were also produced with equiva- lent tensile and yield strength levels. These steels were evaluated for mechanical properties in terms of tensile and yield strength, ductility, impact toughness, fracture toughness and fatigue strength. Machinability was extensively evaluated through tests of drilling, turning and plunge machining. This paper reports on this comprehensive comparative evaluation of these two impor- tant classes of materials for use in the automotive industry. 910142. Process simulation to improve quality and increase productivity in rolling, ring rolling and forging. Rajiv Shivpuri, Industrial and Systems Engrg. Dept., Ohio State Univ.; and Tay - lan Altan, Engrg. Research Center for Net Shape Manufacturing, Ohio State Univ. The practical and proven use of computers in forming technol- ogy include: CAD/CAM for die making; transfer of geometric data from the customer's CAD/CAM system to that of the sup- plier and vice versa; application of artificial intelligence and expert systems for part and process design; simulation of metal flow to eliminate forging defects; prediction and optimization of process variables; and analysis of stresses in dies as well as pre- vention of premature die failure. Intelligent use of this informa- tion can lead to significant gains in product quality and produc- tivity. This paper presents three examples of application of pro- cess simulation to forming: rolling, ring rolling and forging. 1991 SAE Transactions Section S 910143. A new microalloyed, multi-phase steel for high strength forging applications. C. I. Garcia, A. K. Lis, and A. J. DeArdo, Dept. of Materials Science and Engrg., University of Pittsburgh. Forged components to be used in high strength applications have traditionally been heat treated after forging. This processing route unfortunately suffers from many technical and economical shortcomings. The first attempt to overcome these difficulties led to the development of medium carbon microalloyed steels for bar applications in the early 1970's. While tese steels did not require heat treatment, their strengths were limited. Furthermore, the notch toughness of these steels was rather poor. The limitation on strength and toughness have hindered their acceptance as a substitute for the conventional QT steels, especially in safety crit- ical components. In addition, these shortcomings eliminate the possibility of downsizing through redesign. 20</page><page sequence="20">910143-910149 Since the tempered martensite and the microalloyed ferrite- pearlite steels have obvious limitations, an alternative micro- structure had to be developed. Ideally, this new microstructure should have the ability to generate high strengths without heat treatment and offer high toughness values. It has been found that forged and quenched components made from a low-carbon steel containing Mn-Mo-Nb exhibit a multi-phase structure consisting of low-carbon martensite and lower bainite. This structure has been found to have both high strength and high toughness. This paper describes this new steel, its properties and production trials designed to illustrate its applicability to safety critical compo- nents. 910144. Development of manufacturing techniques for oil tem- pered steel wire for valve spring in Japan. Jiro Tominaga , Suzuki Metal Industry Co., Ltd. In the manufacturing processes for valve springs, from steel refining to the secondary working of wire, the techniques which are effective against non-metallic inclusions are especially impor- tant for improving fatigue properties. Attention is given to avoid- ing Al interaction with the molten product, and the size and shape of inclusions are controlled with a Ca-Si type synthetic slag. Decreasing the oxygen in the molten state will cause the forma- tion of AI2O3 undeformable inclusions and should be avoided. To prevent both surface flaws and decarburization, condition- ing of billets, control of heating temperatures in the furnace, and control of cooling temperatures after hot rolling are carried out. Wire surfaces are shaved by using a reverse die system, and further inspection using eddy currents is used for the entire length of the wire. By modifying SAE 9254 to achieve higher tensile strength, four new grades have been developed with increased carbon, vanadium, and molybdenum being the key elements. 910145. The high strength cold forging applications of a new multi-phase steel. C. I. Garcia, A. K. Lis, and A. J. DeArdo, Dept. of Materials Science and Engrg., University of Pittsburgh. High strength fasteners and cold forgings are typically pro- duced from carbon or low alloy steel. While the final components usually exhibit adequate mechanical properties such as strength, toughness and fatigue resistance, the cost of producing compo- nents using these conventional steels is unattractively high. A large portion of these costs originate in the nature of the steel cho- sen for fabrication. The cumulative cost of total material-related processing, e.g. spheroidize annealing required before cold forg- ing plus that of the QT and stress relieving heat treatments fol- lowing cold forging, renders the total process rather cost ineffec- tive. An ideal steel for cost-effective cold forging must exhibit the following characteristics: 1) good bulk formability in the hot rolled bar or rod form; 2) should be capable of generating high strengths during the cold forging process; and 3) should retain good toughness in the final component. A new steel for high strength cold forging applications, which has the characteristics of the ideal steel, has been developed by the Basic Metals Process- ing Research Institute of University of Pittsburgh. This new mic- roalloyed steel, called BHS-1, exhibits a multiphase microstruc- ture which can be developed during controlled hot processing of bar or rod. Laboratory and industrial trials have shown that this new steel is capable of attaining very high strengths, ductilities, notch toughness and fatigue resistances in a variety of applica- tions and is a viable cost-effective substitute for conventional QT steels. 910146. Grain size and forgeability of a titanium microalloyed forging steel. P. A. Oberly, C. J. Van Tyne, and G. Krauss, Advanced Steel Processing and Products Research Center, Colo- rado School of Mi. In recent years, microalloying has been advocated as a means for producing direct cooled forging steels. Microalloyed steels benefit from vanadium and niobium additions, but the carboni- trides formed by these elements are not stable at high tempera- tures. Micro-additions of titanium, which form a fine dispersion of carbonitrides that are stable at high temperature, have been promoted as an approach for maintaining a fine austenite grain size at high forging temperatures. In this work two microalloyed steels were examined, 1522MoV and 1522MoV with 0.011 tita- nium addition. The effect of the titanium additions on the grain size and high temperature flow strength were studied. The tita- nium addition has a significant effect on maintaining a small aus- tenite grain size at temperatures up to 1300°C. High temperature stress-strain data indicate that titanium causes an increased flow strength at 1100°C and 1200°C especially at higher strain rates. At 1000°C the titanium has little effect on the flow strength of this alloy. 1991 SAE Transactions Section 5 910147. Machinability of SAE 8620 with and without machin- ing enhancers. Renato Mauti, Chrysler Materials Engrg. Machinability of SAE 8620 hot rolled steel bars was evaluated. All samples were tested in the normalized condition. Machinabil- ity was determined using a CNC turning center with titanium nitride coated cutting inserts. Several heats from different steel suppliers were tested, some contained the machining enhancers calcium and tellurium as well as various sulphur levels. One heat did not contain enhancers for determination of a machinability baseline. Two machining parameters were used: 800 and 1200 c.s. f.m. (constant surface feet per minute), both at a feed rate of .015 i.p.r. (inches per revolution) and .075 in. d.o.c. (depth of cut). All the materials were chemically, mechanically, and metallurgically characterized. This report will show that these machining enhancers can pro- duce less insert damage (flank and crater) than the same grades without machining enhancers. Machinability will be evaluated with the aid of tool life charts, Taylor curves, and a new parame- ter involving both tool wear and tool forces. 910148. An integrated approach to the simulation of vehicle crashworthiness and occupant protection systems. B. D. Walker and P. R. B. Dallard, Ove Arup and Partners. This paper briefly traces the history of analytical methods as they have been applied to the subjects of vehicle crashworthiness and occupant protection. Recognizing that several different types of analytical methods are currently being used simultaneously within most automotive design offices, it is suggested that the state of the art has now advanced to the point where one single, unified approach can be sensibly adopted. This argument is sup- ported by examples drawn from several different real applica- tions in which the finite element program, OASYS DYNA3D, has been shown to perform well. 910149. Development of the all-mechanical air bag system. Hiroaki Shinto and Kenji Ogata, Toyota Motor Corp.; Fuminori Teraoka, Tokai Rika Co., Ltd.; and Mitsuhiko Fukabori, Daicel Safety Systems, Inc. A highly reliable all-mechanical air bag system has been devel- oped with a production cost lower than the electrical air bag sys- tem. All components, such as the bag, inflator and sensor are inte- grated into the steering wheel. Regarding the sensor design, we first discussed the requirements of the sensor to optimize the driver's protection, and then we designed it using a simulation method. We have confirmed by crash tests that this method is correct, and have found that this system is effective for reducing facial injuries. 21</page><page sequence="21">910150-910155 910150. Numerical simulation of fully folded airbags and their interaction with occupants with PAM-SAFE.D. Lasry, Engineer- ing Systems International S.A.; Rainer Hoffmann, Engineering Systems International GmbH; and Jean-Baptiste Protard, Engi- neering Systems International S.A. With the advent of widespread use of airbags as restraint sys- tems for both driver and passenger, a new challenge has appeared for the design engineer. Numerical models of various degrees of complexity have been developed to model the interaction between airbags and occupants, ranging from simplified models such as the airbags included in rigid body dynamic models, to more sophisticated, fully three-dimensional ones based on finite elements (FE). However, some key questions of airbag design such as interac- tion of the unfolding bag with out-of-position occupants and effects of different airbag folding patterns remained unanswered, and their design still requires extensive test series. In this paper, the approach developed at Engineering Systems International over the past two years to solve the problem of numerical simula- tion of fully folded bags is presented in the larger context of the PAM-SAFE program for analysis of occupant safety. Several examples are presented which illustrate the successful handling of FE mesh folding, improved contact algorithms that can tract the complete unfolding process and early interaction with occu- pants. Models of driver side airbags showing good correlation with test results, as well as simulation of a child dummy interact- ing with a deploying passenger side airbag are presented. 910151. PASSIM-PLUS, a multi-element, passenger airbag model. Michael U. Fitzpatrick and Kelly E. Thompson, Fitzpat - rick Engrg. A multi-element passenger side airbag model for analyzing air- bags of complex shape is discussed. The model has the capability of allowing the passenger to interact with the three dimensional, instantaneous airbag shape determined by the various contact surfaces encountered by the airbag. Therefore, the shape of the contact surface presented to the passenger is not constant but deformable and can therefore accommodate large deflection pen- etrations by the passenger. Up to 3000 airbag elements can be used to configure the desired airbag shape. Airbag mass and its effect on airbag deployment kinematics and the subsequent bagslap forces are taken into account. Because of this, the model is capable of computing the kinematics and resultant injury of forward positioned children as well as nor- mally seated adults. Because of the multi-element airbag approach, the effect of instantaneous vent blockage of porous airbag materials due to contact with the passenger and vehicle compartment may be taken into account and evaluated. The model is fully supported by various menu driven pre-and post-processors for creating the input files as well as evaluating the output. A special, menu driven, interactive pre-processor, structured to receive user input in a format compatible with conventional airbag drawing coordinates and dimensions, facilitates rapid cre- ation of the 3-D airbag "mesh". Because of this, the multi- element mesh, for even the most complex airbag shapes, may be quickly obtained. Another pre-processor computes the inflator mass flow and gas temperatures from tank test data. All FMVSS-208 injury measures are computed and summa- rized. Post-processors provide full graphic output in curve plot overlay (for comparing test versus simulation of simulation ver- sus another simulation) and animated kinematic format. Validation of the model for both the normally seated adult and out-of-position child are included in the discussion. The results show that the model is not only easy to use but also quite accurate in its predictive ability. 910152. Numerical crashworthiness simulation of automotive structures and components made of fiber reinforced composite and sandwich assemblies. E. Haug, O. Fort, and A. Trameçon, Engineering Systems International S.A.; and M . Watanabe, and I. Nakada, R&amp;D Lab., Tonen Corp. The present paper outlines basic material models for compos- ite strength and failure analysis, based on ESFs PAM-FISS/Bi- Phase composite material model. The new material models have been ported into the PAM-CRASH™ crashworthiness simulation code and applied to the crashworthiness simulation of axially compressed box columns made of hybrid carbon-kevlar-aramid sandwich walls. After calibration of the models on laboratory coupon tests and validation on simple component crash tests, the methodology can be used to predict the crash behaviour of a pro- totype passenger car compartment structure, made entirely of composite sandwich material. 1991 SAE Transactions Section 6 910153. Theoretical analysis of powder forging. Suren Dwivedi, R. Sharan, and Donald W. Lyons, Dept. of Mech. and Aerospace Engrg., West Virginia Univ. In recent years, P/M techniques have been combined with conventional deformation processes to manufacture various engineering products. During the forging of a metal powder pre- form, changes in volume and density occur, and the various theo- retical analyses developed based on volume constancy cannot be applied to the deformation of porous materials. The paper reviews some of the work carried out in chronological order. A mathematical solution was developed for axisymmetric forging of iron powder preforms (solid and hollow) under the frictional conditions based on the yield criteria proposed by Tabata and Masaki for porous materials. The theoretical values agreed with experimental values within accuracy (85-95%). 910154. A knowledge-based approach to demonstate feasibil- ity of powder metallurgy process. M. A. Pathak, College of Engrg., West Virginia Univ.; and Suren Dwivedi and R. Sharan, Dept. of Mech. and Aerospace Engrg., West Virginia Univ. Artificial Intelligence (AI) has been gaining popularity since the 1960s. Expert systems (ES) within artificial intelligence are now being applied to industrial and manufacturing areas as a means of solving problems and as decision making aids. Expert systems provide a way to capture expert knowledge so that it is not permanently lost. With the stiff competition in the world market, the tendency is leaning toward manufacturing the part with control of several parameters especially from the point of view of conserving material and money. Powder metallurgy is a metalworking process for forming precision metal and nonmetal components and shapes from particulate matters. The main rea- son for this fast advancing technology is that it is an economical, high-volume prodution method for making parts almost to the final dimensions and finishing them with little or no machining operations. Certain design and manufacturing considerations during the design and manufacture of a powder metallurgy com- ponent can result in cost savings during fabrication. It is the intent of this paper to present a knowledge-based expert system approach to evaluate the feasibility of powder metallurgy process for product design. 910155. Material characterization of powder-forged copper steels. R. A. Chernenkoff, Ford Motor Corp.; S. Mocarski, Ford Motor Co.; M. Gagné, Quebec Metal Powders Ltd.; and D. W. Hall, Ford Motor Co. Powder metal based copper steels have found increased use in automotive applications, an example being powder-forged con- necting rods. A characterization study was conducted to deter- mine the effects of carbon content and manganese sulphide addi- tion on the mechanical properties and machinability of these materials. 22</page><page sequence="22">910155-910163 Steel powder mixes containing 2% Cu and various graphite contents, with and without a MnS addition were pressed, sintered and forged to full density. Forged samples were then tested for tensile properties, hardness and fatigue strength. Machinability was determined by measuring tool life during drilling tests. It was found that increasing the carbon content from 0.28 to 0.69% has little effect on fatigue properties of powder-forged copper steels although the tensile strength increased as expected. The addition of manganese sulphide did not affect the mechanical properties measured, but was found to significantly improve the machin- ability. 1991 SAE Transactions Section S 910156. Applications of high performance P/M aluminum in internal combustion engines. Volker Arnhold , Peak Werkstoff GmbH; and Dieter Müller-Schwellingy Mahle GmbH. Powder metallurgy (P/M) renders the possibilities to tailor material properties using rapid solidification or mechanical alloying processes totally different to the options of ingot metal- lurgy (I/M). For demanding applications in internal combustion engines new materials have become more important because of environmental and/or performance reasons. Weight reductions to improve the performance or reduce the consumptions and consequently the amount of exhaust gases and increase of tem- peratures at different locations of an engine need better alumi- num materials. P/M solutions are described from the point of view of material's processing and general properties. The poten- tial for automotive pistons is discussed with several examples. 910157. Cost effective finishing of powder forged connecting rods with the fracture-splitting-method. Manfred Weber ; Kreb- söge Sinterholding GmbH. The powder forging process closes the gap between conven- tional powder metallurgy and die forgings. Adequate shape of the preform and strict respect of its given volume avoids forging burrs and delivers closer tolerances. Powder forging achieves higher density and therefore remark- ably improved mechanical properties as compared to the conven- tional PM process. An example of application for a component with high dynamic stresses is the connecting rod. High precision and low weight tolerances already lead to less machining operations on sinterforged connecting rods than on classical forged or cast com- ponents. Using the patented Krebsöge fracture splitting proce- dure, subsequent costly machining operations become obsolete. This leads to remarkably lower investments for new machining lines and to cost savings for production. 910158. Sliding surface profiling of plain journal bearings. Durval Duarte , Jr., Manfred Kaufmann, Jr., Mario Praca, Osw- aldo Oybani Filho, and Walter Zottin, Metal Leve S.A. Industria Comercio. Several cases of rod bearing shells assembled in highly loaded engines have been reported to show premature wear of the sliding surface, more specifically the electroplated lead-tin overlay. To understand these phenomena and overcome such occur- rences, an analytical method has been developed to simulate to operation of specially designed journal bearings featuring circum- ferential profiling of the sliding surface. The resulting computer program solves the Reynolds equation taking into account a non- circular bearing surface, thus allowing for a customized design which extends operational component life through minimum oil film thickness (MOFT) increase and peak oil film pressure (POFP) and bearing back temperature (BBT) reduction. Theoret- ical results show an effective way to prevent premature wear. The geometric aspects drawn from those investigations were introduced in the manufacturing of bearing shells provided with relieves, which, after being tested in automotive engines, proved to enhance their operation, granting more reliability to the engines. 910159. Engine bearing contact pressure simulations with thermal effects. Herman Chang, Delco Moraine NDH Div., Gen- eral Motors Corp. A numerical procedure to determine the contact pressure between the engine bearing and block is presented in this paper. As examples, the pressure distributions for both the cast iron and aluminum blocks are calculated. The variations of the contact pressures at different temperatures are also studied. Numerical results indicate that the retention of the bearing is accomplished primarily by the high contact pressure around the bearing edges for grooved bearings. A force diagram explaining this phenome- non is provided. In addition, a simple equation evolving from elasticity theory is included for a quick determination of the con- tact pressure. 1991 SAE Transactions Section 3 910160. A study of oil flow and the temperature in journal bearings. Katsuyuki Hashizume and Yoshio Kumada, R&amp;D Dept., Taiho Kogyo Co., Ltd. With the recent trend toward increased unit load in engine bearings, problems due to lack of lubrication frequently arise, especially in crankpin bearings. We have previously investigated the infleunce of shaft and bearing design on the oil flow using the connecting rod in actual use under alternating loads. In this paper, we investigate the critical value of oil flow at which the bearing temperature rises rapidly and the influence of connecting rod rigidity on the oil flow. As a result of these tests, it was discovered that the increase in bearing temperature (ATj) is in inverse proportion to oil flow (Qj), tests resulting in a single curve expressed by ATj = Ei/Qj + E2, that the critical oil flow (Qc) varies according to Qc = Const. * Ei, and that connecting rod rigidity greatly influences the oil flow (specifically, the greater the rigidity the less oil). 910161. Development of three layers copper-lead bearings for higher speed automotive engines. Koichi Yamaoto, Hiroichi Mat- suhisa, Motomu Wada, Masaaki Sakamoto, and Tadashi Tanaka, Daido Metal Co., Ltd. As the recent automotive engines are designed for higher per- formance, the rotating speed of the engines have been increased drastically. Therefore, the engine bearings should be further improved to have better anti-seizure and wear properties under the high temperature at the high rotating speed. The authors have analyzed the necessary functions of the three layers copper-lead bearings at such operating conditions, and then improved and developed the overlay and the copper based bearing alloy with steel back. Physical and chemical properties for this new bearing were studied. Then the bearing performance tests were carried out including the high speed seizure tests and engine tests. From these test results, it was confirmed that this new bearing could be applied for the recent very high speed automotive engines. 910163. Verification of variable amplitude fatigue life method- ologies for a cast aluminum alloy. K. B. Lease and R. I. Stephens, Mech. Engrg. Dept., University of Iowa. The objective of this research was to determine the feasibility of applying commonly used fatigue life calculation models to notched cast aluminum alloy components. Notched 'component- like' specimens made of A356-T6 cast aluminum alloy were used to obtain experimental fatigue lives both to the formation of a 1.5 mm 'initiation' crack and to final fracture. A commercially avail- able fatigue life calculation software package was then used to cal- culate the fatigue crack initiation and propagation life corre- sponding to these tests, using a variety of common analysis meth- ods. The resulting correlation between these experimental and calculated fatigue lives ranged from excellent to extremely poor (correlation ratios ranging from 1 to 102), depending on the analy- sis method used. The wide range in correlation was due mainly 23</page><page sequence="23">910163-910171 to the large differences obtained from the fatigue crack growth life calculation methods. Extreme care must thus be taken when using these fatigue life calculations for cast aluminim alloys. 1991 SAE Transactions Section S 910164. Biaxial torsion-bending fatigue of SAE axle shafts./. /. F. Bonnen , F. A. Con le, and C. C. Chu, Ford Motor Co. Variable amplitude torsion, bending, and combined torsion and bending fatigue tests were performed on an axle shaft. The moment inputs used were taken from the respective history chan- nels of a cable log skidder vehicle axle. Testing results indicated that combined variable amplitude loading lives were shorter than the lives of specimens subjected to bending or torsion alone. Cal- culations using strain rosette readings indicated that principle strains were most active around specific angles but also occurred with lesser magnitudes through a wider angular range. Over the course of a biaxial test, cyclic creep narrowly limited the angles and magnitudes of the principal strains. This limitation was not observed in the calculated principal stress behavior. Simple life predictions made on the measured strain gage histories were non- conservative in most cases. Evidence also indicated that small cycles from the variable amplitude history - those cycles below the expected fatigue limit- were causing fatigue damage. 1991 SAE Transactions Section S 910165. A review of the development and use of Neuber's rule for fatigue analysis. Steven M. Tipton, Mech. Engrg. Dept., Uni- versity of Tulsa. With the advent of strain controlled fatigue testing, strain gages and the local strain approach for fatigue analyses, designers must be able to assess the state of strain in a notch in order to pre- dict the structural integrity of many mechanical components. A great deal of research effort has been expended over the past thirty years to develop fundamentally sound techniques for esti- mating cyclic notch strains using only elastic stress information and elastic-plastic axial material data. Neuber's rule has become the most widely utilized approach for engineering notch strain estimation. The original approach has undergone a wide variety of modifications for its use in cyclic loading and fatigue analyses. This paper reviews the origin of Neuber's rule and its develop- ment for use in fatigue design. The limitations of the approach are discussed, along with the recent efforts by several researchers to overcome these restrictions. 1991 SAE Transactions Section 5 910166. The role of fatigue analysis in the vehicle test simula- tion laboratory. Gail E. Leese and Robert L. Mullin, MTS Sys- tems Corp. Simulation technology for use in full or partial vehicle testing was developed in the 1970s. It requires meticulous multiaxial control coupled with the playback of frequency compensated realtime data. Simulation testing provides a virtual reproduction of actual service data, typically within 2% accuracy of load ampli- tudes. Use of this technology in automotive development became widespread in the 1980s. Recent advances have made simulation practical even on the component level, complementing more tra- ditional testing techniques including simple playback, block load- ing and constant amplitude mechanical testing. As simulation technology has spread through the ground vehicle industiy, so has the use of fatigue technology as a tool for data evaluation. This paper discusses the role of fatigue analysis in simulation testing, as well as its use for integrating simulation with more con- ventional forms of durability testing frequently used for evalua- tion of individual components. 910167. Emergency braking test of the ice and snow tires on iced drum tester. Ken-ichi Shimizu and Mitsuya Nihei, Mech. Engrg. Lab., MITI. This paper describes a test method that evaluates the emer- gency braking capability of a tire on ice using an ice-covered drum tester. The value of the braking force is affected by the amount of crushed ice stuck to the tire. With a low rotation speed for the tire, this effect can be reduced. Utilizing this technique, braking force- velocity characteris- tics on ice at various temperatures are obtained. 910168. Estimation method of tire treadwear on a vehicle. Shingo Kohmura, Hideyuki Nakamura, Junsuke Komura, and Yutaka Tanaka, Toyota Motor Corp. Tire treadwear is very complication phenomenon that is influ- enced by various factors. Any quantitative treadwear estimating method applicable to tires on a vehicle has not yet been estab- lished. In this study the effects of acting force to the tire and tire attitude (dynamic wheel alignment) upon treadwear were made clear experimentally by taking notice of the fact that they are only the factors directly influencing tire treadwear provided that a tire and a road surface are determined. Furthermore, on the assump- tion that treadwear will increase linearly, an examination was made to find a method of estimating treadwear of tires on any vehicle in any running condition by using above-mentioned effects for the values of tire-acting force and dynamic wheel align- ment calculated from the vehicle particular and running condi- tions. The values obtained from this estimation method well coin- cide with results of tire treadwear tests on vehicles, giving confir- mation of the effectiveness of this method. 1991 SAE Transactions Section 6 910169. Reinforcing materials for more fuel efficient tires. R. M. Shellenbarger, G. N. Henning, R. L. Keefe, P. E. Rusek, and T. K. Venkatachalam, Du Pont Fibers. Both the current legislative trend proposing to mandate more fuel efficient automobiles and responsible corporate environ- mentalism require suppliers to develop materials that will enable both vehicle and component manufacturers to engineer lighter and/or more fuel efficient systems for all vehicles. One such sys- tem is the tire, where the reinforcing materials for the elastomer can have a significant effect on tire weight and rolling resistance. This paper reviews some of the materials now available for reinforcing tires and what impact these may have on the ability to design tires with potential to improve fuel efficiency. In partic- ular, it discusses aramid yarns and nylon monofilaments for tire reinforcement and their effect on tire weight and rolling resis- tance. Additionally, the use of short fiber aramids for blending with elastomers to directly modify bulk physical properties and increase design freedom while maintaining critical properties is covered. 910171. (SP-863) Motor vehicle pollution in Eastern Europe: A case study in Hungary. Michael P. Walsh, Consultant ; and Dr. Pollack, Dr. Szoboszial, and Dr. Meterei, Institute for Transport Sciences. The recent developments in Eastern Europe create many opportunities as well as challenges with regard to motor vehicle pollution. Using Hungary as an example, this paper shows that even with a relatively low per capita motor vehicle population compared to Western Europe, motor vehicle pollution problems are starting to emerge in Eastern Europe (on top of already severe stationary source pollution problems in many of these countries). Using Hungary as a prototype for several other countries, the pur- poses of this paper are to review the current motor vehicle air pol- lution situation in Eastern Europe, to describe the future which is likely to emerge if current trends continue and to summarize the potential impact of a variety of control options. 24</page><page sequence="24">910172-910177 910172. (SP-863) On-the-road durability and performance of TWC exhaust emission control under real Nordic driving condi- tions. JuhaniK. Laurikko , Technical Research Centre of Finland. The temperature regime of driving conditions in Nordic coun- tries is very wide. This may have some effect on the performance and durability of the emission control systems used in todays vehicles, because normally these are designed with a less rigorous environment in mind. This paper describes durability and cold- start performance results obtained with two current technology TWC-cars in a full 80,000 km's on-the-road test under realistic driving conditions in Finland. The temperature extremes during the 24-month test period ranged from -28° to +28°C. All vehicles were operated in day-to-day traffic as normal passenger cars with- out using any predetermined driving pattern. This practice is in contrast to the standardized durability run. The evaluation of long-term emissions performance showed a reasonable low deterioration over the test. However, at an early stage of the test one of the cars suffered from a mechanical failure in the converter unity leading to reduced performance. Rather than by cold environment, this failure was caused by a strong out- side impact breaking down the ceramic substrate, probably in off- road driving. After 80,000 knťs both vehicles needed a new oxy- gen sensor to bring their emissions within the legal conformity limits. In addition to the standardized tests, emissions were mea- sured in proprietary on-the-road cold-start tests. These showed quite high CO emissions. The main cause of this elevation was the heavy enrichment of the air-fuel mixture necessary in cold- start and warm-up operation. This enrichment disturbed the cor- rect composition of the exhaust gases and made the operation of a TWC converter impossible, because it normally works solely on the oxygen contained in the exhausts. Therefore, a further optim- ization of TWC systems for low ambient temperatures seems nec- essary. 910173. (SP-863) Spatially resolved effects of deactivation on field-aged automotive catalysts. Edward Jobson, Dept. of Applied Physics , AB Volvo; Erik Högberg and Kurt H. Weber ; Volvo Car Corp.; and Gudmund Smedler , Staffan Lundgren, Anders Romare , and Göran Wirmark , Dept. of Applied Physics , AB Volvo. Four samples from each of two field-aged catalysts subjected to different field test conditions were investigated. The light-off and conversion performance of each sample was measured in a synthetic exhaust flow reactor system. Time-resolved laser IR spectroscopy was used to investigate the catalyst behaviour under transient conditions. Significant differences in light-off temperatures and transient conversion performance between the samples was observed. The samples taken from the inlet side of the monolith were more deactivated than the corresponding ones from the outlet. How- ever, samples taken from peripheral positions always showed bet- ter performance than samples originating from the center. In order to explain observed variations in activity, the follow- ing surface properties were examined: oxygen uptake, specific metal area (CO chemisorption), total surface area (BET) and chemical composition (XPS analysis). It was concluded that ther- mal deactivation was mainly responsible for the difference between peripheral and central positions while the poisoning due to S, Pb and P had the largest effect on the inlet samples. The total conversion efficiency, as measured by FTP75 tests, was compared to the results from laboratory activity tests and catalyst characterization data. The mechanisms of aging and the effect on emissions were correlated to the laboratory results from this study. 1991 SAE Transactions Section 4 910174. (SP-863) The effect of catalyst aging on the composi- tion of gasoline engine hydrocarbon emissions. S. E. Andersson and A. Frestad , Svenska Emissionsteknik AB; and N. M. Demp- ster and P. R. Shore, Ricardo Consulting Engineers Ltd. Twenty-three hydrocarbons were measured in the exhaust gases from a Volvo passenger car fitted with a 2.3 litre gasoline engine. Measurements were made in the absence of a catalyst, and in the presence of a fresh and an aged three-way catalyst, with particular attention being paid to the emission of benzene and other light aromatic compounds. Loss of catalytic activity through aging led to an increase in hydrocarbons of ~200% from 0.22 to 0.62 g/mile. Loss of activ- ity was most evident for certain compounds notably alkanes (par- affins) although large increases in aromatic emissions were also apparent; catalytic control of ethyne (acetylene) was, however, completely maintained by the aged catalyst. Thus the work reported here demonstrates the selective manner in which a cata- lyst operates depending upon the chemical structure of hydrocar- bons, and how this influences catalyst performance loss via aging. 1 991 SAE Transactions Section 4 910175. (SP-863) The effect of high temperature aging on plat- inum-rhodium and palladium-rhodium three way catalyst. R. J. Brisley, R. D. O 'Sullivan, and A. J. J. Wilkins, Johnson Matthey Catalytic Systems Div. The durability of platinum-rhodium and palladium-rhodium three way catalysts has been investigated after aging at elevated temperatures. Catalyst were subjected to inlet temperatures of between 780 and 960°C for periods up to 100 hours on an engine bench. It may be concluded that platinum-rhodium catalysts have a better resistance to aging at catalyst inlet temperatures above 840°C than palladium-rhodium catalysts at the same load- ing. A new formulation palladium-rhodium catalyst loaded at 60 g/ft3 and a ratio of 9:1 showed substantially improved high tem- perature durability. 910176. (SP-863) How to keep "clean" cars clean - Government policy in the Netherlands. S. W. JosephusJitta, Min- istry of Housing, Physical Planning and Environment; and R. C. Rijkeboer, TNO Road Vehicles Research Institute. In the Netherlands a lifetime requirement entered into force since July 1, 1990, in combination with a recall regulation. Both are dealing with automotive emissions. Three parties play a role: the car manufacturer, the owner/ operator of the car and the garage. This paper deals with the sur- veillance program, commisioned to TNO by the Ministery of Environment of the Netherlands. In this program is checked whether the car manufacturer has done his job - delivering cars meeting the lifetime requirement and thus meeting the in use compliance standards. A report is given of the experience so far and an insight to the system. 910177. Flow and combustion in a hydra direct-injection diesel engine. C. Arcoumanis, A. Hadjiapostolou, and J. H. Whitelaw, Dept. of Mech. Engrg., Imperial College of Science, Technology and Medicine. Measurements of flow, spray, combustion and performance characteristics are reported for a Hydra direct-injection diesel, based on the Ford 2.5 L, engine and equipped with a variable- swirl port, a unit fuel injector and optical access through the liner and piston. The results provide links between the pre-combustion and combustion flow and, at the same time, between purpose- built single-cylinder optical engines and multicylinder produc- tion engines of nearly identical combustion chamber geometry. In particular, the spray penetration was found to depend on engine speed, rather than load, with velocities up to around 260 m/s at atmospheric pressure and temperature which are reduced by a factor of 2.5 under operating conditions and seem to be unaf- 25</page><page sequence="25">910177-910183 fected by swirl. The duration of combustion was reduced with increasing swirl and ignition delay increased linearly with engine speed. The torque was almost 40% less than in the Ford engine with increased particulate emissions as a consequence of higher frictional losses and the unrealistic flat base of the piston bowl. 910178. LDV characterization of air entrainment in transient diesel sprays. Gianpietro E. C ossali, Politecnico di Milano; Gianni Brunello , CNPM -CNR; and Aldo Coghe, Politecnico di Milano. The air entrainment in a transient non-evaporating diesel spray was studied using laser doppler velocimetry, to provide information on the mixing properties in the near-field region extending to 160 nozzle diameters (40 mm). The spray was injected into confined quiescent air at ambient pressure and tem- perature. The air velocity component normal to a cylindrical sur- face surrounding the spray was measured during the entire injec- tion period, allowing the instantaneous air mass flow rate and the entrainment rates to be evaluated as a function of time. Two injection conditions were examined and their influence on the entrainment quantified. In the near field zone investigated, the air entrainment in transient liquid jets appears to be lower than that in steady gaseous jets, but larger than that in steady liquid jets. 1991 SAE Transactions Section 3 910179. Comparisons of measured drop sizes and velocities in a transient fuel spray with stability criteria and computed PDFs. Ja-Ye Koo and Jay K. Martin , University of Wisconsin-Madison. Two sets of comparisons were made in an attempt to provide a mechanism for understanding the behavior of transient sprays. Fisrt, detailed measurements of drop size and velocity in a tran- sient spray were compared to established stability criteria for dif- ferent droplet breakup mechanisms, specifically criteria for bag breakup and boundary layer stripping. Then, probability-density- functions were determined from the experimental data and com- pared, where appropriate, to different computer distributions (such as the chi-square or log-hyperbolic distributions). Comparison with the stability criteria indicates that the majority of droplets in the spray are susceptible to both breakup mechanisms near the injector tip. However, downstream, the spray appears to stabilize and any redistribution of droplet size must apparently be a result of collisions. The experimentally-determined PDF's for size and velocity are functions of both position and time in the spray. Compari- sons with computed PDF's show best agreement with the data for the multiparameter-dependent distributions, such as the chi- square or log-hyperbolic distributions. 1991 SAE Transactions Section 3 910180. A study of diesel cold starting using both cycle analy- sis and multidimensional calculations. Manuel A. Gonzalez, Intevep SA. Venezuela; and Gary L. Borman and Rolf D. Reitz, University of Wisconsin-Madison. The physical in-cylinder processes and ignition during cold starting have been studied using computational models, with par- ticular attention to the influences of blowby, heat transfer during the compression stroke, spray development, vaporization and fuel/air mixture formation and ignition. Two different modeling approaches were used. A thermodynamic zero dimensional cycle analysis program in which the fuel injection effects were not mod- eled, was used to determine overall and gas exchange effects. The three-dimensional KIVA-II code was used to determine details of the closed cycle events, with modified atomization, blowby and spray /wall impingement models, and a simplified model for ignition. The calculations were used to obtain an understanding of the cold starting process and to identify practical methods for improving cold starting of direct injection diesel engines. It was found that, blowby gas flow represents an important source of reductions for the cylinder gas temperature at lower cranking speeds, opposing the squish flow. Overfueling and advanced injection increase the amount of fuel evaporated. The spray intact core is extended at low temperatures, spray wall impinge- ment phenomena are characteristized by low impact velocities and the bouncing of liquid drops enhances the limited fuel-air mixture formation. Failure to achieve successful ignition at low initial air temperatures was predicted by the simple kinetics model. 1991 SAE Transactions Section 3 910181. The propagation of fuel sprays in a research diesel engine - A joint numerical and experimental analysis. B. Ahmadi-Befrui, B. Wiesler, and E. Winklhofer, Fluid Dynamics Research Dept., AVL List GmbH. A program of development and experimental validation of a multidimensional spray prediction method, based on the discrete droplet model, has been broadened to include computational investigations of the effects of random perturbations of the injec- tion velocity on the spray characteristics, and further detailed examination of the spray structure and development. The results demonstrate strong dependence of the predicted spray penetra- tion length on the precise start-of-injection time and injection velocity data, and relative insensitivity to subsequent variations of the injection velocity. Specifically, it is found that under impo- sition of random variations of the injection velocity, the varia- tion of the spray-tip penetration and velocity remain smooth, bearing no correspondence to the instantaneous spray injection velocity. The detailed computational investigation of the spray structure and development provides insight into the complex relationship between the penetration length and injection veloc- ity, and highlights the significant influence of spray-front dilution on its detection accuracy, and the discrepancy with predictions at large spray penetration lengths. The novel adoption of a line- of-sight integral-liquid-density criterion for identification of the spray front in the calculations is shown to yield marked improve- ment of the apparent predictive accuracy. 1991 SAE Transactions Section 3 910182. Advanced in-line pump for medium-duty diesel engines to meet future emissions regulations. Shohei Itoh, Shinobu Sasaki, and Kazuyoshi Arai, Nippondenso Co., Ltd. This paper describes the Nippondenso in-line pump system designed for U.S. 1991 emissions regulation for medium duty diesel engines. With the combined use of the further improved in-line pump, NB-S and the multi-hole nozzle with a smaller ori- fice diameter, the required injection pressure of 100 MPa to 120 M Pa at the nozzle can be achieved. However, some problems to be resolved exist in the subject fuel injection system: 1) secondary injection; 2) cavitation erosion of injection pipe; 3) higher pres- sure sealing of fuel; and 4) undesirable fuel delivery curve versus pump speed (called "trumpet shape" fuel delivery curve). Thus technical measures to cope with those problems are explained in details. 1991 SAE Transactions Section 3 910183. Fuel injectors in diesels with large needle-barrel clear- ance. A. H . Bawady and Morgan Abdul Aziz, Ain Shams Univ.; and A. E. F. Hassaneen, Suez Canal Authority. An attempt to operate a diesel engine using the so-called hydraulic fuel injector with large clearance between the needle and its barrel was carried out experimentally. In this type of injec- tors, the spring force was substituted by a pressurized hydraulic oil to control the needle motion. Various factors affecting the injection system, for both hydraulically and spring loaded injec- tors, were also theoretically simulated and tested. The present study confirmed, according to both the experi- mental and theoretical results, that the use of hydraulic closer of needles is a promising technique to overcome the problem of die- sel engine operation with large needled clearance (7 times the standard). To maintain the best specific fuel consumption by the 26</page><page sequence="26">910183-910192 engine, the injection timing has to be readjusted in accordance with the increase in the needle clearance. For example, for pintle nozzle (PIII6-2X25), as the clearance increased from 3 to 23^m the injection timing had to be retarded from 24° to 16° B.T.D.C. in order to maintain the optimim fuel consumption by the engine. 910184. Application of a high flexible electronic injection sys- tem to a heavy duty diesel engine. Roland Racine , Marc Miettaux , Yves D rutel, and James Heidt , Renault Véhicules Industriels. Future strict emission standards such as US 94 and EEC 96 for heavy duty diesel engines require injection systems more and more flexible. They have to be able to electronically control fuel- ing, timing, and injection pressure as independent parameters. To be optimal this fuel injection equipment (F.I.E.) must be able to allow injection rate flexibility, separated pilot injection and cylinder cut-off. The F.I.E. from Nippondenso designated ECD-U2 offers all these characteristics. This paper deals with the installation and the application of this F.I.E. to a "Renault Véhicules Industriels" (R.V.I.) turbocharged and intercooled engine such as the MIDR 06.20.45 engine. Using the flexibility of ECD-U2, the US 91 emission targets for NOx and particulates were easily achieved with good fuel economy and the US 94 legislative standard was approached with limited development. The potential for further improvement in order to achieve the strictest emission standards looking beyond 1994 is also discussed in this paper. 910185. Contribution of optimum nozzle design to injection rate control. Masahiro O kaj im a, Masaaki Kato , Hiroyuki Kano, Shigeki Tojo , and Makoto Kat agiri, Nippondenso Co., Ltd. The purpose of this paper is to discuss injection rate control of the nozzle for direct injection engines. This paper will focus on fuel flow analysis of the nozzle, a key component of fuel injection systems (FIS). The optimum designed nozzle improves fuel flow efficiency and controls injection rate. To meet emission regulations in 1990's, FIS are required to produce higher injection pressure and injection rate control which creates better fuel spray atomization and higher utilization of air. But the higher injection pressure makes injection rate con- trol difficult. In particular, injection rate control by needle lift traveling control is difficult because fuel flow characteristics in the nozzle change with injection pressure and needle lift. Further- more, the forced control of needle lift results in poor fuel spray atomization. To control injection rate with good fuel spray atomization under high injection pressure, we analyzed the fuel flow charac- teristics and calculated them by using a computer model simula- tion. We designed the optimum nozzle configuration by utilizing these methods and confirmed their effects through experiments. 1991 SAE Transactions Section 3 910186. A study on dynamic parameters of fuel injection pump. Zhang Limei, Qiao Xinqi, Cheng Yong, and Wu Bo, Shandong Polytechnic Univ. The authors measured and studied rack displacement pattern and injection advance angle of fuel pump on 6130Q diesel engine at both steady and speed change conditions. By means of injection pattern and indicator diagrams actually measured at the same time, this paper deals with the important roles of fluctuation of rack displacement and injection advance angle at steady condition and their dynamic response to operat- ing stability, accelerability and combustion process of the diesel engine. 910190. Environmental monitoring technologies. David B. Chang, Brian M. Pierce, and I-Fu Shih, Hughes Environmental Systems, Inc. Six defense-related technologies that appear to have applica- tion to environmental monitoring are reviewed. Thermal imag- ing of the sort used in heat seeking missiles provides a means of rapidly surveying an area for possible presence of pollutants. A compact wedge filter spectrometer can be used to remotely deter- mine the spatial distribution of classes of pollutants, while a Fou- rier transform infrared (FTIR) spectrometer has been shown to identify specific pollutants at distances of seven kilometers. A remote active spectrometer using tunable carbon dioxide (CO2) lasers has been shown to give accurate results at 3.5 kilometers; this capability can be extended to the near IR region by using upconversion lasers. A fiber optic evanescent wave liquid level sensor is described that may find application as a leak detector for underground storage tanks. 1991 SAE Transactions Section S 910191. Analysis and development of a real-time control meth- odology in resistance spot welding. Chon L. Tsai, Weng L. Dai, and David W. Dickinson, Ohio State Univ. The single-parameter, in-process monitor and automatic con- trol systems for the resistance spot welding process have been studied by many investigators. Some of these have already been commercialized and used by sheet metal fabricators. These con- trol systems operate primarily on one of the three process param- eters: maximum voltage or voltage drop, dynamic resistance, or thermal expansion between electrodes during nugget formation. Control systems based on voltage or dynamic resistance have been successfully implemented for industrial applications. A great amount of experience on these two control methods has been accumulated through trial-and-error approaches. The expansion-based control system is not commonly utilized due to lack of experience and understanding of the process. Since the expansion displacement between electrodes during welding responds directly to the weld nugget formation, this con- trol parameter provides a better means to produce more precise spot welds. However, the control algorithm of this method is more complex than that for the other two methods. Fruitful development of a such system cannot be obtained by trial-and- error approaches. This paper presents a systematic approach to develop the expansion-based control algorithm for resistance spot welding. The finite element method was used to simulate the welding pro- cess and to determine the physical response of the joint material to the various welding conditions. Direct correlations between nugget formation and expansion displacement between elec- trodes were obtained. By systematic computer simulations, the weldability charac- teristic curves for resistance spot welding were developed. These weldability curves show inadequate welding conditions which would cause nugget expulsion and current shunting. A welding duration curve, which shows appropriate time for squeeze, weld, and hold cycles, was developed and used as a basis for in-process resistance spot welding control. 1991 SAE Transactions Section 5 910192. Resistance spot weldability and electrode wear mecha- nisms of ZnNi EG® sheet steel. Peter Howe, Bethlehem Steel Corp. This study, conducted on a range of coating weights and sub- strate thicknesses, shows that ZnNi EG® DQSK sheet has excel- lent resistance spot weldability. Electrode life is excellent for all coating weights and substrate thicknesses studied, with most tests having to be terminated without failure at 10,000 welds. Current range for these materials was found to be typical for coated sheet in this thickness range. Analyses of electrode wear rates show that coating weight does not affect wear, but that electrode wear is affected by substrate thickness, the thinnest substrate producing the highest wear rates. An examination of the electrode wear mechanisms which influence the excellent electrode endurance revealed that a unique dual layer of alloys is formed on the elec- 27</page><page sequence="27">910192-910197 trode face when welding ZnNi-coated sheet. These alloy layers appear to greatly inhibit electrode-face erosion and extend elec- trode life. 1991 SAE Transactions Section S 910193. Temperature measurements during flash welding thin-walled door-frame components. Jerry E. Gould and Timothy Stotler , Edison Welding Institute. This study was conducted to examine the effect of flashing conditions on the resulting temperature profile during flash weld- ing automobile door frames. Previous work on temperature pro- files of flash welds has shown that at some point in the welding cycle a steady state temperature is reached, minimizing the need for further flashing. The indication of such a minimum flashing time allows flashing conditions for any application to be opti- mized. Unfortunately, previous work has been limited to rather heavy section materials, and the results could not be directly applied to the flash welding thin sections typical for door frames. This program was a preliminary study to examine the effects of initial flashing velocity and flashing acceleration on the result- ing temperature profiles in U-shaped channel sections. Work was done on a cam driven flash welding machine supplied. Flashing conditions were varied by using cams with different profiles. The first cam was a linear cam typical of that used for production of this part. In addition, three new cams were prepared. These included a cam with a linear flashing profile using twice the initial flashing velocity of the production cam, and two cams with para- bolic flashing profiles. Both parabolic cams profiles used half the initial flashing velocity of the original cam. All cams used roughly the same flashing time, resulting in different degrees of burn-off. Temperature measurements were made by locating thermo- couples at increasing distances from the original interface. During welding, temperature was recorded from these thermocouples as temperature versus time data. For each set of flashing conditions, separate experiments were run to characterize temperature pro- files on the three sides of the channel section. Resulting tempera- ture versus time data was then transformed to temperature versus distance from the flashing interface data. This data was curve fit to an exponential expression, and the results of that curve fit used to calculate effective forge depth of the workpiece. The results of this program show that the parabolic cams reach steady state temperature faster than the linear cam, and are con- sistent with the published literature on heavier section flash weld- ing. However, it was also noted that excessive flashing velocities (as a result of either a high initial flashing velocity or too high a flashing acceleration) tended to overheat the part. Higher flashing velocities result increase the rate of heat generation during flash welding. It is belived that the relatively long stick-out lengths used in this application, and the relatively poor conductivity of the dies prevented heat from being extracted at a sufficient rate to maintain a stable temperature profile. Apparently, heat genera- tion needs to be balanced between that necessary to achieve sta- ble temperature conditions in a reasonable time, while not over- heating the workpiece. 910194. Vibration damping steel sheet for resistance spot welding. Yasunori Mats uda, Makoto Kabasawa, Yasushi Fujii, and Yukichi Watanabe, NOK Corp. Weldable vibration damping steel sheet consists of two skin steel sheets and viscoelastic resin film that contains filler metal powder to get electric conductivity. In this study, it is investigated the effect of filler powder (type, size and content) on weld defects. The defects are observed when the resin layer is thick compar- ing with the powder diameter or the content of metal powder is insufficient. The defect with bare skin sheets which is spherical hole is caused by joule overheating. Another defect is observed when Zn-Fe coated skin sheets are used. According to the observation of welding current and voltage wave forms, it is formed by an arc electric discharge between metal powder and skin sheet, which is caused by cutting off current paths due to the evaporation of Zn-Fe coated layer. Based on these results, it is determined the suitable filler pow- der to produce VDSS with good weldability. 910195. Resistance seam weldability of polymer-coated steel sheet. Y. Adonyi, Div. of USX Corp., USS ; M. Kimchi, Edison Welding Institute; and O. McKinney, Dow Plastics USA, Polyole- fins and Elastometers, Technical Service and Develop. Methanol represents one of the most attractive alternative fuels intended to replace gasoline, but it is corrosive to the terne- coated steel sheet traditionally used for automobile fuel compo- nents. Application of a methanol-resistant polymer coating on a steel substrate was found to be a viable solution for methanol- resistant fuel tanks. One-sided electrogalvanized sheet was coated on the bare side with a nonconductive and adhesive thermoplas- tic. The present work studied the weldability of this sheet with the thermoplastic at the faying interface. A systematic parametric study was performed. Welds were evaluated using a set of criteria based on the joint integrity and corrosion resistance. It was found that the coating melted and resolidified in a continuous film adja- cent to the welds. The resistance seam-welding operational enve- lopes were shifted toward lower welding travel speeds and weld- ing currents. It was concluded that the polymer-coated steel sheet can be welded without significant changes in welding equipment and parameters presently used in manufacturing fuel tanks. 1991 SAE Transactions Section S 910196. Physical mechanisms for the local heat transfer enhancement caused by fin-like obstacles in heat exchanger flow passages. Suresh V. Garimella, Dept. of Mech. Engrg., University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee. Experiments were performed to determine the physical mech- anisms for the local heat transfer enhancement caused by short fins of square planform cross section, mounted on one wall of a rectangular water channel. Local heat transfer coefficients and pressure drops were measured in an array of thirty fins. In-line as well as staggered arrays were investigated. The geometry of the individual fins was held constant, while the spacing between fins, the height of the flow channel, and the Reynolds number of the flow were varied, and their effect on heat transfer enhancement determined. Flow visualization was performed using laser sheet- illuminated hydrogen bubbles, and velocity measurements were obtained using laser-doppler velocimetry. The hydrodynamic mechanisms that enhance mixing in the flow, and hence heat transfer from the fins, were identified. Separation and reattach- ment of the flow, interactions between the wakes generated by the fins, and horseshoe vortices formed at the upstream faces of fins were investigated. Reynolds numbers for the onset of transition in the complex three-dimensional flow through the array of fins were determined. 1991 SAE Transactions Section 5 910197. Heat transfer and friction characteristics of turbulator radiator tubes. Paul Farrell, Kevin Wert, and Ralph Webb, Dept. of Mech. Engrg., Pennsylvania State Univ. This study examines the friction and heat transfer characteris- tics of water flow in internally roughened rectangular ducts. The low aspect ratio ducts have two or three-dimensional roughness formed into the two wide dimensions of the tube wall. The ducts considered are representative of turbulator tube geometries used in low flow automotive heat radiators. Isothermal friction data were taken for Reynolds numbers, based on hydraulic diameter, in the range 200 to 11,000. The fric- tion factor was measured for six rough tubes and a smooth tube. Heat transfer data were taken for one smooth and three rough tubes. Data were taken for Reynolds numbers between 3,000 and 10,000. A modified Wilson plot technique was used to reduce the heat transfer data. The heat transfer and friction characteristics 28</page><page sequence="28">910197-910207 of the turbulator tubes are compared to those of standard, plain tubes. 1991 SAE Transactions Section 5 910198. A mechanically bonded AKG-ML 3-aluminum radia- tor as a direct replacement for brazed units. D. Pietzcker and E. Fuhrmann , Autokühler Gesellschaft mbH and Co. KG. A new mechanically bonded aluminum automotive radiator, designated AKG-ML 3 featuring extruded extremely flat oval tubes has been developed that achieves performance levels com- parable with those of ordinary brazed radiators but at a more favorable price. Also, when compared with the old mechanically assembled radiator with round tubes, the AKG-ML 3 has substantially higher heat transfer performance. The need for more efficient radiators means that the potential danger to the environment is increased substantially since the majority of more efficient radia- tors are of the brazed deisgn. The low-cost mechanically bonded AKG-ML 3 certainly appears to be a way out of this dilemma. 1 991 SAE Transactions Section S 910200. Three-dimensional simulations of automotive cata- lytic converter internal flow. M. C. Lai and J. Y. Kim , Mech. Engrg. Dept., Wayne State Univ.; C. Y. Cheng t Pall Corp.; and P. Li, G. Chui, and J. D. Pakko, Ford Motor Co. The three-dimensional non-reacting flow field inside a typical dual-monolith automotive catalytic converter was simulated using finite difference analysis. The monolithic brick resistance was formulated from the pressure gradient of fully developed laminar duct-flow and corrected for the entrance effect. This cor- relation was found to agree with experimental pressure drop data, and was introduced as an additional source term into the non- dimensional momentum governing equation within the brick. Flow distribution within the monolith was found to depend strongly on the diffuser performance, which is a complex func- tion of flow Reynolds number, brick resistance, and inlet pipe length and bending angles. A distribution index was formulated to quantify the degree of non-uniformity at selected test cases covering ranges of flow conditions, brick types, and inlet condi- tions. In general, flow distribution inside the brick is found to be more uniform with smaller Reynolds number, and larger brick resistance, with a straight inlet pipe than a bent one, and with a shorter pipe rather than a longer one. 1991 SAE Transactions Section 5 910201. Combined air-oil cooling of the cylinder with oil chan- nel. Miran Zgonik, TGN; Frančisek Bizjan, Faculty of Mech. Engrg.; Rihard Vičič, TGN; Ferdinand Trenc, Faculty of Mech. Engrg.; and Valter Volf, TAM. The problem of a combined air-oil cooled cylinder in an air cooled motor is discussed in this paper. This method has been selected due to unequal thermal load on the upper cylinder part. The data of previous research on oil cooling show that in spite of local overheating, oil is neither foaming nor aging. In spite of oil viscosity, heat transfer is sufficient. With increased load -with higher temperature of cooled surfaces, the heat transfer is increas- ing due to two influences: increased temperature difference and better convective conditions at lower oil viscosity. The consequence is a satisfactory self-regulating effect on the cooling system; where there is locally increased heat load, the effi- ciency of cooling is increased too. The experimental system is described and the results of the experiments on air cooled cylinders with oil channel are given. It is characteristic of the oil flow in the channel that it is within the range of forced laminar and forced turbulent flow. The experimentally established function Nu = f(Re,Gr,Pr) which can be used in cases of combined cooling on the actual motor is stated. 910202. Using a mathematical flange distortion model and expert system to optimize gasket material selection. Brian C. Lehr and Mark A. Moser, Armstrong World Industries, Inc. An expert system called GMX: The Gasket Material Selection Expert was presented at the 1989 SAE Conference. The capabili- ties of this program have since been increased tremendously by the development of a mathematical model which predicts physi- cal flange distortion and gasket compression values for any bolted, gasketed flange configuration. The expert system contains the logic (rules) and facts (databases) needed to compare gasket material properties to application-specific requirements and to specify gasket materials that will perform best in the application. The flange distortion model is used by the expert system to calcu- late certain quantities that are needed to compare materials for the application. This paper describes how material properties and gasket engineering are used to make a material recommendation, and how an expert system and mathematical model have been utilized to make this expertise available to the gasket specifiers. 1991 SAE Transactions Section 3 910204. Advanced high-temperature test methods for gasket materials. Robert A. Mercuri, Ronald A. Howard, and Joseph T. McGlamery, UCAR Carbon Co. Inc. Equipment and techniques for evaluating the stability, creep, and sealability of gasket facing materials at high temperatures are presented. Mathematical models for predicting long-term failure of elastomer-bonded gaskets from short-term high-temperature tests were used. The value of differential thermal analyses and differential scanning calorimetry in the ranking of facing compo- sitions and alternatives to engine testing to establish confidence in screening gasketing materials are the projects presented. 910205. A new technique to measure real time static and dynamic gasket stresses. Daniel E. Czernik and Frank L. Misz- czak, F el-Pro Inc. A new computerized method using a thin, flexible sensor to measure stress distribution during loading and unloading of gas- kets is disclosed. Stress measurement is achieved by a change in the sensor's electrical resistance as a function of load. Each sensor has many electrical pressure responsive contact points that give a map of stress. The unloading of a gasket due to hydrostatic end forces, thermal motions, and external loads can be observed and measured without modifying the flange environment. Use of this new technology permits better and faster gasket and flange design optimization. Monitoring of gasket stress during unit operation is also possible in some cases. The system uses a personal computer operating specially developed graphics software. It provides visual two and three dimensional dynamic stress distribution representations as well as total compressive force, on the sensor, in real time. 1991 SAE Transactions Section 3 910206. Factors affecting the formulation of non-asbestos gas- ket materials. Randall J. Rogers, Richard P. Foster, and Kimberly L. Was tier, Hollingsworth and Vose Co. A brief description of the differences between asbestos and non-asbestos formulations of sheet materials used in gaskets are discussed. The beater addition process for the manufacture of non-asbestos formulations is described. Various test methods used to test non-asbestos gasket materials are cited. The use of designed experiments to solve problems involving the formula- tion of sheet materials is discussed. A specific problem and its solution are presented as a case history. In general it is found that the flexibility of the beater addition process is suitable for many gasketing applications. 910207. Application of finite element analysis to the curving or sweeping of roll formed sections for vehicle body structures. C. M. Ni, General Motors Research Labs.; D. A. Gatny, General Motors Advanced Engrg. Staff; and A. Rahman, Inetec. 29</page><page sequence="29">910207-910216 Controlling or reducing the amount of cross sectional distor- tion is of primary concern in sweepings of roll formed sections. Many sections could be used in production with an acceptable amount of distortion, provided the designer could account for this distortion early in the design. A design analysis technique based on a finite element model has been developed to predict the distortion and fracture during the sweeping of roll formed sec- tions. A nonlinear finite element program, ABAQUS, is used to calculate elastic -plastic deformation of a section subjected to bending. Several generic sections have been modeled. The corre- lation between the calculated results and experimental measure- ments in distortion of two different cross sections is quite reason- able. This design analysis technique is an effective tool to predict the sectional distortion and fracture during the sweeping of roll formed sections of any arbitrary shape. It can be applied to sweeping with or without mandrel support. 910208. Reduction of vehicle interior noise using structural- acoustic sensitivity analysis methods. Ichiro Hagiwara and Zheng-Dong Ma, Vehicle Research Lab., Central Engrg. Labs., Nissan Motor Co., Ltd.; and Akira Arai and Kazuo Nagabuchi, Product Development Systems Dept., Nissan Motor Co. Ltd. Since interior noise has a strong effect on vehicle salability, it is particularly important to be able to estimate noise levels accu- rately by means of simulation at the design stage. The use of sen- sitivity analysis makes it easy to determine how the analytical model should be modified or the structure optimized for the pur- pose of reducting vibration and noise of the structural-acoustic systems. The present work focused on a structural-acoustic coupling problem. As the coefficient matrices of a coupled structural- acoustic system are not symmetrical, the conventional orthogo- nality conditions obtained in structural dynamics generally do not hold true for the coupled system. To overcome this problem, the orthogonality and normalization conditions of a coupled sys- tem were derived by us. In this paper, our sensitivity analysis methods are applied to an interior noise problem of a cabin model. It will be shown how a sensitivity analysis process is per- formed, and how vibration and noise can be reduced. 1991 SAE Transactions Section 6 910209. Computer-aided program analysis system (CAPAS). Hiromi Uchimaru, Minoru Takahashi, Hirotoshi Tonou, and Hisanori Yasugi, Fujitsu Ten Ltd. The increased use of microcomputers in electronic controllers for automobiles has caused and increase in control program design work. Such factors an pollution regulations have made more comprehensive control mechanism necessary, and attached greater importance to safety. These, in turn, have contributed to the program designer's work load. The computer-aided program analysis system (CAPAS) we developed analyzes instructions in a program designed in assem- bler, and presents them in an easy-to-understand form. Unlike a flowchart generator, CAPAS determines the branching condi- tions and data to be stored in memory, and generates flowcharts and their explanations. CAPAS enables designers with little expe- rience to understand program functions. It also enables programs to be reused or developed by more than one designer without causing that part of the program for which a designer is not responsible to become a black box. CAPAS is expected to reduce debugging time and improve program quality. This report presents the basic principles of CAPAS and tells how it is applied to program module design. 910210. Applying variation simulation analysis to 2-D prob- lems. Anthony G. Sitko, Applied Computer Solutions, Inc. Variation simulation analysis is a technology that has achieved broad popularity in the automobile, appliance, electri- cal machinery and other industries as a method of predicting and analyzing manufacturing variation due to tolerances of individ- ual components and assembly operations. The technology is widely considered to be the only method to accurately analyze three dimensional variation problems. Recently, a substantial body of work has been developed which indicates that variation simulation analysis can provide major advantages over traditional methods even on two dimen- sional problems. Variation simulation analysis uses the Monte Carlo method to accurately simulate the effects of each individual tolerance dis- tribution and complex relationships between individual toler- ances can be defined. This article will go on to provide several examples of the variation simulation analysis method as applied to two dimensional parts and compare the results to traditional methods to demonstrate the accuracy improvements which can be achieved. 910212. Concept development through teamwork- Working for quality, cost, weight and investment. Roberti. Dika and Ray L. Begley, Chrysler Corp. This paper presents a method for developing a product design and manufacturing process concept, before project final approval, which integrates several other methodologies and uses cross-functional teams. It is a method for completing a "paper" study which quickly considers many of the downstream steps of product development, which will be conducted in greater detail later. It results in a selection of the best design and process for the overall product application and supports this selection with sound numerical targets for quality, cost, weight, investment and process capability. 1991 SAE Transactions Section 6 910213. Dynamic analysis of a variable displacement compres- sor for vehicle air conditioners using finite element methods. Nobuhiro Hanu and Kenji Nakayama, Zexel Corp.; and William R. Hill, Zexel Illinois, Inc. Today, time available for production development is shorter and good quality development is required. Using the finite ele- ment method is a mean of meeting this requirement. This method of analysis is very adaptable to many fields and can pre- dict static stress, strength, endurance, resonance, dynamic stress, thermal conductivity, convection, radiation, the optimum design, sound, fluid behaviour, and electromagnetics in a short period. Furthermore, finite element methods are becoming more practical because of increased speed by computer vector opera- tions and the main memory expansion of computers. This paper outlines an analytical model for studying vibration characteristics including amplitude, modal shapes and stress while a variable displacement compressor is operating. Finite ele- ment analysis reveals the dynamic behavior of the mounts and body of this compressor. This dynamic behavior analysis is based on the shaft bearing load which is subjected to unsteady forces, calculated beforehand by dynamic behavior simulation. Based on these loads, eigenvalues and frequency responses, transient dynamic analysis is conducted using simultaneous inverse itera- tion and the householder/QR methods. 1991 SAE Transactions Section 6 910216. An experimental and computational study of cooling in a simplified GM-10 passenger compartment. Chao-Hsin Lin and Michael A. Lelli, Chevrolet-Pontiac-C añada Group, General Motors Corp.; Taeyoung Han, Engrg. Mechs. Dept., General Motors Research Labs.; Robert J. Niemiec, Chevrolet-Pontiac- Canada Group, General Motors Corp.; and Dean C. Hammond, Jr., Engrg. Mechs. Dept., General Motors Research Labs. Three-dimensional flow and temperature distributions in a passenger compartment are very important for evaluating pas- senger comfort and improving A/C system design. In the present study, the Reynolds-averaged Navier-Stokes equations and the energy transport equation were solved, both both quasi-steady 30</page><page sequence="30">910216-910225 and full transient approaches, to simulate a passenger compart- ment cooling process. By comparing the predictions with experi- mental results for a simplified GM-10 passenger compartment, the accuracy of the simulation was assessed. Throughout the 800- second period, good agreement was observed between the mea- sured breath-level air temperatures and the prediction of the tran- sient simulation. The quasi-steady simulation underpredicted air temperatures at the very early stage of the cooling process. How- ever, after 200 seconds of cool down, the quasi-steady simulation predicted air temperatures equally as well as the full transient simulation. The current approaches have demonstrated their applicability and accuracy to passenger compartment cooling simulation. Beyond the current application, this simulation methodology may also be used for passenger compartment heating analyses, providing critical parameters and guidelines for passenger com- fort assessment and evaluating of the effectivness of the HVAC system designs. 910218. Performance evaluation of an automotive air condi- tioner with expansion valve control using CFC-12 and HFC-134a refrigerants. Refki El-Bourini, Calsonic Technical Center ; and Tsunenari Adachi and Katsuichiro Tajima, Calsonic Corp. Re-design of the thermostatic expansion valve (TXV) was necessary for the efficient use of HFC-134a refrigerant in mobile air conditioning applications. Laboratory work demonstrated the need for changing both valve characteristics and inside design. The use of the new expansion valve resulted in low HFC-134a system discharge pressures with either the serpentine or "propri- etary" multiflow condensers. Vehicular wind tunnel and road tests both showed the HFC-134a A/C system to have better cool- ing performance and similar discharge pressures at less refriger- ant charge than the conventional CFC-12 system, when using the new expansion valve and multiflow condenser. 1991 SAE Transactions Section 6 910219. Solar simulation for automotive HVAC climatic test cell applications. Benedict K. Smith , Dwayne M. Carr, and Ernesto J. Gutierrez , Harrison Div., General Motors Corp.; and William J. Putman, DSET Labs., Inc. The ability to simulate radiant solar energy for automotive applications allows the evaluation of various glass coatings and tints pertaining to vehicle A/C performance. This paper covers the selection and application of CSI metal halide lamps for truer simulation of solar radiation as it applies for use in automotive climatic test cells. The criterion and technology used to maximize even distribution of solar irradiance over the body of the vehicle is also discussed. 910222. Real time oil concentration measurement in automo- tive air conditioning by ultraviolet light absorption. Kiyoharu Kut- suna, Yoshimitsu Inoue, and Takehito Mizutani, Nippondenso Co., Ltd.; and Eiichi Sudo, and Toshimi Araga, Toyota Central R&amp;D Labs., Inc. A method of real time oil concentration measurement has been developed utilizing the effect of ultraviolet light absorption by lubricating oil in the liquid refrigerant line of an automotive air conditioning system. The light wavelengths from 200nm to 370nm are selected based on the ultraviolet light absorption sen- sitivity of the oils and refrigerants (CFC12, HFC134a). The effects of temperature, pressure and contaminantion on the absorbance of light are investigated in order to determine how these parameters affect the concentration measurement. The den- sity changes of refrigerants are then compensated in the calcula- tion for the oil concentration. The uncertainties of the overall concentration measurement are less than ±0.1 weight percent at 1 weight percent concentration. A transient oil circulation of the automotive air conditioner is measured by using this method. 1991 SAE Transactions Section 6 910223. 2-D soot visualization in unsteady spray flame by means of laser sheet scattering technique. Young-Ho Won, Tokyo Institute of Technology; Takeyuki Kamimoto, Dept. of Mech. Engrg., Tokyo Institute of Technology ; and Haruki Kobayashi and Hidenori Kosaka, Tokyo Institute of Technology. The two-dimensional distribution of a soot cloud in an unsteady spray flame in a rapid compression machine (RCM) was visualized using the laser sheet scattering technique. A 40 mm X 50 mm cross section on the flame axis was illuminated by a thin laser sheet from a single pulsed Nd:YAG laser (wavelength 532 nm). Scattered light from soot particles was taken by a CCD camera via a high speed gated image intensifier. The temporal variation of the scattered light images were presented with the injection pressure as a parameter. The results showed that scattered light was intense near the periphery of the flame tip and that the scattered light becomes weaker significantly and disappears fast after the end of injection as injection pressure is increased. This technique was also applied to the visualization of the two-dimensional distribution of liquid droplets in the nonevaporating spray to correlate it with the soot concentration distribution. 1991 SAE Transactions Section 3 910224. Soot distribution in a DI diesel engine using 2-D laser- induced incandescence imaging. John E. Dec, Sandia National Labs.; Axel O. zur Loye, Cummins Engine Co.; and Dennis L. Siebers, Sandia National Labs. Laser-induced incandescence (LII) has been explored as a diagnostic for qualitative two-dimensional imaging of the in- cylinder soot distribution in a diesel engine. Advantages of LII over elastic-scatter soot imaging techniques include no interfer- ing signals from liquid fuel droplets, easy rejection of laser light scattered by in-cylinder surfaces, and the signal intensity being proportional to the soot volume fraction. LII images were obtained in a 2.3-liter, single cylinder, direct-injection diesel engine, modified for optical access. To minimize laser sheet and signal attenuation (which can affect almost any planar imaging technique applied to diesel engine combustion), a low-sooting fuel was used whose vaporization and combustion characteristics are typical of standard diesel fuels. Temporal and spatial sequences of LII images were made which show the extent of the soot distribution within the optically accessible portion the com- busting spray plume. At all temporal and spatial locations stud- ied, soot is found throughout the observed cross-section of the plume and has a spatially continuous distribution. These soot distribution images provide new insight into where and when soot occurs in the diesel engine used for this study. 1991 SAE Transactions Section 3 910225. Fast burning and reduced soot formation via ultra- high pressure diesel fuel injection. Haruyuki Yokota, Hino Motors Co., Ltd.; Hidenori Kosaka, Tokyo Institute of Technol- ogy; Kinji Tsujimura, Advanced Combustion Engrg. Institute Co., Ltd.; and Takeyuki Kamimoto, Dept. of Mech. Engrg., Tokyo Institute of Technology. The relation between the characteristics of a non-evaporating spray and those of a corresponding frame achieved in a rapid compression machine was investigated experimentally. The fuel injection pressure was changed in a range of 55 to 260 MPa and the other injection parameters such as orifice diameter and injec- tion duration were changed systematically. The characteristics of the non-evaporating spray such as the sauter mean diameter and the mean excess air ratio of the spray were measured by an image analysis techniques. The time required for a pressure rise due to combustion was taken as an index to characterize the flame. It was concluded that the mean excess air ratio of a spray is the major factor with controls the burning rate and that the high injection pressure is effective in shortening the combustion dura- tion and reducing soot formation. 31</page><page sequence="31">910226-910231 910226. Characteristics of diesel spray with unsteady and higher injection pressure using a rapid compression machine. Hideo Takahashi, Dept. of Mech.

This paper presents the characteristics of diesel spray with higher and unsteady injection pressure under an elevated pres- sure and temperature condition. For this purpose, a pneumati- cally actuated rapid -compression machine was developed, which has 120 mm bore combustion chamber. A Bosch type injection system was used and can realize the maximum injection pressure about 160 MPa. By using high-speed photography, the spray-tip penetration and the spray angle were measured. Under the non- evaporating condition, the penetrations of higher and normal injection pressure are almost the same, whereas, under the evapo- rating condition, those penetrations are not the same. Thus, the penetration of the normal injection pressure is affected by the ambient temperature, while that of the higher injection pressure is little affected by the evaporation. The same tendency was observed in the behavior of spray angle development. It is also shown that fairly large eddies start to be generated at a certain stage of spray development and the spray formation process is affected by the growth and dissipation of those eddies. 910227. Autoignition of methane and natural gas in a simu- lated diesel environment. Roydon A. Fraser, University of Water- loo; and Dennis L. Siebers and Chris F. Edwards, Sandia National Labs. This work presents the autoignition delay time characteristics of methane and natural gas under simulated diesel engine condi- tions. A constant-volume combustion vessel is used for the exper- iments. Results are presented for the pressure and temperature ranges of 5 to 55 atm and 600 to 1700 K, respectively. Compari- sons are then made with autoignition data for methanol, ethanol, isooctane, and n-cetane. Three major trends are observed. First, there is little effect on the autoignition delay time of natural gas as the vessel pressure is increased from 5 to 55 atm. Second, there is a slight decrease in the autoignition delay time of methane- ethane gas mixtures as the concentration of ethane is increased. Third, the autoignition delay time of natural gas is strongly dependent on temperature and continually decreases with increasing temperature. From a pragmatic point of view, it is shown that the use of methane or natural gas as a compression- ignited diesel fuel is impractical in a conventional diesel engine due to the high temperature of between 1200 to 1300 K needed to reduce the autoignition delay time to practical values (- 2 ms). 1991 SAE Transactions Section 4 910228. The IDI diesel engine and its combustion noise varia- tions. Joachim Wolschendorf, Manfred Diirnholz, and Karl P. Schmillen, FEV Motorentechnik. Future developments of IDI diesel engines aim at a further reduction of the engine exhaust and noise emissions with no pen- alty on the fuel consumption. In this paper it is demonstrated that the combustion noise of IDI diesel engines is of great importance for the emitted total engine noise. Any reduction in combustion noise leads to an improvement in the noise behaviour of diesel engines. There is a large potential for the improvement of noise emission if the significant cycle-to-cycle variations in combustion noise can be reduced. These cyclic variations can be reduced e.g. by an optimized injection system which is part of future low emission, high efficiency combustion systems. 1991 SAE Transactions Section 3 910229. Performance and fuel consumption of a single- cylinder, direct-injection diesel engine using a platinum fuel addi- tive. Jerald A. Caton and Warren P. Ruemmele, Texas A&amp;M Univ.; Danny T. Kelso, Consultant; and W. Robert Epperly, Epperly Associates, Inc. Performance and fuel consumption of a single-cylinder, direct-injection diesel engine were determined for both an untreated diesel fuel and for the same fuel treated with a plati- num-based fuel additive package. The platinum was in an organometallic compound which was soluble and stable in diesel fuel. The fuel additive package was supplied by Fuel Tech, Inc., of Stamford, Connecticut. The engine, a Cooperative Lubrication Research (CLR) engine, was operated for 185 hours on untreated fuel (a low sulfur no. 2 diesel fuel), 236 hours on treated fuel and then 217 hours on the untreated fuel. Engine operating conditons were varied among three steady-state operating conditions at moderate load at 1300, 1600 and 1900 rpm. At the end of the 236 hours in which the additive treated fuel was used, the average brake specific fuel consumption (BSFC) decreased by approximately 9% at 1300 rpm, 5% at 1600 rpm, and negligibly at 1900 rpm. To understand the causes of the BSFC improvements, cylinder pressures were compared for the same conditions. This examination revealed that the cylinder pressures throughout portions of the compression and expansion stroke were higher after the additive was used. The lower BSFC values were attributed to increased indicated work due to shorter ignition delay periods and slightly greater instantaneous heat release rates during portions of the expansion stroke. 1991 SAE Transactions Section 4 910230. Soot formation oxidation and its mechanism in differ- ent combustion systems and smoke emission pattern in DI diesel engines. Mei Ning, Dept. of Therm. Physics and Flight Mech., East China Institute of Technology; Zhu Yuan-Xian, Dept. of Powering Engrg., Dailian University of Technology; andHu Guo- dong and Song Zhen-Huan, Dept. of Powering Engrg., Dailian University of Technology. The purpose of this study is to investigate soot formation and oxidation behaviors with two combustion systems for a DI diesel engine. The conventional DI combustion system and the conical spray combustion system (CSCS system) were used in a single- cylinder diesel engine. Under various operation conditions, the measurements were taken of soot, NOx and oxygen concentration by transient sampling technique; KL factor and flame tempera- ture by the two-color method; particulates emission by dilution sampling mini-tunnel. The soot microstructure was also investi- gated with transmission electron microscope. The temporal histories of soot concentration and KL factor show that soot concentration in the combustion chamber with CSCS is lower than that with a conventional combustion system. The main reason for this is that the spatial distribution of fuel-air mixture is more uniform with the CSCS. The results from electron micrographie analysis show that soot oxidation is influenced by aggregation and agglomeration of soot particles. A very small amount of crystal soot with an unsta- ble lattice is formed at higher flame temperature. 910231. NO2 formation in a diesel engine. Michael J. Pipho, David B. Kittelson, and Darrick D. Zarling, Dept. of Mech. Engrg., University of Minnesota. The formation of NO2 in the cylinder of a diesel engine has been investigated using a total cylinder sampling technique and a simple kinetic model. Exhaust measurements of NO2 as a func- tion of equivalence ratio and as function of time after engine start were made. Samples obtained by total cylinder sampling from an operat- ing direct injection diesel engine showed NO2/NO ratios of 25 to 50%. This is much higher than the 1 to 3% which was measured in the exhaust. Simulations of the sampling process indicate that conversion of NO to NO2 is at least partially responsible for the high NO2/NO measurements. However, the processes which pro- duce the NO to NO2 conversion during the sampling also occur during normal combustion. This may lead to high NO2 concen- trations during the combustion cycle which are then lowered dur- 32</page><page sequence="32">910231-910238 ing the expansion to the measured exaust concentrations. Simple kinetic models of combustion processes similar to diesel combus- tion indicate that NO2/NO ratios greater than 1 may be possible during the cycle. Measurements of the NO2/NO ratios in the exhaust increase markedly as the equivalence ratio is decreased, increasing from 0.01 to 0.62 as the equivalence ratio is reduced from 0.6 to 0.07. The concentration of NO2 in the exhaust peaked at an intermedi- ate equivalence ratio of 0.24. Measurements of the NO2/NO ratio as a function of time indicate that 45 to 60 minutes is required for stabilization. 1991 SAE Transactions Section 3 910232. (SP-861) A simplified method for the measurement of composite suspension parameters. Jeffrey P. Chrstos, Transporta- tion Research Center of Ohio. The need to measure vehicle parameters required for vehicle dynamics simulations has been a difficult and time-consuming task since the first simulations were developed over 35 years ago. The wide variety of simulations developed have demanded as wide a variety of vehicle parameters. Due in part to this diversity, no standard set of measurement techniques has been developed. A laboratory facility to measure the vehicle parameters for a 13-degree-of-freedom, lumped parameter, nonlinear vehicle dynamics simulation (VDANL) was needed. Parameters for a large number of vehicles were required. Therefore, only a few days could be devoted to measuring the parameters for each vehi- cle. The composite parameter measurement device (CPMD) was designed and built to meet these goals. The hardware, data acqui- sition system and analysis software are presented. The role test, steer test, and aligning stiffness test, used during the initial testing are discussed. Future tests under development are also presented. 1991 SAE Transactions Section 6 910233. (SP-861) An experimental investigation of passenger car tire properties at high slip and camber angles. David C. Hol- loway and T. J. Drach , University of Maryland; and B. M oh anty, U.S. Dept. of Commerce. A newly designed and built mobile tire testing machine (MTTM) is described that has features for large and continuously variable camber and steering angles with minimum tire scrub. This equipment was used to examine tire properties for six pas- senger car tires. Of special interest were the tire characteristics at combinations of high slip and camber angle. It was found that camber stiffness decreases with increasing slip angle when the slip and camber angles are both positive, and at limit conditions in slip angle, cambering a tire has little effect on the lateral side force produced. When the slip angle is negative, and the camber angle is positive, preliminary data shows that a greater lateral force is produced when compared to operating at limit conditions in slip angle alone. 910234. (SP-861) Characteristics influencing ground vehicle lateral/directional dynamic stability. R. Wade Allen, Henry T. Szostak, Theodore J. Rosenthal, David H. Klyde, and Keith J. Owens, Systems Technology, Inc. Lateral/directional dynamics involve vehicle yawing, rolling and lateral translation motions and dynamic stability concerns directional behavior (i.e. spinout) and rollover. Previous research has considered field test and computer simulation methods and results concerning lateral/directional stability. This paper sum- marizes measurements and simulation analysis of a wide range of vehicles regarding directional and rollover stability. Direc- tional stability is noted to be strongly influenced by lateral load transfer distribution (LTD) between the front and rear axles. LTD influences tire side force saturation properties, and should be set up so that side forces at the rear axle do not saturate before the front axle under hard maneuvering conditions in order to avoid limit oversteer and spinout. Rollover stability is shown to interact with directional stability, and to be related to center of gravity location, track width and several other characteristics that influence these variables under hard maneuvering conditions. 1991 SAE Transactions Section 6 910235. (SP-861) The importance of tire lag on simulated tran- sient vehicle response. Gary J. Heydinger, Transportation Research Center of Ohio ; W. Riley Garrott, National Highway Traffic Safety Administration; and Jeffrey P. Chrstos, Transporta- tion Research Center of Ohio. This paper discusses the importance of having an adequate model for the dynamic response characteristics of tire lateral force to steering inputs. Computer simultion and comparison with experimental results are used to show the importance of including appropriate tire dynamics in simulation tire models to produce accurate predictions of vehicle dynamics. Improvements made to the tire dynamics model of an existing vehicle stability and control simulation, the vehicle dynamics analysis, nonlinear (VDANL) simulation, are presented. Specifi- cally, the improvements include changing the simulation's tire dynamics from first-order system tire side force lag dynamics to second-order system tire slip angle dynamics. A second-order system representation is necessary to model underdamped characteristics of tires at high speeds. Lagging slip angle (an input to the tire model) causes all slip angle dependent tire force and moment outputs to be lagged. This is a better representation of the actual physical system than merely lagging the tire side force. The modified tire dynamics were implemented into VDANL, which improved simulation predictions in both the time and fre- quency domains. 1991 SAE Transactions Section 6 910236. (SP-861) Simulation of multibody systems for the computer-aided design of vehicle dynamic controls. Ashraf Zeid, Computer Sciences Corp.; and David Chang, Lord Corp. Simulation of multibody systems (MBS) that are suitable for the design of their controls require fast processing and access to advanced computational analysis tools. The approach that some MBS simulation programs take is to supply FORTRAN subrou- tines that represent simple transfer functions. The approach of other programs is to derive state space description of the MBS and write it in a disc file that can be used by specialized control systems design programs. Both approaches limit the interactive process necessary for the efficient design of control systems. This paper describes a structured and modular multiport approach to the computer-aided simulation of multibody systems. The approach presented in this paper produces models of multibody systems that are not only suitable for the interactive design and evaluation of control strategies, but also suitable to processing on parallel computers. 910237. (SP-861) Real time vehicle dynamics simulation - Enabling tool for fundamental human factors research. Richard A. Romano, James W. Stoner, and Douglas F. Evans, University of Iowa. A summary is given of the enabling technologies for real time high fidelity vehicle dynamics simulation. Methods of utilizing this technology to increase realism in an operator in the loop sim- ulation are then discussed. Finally some of the research that can be performed using a high fidelity, highly realistic operator in the loop simulator is presented. 910238. (SP-861) Correlation analysis of open/closed loop data for objective assessment of handling characteristics of cars. Werner Reichelt, Daimler-Benz AG. A new method - the stochastic lane-change maneuver- has been developed for the assessment of active driving safety in the closed-loop on the Daimler-Benz driving simulator. The charac- teristic data of 24 ordinary drivers and four vehicle variants 33</page><page sequence="33">910238-910244 defined by this method were correlated with the frequently used open-loop data of the vehicle variants and the subjective assess- ment of the drivers. The results show that the closed-loop assessment correlates much better (R= 0.996) with the subjective assessment by the ordinary drivers than the handling data of the open-loop (R =0.717). 1991 SAE Transactions Section 6 910239. (SP-861) Effect of lateral tire flexibility on the steering system dynamic behavior. Hani Mabrouka, Ohio State Univ.; H. Fred Chen andArefY. Maalej ', S.E.A., Inc.; and Dennis A. Guen- ther, Dept. of Mech. Engrg., Ohio State Univ. The purpose of this paper is to investigate the influence of tire lateral flexibility on the steering system dynamic behavior. Indi- vidually, the steering models and the lateral flexible models have been investigated for a long time. However, the combination of both hasn't yet drawn much attention. The inclusion of the lateral (rigid) tire model has shown to be of great importance. This study attempts to scrutinize the influence of a more practical tire model on the steering dynamic performance. Included in the study, tran- sient response as well as frequency response are illustrated by tables and figures. 910240. (SP-861) A simulation system for vehicle dynamics control.

Div., Toyota Motor Corp.; Hiroshi Shimomura, Vehicle Research and Advanced Engrg. Div., Toyota Motor Corp.; and Yoshihisa Magahara, Technical Administration Div., Toyota Motor Corp. A simulation system has been developed to facilitate the anal- ysis of vehicle dynamics control systems (e.g., ABS, 4WS, active suspension, etc.). This system can analyze the controllability of a vehicle model when combined with a controller. Its main fea- tures are: 1) the ability to simulate the various motions of a vehi- cle, utilizing a vehicle model that has been adjusted for the pur- pose; and 2) all operations, from data preparation to final analy- sis, can be done easily and efficiently. 910241. (SP-861) An examination of the maneuverability of an all wheel steer vehicle at low speed. Shinsub Jung and Dennis A. Guenther, Dept. of Mech. Engrg., Ohio State Univ. With the goal of improving the driver's steering performance, the four (all) wheel steering (4WS) system was designed, and theo- retical and experimental analysis of the 4WS system was investi- gated. In the 4WS system the low speed maneuverability is better due to a smaller turning radius. In reality, however, the opposite steering of the rear wheels could be counter-productive for certain maneuvers as shown in the Fig. 1. In this paper, this counter- productivity is called the parking problem. The objective of this study is to prevent the parking problem and to maintain the maneuverability of the 4WS vehicle. To accomplish this goal, a new concept of the 4WS system for the low speed range has been introduced. It is proposed that the rear wheel steering angles should be zero for any front wheel steering angles at zero velocity and after the vehicle is started the real wheels should be steered to maintain their original direction for a moment before the rear wheel steering angle reaches the limit of the rear wheel steering angle. Under this new concept, the 4WS system vehicle was investi- gated. The results show that the new 4WS system reduces the parking problem and maintains the maneuverability of the vehi- cle. 910242. (SP-862) Performance testing of the Vehma G van electric vehicle. Gerald D. Whitehead and A. Scott Keller, Elec- trotek Concepts, Inc. This paper presents the results of performance characteriza- tion testing of two prototype Vehma G van electric vehicles (EVs). Testing was performed at the Electrotek Electric Vehicle Test Facility (EVTF) as part of the Electric Power Research Insti- tute (EPRI)/Electrotek EV Program. The G van is a GMC full- sized van converted to electric propulsion by Vehma Interna- tional of Toronto, Ontario. One of the vans tested at the EVTF was a five-passenger model, the other was a two-seat cargo van. These vehicles utilize tubular-plate lead-acid batteries and dc powertrain system components produced by chloride EV systems of Redditch, England. Performance testing was conducted according to the EPRI/Electrotek EV test plan and included mea- surement of driving range at 56 km/h, on the SAE J227a C cycle, and on the Electrotek-defined urban route. Vehicle top speed, maximum acceleration, dc and ac energy consumption, hill climbing, and braking capabilities also were measured. A series of product-improvement tests then was conducted. These tests compared driving range and energy consumption between the original-equipment passenger van and the same van that was modified by changing tire type, tire pressure, and rear axle type. Additional tests were performed to determine the power con- sumption and driving range effects of the vehicle's power steer- ing/power brake unit and the air conditioner. 1991 SAE Transactions Section 6 910243. (SP-862) Track and dynamometer testing of the Eaton D SEP minivan and comparisons with other electric minivans. A F. Burke and R. D. MacDowall, Idaho National Engrg. Lab., EG&amp;G Idaho, Inc. Track and dynamometer testing of the Eaton dual shaft elec- tric propulsion (DSEP) minivan has been performed by the Idaho National Engineering Laboratory (INEL). The dynamometer testing included constant speed tests up to 88 km/h and driving cycle tests on the SAE J227a C and D cycles and the Federal Urban Driving Schedule (FUDS) as well as maximum effort acceleration tests. The dynamometer data were analyzed to deter- mine the energy consumption (Wh/km) of the DSEP vehicle for the various driving modes and to project the range of the vehicle if the NÍF170 nickel-iron battery had been at its rated capacity. Ranges of 90-125 miles at constant speeds and about 70 miles on the driving cycles were projected. Comparisons were made of the performance of the DSEP vehicle and the ETX-II and the TEVan minivans, which have been developed on other DOE and EPRI programs using lead- acid, nickel-iron, nickel-cadmium, and sodium-sulfur batteries. The comparisons utilized test data when available, but were based primarily on computer simulation results obtained using the SIMPLEV program. 910244. (SP-862) Electric vehicle development in Fiat. G. Bru- saglino, First Central Research Center. Within the strategical scope of energy conservation and improvement of human quality of life FIAT is since long time performing activities aimed at the technologies for electrically propelled vehicles for diversified applications. The electricity as energy vector allows an application flexibil- ity to different types of vehicles, full electrics hybrid and multi- mode vehicles which have been developed at prototypes level or small scale production. The tactical process which has been followed is based on the three phases of: technology research and development; demon- stration programs and field trials; and production. The experience achieved within several extensively tested pro- totypes and pilot service allowed to put in small series production light and medium delivery vans as well as minibuses, which are now in service in Rome and other Italian cities. 34</page><page sequence="34">910244-910251 In 1990, the Panda Elettra has been put in commercialization as a first type of electric vehicle offered for private transport; this vehicle is based on technological solutions adequately and eco- nomically viable for the present state of the art. The evolution process includes now further technological development in the field on board energy sources and drive sys- tem. As a first example of this new technology, a solution with four "in wheel motor" has been developed and applied to a multi- mode hybrid bus.

(SP-862) Electrically propelled vehicles at BMW - Experience to date and development trends. Hans-Hermann Braess and Karl-Nikolaus Regar ' BMW AG. Back in the first two decades of automobile development, elec- tric propulsion was a serious competitor for the internal combus- tion engine. Electrically-propelled vehicles, however, soon proved unable to satisfy users' increasing performance demands in terms of range, acceleration, top speed and hill-climbing, together with such factors as operating life, initial purchase price, running costs and reliability. Engineers investigating electric propulsion today face pre- cisely the same unwelcome legacy as their predecessors, despite many and varied attempts in the meantime to improve the com- ponents of the electric vehicle's drive system (energy storage device, motors, controller). Progress in battery development, particularly in the case of the Na-S system, has nevertheless enabled us at least partly to over- come the previous problems associated with electric drive sys- tems, though it cannot be claimed that all obstacles to its com- mercial application have been eliminated as yet. This is a report on the experience gained at BMW to data, the current state of work and development trends. 1991 SAE Transactions Section 6 910246. (SP-862) Integrated electric vehicle drive.

John Dieckermann and David Mallory, Arthur D . Little, Inc. The vast majority of cars and small trucks are sold with fac- tory installed air conditioning (approximately 80% in 1989). For electric vehicles to succeed in the marketplace, air conditioning will need to be offered as optional equipment, along with ade- quate heating and defrosting systems. While providing the level of cooling performance expected by vehicle operators, it is impor- tant that the power consumption of the air conditioning systems used in electric vehicles be minimized, to minimize penalties to vehicle range and performance. This paper summarizes the design and performance of several air conditioning systems that have been developed for electric vans over the past two years, including systems based largely on standard automobile air conditioning components and more advanced systems using high performance heat transfer compo- nents and a variable speed refrigerant compressor. The feasibility of using a heat pump cycle for vehicle heating functions (instead of a fuel fired heater), and the feasibility of applying measures to control vehicle thermal loads is discussed. 1991 SAE Transactions Section 6 910251. (SP-862) A high torque, high efficiency CVT for elec- tric vehicles. Frank A. Fitz and Paul B. Pires, Epilogics, Inc. Epilogics, a young engineering firm in Los Gatos, CA, has dveloped the first fully geared, high torque, high efficiency, infi- nitely variable transmission suitable for automotive applications. The IVT has particular significance to electric vehicles because it can provide a highly efficient, yet exceptionally controllable means to regenerate power throughout the normal braking cycle (allowing regeneration even at near-zero vehicle speeds). Under normal operating conditions, the efficiency of the Epilogics trans- mission exceeds 90% as derived mathematically and corrobo- rated experimentally. The device does not rely on traction to transmit torque and can therefore match the torque capacity of any typical gear drive. The size, weight, and cost of the device closely approximates that of a four-speed transmission suitable for the application. A recent development allows a bi-directional transmission which greatly enhances its attractiveness as an elec- tive vehicle transmission by providing for a highly desirable (al- beit, unnecessary in itself) means to regulate vehicle speed inde- pendently of motor speed, in addition to a means to a highly prac- ticable regenerative braking system. 35</page><page sequence="35">910252-910258 910252.

(SP-848) Ford races its EEC-IV electronic engine con- trol unit to improve production vehicle performance and durabil- ity. Walter F . Clark, Roberti. Fortier, and James M. Coats, Elec- tronics Div., Ford Motor Co. In 1984, Ford Motor Company Electronics Division began to develop a version of its (production) EEC-IV electronic engine control unit that could provide the precise monitoring and com- mand functions needed for the company's new turbocharged 1.5 liter Formula One V-6 racing engine. The electronic engine con- trol system was necessary to allow the new engine to operate reli- ably at the limit of its structural integrity, while producing a horsepower/liter ratio at least 10 times that of typical production powerplants. Ford Electronics Division is now applying the lessons learned on three generations of racing EEC-IV units, for both turbochar- ged and naturally aspirated racing engines, to improve the perfor- mance and durability of its passenger vehicle engines. This paper: 1) acquaints engineers with the electronic configu- ration of the EEC-IV unit; 2) discusses engine monitoring, control and diagnostics features traded between racing and production applications; 3) examines the electronic control strategies that allow racing engines to reach, but not exceed their structural and power limits while operating with reliability; 4) illustrates how those control strategies have been, or can be, applied to produc- tion vehicles; 5) describes how electronic tools developed in rac- ing to let engineers find and make immediate performance improvements at the race track are also employed by engineers to shorten the production car development cycle; and 6) discusses how racing helps develop the talents of Electronics Division engi- neers. 910254. (SP-848) Unburnt hydrocarbon measurement by means of a surface ionization detector. Wei Cai and Mick Col- lings, Engrg. Dept., University of Cambridge. Recent studies in the USA have revealed that the catalysts (which are universally fitted to gasoline automobiles) are failing in service to an unacceptable extent. Although the reasons for the failures are not completely clear, it seems that misfiring, leading to highly exothermic reaction in the catalyst, may be responsible for the damage. Legislation is to be enacted later in this decade to address this problem by requiring on board diagnostic (OBD) systems which can measure misfire, as well as catalyst hydrocarbon (HC) con- version efficiency. Although some ideas have been suggested for the OBD requirements, no fully satisfactory sensor technology has yet appeared. This paper describes a novel hydrocarbon sensor based on a surface catalysis principle. The fundamental studies reported here have been made with the automobile application in mind. A catalytic chemi-ionisation model is proposed in order to enhance our understanding of this surface ionisation. The automobile application of this hydrocarbon sensor is examined. Two measurement requirements of OBD II legisla- tion, catalyst HC conversion efficiency, and engine misfire, are shown to be feasible by this instrument. Some fundamental diffi- culties in using the sensor are discussed. 1991 SAE Transactions Section 3 910255. (SP-848) Control system for a low emissions natural gas engine for urban vehicles. A. D. Noble and A. J. Beaumont, Ricardo Consulting Engineers Ltd. Natural gas has been the subject of growing interest as a low emissions alternative to conventional automotive engine fuels. The development of a control system for a very low emissions heavy-duty natural gas engine is described. The engine is intended for city bus applications, with emissions targets set well within US 1994 levels. The engine uses a stoichiometric air-fuel mixture with exhaust gas recirculation and a three-way catalyst. The control system was implemented on a prototype hardware architecture designed to facilitate algorithm development. The control system software was constructed from a number of funda- mental modules. Good steady-state and transient air-fuel ratio control was par- ticularly important for maintaining optimum catalyst efficiency and hence minimum emissions. To achieve this, the air-fuel ratio control system used solenoid gas injectors and lambda feedback. The air-fuel ratio control algorithm design involved the use of advanced dynamic modeling and system identification tech- niques. Other functions performed by the control system were exhaust gas recirculation (EGR) control, ignition control, knock control, boost control and idle speed control. The engine was run over the US Federal Heavy Duty Tran- sient test and good control system performance was achieved, resulting in very low emissions. Transient torque response and stability, important driveability factors, were also good. 1991 SAE Transactions Section 4 910256. (SP-848) An adaptive engine control algorithm for acceleration response. Teruji Sekozawa, Makoto Shioya, and Takeshi Atago, Hitachi, Ltd. Chassis back and forth oscillation caused by sudden engine torque increase tends to occur, according to the characteristic of vehicle dynamics. This oscillation is called an acceleration surge and gives a vehicle driver a feeling of discomfort. This paper pro- vides two control methods which can change the characteristic of vehicle acceleration response in order to suppress acceleration surge and to match with driver's preference. The first control method is an acceleration servo method which is composed of control reference model and ignition tim- ing control. The second control method is a variable response characteris- tic control algorithm. We treat the controlled object as the second order model with time delay, and assign the characteristic roots of transfer function in order to obtain the desired response. 910258. (SP-848) SI engine controls and mean value modeling. Elbert Hendricks, Institute of Automatic Control Systems, Techni- cal University of Denmark; and Spencer C. Sorenson, Lab. for Energetics, Technical University of Denmark. Many existing classical electronic control systems (speed- throttle, speed-density, MAF (mass air flow) are based on qua- sistatic engine models and static measured engine maps. They are thus time consuming to adapt to new engine types, are sensitive to dynamic sensor errors and in general have undesirable dynamic characteristics. One of the main reasons for the charac- teristics of these strategies has been the lack of a precise, systems oriented, equation based, dynamic engine model. Recently a compact dynamic mean value engine model (MVEM) has been presented by the authors which displays good global accuracy. A mean value model is one which predicts the mean value of the 36</page><page sequence="36">910258-910264 gross internal and external engine variables. This paper shows how the engine model can be applied to the systematic design and analysis of classical electronic engine control systems. One of the main aims of the paper is to eliminate the use of cut and try methods in designing dynamic engine controls. The goal is also to improve transient driveability and emissions per- formance. The main subjects treated are steady state and tran- sient fueling strategies, lambda control and idle-speed control. There is also a comparison of conventional speed density and MAF control systems including the limitations imposed by signal conditioning filters and avaiable sensors. 910259. (SP-848) A PC engine control development system. Jan Lillelund and Elbert Hendricks , Institute of Automatic Con- trol Systems, Technical University of Denmark. Given the rather complicated set of coordinated control inputs which are necessary to control a spark ignition engine, pri- mary control system development and evaluation can be a very difficult task. It is also difficult to develop microprocessor sys- tems which are flexible enough for rapid system reconfiguration. In this paper it is shown that a personal computer (PC) provides an excellent solution to this common problem. Possible execution time problems are avoided by the use of a special mutli-tasking environment and simple external hardware. The external hardware takes care of the cycle to cycle fueling and spark advance timing calculations. The PC itself uses its execu- tion time only for calculating new fueling pulse widths and spark advance angles when the operating point of the engine changes. There is also extra computing capacity available for system simu- lations, condition monitoring, fault detection or perhaps driver information. Because of its mainframe architecture the PC allows the devel- opment systems to be programmed directly in a higher language which minimizes development costs and difficulties. In addition PC's are supported by a multitude of readily available software tools and facilities which can be applied to enigne control and monitoring. 910260. Compressible turbulence predicted by Reynolds stress models. C. Borgnakke and Y. Xiao, MEAM Dept., University of Michigan. Turbulence in strongly compressible flows as found in internal combustion engines is investigated with several models of turbu- lence. The standard k-e model, 2 classical and 4 of the most recent Reynolds stress models are used in this investigation. The com- pressible flow with a non-zero velocity divergence necessitates some changes to the incompressible model formulations nor- mally presented. Flows selected for the present study are the spherical, radial and the uniaxial compressions/expansions belonging to the class of flows with irrotational normal strains. For the selected flows the response of the scalar quantities k and e together with the anisotropy in the normal Reynolds stresses are examined. The initial behavior of isotropic turbu- lence in the rapid distortion theory (RDT) limit is a variation of K and e as density to the power 2/3 and 4/3, respectively. Anisot- ropy develops in a direction driven by the strain field and will feed back to the generation of k and e causing each flow case to be different. Most actual flows with compressibility do not have strain rates large enough to satisfy the rapid distortion theory, so the dissipative effects are included in this study. 1991 SAE Transactions Section 3 910261. Stratification of swirl intensity in the axial direction for control of turbulence generation during the compression stroke. Yasuo Moriyoshi, Dept. of Mech. Engrg., Chiba Univ.; Takeyuki Kamimoto and Hideo Ohtani, Dept. of Mech. Engrg., Tokyo Institute of Technology ; and Miki Yagita, Dept. of Mech. Systems Engrg., Yamagata Univ. Control of turbulence during the compression stroke is sug- gested by both theoretical calculations and experimental results obtained with an LDV measurement in a motored engine. The authors have found experimentally that when an axial distribu- tion of swirl intensity exists, a large-scale annular vortex is formed inside the cylinder during the compression stroke and this vortex generates and transports turbulence energy. A numeri- cal calculation is adopted to elucidate this phenomenon. Then, an axial stratification of swirl intensity is found to generate a large-scale annular vortex during the compression stroke by an interaction between the piston motion and the axial pressure gra- dient. The initial swirl profile is parametrically varied to assess its effect on the turbulence parameters. Among calculated results, turbulence energy is enhanced strongest when the swirl intensity is highest at the piston top surface and lowest at the bottom sur- face of the cylinder head. 910262. The use of intake and exhaust measurements with computer simulations to investigate the evolution of the internal flow field in a ported engine. M. J. Andrews and F. V. Bracco , Mech. and Aerospace Engrg. Dept., Princeton Univ. Recent measurements by gas intake flows and exhaust pres- sure in a motored, ported, single-cylinder engine with strong swirl and roll have been used as boundary conditions to a three- dimensional, transient computer simulation of the flow within the cylinder. For each condition, the calculation is continued over several engine cycles until the periodic solution is obtained. The computed TDC tangential velocity and turbulence intensity are then compared with measured ones. A technique is described to evaluate scavenging efficiency, the fraction of charge that remains in the cylinder over later cycles and the degree of mixed- ness of fresh and residual charge. For this motored ported engine, it is found that the scavenging efficiency is very low (19.4% at 1200 rpm) and the inflow from the exhaust ports is very signifi- cant. For practical ported engines with combustion, the scaveng- ing efficiency is much higher but the inflows from exhaust ports are still expected to be significant. Thus computations over many cycles are required and numerical accuracy may become an issue, particularly as far as the evaluation of the roll angular momen- tum is concerned. 1991 SAE Transactions Section 3 910263. Numerical simulation of swirling port-valve-cylinder flow in diesel engines. S. Aita, A. Tabbal, G. Munck, and N. Mont- mayeur, Engineering Systems International; Yoshihide Takenaka and Y. Aoyagi, Hino Motors Ltd.; and S. Obana, IBM NIC Center. A CAD/CAE procedure has been used for the analysis of the flow in an intake port-valve-cylinder assembly of a DI diesel engine. The flow was simulated for both, steady state conditions and transient motored situation during intake and compression strokes. The characteristics of the helical port are analyzed, for the steady state case, in terms flow rate, generation of angular momentum flux and induced in-cylinder flow motion. The results of the simulation were correlated in experimental results, consisting of oil film visualizations on valve and intake port sur- faces, and of local velocity measurements in the cylinder. The transient flow simulation shows the different characteristics of the flow motion in cylinder and piston bowl during intake and compression strokes. It was observed that the swirl generating capacity of the valve is different between the valve opening and closing phases. Also, a strong interaction was found between the swirling motion and the shape and position of the piston bowl. 910264. Study of swirl effects on spray formations in D.I. engines by 3D numerical calculations. Seiko Kono, Toshiyuki Terashita, and Hidetoshi Kudo, Mazda Motor Corp. 37</page><page sequence="37">910264-910269 Spray formations of three injection directions against swirl have been investigated by means of 3D numerical calculation, in- cylinder measurement, and engine performances tests. A direct injection type engine which has a single hole nozzle and a spark plug, has been operated, and three injection directions; a forward (same) direction, a reverse one, and a right-angled (central) one against a swirl direction, have been selected. Three types of intake port, furthermore, have been selected owing to create three types of in-cylinder flow, low swirl, middle swirl, and high swirl. Spray formations in 3D cylinder flow have been investigated by using a 'KIVA* code. Initial conditions of in-cylinder flow are based on data which have been measured in three dimensional by a LDV system under a motoring operation. Analysis results of spray for- mations by numerical calculations can explain well data of engine performance tests qualitatively, and some interesting results have been obtained. 910265. The modeling and calculation of a turbulent premixed flame propagation in a closed vessel: Comparison of three models with experiments. L. Delamare , R. Borghi , and M. Gonzalez , CORIA -URA -Faculte des Sciences de Rouen. The modeling of a turbulent premixed flame propagating in a constant volume vessel has been studied and compared with experiments. Three models including step by step the turbulent mixing, the flamelets propagation for wrinkled flames, and the flamelets stretching, interactions and thickening when the chem- istry is not very fast, have been tested. The experiment consid- ered here allows the knowledge of the turbulent kinetic energy and the turbulence scale at the time of the spark, and avoid any problem of spark fluctuations and residual gases, but displays again "cyclic variations" and the comparison concerns ensemble averages. The results of comparisons is that the agreement con- cerning the flame brush propagation is improved from the sim- plest to the largest model, when considering a domain in which k1/2 over Ut varies from 2. to .75 and Tc over Tt from 2. to 0.4. The turbulence model itself (k -e or k-lt) has a small influence on the flame velocity but a big infleunce on the shape of the flame, especially through the compressibility term. Further studies and comparisons with local experiments results are needed for assess the components of the most convenient turbulence model. 1991 SAE Transactions Section 3 910266. Calculation of inhomogeneous-charge combustion in a swirl-assisted lean-burn engine. B. Ahmadi-Befrui, Fluid Dynamics Research Dept., AVL List GmbH; and W. Brandstätter and H. Kratochwill, AVL-List GmbH. A multidimensional computational method is extended to include the methodology for modeling of partially-mixed inho- mogeneous charge combustion and is applied to investigation of combustion and simultaneous mixing process of an inhomoge- neous mixture in a lean-burn spark-igntion engine. The in- cylinder flow and charge mixture distribution pertain to a helical intake port with manifold fuel injection, and were obtained through complete simulation of the induction and compression processes. The engine compression ratio is 12:1 and the study pertains to the operating condition of 2500 rpm. The results show that the flow and charge distribution at the time of ignition is predominantly characterised by the evolution of the induction flow. The effect of heat release on enhancement of charge mixing is marginal and the pre-ignition charge distribu- tion is preserved throughout the combustion. The remnant of the induction vortical flow structure persists through a major part of the flame development, but the swirl component suppresses its interaction with the flame. The results indicate that combustion has a limited transitionary influence on the turbulence parame- ters, and the effect of bulk dilatation imposed by the expansion stroke is predominant. The flame interaction with the swirl and reverse-squish flows is indicated as the principal mechanism of rapid combustion. 1991 SAE Transactions Section 3 910267. Assessment of wall heat transfer models for pre- mixed-charge engine combustion computations. Rolf D. Reitz, University of Wisconsin-Madison. Two-dimensional computations of premixed-charge engine combustion were made using the KIVA-II code. The purpose of the study was to assess the influence of heat transfer and turbu- lence model boundary conditions on engine combustion predic- tions. Combustion was modeled using a laminar and turbulent- characteristic-time model. Flow through piston-cylinder-ring crevice was accounted for using a phenomenological crevice-flow model. The predictions were compared to existing cylinder pres- sure and wall heat transfer experimental data under motoring and fired conditions, at two engine speeds. Two different wall heat transfer model formulations were considered. The first is the standard wall function method. The second is based on solutions to the one-dimensional unsteady energy equation, formulated such that the standard wall function method is recovered in the quasi-steady limit. Turbulence was modeled using the standard k-e turbulence model equations. However, the turbulence model boundary conditions were modified to account for compressibil- ity effects by using a coordinate transformation in the wall region. The results show that the details of wall heat transfer and turbu- lence model boundary conditions influence heat transfer predic- tions greatly through their influence on the flame speed and the flame structure in the vicinity of the wall. Inclusion of compress- ibility and unsteadiness effects leads to increased wall heat flux values that agree better with measurements. 1991 SAE Transactions Section 3 910268. Numerical modeling of SI engine combustion with a flame sheet model. Wai K. Cheng, Massachusetts Institute of Technology ; and Joachim A. Diringer, University Karlsruhe. A combustion model for spark ignition engine based on the concept of accounting for the flame area per unit volume is for- mulated. This concept is applicable when the local laminar flame thickness is small compared to the size of the turbulent eddies, i.e., in the wrinkled laminar flame regime. Applying the model to the three dimensional computer simulation of SI engine combus- tion has demonstated that the model is inherently computation- ally efficient and useful insight of the combustion process could be gained from such a simulation. 1991 SAE Transactions Section 3 910269. (P-242) Long life Potentiometrie position sensor- Its material and application. Mitsuru Saitoh, ALPS Electric Co., Ltd.; and Katsuhisa Osada, ALPS ELectric Co., Ltd. Recently various kinds of position sensors have been used in automotive subsystems which include electronic fuel injection, active suspension and exhaust gas recirculation (EGR). Because a potentiometer has a simple structure in which a brush slides on a resistor surface, it has many advantages such as high tempera- ture applications, low cost, high signal level and almost infinite resolution compared to other kinds of position sensors that are magnetic or optical in nature. The potentiometer is considered to have the highest potential for a position sensor. However, conventional potentiometers sometimes lose their linearity after use under severe conditions such as engine vibra- tion (dither). They can endure only tens of millions of cycles of dither. This linearity error is thought to result from the following process: first stage: the resistive element wears by numerous cycles of slides; second stage: the wear debris are generated and are deposited between resistor and brush; and third stage: contact resistance increases as the contact area between resistor and brush decreases, since debris act as an insulator. In order to prolong the sliding life of a potentiometer, the wear of both the resistive element and the brush must be reduced. Carbon resistors consist of binder resin, carbon black, and some fillers that reinforce the resistors. By choosing these materi- als well, we have succeeded in developing a potentiometer that 38</page><page sequence="38">910269-910276 has a lifetime of more than one billion cycles of dither, preserving the initial linearity throughout this period of use. 1991 SAE Transactions Section S 910270. (P-242) A hall effect rotary position sensor. Robert Biebing , George Wu, Joe Murdock, Don Hoy, and Rusty Johnson, Micro Switch. Rotary position sensors (RPS) currently are applied widely in engine management systems for throttle position sensing and are being considered for other applications such as drive-by-wire. The potentiometer RPS relies on contact between a resistive ele- ment and a wiper and thus has an inherent wear mechanism. This paper describes a noncontacting RPS which is essentially a drop-in replacement for the present device. A linear output hall effect IC is key to achieving the required functionality, but it must be combined with a magnetic actuation scheme which provides a very linear and stable magnetic field as a function of input angle and packaging which provides long life and control of mechanical tolerances. Each of these design elements will be discussed. 910271. (P-242) Speed measurement of vehicles by radio waves. Kajiro Watanabe and Kazuyuki Kobayashi, Instrument and Control Engrg. Dept., College of Engrg., Hosei Univ. This paper describes a new method of measuring the absolute speed of moving objects such as people who are walking or run- ning, running animals, vehicles, sailing boats and the like. The method estimates speed using the time delay between spa- tial values (patterns) detected by the front and rear sensors which are separately disposed on an object and aligned in the direction of movement. It is known that the electric field intensity of radio waves in the VHF/UHF range exhibit a spatial periodic pattern due to the multi-pass fading phenomenon. It is also known that this phe- nomenon is a source of noise in automotive telecommunications. In experiments we make use this pattern for speed measurement and investigate if the pattern can be used to provide a spatial value which permits the estimation of the speed of the above mentioned types of objects. From various viewpoints and we show that it can be used to provide accurate measurements and further provide a guideline of how to design a measuring system which operates on this concept. 1991 SAE Transactions Section 6 910272.

Two approaches to speed over ground measurement are dis- cussed: doppler radar and spatial filtering. The strengths and weaknesses of each type of system are compared with particular reference to the inherent errors that exist in each technique. 1991 SAE Transactions Section 6 910273. (P-242) Development of acceleration sensor and accel- eration evaluation system for super low range frequency. Shogo Asano, Juhei Takahashi, Toshiharu Saito, and Hideki Matsu - moto, Matsushita Communication Ind. Co., Ltd. This paper describes the development process for acceleration sensors used on automobiles and acceleration evaluation system especially for the acceleration in super low range frequency. Acceleration sensor is indispensable not only for good vehicle motion control system, for example, active suspension control system, antiskid control system and four wheel steering control system, but also for safety system like air bag control system. This work focused on the development process of acceleration sensor which applied piezo ceramics. Features of newly developed sensor are as follows: 1) achieve- ment of self-diagnostic function to detect sensor failure utilizing the characteristics of piezo ceramics; 2) addition of piezo ceramic to cancel the pyro-effect achieved stabilization of sensor charac- teristics and enabled to detect acceleration of 0.0025G in super low range frequency of 0.05Hz; and 3) incorporates impedance conversion, filtering and temperature characteristics compensa- tion circuitry. Frequency range of acceleration for good vehicle motion con- trol is considered to be from DC to about 50Hz. But the measure- ment of acceleration in thus super low range frequency near DC had been difficult because of its mechanical and electrical noise interruption. This had delayed the development of acceleration sensor for automotive use. We succeeded in the development of acceleration measure- ment system for super low range frequency from 0.01Hz to 2Hz with detecting acceleration range from 0.0002 (0.2 gal) G to 1G as well as the development of piezo type acceleration sensor for automotive use. 910274. (P-242) Semiconductor capacitance-type accelerome- ter with PWM electrostatic servo technique. Seiko Suzuki and Shigeki Tuchitani, Hitachi Research Lab., Hitachi Ltd.; Kazuo Sato, Central Research Lab., Hitachi Ltd.; and Shotaro Naito, Sadayasu Ueno, Masayosi Suzuki, Norio Ichikawa, and Masayuki Sato, Sawa Works, Hitachi Ltd. A semiconductor capacitance-type accelerometer utilizing a pulse width modulation (PWM) electrostatic servo technique has been developed. Highly accurate detection of very small and low frequency acceleration became possible with the PWM sensing method. The limited air gaps between the movable and fixed elec- trodes ensured compatibility between high sensitivity and dura- bility, while transverse sensitivity and temperature coefficient were reduced due to the symmetric structure of the sensing device. This sensor has been designed for the measurement range of 0 to ±lg, ±2g and 0 to 50Hz. The accelerometer is composed of two chips: the sensing device made by silicon micromachining technology and the custom IC made by bipolar CMOS technol- ogy. In this paper, we present the fundamental sensing principle, the sensing device, the custom IC and the characteristics of the new accelerometer. 910275. (P-242) Gas damped sensing of automobile crashes for airbag deployment. David F. Gallup, TRW Technar Inc. While sensors used to detect front end collisions to deploy air bags are highly reliable, they involve using multiple sensors mounted in the crush zone and have difficulty meeting the sensor requirements for small vehicles such as minivans. A sensor is presented which deals with these drawbacks by employing a novel method of gas damping coupled with a spring mass system. Test results are shown which demonstrate the ability to tailor the degree of damping in the sensor. The theory and test results are presented which show how this sensor is able to react to the crash signal more quickly, a feature enabling its application in non- crush zone areas and in vehicles requiring unusually fast reaction times. Its response curve, which provides filtering of short dura- tion inputs, is also discussed. It is this aspect of its performance which can possibly result in a single sensor system meeting the performance requirements for the US market. 910276. (P-242) Electronic sensing of automobile crashes for airbag deployment. Robert W. Diller, TRW Technar, Inc. Although the performance of most of today's airbag crash sen- sor systems is excellent, it is achieved by using multiple sensors located remotely from the passenger compartment. Those system which use single sensors in the passenger compartment some- times fail to actuate when needed or are too slow to provide opti- mum occupant protection. Installed airbag system cost now sug- gests that designers should find ways to reduce the number of sen- sors and the complexity of the system without suffering degrada- tion in performance. An electronic sensor is freed from the constraints of the differential equation of motion of an electrome- chanical sensor because its algorithm can, in principle, be arbi- 39</page><page sequence="39">910276-910285 trary. It can manipulate the acceleration data in new ways, but whatever algorithm is employed must be firmly grounded in some understood physical process to guarantee the ability of the algorithm to perform properly in real world events not recreated on the test track. An algorithm is presented which de-emphasizes the use of the simple velocity calculations used by older electronic sensors and instead, uses measures of energy dissipated during a crash event to assess whether or not the level of severity of the event is suffi- cient to warrant airbag deployment. Explanations of the physical and mathematical basis of the algorithm and a VLSI circuit which performs the necessary digital signal processing are given and the efforts to help assure sensing reliability are discussed. 910277. (P-242) A magnetically damped crash sensor provid- ing testability and dynamic system reconfiguration. Leonard W. Behr, Automotive Systems Lab., Inc. A magnetically damped and biased automobile crash sensor is described. The sensor is configured to provide an optimal bal- ance between spring-mass and damped response characteristics. It is testable by the on-board diagnostic module at vehicle start-up, and deficiencies identified in the vehicle safety system may be mitigated by system reconfiguration, accomplished by automatic recalibration of unaffected sensors. The test and recalibration features provide enhanced levels of safety and reliability to vehicle occupants. They also offer vehicle manufacturers and service technicians the benefit of automatic diagnosis to the component level, making full and regular verifi- cation of mechanical sensors and wiring for airbag systems possi- ble for the first time. These features also make this type of sensor ideal as a safing sensor for a system employing electronic crash discrimination techniques. If the electronic sensor fails or is disturbed by EMI, the magnetically controlled safing sensor can assume the crash discrimination task until the upset is corrected, with minimal reduction in occupant safety. 1991 SAE Transactions Section 6 910278. (P-242) Theory of magnetically damped crash sensor calibration and testing. Steven J. Anderson, Automotive Systems Lab., Inc. Magnetically damped and biased crash sensors have several technologically advanced features which lead to a major increase in calibration flexibility and an improvement in inflatable restraint system safety reliability. The sensor's theory of opera- tion, associated simulation model and a comparison with test data is presented. The procedure to optimize sensor characteris- tics for both quick response and avoidance of inadvertent deploy- ments is shown. The sensor provides new safety features such as testability and reconfiguration which are discussed. A byproduct of including these features is a substantial reduction in capital outlays for manufacturing test equipment and reduced on-line testing time. Simple, microprocessor controlled on-line test equipment can be used to emulate either haversine or recorded crash test pulses without actually moving the sensor with a thruster. 1991 SAE Transactions Section 6 910279. (P-242) Experimental technique for measuring cross- axis sensitivity of automotive crash sensors. Chris Caruso, Delco Electronics Corp., Subsidiary of General Motors Hughes Electron- ics. Using computer generated "ramp burst" pulses on a single axis thruster, a "performance map" for a ball and tube type crash sensor is developed which indicates the performance sensitivity to cross-axis vibrations. The arming (safing) sensor reviewed here exhibits a cross-axis sensitivity to frequencies in the range of 200- 400 Hz. With this data is it possible to optimize the sensor bracket design or the sensor/vehicle interface designs such that the system resonance can be maintained above 400 Hz, thus min- imizing the cross-axis effects. 910280. Accelerated plastic exposure tests: Are they effective. Lawrence M. Ayers and David J. Ellis, ETL Testing Labs. Accelerated plastic exposure tests are defined.

Thermomechanical analysis for the investigation of solvent induced and residual stresses in an injection molded auto- motive headlamp reflector. Ma karand H . Chipalkatti, GTE Labs. Inc. In the continual drive toward better quality and long-term reli- ability of products, an examination of all factors that affect per- formance is necessary. For example, in plastic products such as injection-molded headlamp reflectors, the source and distribu- tion of internal stresses plays a crucial role. Specifically, in poly- carbonate reflectors, a detailed examination of internal stresses has resulted in considerably improved parts with a lower failure rate during manufacture and testing and hence a higher yield in production. Experimental analysis of a typical polycarbonate headlamp reflector is described throughout the course of this paper. The dis- tribution of internal stresses is determined via a thermomechani- cal procedure developed for the purpose of this investigation. The same technique has also been used to identify one of the main non-thermal sources of such stress, viz. solvent-induced stresses during the coating of the reflector with MIBK (methylisobutylke- tone)-based coatings. Systematic studies have established the role of the MIBK in creating internal microdamage within the mate- rial. These "damage" sites then act as crack initiation sites within the polymer. While the solvent has a damaging effect on the poly- mer under normal circumstances, its ejection from the matrix by heating to temperatures above its boiling point has catastrophic effects. Oftentimes the cure temperature for the coating is above the boiling point of the solvent as it is assumed that nonvolatil- ized solvent on the surface is minimal. An experimental tech- nique has been developed and applied to a typical headlamp reflector in the determination of the residual stress/strain distri- bution in a molded part. This technique offers potential as a diag- nostic technique for determining internal stresses in molded parts and predicting and resolving long-term reliability issues. 910284. U.V. processing of "solventless" coatings for automo- tive lense material. Joseph E. Miller, Chemical Coatings Div., Sherwin-Williams Co. A "solventless" coating process for plastic automotive lenses utilizing ultraviolet cure technology has been developed which can be completely recovered and used without adjustment. The resultant product has utility in both interior and exterior environments. In addition, beta backscatter techniques can be used to nondestructively measure the coating thickness which is important to many end use areas. Finally, process parameters are related to performance. 910285. Wet-on-wet silicone hardcoat. Warella R. Browall and George Medford, GE-Silicones ; and Gautem Patel, GE-Corp. R&amp;D. A new silicone hardcoat wet-on-wet system has been devel- oped to increase productivity in the coatings industry by reducing the processing time by at least 67%. The performance and weath- erability of this coating is comparable to that of the baked primer silicone hardcoat system. Additionally, the economic analysis show that the cost of a new coating line is significantly less than a UV-cured system. 40</page><page sequence="40">910286-910293 910286. Automated application of silicone glass like coatings for polycarbonate headlamp lenses. Joe Scranton , Subrata Mokerji, and Frank Warchol Vacumet Inc., Masco Industries Co. Silicone hardcoating and plastic headlamp lenses were first developed in the late 1970's due to the growing trend, in automo- bile design, toward weight reduction as well as a desire for design flexibility. A few creative people presented the auto industry with a plastic substitute that replaced glass and offered new design pos- sibilities. Ford Motor Company presented data to the National Highway Safety Traffic Administration indicating that the chance of total failure for a plastic headlamp component was less than for a glass sealed beam headlamp. General Electricé LEXAN polycarbonate with its excellent impact and high tem- perature resistance, good optics, flame retardant and light weight was selected as a perfect candidate for glass replacement in headlamps. 910287. An evaluation of the dynamic dent resistance of auto- motive steels. Ming F. Shi and David J. Meuleman, National Steel Corp.; and Christine L. Alaniz and Stephen J. Zurdosky, Chrysler Corp. The effects of sheet thickness, yield strength, strain aging and prestrain on the dynamic dent resistance of sheet steel are investi- gated using an instrumented drop-weight test. It is found that the dynamic dent resistance is less dependent on the sheet thickness and the yield strength of the material than the static dent resis- tance. The dent resistance of automotive steels under dynamic loading conditions increases with prestrain in a manner similar to static denting. The relative ranking of different strength steels in the performance of dynamic denting is provided at various strain levels. An empirical relation of dynamic denting force and energy with the sheet thickness and the yield strength of the mate- rial is derived for a flat panel. Data confirm that dynamic dent resistance is improved using high strength steels including bake hardenable steels and rephosphorized steels. 1991 SAE Transactions Section 5 910288. Prestrain effects on static dent resistance of automo- tive steels. Ming F. Shi and David J. Meuleman, National Steel Corp.; and Christine L. Alaniz and Stephen J. Zurdosky, Chrysler Corp. In previous investigations, it has been shown that the dent resistance of an auto body panel depends upon the yield strength of the material. However, it is known that the yield strength of steel increases with prestrain due to strain hardening. Panel design and material selection based on the material properties obtained from unstrained sheet steels may lead to inaccurate pre- diction of the dent resistance of the formed panel. In this study, the effect of prestrain on the static dent resistance of auto body panels was investigated. Using existing empirical relationships between dent resistance and panel properties, it was found that the static dent resistance of an auto panel depends not only on the part goemetry and material properties but also on the strain level in the panel. The improvement in dent resistance resulting from a material change from an AKDQ steel to a bake hardenable steel or a high strength steel was determined at different strain levels. It is shown that the dent resistance of a panel can be signifi- cantly improved by a small increase in the strain level of the panel. It is believed that the information provided in this investi- gation can be used to help optimize the design and to assist in material selection relative to the dent resistance of auto body pan- els. 1991 SAE Transactions Section S 910289. Study of parameters that affect body panel perfor- mance predictions. Christine L. Alaniz, Chrysler Corp.; and J. E. Bore he It, Inland Steel Research. Predictions of stiffness, denting energy, and critical buckling loads are integral parts of body panel structural design. The accu- racy of these predictions depends upon the method used to simu- late field conditions typically imposed upon the panel in service. This paper describes a study conducted to correlate the effects of different supports or boundary conditions and loading methods on the actual panel performance measurements. Specifically, panel stiffness and oil canning load measurements were experi- mentally made and compared under two different support condi- tions and indentor geometries. Conclusions are drawn with respect to each of these parameters to offer further insight into better predictions of panel performance during the design phase. 910290. Dent-resistant bake-hardening steels for automotive outer-body applications. R. Pradhan, Bethlehem Steel Corp. Bake-hardening steels are finding increased usage in automo- tive outer-body applications to achieve an improvement in dent resistance and, in some cases, a sheet thickness reduction as well. This paper reviews 1) bake-hardening specifications and mea- surements; 2) processing and properties of various types of bake- hardening steels; and 3) effects of pre-strain, ambient aging and baking conditions on the hardening response. 910291. Bake hardening steel application study- Key factors of dent resistance improvement. Thomas N. Seel, USS. On exterior automotive body panels it is generally accepted that the substitution of a bake hardening, BH grade of steel for a drawing quality special killed, DQSK grade improves the dent resistance performance. However, the amount of performance improvement varies depending on the specific body panel and the loading conditions applied. The objective of this study was to quantify and define the key factors related to the dent resis- tance performance difference. Specifically, body panels of the same part and outer panel gage, one BH the other DQSK, were compared based on the load required to produce a visible dent and the resulting dent depth. While the results were specific to the panel tested, the key factors to be considered when comparing BH and DQSK panels were identified. 1991 SAE Transactions Section 5 910292. The effect of simulated repair heat treatments on the physical properties of high strength steels. Robin Stevenson and Earl G. Brewer, General Motors Research Labs.; Kraig Malstrom, General Motors Institute; and H. Daniel Pursel, General Motors Corp. High strength sheet steels continue to be used in automobile structural components for mass reduction. Depending on the metallurigal strengthening mechanism used in these steels, short term, high-temperature excursions such as those which might be encountered in welding or heating for flame straightening during body repair could reduce their strength. To study this effect, time- temperature cycles were obtained on instrumented automobile rail sections during typical repair procedures using flame heating and welding. These data were then used to generate a program for heat treating tensile specimens of selected steels intended to cover a range of steels used which could be applied to automobile struc- tural components. Crush tests were also performed on simulated rail sections of these steels after undergoing flame heating and welding. Tensile tests showed some degradation of strength for a lean-chemistry dual phase steel and of ductility for galvanized steels. However, the crush tests on these steels did not show a sig- nificant loss in energy absorption. 1991 SAE Transactions Section 5 910293. Development of a new bake-hardenable galvannealed sheet steel for automotive exposed panels. Takashi Tanioku and Yoshihiko Hoboh, Wakayama Steel Works, Sumitomo Metal Industries, Ltd.; Atsuki Okamoto, Research and Development Div., Sumitomo Metal Industires, Ltd.; and Naomitsu Mizui, Research and Development Div., Sumitomo Metal Industries Ltd. 41</page><page sequence="41">910293-910298 Various types of bake-hardenable steels have been developed and applied to automotive body panels for a weight reduction since 1981. Recently for the improvement in the cosmetic corro- sion resistance of the exposed panels, an ultra-low carbon bake- hardenable galvannealed steel was developed and has been pro- duced in a large quantity. The main metallurgical features of the ultra-low carbon bake-hardenable steel are follows: 1) adjustment of bake-hardenability by controlling the total carbon content between 15 and 25 wt. ppm; 2) suppression of TiC formation by controlling Ti content between 48/14*N and 48#(N/14 + S/32); and 3) optimization of temper rolling condition to eliminate the stretcher strain. 1991 SAE Transactions Section 5 910294. Development of conductible type vibration damping composite steel sheet for automotive use. M. Sato, Y. Tanaka, Y. Yutori, H. Nishikawa, and M. Miyahara, Kakogawa Works Kobe Steel, Ltd. Vibration damping composite steel sheets (VDC) have recently been developed as a new material to satisfy the require- ments concerning various types of noise and vibration control for various fields such as automobiles, electric appliances and build- ing materials. Requirement for VDC continues to expand, because VDC, consisting of two steel sheets and a layer of visco- elastic synthetic resin, which is sandwiched between the two steel sheets, has an excellent damping capability. However, it is rather difficult to spot weld the VDC, as it has an electrically insulating resin layer. To improve the weldability, metal particle is generally mixed into the resin. For automotive body panels, VDC is required to have not only high vibration damping capability but also superior proper- ties such as weldability, bonding strength and formability. In this study, the effects of metal particle size and volume frac- tion on these properties have been investigated. Furthermore, a nugget formation behaviour of the developed VDC and relation- ship between welded joint strength and nugget structure have been studied in detail. It is found that the conductible type VDC which satisfies these propeties can be made from the resin con- taining iron particles and a step current welding method assures adequate welded joint strength. 1991 SAE Transactions Section 5 910295. Non-destructive replication technique for the exami- nation of phosphate crystal morphology on vehicle assembly lines. C. A. Gosselin, Armco, Inc.; and K. J. Sabo, Honda of Amer- ica, Manufacturing. Destructive or indirect methods have been available for evalu- ating phosphate crystal morphology on car bodies pretreated on a vehicle production line. Either the panel in question is removed, thereby destroying the car, or flat panels are hung in the window openings with the assumption that the same morphology exists over similar substrate surfaces on the stamped autobody. The replication technique described in this report has proven to be a viable option for examining the phosphate crystal morpholo- gies present on various automobile substrates. The details of this replication techique along with crystal morphologies associated with different substrates and degrees of forming are included in this report. 1991 SAE Transactions Section S 910296. The effects on intake flow configuration on the heat release and heat transfer characteristics of a single-cylinder four- valve SI engine. A. C. Alkidas, General Motors Research Labs.; and In-Soo Suh, Daewoo Motor Co. Local transient heat-flux measurements and heat-release anal- yses were employed to investigate the effects of introducing swirl or tumble fluid motion during the intake stroke on the combus- tion and heat-transfer characteristics of a single-cylinder spark- ignition engine. In general, swirl or tumble motion deceased the period of flame development and increased the peak rate of heat release, but, surprisingly, it increased the period of combustion. The latter increase was the result of comparatively low rates of fuel burning during the last stages of combustion. Swirl or tumble motion also significantly increased the local heat flux on the cyl- inder head. The highest peak heat flux was obtained for tumble motion. The observed increase in heat flux is attributed to the resultant increase in the mean velocity and in the turbulent inten- sity of the gases in the combustion chamber, which, in turn, aug- ment the rate of heat release and the effective convective heat- transfer coefficient. Finally, the local heat-flux measurements were compared with corresponding area-averaged heat fluxes computed using a suitably scaled empirical heat transfer correla- tion proposed by Woschni. The peak value of the computed area- averaged heat flux was in fair agreement with the corresponding values measured in the central region of the combustion cham- ber. On the other hand, the crank angle at which the computed peak heat flux occurred was in good agreement with the corre- sponding result measured at the outer location in the periphery of the combustion chamber. 1991 SAE Transactions Section 5 910297. The influence of soot deposits on combustion chamber walls on heat losses in diesel engines. Gerhard Woschni and Karl Huber, Technische Univ. A modified equation for the heat transfer coefficient has been established, because the original equation proposed by the author in 1967 provides at low load and motored operation to low results. The reason for this descrepancy seems to be a steady state soot layer, the thickness of which increases with increasing load where as it does not exist in a motored engine. All equations for the heat transfer coefficient known either to, do not represent the real heat transfer coefficient accuring at the soot layer surface, but include the thermal conductivity resistance of the soot layer. The real heat transfer coefficient is more than two times higher than assumed up to now. These results also show the adiabatic engine in a totally new light. 1991 SAE Transactions Section S 910298. Evaluation and improvement of an unsteady heat transfer model for spark ignition engines. P. Puzinauskas, Super Flow Corp.; and C. Borgnakke, MEAM Dept., University of Mich- igan. This study utilized time-resolved heat-flux measurements to assess the applicability of a thermal boundary-layer based heat- transfer model. The model is significant in that it is not based on Nu - Re correlation of the heat transfer in steady incompressible pipe flow as are most heat-transfer models used in quasi- dimensional engine simulations. The model was implemented in a two zone zero-dimensional engine simulation with a k-e turbu- lence and turbulent combustion submodels which provide the required inputs for the heat transfer model. The experimental engine had a pent-roof shaped combustion chamber with two intake and two exhaust valves. The primary variable examined was the intake-flow configuration which was varied by means of shrouded intake valves. The presence of large cycle-to-cycle variations in the measured local heat-flux histories necessitated evaluating the heat-transfer model with information from individual cycle calculations. The model in its original formulation was able to accurately predict the heat transfer if convective effects were negligible. After the model was modified to account for these effects, it showed good agreement with measurements made at a location exposed to a strong convective influence. The model gave significantly improved heat-transfer predictions over the currently available correlations tested. 1991 SAE Transactions Section 5 42</page><page sequence="42">910299-910305 910299. A telemetry linkage system for piston temperature measurements in a diesel engine. Dennis N. Assanis and Francis Friedmann, Dept. of Mech. and Industrial Engrg., University of Illinois at Urbana-Champa. A telemetry linkage system has been developed for piston tem- perature measurements in a direct-injection diesel engine. In par- allel with the development of the telemetry linkage system, fast response thermocouples were installed at three piston locations -two on the bowl surface and one on the crown surface. A novel design was used to achieve electrical continuity between the pis- ton and the connecting rod by means of a flexible steel strap piv- oted on the piston skirt. The telemetry linkage system was then used to transport the electrical wires from the thermocouples to the external data acquisition system. A series of tests was run to determine the effects of location and load on piston surface tem- peratures. Surface temperature profiles varied substantially among the three locations, reflecting the differences in the com- bustion and heat flow characteristics of their surrounding regions. Mean piston surface temperatures and cyclic swings increased with increasing load at constant speed for all three loca- tions. Three tests were also conducted under the same speed and load to examine the effect of soot deposits on surface tempera- tures after the engine had accumulated 1, 5, and 10 total running hours, respectively. It was determined that deposit formation on a surface over the first five running hours causes the most signifi- cant reductions in the mean temperature and the cyclic swings of that surface. Overall, it was demonstrated that the telemetry link- age system can provide a reliable and effective means for measur- ing instantaneous properties of reciprocating diesel engine com- ponents. 910300. Coolant flow in the cylinder head/block of the Ford 2.5L DI diesel engine. C. Arcoumanis, J. M. Nouri, and J. H. Whitelaw, Dept. of Mech. Engrg., Imperial College of Science, Technology and Medicine ; and G. Cook, and D. M. Foulkes, Die- sel Engrg., Ford Motor Co. Ltd. Local measurements of the mean and rms velocities have been obtained by laser doppler velocimetry in the coolant passages of a transparent model of a Ford 2.5L diesel cylinder head and block at a steady flowrate of 6.83 X 1(M m3/s. The simulation of the coolant fluid by a mixture of hydrocarbon fluids at a predeter- mined constant temperature allowed accurate matching of the refractive index to that of the acrylic model, thus providing opti- cal access for LDV measurements of the internal flow in sensitive areas where cooling is essential to prevent metal-fatigue failure. The results were obtained in sufficient detail to allow further vali- dation of CFD coolant flow models. 910301. Heat transfer/thermal analysis of cylinder head. N oboru Sunayama, Komatsu Ltd. Internal combustion engine, in which there are high efficiency, is required high efficiency/high power, so that combustion pres- sure is increased more than before. By the way, cylinder head, which is main part of internal combustion engine, should be required high reliability in user's needs. If there were once appeared trouble, reasonable troubleshootings could hardly be founded, so initial developments terms could not been attained occassionally. Because folloiwng reasons should be considered: 1) shape of cylinder head is very complicated; and 2) its thermal phenomenon, which is composed of heat generation (by combus- tion), heat transfer (by combustion, cooling-water, intake air, exhaust gas) and heat conduction (by cylinder block, valve seat and injection nozzle). Now, in this report, heat transfer/thermal analysis for cylinder heads is introduced because its accuracy has come to practical level. 910302. Modeling the spark ignition engine warm-up process to predict component temperatures and hydrocarbon emissions. Jordan A. Kaplan, Massachusettes Institute of Technology ; and John B. Hey wood, Sloan Automotive Lab., Massachusetts Insti- tute of Technology. In order to understand better the operation of spark-ignition engines during the warm-up period, a computer model has been developed which simulates the thermal processes of the engine. This model is based on lumped thermal capacitance methods for the major engine components, as well as the exhaust system. Coolant and oil flows, and their respective heat transfer rates are modeled, as well as friction heat generation relations. Piston-liner heat transfer is calculated based on a thermal resistance method, which includes the effects of piston and ring material and design, oil film thickness, and piston-liner crevice. Piston/liner crevice changes are calculated based on thermal expansion rates and are used in conjunction with a crevice-region unburned hydrocarbon model to predict the contribution to emissions from this source. Comparison of model results to existing test data for a similar engine configuration has shown that the model predcits the cor- rect component temperature trends during warm-up. Based on the results of this study, crevice region hydrocarbons are a sub- stantial contributor to unburned hydrocarbons during cold start. Also, it was shown that piston expansion is the major controller of the rate of change of the crevice hydrocarbons during warm-up. 1991 SAE Transactions Section S 910303. The development of lightweight and low-heat-capacity exhaust manifolds. Yasuo Fukae, Calsonic Co., Ltd. An automobile engine discharges more exhaust emission when it is started in a cold state. It is generally known that the cat- alyst start-up characteristics must be improved to reduce exhaust emissions in that case. We got the relationship between the exhaust gas temperature and the activation of the catalyst by measuring the exhaust gas temperature at each part during the exhaust emission test mode, then found that the improvement of the exhaust manifold is an effective measure to reduce the exhaust emission as the result of the analysis of the temperature distribtuion of the exhaust gas. Then we developed the exhaust manifolds having light weight and low heat capacity, and we succeeded in improving the cata- lyst start-up characteristics and reducing exhaust emissions. The details of this study will be explained in this paper. 910304. Heat transfer to non-aqueous engine coolants. R. J. Boyle and I. C. Finlay, National Engrg. Lab.; and T. Biddulph and R. A. Marshall, Ford Motor Co., Ltd., UK. Measurements are reported of heat transfer to a number of non-aqueous liquids that may be used as high temperature engine coolants. Included are engine lubricating oil, propylene glycol and LP 1693. The measurements were made with the coolants flowing at velocities ranging from 0.5-5 m/s in ducts similar in geometry to those employed in cylinder-heads and engine blocks. Heat fluxes up to 100 W/cm2 were used. For most tests the pres- sure drop across the test section reported for constant coolant flo- wrate. The heat-transfer data obtained are shown to be in good agree- ment with predictions from the Chen correlation for flow-forced, sub-cooled nucleate boiling. This model is used to evaluate the heat-transfer performance of other non-aqueous coolants, namely 'thermex' and ethylene gloycol. 1991 SAE Transactions Section 5 910305. Cold start improvements with a heat store. Oskar Schatz, Schatz Thermo Engrg. The heat battery, a latent heat store, accumulates waste heat of the engine and preserves it by efficient heat insulation. On the next cold start, after a day or a weekend, the heat is released with an initial power of 50 to 100 kW. 43</page><page sequence="43">910305-910311 This energizes the vehicle heating system within seconds, allowing for hot air to flow instantly to the cabin and to the wind- shild. The passenger comfort is immediately felt, and the wind- shield can be defrosted or demisted without manual help. Due to the high heating power the engine will warm up within 30 seconds so that the tailpipe emissions of carbon monoxide are reduced up to 50% and unburnt hydrocarbons up to 30% in the first bag of the CVS-test. 910306. Numerical simulation on three dimensional flow and heat transfer in engine compartment. Nobuhiro Katoh , Tadao Ogawa, and Toshihiko Kuriyama, Research and Development Dept., Daihatsu Motor Co., Ltd. Numerical simulation on three dimensional flow and heat transfer in the engine compartment is presented in this report. As the feature of construction in the engine compartment is compli- cated, mesh generation is difficult. Therefore, to solve this prob- lem we made and used code Tre.M', which auto-generates carte- sian mesh model with NASTRAN data. And this calculation solver is used cartesian coordinate commercial code 'stream'. In this way, we could reduce the time of making calculation model. Computation was executed for high speed, low speed driving and idling (Okm/h), in which steady, incompressible and viscous flow have been simulated using the standard k-e tubulence model. We have compared the calculation values with experiment values, and considered the flow and heat phenomena. 910307. (SP-855) Water flow simulation of automotive under- hood airflow phenomena. J. E. Williams, Ford Motor Co.; J. W. Oler, Texas Tech Univ.; J. E. Hackett, Lockheed Aerospace Co.; and L. Hammar, S SPA Maritime Consulting AB. An experimental investigation of the underhood cooling air- flow of a production passenger car has been carried out with a Vs-scale model in a water filled tow tank at Texas Tech Univer- sity and with a production vehicle in the Maritime Dynamics Laboratory tow basin of SSPA Maritime Consulting AB in Goth- enburg, Sweden. The primary objectives for both the Vs and pro- duction vehicle investigations were to obtain a better understand- ing of the cooling airflow behavior within the engine compart- ment of an automobile and to identify the major factors influenc- ing the flow field. The tests consisted of running a fan on a stationary and moving vehicle with pressure measurements and extensive flow visualizations within the engine bay. 910308. (SP-855) Engine compartment airflow investigations using a laser-doppler-velocimeter. A. Cogotti, Industrie Pinin- farina S.P.A.; and H. Berneburg, Adam Opel AG. Knowledge of the air flow through and within the engine com- partments of passenger cars has become more and more impor- tant in recent times. Flow visualization has been conducted, but, on the whole, there is a lack of real flow data. Experimental inves- tigations by conventional probes have been, up to now, impossi- ble, due to the highly turbulent and often unsteady nature of the flows resulting from the complexity of the engine compartment geometry. The availability of reliable flow data, would help in solving some critical temperature problems. Furthermore, experimental data could be used as a basis for a numerical approach by CFD codes which could probably help in analysing engine compartment flow in the future. In order to better understand this flow, the Technical Devel- opment Center of General Motors Europe has recently carried out an experimental test program, aimed at collecting data on the engine compartment air flow of an Opel Vectra in the Pininfarina wind tunnel. A new two-component fiber-link laser velocimeter, with which it is possible to measure local velocities, was used. This paper reports a description of this instrumentation, of the safety precautions that have to be taken when using this technol- ogy, as well as some of the results collected during these prelimi- nary investigations. 910309. (SP-855) Ram-recovery coefficient correlations for automotive cooling airflows./. W. Oler, C. M. Rosenberry, and D. P. Jordan, Texas Tech Univ.; and J. E. Williams, Ford Motor Co. The design of more efficient automotive cooling systems requires better understanding of the losses in fluid mechanical energy through conversion to thermal energy for the air flow through the front end cooling openings. A wind tunnel study with simplified models has been conducted to investigate the factors affecting the cooling opening mechanical energy losses. The data from this study have been successfully correlated using newly defined dimensionless parameters. The influence of the con- trolled geometrical factors are clearly identifiable with the data presented in dimensionless form. An algorithm has been devised which accurately correlates the behavior of a combination of cooling openings given the behavior of each of the openings oper- ating individually. 910310. (SP-855) Determination of flow velocity distribution in a vehicle interior using a visualization and computation tech- niques. Yuji Ishihara and Junichiro H ara, Vehicle Research Lab., Central Engrg. Labs., Nissan Motor Co., Ltd.; Hideyuki Saka- moto, Body Development Dept., Nissan Motor Co. Ltd.; andKyoji Kamemoto and Hidenobu Okamoto, Dept. of Mech. Engrg., Fac- ulty of Engrg., Yokohama National Univ. In this work, the flow velocity distribution was determined by measurements of visualized flow, obtained with a one-fourth scale three-dimensional model, and by numerical analysis. The measurements of interior flow were obtained using a method which combined the particle-tracking technique, a basic method conventionally employed for flow visualization, with a pulsed- laser-light-sheet technique. Flow images taken with a video cam- era were then processed by means of an image processing system. Flow velocity distributions were obtained for two different dis- charge modes -a dashboard-vent mode in which air was dis- charged from four vents provided along the top of the dashboard, and a bi-level mode in which vents at the foot position were added to those of the first mode. Three-dimensional numerical analyses using a direct-simulation method were conducted to cal- culate the interior flow, and a comparison was made with the measured results obtained in the visualization experiment. 910311. (SP-855) On the aerodynamic interference due to the rolling wheels of passenger cars. E. Mercker and N. Breuer, Ger- man-Dutch Wind Tunnel (DNW); and H. Berneburg and H. J. Emmelmann, Technical Development Center of General Motors Europe. Wind tunnel tests were carried out with a full-scale passenger car over a moving belt. The suspension system of the vehicle was redesigned in such a way that drag and lift forces could be mea- sured whilst the wheels were rolling on the moving ground. The measurements were carried out with an internal balance installed inside the vehicle. Additionally, total-pressure-deficit contour plots were reduced from wake-rake measurements behind the front and rear wheels in order to identify the origin of different bound vortices generated at the wheels. It was found from these tests that rolling wheels have a large aerodynamic influence on passenger cars. They decrease the drag and increase the lift forces in comparison to fixed wheels. This has been established in an absolute and a relative sense by investigating different vehicle configurations. 1991 SAE Transactions Section 6 44</page><page sequence="44">910312-910319 910312. (SP-855) Advanced techniques for flow simulation in automotive climatic wind tunnels. Lakhi N. Goenka , Advanced Engrg. Applications Branch, Sverdrup Technology, Inc. Two techniques for advanced flow-simulation in automotive, climatic wind-tunnels have been presented. These are the slotted- wall extension for improved flow simulation over the test vehicle, and methods for improved thermal boundary-layer simulation. The slotted-wall extension gives a reference q-correction that is relatively indepedent of vehicle configuration and blockage, pre- vents the formation of shear layers in the nozzle exit flow, sup- presses mean-flow pulsations in the test chamber, and reduces vehicle pressure-simulation errors, with resultant improvement in critical cooling airflows. Measurements over a heated, flat surface show that the open road thermal boundary-layer exhibits a turbulent temperature profile, and can be split into a thin sublayer region in which most of the temperature change occurs, and an outer layer in which a shallow, linear temperature gradient exists. From a practical viewpoint, adequate outer layer simulation can be easily obtained by heating the lower 0.5 m to 1 m of the wind tunnel flow to a temperature that is up to 5 degrees C above ambient. Future trends toward lower automobile underbody clearances would necessitate the simulation of the thermal sublayer region. This can be achieved by the tangential injection of hot air along the wind tunnel floor. 910313. (SP-855) Scale-model tests on the test section of the Chrysler slotted-wall automotive wind tunnel. Lakhi N. Goenka, Advanced Engrg. Applications Branch, Sverdrup Technology, Inc. The Chrysler Corporation is currently in the aerodynamic design phase of a slotted-wall automotive wind tunnel. This wind tunnel, with a 12-ft high by 20-ft wide test-section, is designed for aerodynamic, thermodynamic, and acoustic testing, and has a slotted-wall test section to minimize wall-interference effects. Vi2-scale tests were conducted on test sections with lengths of 51, 65, and 72 in. to determine the acceptable length of a slotted-wall test section having both turntable and dynamometer test posi- tions. The effect of test-section length on the magnitude of the model pressure errors and the reference-speed correction required at the model and dynamometer positions, as well as the influence of the re-entry flaps on the test-section pressure gradi- ent and on vehicle wake-development at the dynamometer posi- tion, were investigated. A test-section length of 72 in. (72 ft full-scale) was selected, based on the test results. This test-section length produced ade- quate wake-development at both the turntable and dynamometer positions. 910314.

Kiyoyuki Minato and Hano Ryu, Japan Automobile Research Institute, Inc.; and Toshio Kobayashi, Insti- tute of Industrial Science, University of Tokyo. For the past several years, construction of Japanese road net- work has maintained a rapid pace, but those roads, having many automotive tunnels, are affected by mountainous topography. The air pollution in tunnels by exhaust gases from cars, especially those from large-size vehicles, has become problematical in Japan. The purpose of this paper is to clarify the flow behavior, espe- cially wake structure behind trucks, and their aerodynamics char- acteristics at overtaking in road vehicle tunnels with digital image processing technique and three dimensional numerical analysis. 910315. (SP-855) A calculation method for estimating the tran- sient wind force and moment acting on a vehicle. Van Tuan Tran, Daimler-Benz AG. A new calculating method has been derived to determine, to some extent, the transient cross-wind force and wind yaw moment acting on a vehicle. On the basis of a plate model, the steady-state aerodynamic characteristic and, to some extent, the three fluid dynamic influ- ences of the partial flow, the vehicle side area and the pressure distribution are taken into account. The method developed is simple in comparison to the usual calculation methods of fluid dynamics and is therefore suited for vehicle dynamic calculations, as well as for determining the wind forces and yaw moments of test drivers. There is good agreement between the calculation results and the measurements of other authors. 1991 SAE Transactions Section 6 910316. (SP-851) Occupant kinematics and injury causation in side impacts - Field accident experience. Ludo M. M. Carême, AG Belgium Ins . Group. A sample of 31 real world side-impact crashes was selected for detailed analysis of the thoracic injuries observed in near-side occupants. The occupant kinematic data used in this study was based on the results from investigations carried out in the context of EEC programs on biomechanics. A clinical data base was established, and detection of the actual sites of contusive hemor- rhage in the lungs of trauma patients allows informed speculation on the relative contribution of pathodynamic mechanisms in var- ious types of blunt chest trauma. It was found that the injury mechanisms of visceral injuries are not the same in real accidents and in cadaver experiments. To give much confidence on cadaver data for the development of side impact dummies may result in misleading conclusions. 910317. (SP-851) Practical problems related to side impact field data accuracy and its importance to side impact protection assessments. Zygmunt M. Gorski and Edwin S. Nowak, Univer- sity of Western Ontario. Research interest in passenger car side impacts has included creation of hypothetical models to simulate the real-life collision. Also, controlled testing has involved development of new side impact dummies, moveable barriers and various impact configu- rations whose characteristics will allow comparison of the con- trolled collision to real life. An important addition to this research is the interpretation of evidence available in the real-life side impacts themselves. This paper critiques the field work which identifies the charac- ter of the real-life side impacts through discussion of the practical difficulties encountered in documenting these events. Relevant issues include difficulties and necessity for accurate and relevant measurements; the problems related to calculation of door veloc- ity are discussed in the context of latch/hinge failures during the impact and damage caused by emergency personnel. Inaccuracies in the assignment of magnitude of force are discussed in relation to their effect on locating the mechanism of injury. Finally the issues of injury assessment when a definitive occupant contact point is not identified in the vehicle interior is discussed in the context of the mass data files used by safety researchers. 910319.

The sys- tem uses ordinary video or 16 mm high speed movie to capture the crush event. This information is digitized and analyzed using personal computers to perform photogrammetric manipulations which yield accurate surface geometries. The output is useful for comparison to computer simulations. This paper presents preliminary results regarding the accuracy of this system. 910321. (SP-851) Prospects for improving side impact protec- tion based on Canadian field accident data and crash testing. Dainius Dalmotas, Transport Canada ; and Alan German, Zyg- munt M. Gorski, Robert N. Green, and Edwin S. Nowak, Univer- sity of Western Ontario. Currently, one of the major challenges for automotive engi- neers is to provide additional protection to motor vehicle occu- pants involved in side-impact collisions. A considerable amount of research is being conducted into this problem by governments and motor vehicle manufacturers on a worldwide basis. Changes to the current safety standards relating to side impact protection have been proposed in both North America and Europe. The pro- posed standards involve the use of dummies in collisions between a moving varrier and a stationary test vehicle. A total of 22 side impact tests of production vehicles have been completed to data to assess the appropriateness of the test procedures developed in the U.S. and Europe in the context of the Canadian vehicle mix and associated side impact accident problem. Vehicle performance rankings provided by the two test proce- dures were found to vary greatly. These discrepancies can be attri- buted largely to the different loading induced by the two different moving deforming barriers. Examination of Canadian field acci- dent data indicates that both barrier designs create loading envi- ronments which, in terms of maximum crush to the impacted vehicle, have a high likelihood of producing serious or fatal injury to a driver. Vehicle deformation patterns produced by the U.S. barrier, in the immediate proximity of the driver's seat, showed closer agreement with vehicle-to-vehicle damage patterns than did those produced by the European barrier. Delaying direct loading of the thorax until the pelvis has begun to accelerate was found to have a very favourable effect on the thoracic response. 1991 SAE Transactions Section 6 910323. (SP-851) Computer simulation of side impact using different mobile barriers. Karl Gruber, Martin Herrmann, and Martin Pitzer, Mercedes-Benz AG. In the past decades car structures have been optimized for the most frequent accident, the frontal impact. Together with the restraint systems (safety belt, airbag) they provide good protec- tion for the front passengers in this type of collision. Due to this fact the side impact must now get relatively more importance. Today, more than one third of seriously injured occupants are the consequences of vehicle side collisions. In order to test and classify vehicle safety in side collisions, different test procedures have been proposed. The basic assump- tion of these test procedures is that the striking car can be replaced by a moveable barrier. A comparative study of side impacts with moving rigid and deformable barriers has been per- formed by means of the finite element technique. Numerical sim- ulation of crash processes, using explicit finite element codes like DYNA3D and supercomputers like a CRAY Y-MP, provides an efficient and promising tool for the analysis of deformation behaviour of structural components and permits profound studies of different variants at early stages of the design process. 910324.

A new method of measuring diesel-particulate accumulation has been developed that uses electromagnetic energy to interro- gate a ceramic filter and to give a real-time measurement of the trapped-soot level. The measurement method is inherently inde- pendent of engine-exhaust-gas volumetric flow rates and is rela- tively insensitive to changes in filter temperature. This paper presents laboratory data, derived from testing of full-scale, wall-flow filter systems, demonstrating the viability of the measurement method. The implementation of the measure- ment method in on-vehicle regeneration systems is also dis- cussed. 1991 SAE Transactions Section 3 910325. (P-240) New developments of ceramic foam as a diesel particulate filter. J. P. Gabathuler, T. Mizrah, L. Eckert, A. Fischer, P. Käser, and A. Maurer, Alusuisse-Lonza Services Ltd. Diesel particulate filters for both passenger cars and heavy duty vehicles were manufactured using ceramic foam. A new design -the Z-filter family -allows for canning in a conventional manner. Performance of the new ceramic foam design types was deter- mined employing stationary and dynamic test stand measure- ments, as well as road testing. Particulate collection efficiency and backpressure can be tailored for a broad range of applica- tions. Z-filters exhibit the already known favourable regeneration properties of ceramic foam. 910326. (P-240) Development of particulate trap system with cross flow ceramic filter and reverse cleaning regeneration. Kazuhiko Takesa, Taroh Uchiyama, and Satoshi Enamito, Asahi Glass Co., Ltd. A new particulate trap system has been developed. It features both a cross flow type ceramic filter and reverse cleaning regener- ation. The filter is made up of thin plate elements of modified cordi- erite. Each plate has a row of some two dozen open-end, oval- sectioned channels. A periodic reverse jet cleaning by compressed air injection blows the particulate off the filter wall and drops it into the vessel bottom. It is burned by an electric heater. The trap efficiency of this system is above 95%. The durability has been confirmed by a 1000-hour test. Its efficiency will meet EPA 1994 standards with present diesel engines. 1991 SAE Transactions Section 3 910327. (P-240) Regeneration performance of a catalyzed ver- sus noncatalyzed ceramic membrane diesel particulate trap. Rich Helferich, Cercona, Inc.; and Kiyohide Yoshida and Kozo Ogasa- wara, Riken Corp. The regeneration characteristics of a membrane containing ceramic foam diesel particulate filter are discussed. Two regener- ation methods were employed to evaluate four different trap sys- tems. A manually operated burner system was used to determine thermal durability while an exhaust throttling system was used to evaluate a complete system. With the exhaust throttling sys- tem, two non-catalyzed traps, a non-catalyzed trap with the engine operating on a copper fuel additive, and a base metal cata- lyzed trap were evaluated. The goal of the catalyst system evalu- ated was the simultaneous reduction of both particulates and NOx emissions. Diesel particulate emissions were monitored and collected for this study in a test cell at the Southwest Research Institute using repetitive EPA heavy duty transient cycles.

(P-240) SOF reduction and sulfate formation charac- teristics by diesel catalyst. Minoru Arai, Isuzu Motors, Ltd. Characteristics of diesel catalyst for particulate reduction were examined. Important points of catalyst application for diesel engine are SOF reduction ability and control of sulfate formation from sul- fur in diesel fuel. Diesel catalysts were evaluated to select better catalyst formation and washcoat on substrate. SOF reduction and sulfate formation of each catalyst were examined, and it was recognized maximum SOF reduction was achieved to 80% or more over and sulfate formation was almost negligible when catalyst formation and washcoat were suitable for diesel application. Washcoat on substrate stored sulfate at low temperature and released at high temperature. Catalyst for diesel application is considered to be promising to reduce particulate as well as HC and CO if control of sulfate formation will be sufficient. 910329. (P-240) Further studies of electrostatic collection and agglomeration of diesel particles. David B. Kittelson, Jenny Rei - nertsen, and Joel Michalski, Dept. of Mech. Engrg., University of Minnesota. Diesel particles can carry 1 to 5 elementary charges per particle and earlier studies have shown that as much as 88% of the partic- ulate mass is charged. The charge is bipolar: there are equal num- bers of positively and negatively charged particles. Because the particles are charged as a result of the combustion process, no corona charging section is necessary. This minimizes power requirements. Relatively low voltages and currents are required (3 kV and 1 to 2 mA). The charged particles are removed from the exhaust flow in a region of high electric field. The collected particles undergo surface agglomeration, grow- ing from mass mean diameters of 0.1 -0.3 |im to well over 10 fim, and then are reentrained by fluid mechanical shear. These larger particles are easily collected by passive inertial devices such as cyclones, multiclones, inertial impactors, etc. The collected parti- cles can be subsequently injected into the intake air of the engine and reburned in the cylinder or disposed of by other means. Studies of the reburning process are currently underway. The ESA does not serve as a collector over the long term, but serves only to agglomerate the particles in order to prepare them for easy collection. Details of the design and initial testing of a first generation prototype electrostic agglomerator have been given by Thimsen et al. The prototype was a full scale unit designed to treat the entire exhaust of a Caterpillar 3304 diesel engine. The unit removed submicron mass with efficiencies up to 50% and showed clear evidence of significant agglomeration. However, the proto- type was not optimized, did not lend itself well to design changes, and was not convenient for making separate deposition and reentrainment measurements. The work described in this paper represents an extension from the original hardware orientation to more of a fundamental research orientation. The objectives of the work described in this paper are as follows: 1) further character- izations of the full scale prototype, 2) measurements of the natu- ral charge on the particles emitted by the Caterpillar 3304 engine, 3) testing of subscale single cell agglomerators with several differ- ent geometries, and 4) reentrainment tests. 1 991 SAE Transactions Section 3 910331. (P-240) Particulate trap technology demonstration at New York City transit authority. Kong Ha and Ian Carmichael, Ortech, International; John Walsh and Andy Skabowski, New York Transit Authority ; and Laslo Goldberger, New York City Dept. of Environmental Protection. In a further field evaluation of diesel particulate trap oxidizer systems the New York City Transit Authority (NYCTA) and ORTECH International have expanded their evaluation to include three more buses. The expansion of this program was two fold: 1) to further evaluate the ORTECH burner based trap sys- tem; 2) to evaluate a Donaldson Company Inc. (DCI) duel trap system utilizing an electric heater; and 3) to evaluate a Webasto burner based trap system. Four addition revenue buses #4511, #4512, #4513, and #4517 were chosen for this evaluation, in addition to bus #1698 which was equipped with an ORTECH trap system, and has been in rev- enue service since April 1989. All four buses were retrofitted with new Detroit Diesel Corp. (DDC) DDEC controlled 6V92-TA Cal- ifornia rated low NO* engines, with ATEC Allison transmissions. Buses #4511 and #4512 were each retroffited by ORTECH International of Mississauga, Canada with an ORTECH burner based system. This system consists of two catalyzed trap mono- lithic exhaust filters and a Webasto burner to promote regenera- tion. This system has proven to reduce emissions by 80 to 90 per- cent and is also effective in reducing hydrocarbon and carbon monoxide emissions. Both of these buses have been in service since October 1989. Bus #4517 was retrofitted by ORTECH with a DCI electric trap system. This system utilizes two non-catalyzed traps to col- lect particulate and an electric resistance heater to initiate regen- eration. This system also reduces particulate 80 percent while having only minor effects to the operation of the vehicle. This bus has been in revenue service since February of 1990. A Campbell Scientific Datalogger was installed on this bus in May of 1990, further expanding the information database. The NYCTA has operated these vehicles on the M-15 route in midtown Manhattan. Their performance has been monitored and compared to a control fleet running on the same route to ver- ify the durability and deterioration of the trap systems. Exhaust emissions levels were taken at the New York City Department of Environmental Protection (NYC DEP), on a chassis dynamome- ter allowing for data in gr/mile. All problems with these systems were carefully recorded and the resolution to the problems fully explained. The Webasto burner system was tested for 450 hours using a test cell dynamometer over the NYC bus cycle. The system uti- lizes a single non-catalyzed trap and a diesel burner to heat the bus exhaust for regeneration. Emission tests results show effi- ciency of particulate removal over 85% with a weighted fuel pen- alty of 2-3%. 1991 SAE Transactions Section 3 910332. (P-240) Demonstration of durable retrofit diesel par- ticulate trap systems on an urban bus and class 8 truck. Kong Ha and Ian Carmichael, Ortech, International; M. O'Connor, Air Resources Board, State of California; Steve Albu, California Air Resources Board ; and Dan Quigg and Vince Pellegrin, Southern California Rapid Transit District. Progress is reported on a project sponsored by the California Air Resources Board (ARB) to evaluate the potential of diesel particulate trap systems for retrofit application to reduce emis- sions from buses and trucks. A trap system was selected for evalu- ation based on availability of commercial prototypes at the time of the project. Engine dynamometer testing of this trap system is reported over advanced design bus cycles. The results showed that the system is viable for application to a bus equipped with a Detroit Diesel Corporation 6V-92TA diesel engine, producing satisfactory exhaust backpressure and emission characteristics over a 500 hour test period. Field testing of this system on a tran- sit coach is now ongoing at Southern California Rapid Transit District (SCRTD) and the experience is reported. Emission test- ing has been conducted regularly at ARB to verify the perfor- mance of the trap system. Work is also proceeding on the prepa- ration of field testing of a similar system on a truck equipped with a Cummins* NTCC 400 diesel engine. 47</page><page sequence="47">910333-910344 910333. (P-240) Evaluation of a self-cleaning particulate con- trol system for diesel engines. Yiannis A. Levendis, Kevin Mcln- erney, and Thomai Panagiotou, Dept. of Mech. Engrg., Northeast- ern Univ. Self-cleaning trap configurations have been developed and evaluated for removing particulate emissions from diesel engine exhaust streams. The main feature of this approach is that the traps are being cleaned continuously using compressed air, and thus, do not require thermal or catalytic regeneration to remove the collected particles. The results of this study indicate that the present system, employing ceramic wall flow monolith filters, performs well in simultaneously filtering the exhaust and remov- ing the captured particles from the filter element into a fabric bag. Successful cleaning of the trap was evidenced by a quasi-steady state behavior of the exhaust back pressure that was reached in a fairly short period of time. 910334. (P-240) Evaluation of diesel particulate filter systems for city buses. Hideo Suto , Tetsuo Mikami, Hiroshi Hirai, and Masahiko Hori, Japan Automobile Research Institute Inc. (JARI). Four different diesel particulate filter (DPF) systems for city buses have been studied on an engine bench, and based on the results, their practicalities are discussed. On road data of buses operating in Tokyo were collected, and a city bus driving pattern for engine bench test was prepared. Evaluation tests were carried out on an engine bench using an 11-liters engine, used on city buses. The test engine equipped with a DPF system was operated on cyclic test of the city bus driving pattern for the accumulated loading time of 400 hours. Each of the DPF systems has a wall flow monolith filter. A diesel fuel burner or an electric heater with or without catalyst-coated filter is used for regeneration. It is possible to remove about 90% of particulates from the exhaust gas by the use of DPF systems for diesel engines. Soluble organic fraction (SOF) is reduced by about 30%. It is difficult to sufficiently remove SOF. No deterioration in the filtering effi- ciency of particulate matter has been noted after the bus cycle test of 400 hours. 1991 SAE Transactions Section 3 910335. (P-240) Reduction of diesel particulates, unburned hydrocarbons, and nitrogen oxides from diesel exhaust gases. Julius J. Rim, Intermet, Ltd. A new method of controlling all the harmful diesel emissions including diesel particulate matter (DPM), unburned- hydrocarbons (UHC), and nitrogen-oxides (NOx), has been developed and its concept and test results are briefly presented in this paper. Two filters in parallel are used, each alternating operation as the other regenerates. Each filter made in a conventional manner operates at low temperature below 300 degrees centigrade to help UHC condense onto DPM captured in the filter. A microproces- sor-controlled valve system regulates which filter is active or fil- tering and which is regenerating. DPM accumulates at the active filter, with UHC condensing or being adsorbed on the DPM cap- tured. Catalysts are employed to support the regeneration burn at low temperature. The byproducts of regeneration including UHC are recirculated into diesel engine combustion chamber for combustion of UHC and reduction of NOx. 910336. (SP-863) Emissions and age distribution of vehicles in Colorado I/M program, winter 1989-1990. Jerry Gallagher and Robert Livo, Air Pollution Control Div., Colorado Dept. of Health. Vehicle age distribution is an important consideration when evaluating the effects of exhaust emissions. To quantify CO idle data from motor vehicles of different model year groupings and vehicle classifications, the Colorado Department of Health (CDH) reviewed emissions data from the Colorado Automobile Inspection and Readjustment (A.I.R.) program. 910338. (SP-863) Recommended I/M short test procedures for the 1990*8 - Six alternatives. Erik Herzog, Lisa Snapp, and Eugene Tierney, U.S. Environmental Protection Agency. This report describes in detail new test procedures designed to minimize test variability, and the resulting false failures of new technology vehicles. There are currently six promulgated test pro- cedures. The new procedures differ from the current ones in that they include controlled preconditioning, second chance testing, and sampling and score selecting algorithms. These are intended to minimize the variability in testing conditions and thereby reduce false failures of clean vehicles. High emitting vehicles which have been escaping detection with the current test proce- dures may continue to do so under the new ones. It is EPA's hope that these new procedures will improve the possibility of using more stringent cutpoints and non-idle test modes in the future to detect these high emitters by eliminating the additional false fail- ures that would otherwise occur by instituting such measures under current procedures. 910339. (SP-863) In-use emissions with today's closed-loop systems. Harold M. Haskew and Thomas F. Liberty, Powertrain Div., General Motors Corp. Closed-loop emission control systems were adopted by most motor vehicle manufacturers on a wide-spread basis in model year 1981, in order to meet the 1981 and later Federal exhaust emission standards. General Motors and the Environmental Pro- tection Agency have conducted test programs to quantify the in- use performance of these closed-loop systems. Over 4000 vehicles (passenger cars and light duty trucks) have been evaluated cover- ing the 1983 through 1988 model years at both low and high alti- tude locations. For model year 1986 and later, average emission levels, adjusted to the 50,000 mile point, are below the applicable EPA standards. The GM and EPA data indicate average emission levels have decreased during the 1980's and reflect the increased penetration of fuel injection, improvements in catalytic con- verter performance, and improved system and component reli- ability. Maintenance of the in-use fleet appears to offer the best oppor- tunity for further reducing the mobile source contributions to atmospheric inventory and resulting pollution. 1991 SAE Transactions Section 4 910344. The design of lightweight reciprocating components for a new family of high speed motorcycle engines. Anthony V. Smith, Ricardo Consulting Engineers ; and S. G. Steward, Tri- umph Designs Ltd. Modern premium high speed motorcycle engines represent a particularly demanding environment for component design. The severe nature of the internal thermal and mechanical loads in such engines has traditionally necessitated extensive develop- ment testing in order to ensure that design tragets are met. In order to meet the increasing commercial pressure for improved product refinement and durability coupled with reduced devel- opment timescales, the effective application of a modern analysis techniques should be regarded as an essential part of the design phase. This paper describes the approach used to develop the design of a lightweight slipper construction piston, pin and connecting rod for use in a new family of motorcycle engines. A finite ele- ment model of the piston was used to assess the effectiveness of various piston cooling regimes. Development of the piston skirt ovality profile for minimum clearance (and hence low noise) was also undertaken on the model, with reference to the results of an FE analysis of liner distortion and calculations of skirt stiffness distribution. A lightweight, internally tapered, fully floating, bushless gud- geon pin was designed using a nonlinear system model of the con- necting rod small end, pin and piston allowing for the clearances between each component. 48</page><page sequence="48">910344-910352 The connecting rod was designed using an FE model incorpo- rating big end wrap round. An iterative approach was applied whereby material was redistributed on the basis of local fatigue safety factors. The final 3D surface geometry was transferred to a CAD system for detailing prior to procurement. The approach described enable a competitive lightweight design of piston, pin and connecting rod to be produced on a "right first time" basis as a part of a single stage design and devel- opment program. Sufficient confidence was placed in the approach for production rather than prototype tooling to be pro- cured on the basis of the analytical results. Subsequent durability testing was carried out on entirely production parts. Discussion: John Brooks, Pacific Piston Ring Co., Inc. 1991 SAE Transactions Section 3 910345. Study of non-uniform velocity balancer in the piston crank mechanism. Masaru Ogura , Nippon Institute of Technol- ogy . This paper is concerned with a new type of non-uniform veloc- ity balancer appling to the single cylinder engine. A conventional balancer rotate in an uniform velocity, while the new one rotate in a non-uniform velocity. A non-uniform velocity rotation is given by the eccentric gear installed balancer shaft. It is recog- nized that the moderate eccentricity of gear train is existed for reducing the exciting force and its effect is remarkable. 910346. Thermodynamic modeling of the two-cylinder regen- erative internal combustion engine. Francisco Ruiz , MAE Dept., Illinois Institute of Technology. The thermodynamic process inside a regenerative internal combustion engine, composed of compression and expansion cylinders, connected by a porous matrix regenerator is modeled as a function of crank angle and a plurality of design and opera- tion parameters. These parameters include: regenerator type (heat capacity, porosity, and hydraulic diameter), timing parame- ters (valve timings, phase difference between cylinders), geomet- rical parameters (displacement, expansion ratio, regenerator dimensions), and operating parameters (equivalence ratio, crank speed). Fluid friction effects are included, as well as heat transfer effects in the regenerator and cylinders, and finite combustion rates. Efficiency, and other performance indicators are plotted against these parameters. Pressure-volume diagrams at different conditions are presented. The effects of the different parameters are discussed and recommendations are made for design of prac- tical regenerative engines, having indicated thermodynamic effi- ciencies in excess of 40%. 1991 SAE Transactions Section 3 910347. Estimation of total engine loss and engine output in four stroke S.I. engines. Shizuo Yagi, Kazuo Fujiwara , Nobuhiko Kur oki, and Yoshio Maeda , Honda R&amp;D Co., Ltd. In the previous reports (SAE Paper 880268, 900223), a rela- tionship between dimensional specifications and total engine loss (Pmf) measured by motoring method under certain conditions was established by analyzing 300 different types of mass- produced engines of which engine speed for maximum power output (Nepsmax) was obtained between 8,000 to 16,000 rpm, and thereby an empirical formula was proposed (Pmf). In this paper, it was proved that brake mean effective pressure (Pme) can be estimated by using the empirical formula for Pmf and modified indicated mean effective pressure (Pmi*) obtained from analyzing varous types of motorcycle engines consisting of different cylinder configurations, valve sizes and numbers. At first, the relationship between the characterstic values of engine and Nepsmax is described, and methods to obtain higher power output by increasing engine speed are also discussed. It was found that the proposed empirical formula for Pmf is applicable to high revolution engines which run upto 20,000 rpm, and that a reduction in Pmf can be achieved by utilizing an engine with short-strokes, multi-valves and multi-cylinders. Under optimum operating conditions, the values of modified indicated mean effective pressure (Pmi*) [ = (Pmf + Pme)/ (K(e)*nu)] have shown to be substantially constant and agree well with the value of modified Pmi (Pmi*) which is obtained from the indicated pressure diagrams of 300 cycles under same opti- mum operating conditions. Therefore, it is concluded that net output (Pse) can be also esti- mated at planning stage of a new engine layout with the value of no calculated numerically, the constant value of Pmi* and the value of Pmf calculated from the empirical formula. 1991 SAE Transactions Section 3 910349.

John Bieda, AC Rochester Div., General Motors Corp. Reliability growth test management is a feasible method for identifying failure modes, implementing design changes and monitoring reliability progress on an on-going basis during the early phases of a product development program. Implementation of this particular process will provide very useful information on concept selection, product/process reliability, and cost effective- ness without exorbitant time, money, and engineering effort being spent on the development of failure suspect parts. Recent experience with the testing of automotive components has led to a practical method for efficiently organizing, initiating, and mon- itoring a reliability growth test process under a competitive auto- mobile environment. Analysis techniques to be presented address product/process design concerns and validation testing issues by providing 1) timely reliability growth progress, 2) practice tests leading up to validation, and 3) confidence limits with test time. Performing such activities as identifying operating environments, developing growth test curves from the results, examining the results for vari- ous relationships between design iterations, and linking the infor- mation with other product assurance analyses help to properly evaluate a product's conformance to customer requirements. Reliability growth test management is a part of the product assurance function that plays a significant role in product/process reliability improvement. 1991 SAE Transactions Section 5 910355. A method of reliability analysis for automotive elec- tronic systems. Masaru Idoguchi, Hino Motors, Ltd. This paper presents some results gained from our investiga- tion of reliability analysis for automotive electronic systems with the aim of establishing a method for application reliability engi- neering. As the functions of automotive electronic systems expand to various areas, the number of components increases. Therefore, the total failure rate necessarily increases, so that it is important to reduce the effects of a failure as well as to prevent failure occur- rence. In consequence, the component duplication concept has been implemented as a cou n terme asu re. Through this investiga- tion, a reliability analysis method for automotive electronic sys- tems with certain duplicated components and the applicability of this method have been established. Moreover, in applying reli- ability technology, various points to be taken into consideration have been defined. 1991 SAE Transactions Section 5 910356. A predictive process for spring failure rates in automo- tive parts applications. Partab Jeswani and John Bieda, AC Roch- ester Div., General Motors Corp. This paper discusses an analytical technique for computing the failure rate of steel springs used in automotive part applica- tions. Preliminary computations may be performed and used to predict spring failure rates quickly at a very early stage of a prod- uct development cycle and to establish program reliability impact before commitment. The analytical method is essentially a com- bination of various existing procedures that are logically sequenced to compute a spring probability of failure under vari- ous operational conditions. Fatigue life of a mechanical component can be computed from its S-N curve. For steels, the S-N curve can be approximated by formulae which describe the fatigue life as a function of its endur- ance limit and its alternating stress. Most springs in service are preloaded and the actual stress fluctuates about a mean level. In order to compute an equivalent alternating stress with zero mean, an analytical method based on the Goodman Diagram is used. The endurance limit of a mechanical component will usually dif- fer from the endurance limit of the material determined from the laboratory tests conducted on a rotating-beam specimen. The endurance limit of the mechanical component will depend upon its surface finish, size, temperature, stress concentration and other factors. Having determined the fatigue life, the mean time between failure (MTBF) and the failure rate is computed based on the assumption of a constant failure rate. Once there is a reasonable correlation of the modeled spring failure rate to field test data, the information becomes very useful for early product development reliability assessment. Knowing the approximate failure rate of the spring for an assembly application provides valuable input for relaibility predictions, fault tree analyses, and FMECA (fail- ure modes, effect, and criticality analyses). 1991 SAE Transactions Section 5 910357. Comprehensive design reliability process for the auto- motive component industry via the integration of standard reli- ability methods. John Bieda and Drew A. Hoelscher ; AC Roches- ter Div., General Motors Corp. This paper will focus on the process, as used at AC Rochester, of performing reliability analyses early in the design phase of automotive component development and the integration of spe- cific techniques and methods. This methodology forms an effec- tive tool that achieves the identification of component failure modes and mechanisms with greater confidence than any single technique and provides for the simple and direct communication of the results. In addition, our experience shows that this process provides the maximum preventive impact on the product during the design phase, thus yielding demonstrably improved reliability characteristics on the production part. Specifically, a four-step up-front analysis process can facilitate the usefulness of various anaytical techniques to the identifica- tion of product reliability problems. This process will involve the integrative use of functional and reliability block diagrams, reli- ability prediction analysis, fault tree analysis and FMECA's to the evaluation of a product's design reliability. The results compiled in a form of a reliability information package help the responsible product engineers understand product reliability concerns and establish a base for sensitivity analyses. The information package also helps to achieve useful data for product life cycle cost evalua- tion, product reliability comparative studies, and information leading to successful achievement of validation. 910358. Probabilistic evaluation of automotive cold cranking performance. C. Julius Wang and Paul D. Misiti, Chrysler Corp. A probabilistic model proposed by Wang (1990) is summa- rized and extended to quantify the approximate cranking proba- bility at a specified confidence level. The criterion for acceptance is the ability of a randomly selected starter/battery set which delivers acceptable cold cranking performance on a specified engine application above a minimum targeted speed required to start. The model serves as a decision-making tool for engineers to 1) verify existing cranking system performance; 2) assess new combinations of existing cranking components; 3) evaluate the 50</page><page sequence="50">910358-910366 performance of newly developed cranking components; and 4) provide functional requirements of starter/battery sets for com- ponent sizing purposes. The model can be applied to perform trade-off analyses of cranking system performance with test results or computer simulation conclusions. An example is dis- cussed and engineering usage is illustrated. A sensitivity analysis is performed under the uncertainty of engine variability due to small testing sample size. Future research direction is also recom- mended. 1991 SAE Transactions Section S 910359. The discoloration of vinyl instrument panels by poly- urethane foam backing. John L.

Vinyl itself can be easily formulated to pass the most rigorous oven aging and light stability tests. With a semi-rigid polyurethane foam backing as is currently used in these applications even the most stable vinyls fail to pass proposed new specifications. This study deals with the mechanism of what is going on in the polyurethane backed vinyl that brings about this instability. 910360. New S/MA copolymer with outstanding long terms heat aging performance. R. F. Francis and AI Wambach , ARCO Chemical Co. Continuous improvement development activity has led to advances in materials used instrument panels. Long term heat aging characteristics of S/MA resins can be enhanced to the extent that critical properties are retained through the service life of the part. The extent of this improvement is presented. 910361. The full plastic car - Reality by using modular sys- tems. Eckhard Boigk , Bayer AG. After 100 years experience in designing and producing cars, the automotive industry is at the point of changing the philoso- phy of car design and assembly. Plastics helped all the time to ful- lfill customer demands, comfort, regulations like weight reduc- tion and safety standards. Engineering plastics will also help in the future to build cars based on modular systems. So the auto- motive designer can react very quickly to market changes on a low risk level. The use of engineering plastics will increase further in the direction of the full plastic car. 910362. Paper reinforced plastics for automotive application. Hiroyuki Wakabayashi, Nippondenso Technical Center, USA, Inc.; Fumio Kato , Nippondenso Co., Ltd.; and Noboru Yama- moto, Tonen Chemical Co., Ltd. Recently, it has become very popular to use reinforced polyolefines with talc, calcium carbonate, mica, glass fiber, etc. for industrial application. We have paid particular attention to recycled newspapers as one filler for polyolefine reinforcement based on technical interest in cellulose fiber properties of paper and conservation of paper resources. The compounding process, physical properties and injection moldability of paper reinforced polypropylene have been investi- gated. We have succeeded in developing a compounding process for newspaper and polypropylene with two high-speed mixers. Thus, the paper reinforced polypropylene has good physical properties, easy mold processability and light weight for indus- trial applications. 910363. New plastic coloring and forming system. Hideo Satake, Toshio Ohashi, and Katsumi Ui, Toyota Motor Corp.; and Hideo Shimizu , Toyo Ink Mfg. Co., Ltd. This paper describes a new plastic coloring and forming sys- tem. The system greatly reduces the time and amount of raw materials necessary for color changes, and eliminates the need for manual cleaning during a color change. This system is well-suited for small-lot production with fre- quent color changes, as well as for automated production sys- tems. The system is being used by auto parts makers, and is prac- tical in a variety of other fields involved with the coloring and forming of plastics. 910364. Window encapsulation- European experience and developments. Stefano Fini, Tecnos S.p.A. Window encapsulation with the polyurethane reaction injec- tion molding (RIM) technique, first developed in the USA, has now been adopted by major car manufacturers in Europe utiliz- ing advanced and automated production systems. This paper gives an overview of the present glass encapsula- tion applications among the European car industry and expected dvelopments. General information about state-of-the-art equipment and production systems currently employed in Europe completes the lecture. 910365. The development of primerless on-line paintable bumper. S. Ono, H. Tajima , and S. Morit, Nissan Shatai Co., Ltd. Recent trends in automotive design and aerodynamics increasingly lead to a "oneness" or unified image of the bumper with the body, this leads to requirements that the bumper meet the same high surface quality as the body, be capable of more complex geometry, while at the same time becoming larger. Currently in Japan, the typical approach is to use PP or PUR as a base material. As for the painting operation, a primer is applied and then the bumper must be painted off-line separately from the body. The purpose of this development effort was to: 1) improve color matching; 2) improve distinctness of image; 3) improve impact performance; 4) simplify the process, while at the same time; and 5) achieving a large cost reduction. The focus of this program was to develop a PPE (polyphenyl- ene ether)/PA (polyamide) bumper material, paint on-line with the body, and eliminate the primer system. The first step of this program was to establish the on-line pain- tability of the PPE/PA bumper system. This was then employed on the current model. Next, the primerless system was estab- lished with the goal of achieving cost down in addition to the per- formance and quality benefits already realized. Lastly, the com- bined process was validated for the primerless, on-line painting system (no primer, bumper and body painted together). 910366. (SP-853) Computer animation admissibility in the courtroom. Ian S. Jones, David W. Muir ; and Stephen W. Groo, Forensic Technologies International, Inc. Because accident reconstruction involves the simultaneous movements of vehicles and their occupants, it is often difficult to explain the sequence of events to lay audiences. Computer video animation provides a technique which allows the relative movement of vehicles to be illustrated as a function of time, and in three dimensions. As a consequence the technique has found increasing utility in the litigation arena. However, because of the flexibility that is available in creating computer animations, their admissibility in the courtroom can be brought into question. Therefore, it behooves the animator to address key admissibility issues before constructing an expensive and time consuming ani- mation. This paper discusses the admissibility issue. Major consider- ations include: qualification of the expert; the computer hardware and software used to generate the animation; qualification of the computer programs used to generate the engineering reconstruc- tion, plus the input/output and assumptions used in these pro- grams. Examples of different approaches are given to illustrate the various techniques that have been used successfully in prepar- ing animations for the courtroom. 51</page><page sequence="51">910367-910373 910367« (SP-853) An application of computer graphics for vehicle accident reconstruction. Hiroshi Makishita , M asaru Ueyama, and Shuji Saitoh, Mech. Engrg. Section , National Research Institute of Police Science. Accident reconstruction cannot be carried out without assumptions. So the assumptions must be examined to determine whether errors exist. In order to make this examination, it is desired to present the assumed accident scenes in a clear manner. In such cases where many vehicles are involved or behaviors of the involved vehicles are complicated, it is difficult to present the accident scenes by means of a two dimensional drawing or a clay model. Three dimensional computer graphics can be used as an effective means of presentation in these cases. Because once the computer models of accident scenes are made, they can be easily observed from any position of view and can be easily remade according to need. The purpose of this paper is to show how a computer graphics is used in the process of accident reconstruction. The case of a serious and complicated accident, which involved many vehicles, is illustrated and the process of the accident reconstruction is explained in order to illustrate this technique. 910368. (SP-853) Computer accident simulation pretty pic- tures and the real world. Ruedy W. Leeman , Douglas R. Brown , Rickey L. Stansifer, and Donald B. Uldricks, S.E.A., Inc.; and Dennis A. Guenther, Dept. of Mech. Engrg., Ohio State Univ. A computer accident simulation (CAS) is the application of dynamics to known physical evidence to yield a best approxima- tion of the interactions of vehicles and other objects during the rear world accident scenario. The simulation is based upon the reconstruction after an engineer's examination of the vehicles involved, the roadway (i.e., skid marks and gouges), and any sub- stantiated evidence from witnesses. Examples of various cases are presented to illustrate the engineer's accident reconstruction and how the reconstruction is used to establish the computer sim- ulation. The cases are used to explain the accuracy, features, advantages, and disadvantages of developing a computer acci- dent simulation. During the interaction of the engineer and the graphics specialist, extra information such as witness viewpoint needs to be attained to make the computer simulation. This results in a greater awareness of the individuals involved, a better prepared case, and a very informative and concise courtroom presentation. The extra preparation makes it possible for the judge and jury to view a very representational visual simulation of the engineer's analysis. 910369. (SP-853) Engineering visualization of vehicle acci- dents: Data sources and methods of production. Kent F. Martin and James A. Banister, Applied Visual Computing, Inc.; and Rob- ert L. Piziali, Failure Analysis Associates, Inc. Computer generated animation can be used very effectively as a tool in accident reconstruction. It is espcially effective in con- veying the results of engineering analysis to a non-technical audi- ence. This has been found particularly useful when describing dynamic events. This paper emphasizes methods for accurately portraying geometric data and object trajectories. Techniques will be explained in the context of an example accident recon- struction animation. Discussed, in particular, are the methods of having a comput- er-generated vehicle follow three-dimensional terrain, of accu- rately aligning photographic data with terrain data, and of accu- rately creating contour and profile lines. Also discussed are techniques for demonstrating both the methods used and the accuracy of the animated scenes. 910370. (SP-853) Computer-aided accident reconstruction: Its role in court. Thomas L. Bohan , Medical and Technical Consul- tants. As the computer software which has lightened and enlightened the work of the accident reconstructionist over the past several years moves into the courtroom, a debate has sprung up concern- ing the appropriateness of this latest form of scientific evidence. Both its admissibility as evidence and its use as "demonstrative evidence" have been questioned. The primary purpose of this paper is to sort out the several different categories of computer applications which are frequently lumped together as "accident reconstruction software," and then to distinguish on the basis of these categories the arguments regarding the courtroom use of data and images generated by this software. The paper also contains an attempt - based on current judicial scrutiny of scientific evidence - to predict the ultimate consensus which will emerge regarding the evidentiary use of computer- aided accident reconstruction results. Finally, there is a brief review of the present judicial acceptance of such results among the various U.S. and Canadian jurisdictions. 910371. The design of automotive catalyst supports for improved pressure drop and conversion efficiency. J. Paul Day, Corning, Inc.; and Louis S. Socha, Jr., Corning Inc. The current automotive catalytic converter is highly depend- able and provides excellent emissions reduction while at the same time it offers little resistance to the flow of gasses through the exhaust system. As automobile performance requirements increase, and as the allowable tailpipe emissions are tightened, there is a need on the one hand to reduce the back pressure even further, and on the other, to increase the already excellent cata- lytic performance. This paper will analyze the substrate factors which influence the pressure drop and conversion efficiency of the catalyst sys- tem. The converter frontal area has the most significant influence on both pressure drop and conversion efficiency, followed in order by part length, cell density, and wall thickness. 1991 SAE Transactions Section 4 910372. Optimization of substrate/washcoat interaction for improved catalyst durability. S. T. Gulati, Corning, Inc.; and B. J. Cooper, P. N. Hawker, J. M. K. Douglas, and D. J. W. Winter- born, Johnson Matthey. The substrate/washcoat systems which presever both the mechanical and thermal attributes of cordierite substrates are most desirable for prolonged durability of automotive catalysts. This paper provides a micromechanics viewpoint of substrate/ washcoat composite whose properties are predictable, measur- able and relevant to catalyst durability. The micromechanics model helps quantify substrate/washcoat interaction which con- trols the long-term catalyst performance. Three different exam- ples of substrate/washcoat systems are used here to illustrate the optimization process during the development of new substrates or washcoat technologies to meet the more stringent emission and durability requirements of advanced catalysts for the 1990s. 1991 SAE Transactions Section 4 910373. Coating experience on thin wall substrates. Mitsuyoshi Ichimura, N. E. Chemcat Corp. Thin wall substrates are requested by automobile companies to obtain lower back pressure and to provide lighter materials than conventional cordierite substrates. Cell strength was increased in thin wall substrates and, as a result, pore volume of the substrates was drastically decreased. Therefore, coatability of thin wall substrates is much worse than that of normal water absorption substrates. To improve the poor coatability, slurry properties of washcoat and coating machines are improved. Catalysts of thin wall substrates have been pro- duced on a commercial scale since 1987. The process coating experiences during this period are discussed in terms of coata- bility, catalyst physical properties, and catalytic performance in this paper. 52</page><page sequence="52">910374-910380 910374. High temperature creep behavior of ceramic and metal substrates. S. T. Gulati, Corning , Inc.; K. L. Geisinger, Cor- ning Inc.; and K. Pattabhi Reddy and David F. Thompson, Cor- ning, Inc. The high temperature creep data for radial specimens, cut from metal and ceramic substrates and subjected to compressive loads representative of mounting and thermal pressure are pres- ented as function of load and temperature. These data show that the creep resistance of metallic specimens under sustained load- ing varies with temperature and is orders of magnitude lower than that of ceramic specimens. The observed creep deformation in metallic specimens reduces their open frontal area and hydrau- lic diameter with potentially adverse impact on pressure drop across the metallic substrate. 910375. Isostatic strength of porous cordierite ceramic mono- liths. S. T. Gulati, Corning, Inc.; and D. K. S. Chen, AC Rochester Div., General Motors Corp. The isostatic strength of porous cordierite ceramic monoliths plays an important role during canning and subsequent operation of automotive catalysts. Its value depends on wall porosity, cell geometry, skin thickness and morphology, monolith size and contour, and substrate/washcoat interation. If the stresses induced by canning loads and closure speeds exceed the isostatic strength, the monolith may exhibit either crushing or shear type failure. This paper presents the room temperature isostatic strength data for coated and uncoated ceramic monoliths of different con- tour, size, and cell geometry. The applied isostatic load on the monolith is translated into stresses in the porous cell wall using both an analytical model and finite element analysis. It is found that the failure criteria are governed by the fundamental tensile and compressive strengths of the cell wall. The addition of alu- mina washcoat increases the isostatic strength as long as the sub- strate/washcoat interaction is carefully controlled during the coating process. The higher isostatic strength of coated monoliths facilitates the canning process and permits higher holding pres- sure, thereby enhancing their physical durability over the speci- fied lifetime of the vehicle. 910376. Rib selection to ensure optimum monolith stresses in catalytic converters. Anil Verma, AC Rochester Div., General Motors Corp. This paper presents a numerical approach to evaluate the opti- mum rib configuration in a catalytic converter shell in order to ensure the safest stress state in a cellular ceramic monolith under assembly conditions. Specifically, the paper seeks to determine the rib width and orientation. Numerical studies are conducted on an axisymmetric, ortho- tropic, finite element model of a ceramic monolith to simulate the stresses under converter assembly conditions. Different rib widths and orientations are modeled. The ceramic monolith is modeled as a homogeneous continuum. The macroscopic stress state is transformed into stresses in the cell walls. The micro- scopic stresses are then compared to the base material strengths in order to determine monolith integrity. 1991 SAE Transactions Section 4 910377. Improving the cold start combustion in methanol fueled spark ignition engines by means of prompt EGR.D. P. Gar- diner, V. K. Rao, and M. F. Bardon, Dept. of Mech. Engrg., Royal Military College ; and V. Battista, Transport Canada. A methanol fueled single cylinder research engine was tested under simulated cold start conditions of 0°C. The engine instru- mentation provided dynamic measurements of pressures and temperatures in the cylinder, inlet port, and exhaust port. Ini- tially, tests were conducted to gain a better understanding of the metabolism of methanol cold starting under limit conditions. Following these tests the exhaust charged cycle (ECC), a form of prompt exhaust gas recirculation, was employed as a means of improving in-cylinder mixture formation during starting. Tests using a special camshaft to obtain prompt EGR showed that successful starts using neat methanol could be achieved if ignition occurred during cranking. Thus, unlike the standard engine configuration, the ignition and starting limits with the prompt EGR system were essentially the same. Prompt EGR typ- ically gave higher and earlier peak cylinder pressures and pro- duced heat release rates which were unusually rapid for cold start conditions. As well the modified system was found to be much more tolerant of the post-start and run-up fueling calibration strategy than the standard system, making it easier to achieve idle speed without stalling. 1991 SAE Transactions Section 4 910378. Electro-fluidic devices as fuel injectors for spark- ignition engine fuel injection systems. Chiang Q. Huang, Nigel J. Leighton, and B arrie Jones, Mech. Engrg. Dept., Birmingham Univ. A prototype fluidic fuel injection system for spark-ignition (SI) engines has been established and tested. The fluidic injector unit combines a non-moving part wall reattachment type fluidic device powered by a solenoid puiser interface and an air-fuel mix- ing nozzle for good fuel atomization. It is demonstrated that the fluidic injector unit is capable of operating in a pulse modulated control mode and that the fluidic injector stage performs on-off switching in 1-1.5 msec. The use of a fast response fluidic device coupled to a low power electric-fluidic interface potentially offers considerable cost and performance benefits for SI engine fuel injection systems. 910379. The effect of oxygen content in different oxygenate- gasoline blends on performance and emissions in a single cylin- der, spark-ignition engine. H. C. Taljaard, C. F. P. Jordaan, and J. J. Botha, Sasol Oil R&amp;D. The effect of oxygenates in gasoline on exhaust emissions and performance was studied in a single cylinder, four-stroke spark- ignition engine. The performance of the engine, in terms of power output and specific fuel consumption, did not alter significantly upon the addition of oxygenates to a synthetic hydrocarbon base stock gasoline. Furthermore, the exhaust emissions (CO, HC, NOx) decreased, whilst the exhaust temperatures marginally increased with increasing oxygen content of the fuel. Oxygenates significantly decreased CO, NOx, and HC emissions at the stoi- chiometric air/fuel ratio. The leaning effect of adding oxygenates is determined by the oxygen content and not the type of oxygen- ate, blended with the hydrocarbon base stock. 910380. The total effect of a reformulated gasoline on vehicle emissions by technology (1973 to 1989). Gary A. Schoonveld, Phil- lips Petroleum Co.; and William F. Marshall, National Institute of Petroleum and Energy Research. Several gasoline supply companies have introduced versions of reformulated gasolines to gain experience in manufacturing, transporting, and marketing this new type of gasoline while pro- viding environmental benefits. This paper describes the evalua- tion of one such reformulated gasoline on a variety of engine and vehicle technologies. The reformulated gasoline tested in this program is marketed exclusively in the metropolitan St. Louis area. Thus, a side-by- side comparison of fuels representing the average gasoline sold in St. Louis and the reformulated gasoline was made. The reformu- lated gasoline was blended at the limits of established manufac- turing specifications to provide a conservative estimate of the environmental benefits of such a fuel. Emissions and driveability performance of both fuels were tested in cars representing four distinct vehicle technologies. The technology classes represented were non-catalyst, open loop oxi- dation catalyst, closed loos non-adaptive three-way catalyst, and 53</page><page sequence="53">910380-910385 adaptive learning three-way catalyst equipped vehicles. A total of eight vehicles was tested ranging in model years from 1973 to 1989. The standard Federal Test Procedure with a modified prep- aration cycle was employed to evaluate the vehicle emission response. Exhaust and evaporative emission measurements were made with complete hydrocarbon specification and toxic identifi- cation. Results of the comparative testing indicated significant reduc- tions of carbon monoxide, total hydrocarbons, oxides of nitro- gen, benzene and 1,3 butadiene in 1980 and newer vehicles. Older vehicles (pre-1980) also showed significant reductions of diurnal evaporative hydrocarbon emissions, carbon monoxide, oxides of nitrogen and benzene but increases in hot soak hydrocarbon emissions. All cars showed increases in formaldehyde emissions with the older cars also showing increases in acetaldehyde. The data were used to model the impact of this new gasoline formulation on the St. Louis metropolitan area. The Environ- mental Protection Agency's MOBILE4 inventory mode was employed to project benefits for the years 1995 and 2005 should all gasoline sold in the St. Louis area be the tested reformulated gasoline. 1991 SAE Transactions Section 4 910382. Distillation adjustment: An innovative step to gasoline . reformulation. Jeff A. Gething, Chevron Research and Technology Co. Four vehicle emissions test programs deomonstrated the ben- eficial effects of modifying gasoline distillation characteristics on vehicle emissions. The initial program tested two modern vehi- cles with a wide variety of fuels, including the testing of individ- ual fuel blending components as if they were gasolines. A second program tested five modern vehicles with a matrix of fuels which varied aromatics and distillation characteristics independently. The third program tested two premium unleaded gasolines in 20 vehicles with a variety of emissions control systems. One of the fuels represented an average production gasoline, and the other was a reformulated gasoline designed to produce lower emis- sions. The fourth program tested some of the same fuels and an eight-vehicle subset from the third program at an independent laboratory. Besides exhaust emissions testing, the independent laboratory tested these vehicles to evaluate the effect of reformu- lated gasoline on evaporative emissions. All of the results indicate that a gasoline's distillation charac- teristics have a large impact on exhaust hydrocarbon (HC) emis- sions. Decreasing the overall distillation characteristics of a gaso- line (that is, lowering the temperatures at which all portions of the gasoline vaporize) decreases HC emissions. The Driveability Index sufficiently describes the overall distillation characteristics of a gasoline and correlates well with the exhaust hydrocarbon changes indicated in these programs. The largest impact of modi- fying a gasoline's distillation characteristics is apparent in the hydrocarbon emissions in the first phase (cold transient) of EPA's Federal Test Procedure. 1991 SAE Transactions Section 4 910383. Capabilities of sheet molding composite in the automi- tive industry: An overview. Arthur M. Flax, SMC Automotive Alli- ance. Automakers can realize design, manufacturing and finished product advantages when sheet molding composite is chosen for the appropriate auto or truck body, engine and structural applica- tions. This paper will: describe the capabilities of automotive SMC; discuss properties of SMC, including its composition, strength and stiffness, and describe the suitability of these proper- ties to particular automotive applications; provide examples of automotive SMC applications and discuss how SMC can be for- mulated and engineered to meet the needs of specific automotive applications; and describe the capabilities of the SMC industry. 910384. Advances in thermoset injection molding. K. E. Atkins, R. L. Seats, and G. C. Rex, Union Carbide Chemicals and Plastics Co. Inc. Injection molding of thermosetting materials such as low pro- file SMC/BMC composites found increasing application in the transportation industry in the eighties. Such automotive parts as front end panels and rear/hatchback doors have grown in usage. The rear doors have reached exceptional production levels of 2500/day in a single plant. The injection process offers the advantages of greater automa- tion for the mass production of body panel parts compared to compression molding. However, the injection molding of fiber reinforced low profile composites suffers from a severe reduction in physical properties. This is particularly true for impact strength which can be one-third that of similar compression molding materials. A primary reason for this is due to the degra- dation of the reinforcement during the processing/molding. Efforts at increasing the physical properties through processing changes have many times caused problems with the surface smoothness of the moldings. Should major improvements in impact strength be coupled with excellent surface appearance the injection process could be applicable to automotive hoods, doors, deck lids, etc. The resultant application of automation could pro- vide a more favorable cost structure for these composites versus metal even at high volumes of production. This paper reports on a concerted study of this problem involving examination of the organic matrix system, shrinkage control materials, interfacial agents, glass sizing changes, chemi- cal thickening and various processing parameters and injection molding machines. This work has resulted in truly super Class A surface molding at impact strengths 80% above those of the best standard injection materials. Progress of this nature signals the beginning of a new day in low profile thermoset injection mold- ing. 1991 SAE Transactions Section 5 910385. Optimization of an SMC system for maximum surface smoothness - GM APV van hood study case. Frank W. Bradish, Premix /E.M. S . Inc. Sheet molding composite (SMC) technology has advanced sig- nificantly in the surface smoothness and appearance of compres- sion molded automotive exterior body component parts over the past five years. An example of that new technology is the General Motors' APV Van Hood. As judged visually on vehicles and measured quantitatively in the laboratory, not only by the SMC molder and fabricator, but by other SMC molders and the automotive customer, this SMC hood sets a new SMC industry standard for surface appearance for thermoset composite exterior automotive body panels. The appearance of the GM APV Van Hood was the result of a total system approach to material and process optimization. Teamwork and partnership concepts contributed significantly and leveraged the application of technology. Key program development factors included the evolution of new SMC materials technology, the development of methodol- ogy for the accurate quantification of surface smoothness, the development and application of new tooling procedures and stan- dards, the characterization of press dynamic mechanical and thermal behavior, and the optimization and control of adhesive bonding and paint priming processes. The APV Van hood pro- gram resulted from the effective integration of technical activities focused on understanding and controlling fundamental material and process interrelationships to derived controlled, capable manufacturing processes. The end result is a high-visibility SMC exterior automotive body panel assembly with surface smoothness and appearance equivalent or better than sheet metal! 54</page><page sequence="54">910385-910391 The GM APV Van Hood represents the capability and com- mitment of the SMC industry to be responsive to increasing cus- tomer needs and requirements, to technical innovation as a means of market growth, and to a total system approach to meet- ing the challenges of the future. 1991 SAE Transactions Section 5 910386. The state of polyurethane structural adhesive technol- ogy in the transportation industry. Gregory M. Maclver, Ashland Chemical, Inc. The purpose of this paper is to outline the current state of poly- urethane bonding technology in the transportation industry. The paper focuses on the strengths and limitations of this technology and the reasons for its long-term success in the market place. Significant advances have been made in the range of end use applications for polyurethane structural adhesives. The introduc- tion of the new General Motor's Lumina, Silhouette, and Trans- port mini vans has created the largest assembly line use of struc- tural adhesive to bond SMC body panels to date. Molders and manufacturers of more traditional SMC assemblies have made noteworthy improvements in productivity with fast cure bonding cycles and simplified production processes using polyurethane technology. Auto makers have continued to capitalize on the cost and per- formance benefits of bonded composite body vehicles for spe- cialty niche markets. This is following the successful tradition established by the General Motors Chevrolet Corvette. These advances will be explained by examining specific bond- ing applications. High volume assembly will be described through the GM APV program. Rapid cure and simplified assem- bly will be covered with GM W-car spoilers and Corvette sub- assemblies, and new specialty niche vehicles through Chrysler's viper program. The recent market expansion of polyurethane structural add- hesives has occurred, in part, because of their unique combina- tion of bonding performance and manufacturing processability. The ability to custom design polyurethane adhesives to achieve specific physical and chemical performance will be reviewed. Waste minimization and environmental safety are key manufac- turing concerns. These issues will also be addressed through material handling and dispensing techniques. 910387. Recycling of thermoset automotive components. Arthur M. Flax, W. David Graham, George N. Hartt, and Charles N. Cucuras, SMC Automotive Alliance. The suppliers of sheet molding composite to the automotive industry recognize their responsibility to ensure that environ- mentally sound recycling techniques are in place for SMC as its use increases in automotive applications. To this end, automo- tive SMC molders and their material suppliers are investigating recycling processes which create the opportunity to produce via- ble products from recycled SMC. This paper will: introduce recycling processes available for SMC; describe the preparation of scap SMC, from the point at which discarded vehicles and scrap SMC is collected, to the point at which SMC enters the recycling process; describe alternative recycling processes including pyrolysis and regrinding; describe the equipment necessary for recycling processes; discuss the char- acteristics and structural properties of the products from recy- cling processes and offer potential applications for those prod- ucts; provide an economic overview of the pyrolysis and regrind- ing recycling options; and compare recycling options with dis- posal options. 1991 SAE Transactions Section 5 910389. Fuel efficiency and response of load control methods for premixed charge engines. Wayne M. Brehob, Lawrence Tech- nological Univ.; and Diana D. Brehob, Dept. of Mech. Engrg ., University of Minnesota. The term engine readiness is proposed as an additional con- cept which should be considered when evaluating among various options for controlling power in homogeneous charge, SI engines. Although improving part load fuel economy is a desirable goal, engine readiness should not be sacrificed in the process. A variety of methods for power control are identified. In general, those which provide superior part load fuel economy suffer from poor response to driver demand, i.e., readiness, and vice versa. Other concerns of load control techniques: range, step size, cost, noise, emissions, safety, complexity, etc., are also considered. 910390. Fuel injection control systems that improve three way catalyst conversion efficiency. Hideaki Katashiba, Minoru Nishida, and Shoichi Washino, Industrial Electronics and Sys- tems Development Lab., Mitsubishi Electric Corp; and Akira Takahashi, Tohru Hashimoto, and Mitsuhiro Miyaki, Mitsubishi Motors Corp. A fuel control method to reduce the harmful exhaust gas from SI engines is proposed. As is well known, both the amplitude and the frequency of the limit cycle in a conventional air-fuel ratio control system are determined uniquely by parameters in the sys- tem, and this limits our making full use of the oxygen storage effect of TWC. A simple model of TWC reaction revealed the relationship between maximum conversion efficiency and both the amplitude and the frequency in an air fuel control system. It also revealed that TWC conversion efficiency attained to maximum levels when both the amplitude and the frequency of the limit cycle are selected so as to make full use of the oxygen storage effect of TWC. In order to achieve this, it is necessary to vary both the amplutide and the frequency arbitrarily. Superimposing a modu- lation signal (artifical modulation) with a higher frequency than the conventional one on the fuel control signal is able to vary the amplitude of the limit cycle independently of the frequency. This means artificial modulation can always operate TWC at its maxi- mum conversion efficiency. A remarkable improvement by our artificial modulation was confirmed in both the engine dyna- mometer test and US Federal Test. 1991 SAE Transactions Section 4 910391. Decrease emissions by adaptive air-fuel ratio control. Bian Yaozhang and Huang Yiqun, Xian Highway Institute. Nowadays design and production of carburetor can not make the mixture of carburetor fit in with the ideal value of A/F ratio on all running conditions, the method of using micro-processor control A/F ratio can solve this problem. In this paper, the self- tuning and adaptive control method was used to realize the opti- mal control for A/F ratio. Based on the open-loop control, this method was combined with the close-loop control. The adaptive control method of using difference of slope change at the lowest specific fuel consumption point on fuel adjustment curve has wide adaptive ability. It is superior to the open-loop control, and does not need to use expensive exhaust gas oxygen sensor and other detect sensors compared with other close-loop control. The method that uses the rate of speed change to add air perturbation as feed-back signal is easy to use practi- cally. By the test on engine test stand, the method of using micro- processor being compared with original engine (EQ-6100Q engine), which has been carefully adjusted, the results show that this A/F ratio control method can decrease HC emission about 30%, CO emission about 40%, specific fuel consumption about 10%. The control system does not need to measure the A/F ratio, but it has enough control accuracy and be put conveniently into practical use. 55</page><page sequence="55">910392-910399 910392. Modeling of unsteady multiphase flow in the intake manifold of spark ignition engines. Fadila Maroteaux Benyettou and Michel Thelliez, University of Paris VI. Experimental studies show that spark ignition engines under unsteady operation are subject to a temporary equivalence ratio excursion. This phenomenon can lead to lean misfiring and/or high pollution levels. In this paper, we propose a model that describes this phenom- enon by an unsteady annular dispersed flow with two compo- nents, air and fuel (film and droplets). The results show that the modeling reproduces well the equiv- alence ratio excursions in transient operation, as well as response times comparable to those observed experimentally. Besides, and although they have a small response time, the droplet population can play a great part into the equivalence ratio excursions. Fur- thermore, the model analyses the influence of some parameters such as: the droplet deposition rate; the air temperature; the ini- tial droplet diameter; etc. 910393. Development of brushless fuel pump. Koichi Mine , Shingo Nakanishi , Shigetaka Takada, and Hitoshi Takeuchi, Aisan Industry Co., Ltd. To achieve a clean atmospheric environment and a stable fuel supply, considerations are being given to the use of methanol fuel as one of the fuel used by alternative fuel vehicles. This report describes the development and studies of a brush- less motor-driven fuel pump to be employed for a methanol elec- tronic fuel injection system. Several problems remained to be solved for the fuel pumps used with methanol fuel, and hence considerations were given to the following items: 1) a control unit was developed that can be used in high-pressure fuel. This unit has been downsized substan- tially due to the adoption of a system in which it is subjected to forced cooling with the fuel. The control unit can be mounted inside the fuel pump; and 2) in order to cope with increased fuel consumption and other needs, the specifications of the motor and pump were studied, and highly corrosion-resistant materials were used for various components, increasing the performance and durability of the pump substantially. 1991 SAE Transactions Section 6 910394. A testing equipment for measuring fuel permeability of plastic fuel line tubing. A. Weber, J. Hubold, J. Müller, and J. J. Linster, EMS-Chemie AG. An easily implemented laboratory method for measuring fuel- permeability through plastic tubes, while controlling fuel temper- ature and pressure independently, is presented. This is achieved with a recirculating system in which fuel permeated through the tubing wall is evaporated and collected by a controlled flow of nitrogen and absorbed in activated carbon. A formula is given by which fuel-permeability under standard conditions of temperature and pressure can be predicted for plas- tic parts of any shape and thickness. A particular embodiment of the test equipment allows, in addition, the measurement of tube length change under the same experimental conditions. 1991 SAE Transactions Section 6 910395. Automotive training: "A new process of learning" - A nationwide thrust./. Kenneth Cerny, DAS ; and Donald L. Levons , Sears Roebuck and Co. Sears Roebuck and Co., Automotive Training Department has implemented a new "process of learning." The process was based upon performance criteria designed to increase technician productivity, improve job task accuracy and ensure completeness of service repairs. This paper describes the learning process, a self-study approach, training center-based and field clinic approaches used to deliver the training. Four approaches to the evaluation of the performance of technicians is presented. One training center-based program is detailed in this paper and explains the new "process of learning." The training pro- gram, "brake system diagnosis and repair" was the 1990 recipient of the Grand Award for excellence in training from the Automo- tive Training Managers Council. Many of the elements identified by the SAE, Technician Training Committee are found in the Sears approach to training. 910396. Determining value of technical training by statistical analysis. Bill B. Burris, Jaguar Cars Inc. In today's customer satisfaction-driven marketplace, modern automotive training programs must accurately determine their value and effectiveness to be competitive. There are sound statis- tical methods of analyzing student test data that can more accu- rately determine a technician's achievement than a "final exam". Intra-course testing can be used by technical instructors to determine entry level understanding and help technicians get acclimated to written tests. This data serves multiple purpose: to determine a statistical baseline for each technician, and to give the instructor feedback as to the group's needs so he/she can make curriculum modifications as necessary. Test questions should be of a type already known to most tech- nicians (such as ASE-style) to avoid conftision. Skill improve- ment can be quantified by score improvement over the time span of a technical course, providing automotive training groups an accurate reflection of the effectiveness of their program. 910397. Making performance pay through training. Gary J. Corrigan, Dana Corp. How do you measure the effectiveness of a training program? This question is similar to one people ask about the effectiveness of advertising. The story goes that all advertising is only 50% effective. The problem is finding out which 50% that is. Dana Corporation identified a problem that affected engine part sales. Lack of quality machinist training was critical to the growth and expansion of machine shops. Fewer machine shops mean fewer parts sold. After a needs analysis was completed, the Data solution was to offer their customers machine shop training. Measuring the effectiveness of this training was accomplished in several ways. Paper and pencil evaluations (smile sheets), fol- low-up telephone surveys and skill mastery exercises were a few of the methods used to measure the training program. The diffi- culty in obtaining evidence was partially attributed to the fact that customers were trained and not Dana employees. Some key questions need to be answered if one wants their training program to be accountable. Do I have specific budget for training? Does my business train its customers how to use, sell and promote its products and services? Is my business's training program part of my cost control/profit strategy? Does my busi- ness have at least one person responsible for training? These are critical questions that need to be answered if one wants to make performance pay through training. 910399. Development of ceramic coated exhaust manifolds for heavy duty diesel engines. K. Itoh and K. Ohtsuka, Advanced Materials Research Lab., Hitachi Metals, Ltd.; T. Nagata and M. Nakamizo, Production Control Dept., Kyushu Works, Hitachi Metals, Ltd.; K. Morikawa, New Products Development and Mar- keting, Kurosaki Refractories Co., Ltd.; S. Kanoh, Materials Dept., Hino Motors Ltd.; and T. Yamazaki, Engine Research and Development Dept., Hino Motors, Ltd. Along with the effort to improve engines for exhaust gas emis- sion reduction and high power performance, the increment of exhaust gas temperature emerged as a new problem causing inner surface oxidation and thermal deformation of exhaust manifolds particularly. Under such circumstance, a novel ceramic coating exhaust manifold has been developed. This coating is composed two lay- ers. The inner layer is oxidation resistant layer of comparably 56</page><page sequence="56">910399-910407 compact structure having same thermal expansion coefficient as the cast iron substrate, and the outer one is thermal insulating layer of very porous structure. These two coating layers have, therefore, made it possible to withstand the crack and peeling off because of the thermal impact of high temperature exhaust gas and made it applicable to the complex figured inner surface. This newly development coating process shall convert a con- ventional ductile iron manifold to a superior heat resistant mani- fold by application of the ceramic coating. 910400. Development of abradable flame spray coating tech- nology. Masashi Ito, Syoji Ikawa, Kimimasa Murayama, and Masaaki Sano, Toyota Motor Corp. The authors, et al. have succeeded in the practical application of the abradable flame spray coating, used in aircraft engines for the prevention of air leakage and the improvemnet of efficiency, to automobile turbochargers for the first time in the world. Two layers consisting of a bond coated layer and an abradable layer used to be coated by separate spray nozzles under the con- ventional technique. In this paper, equations of relations between various flame spray coating conditions and the quality of coated film, which were derived from measured results, will be described. Flame spray coating conditions, that allow the double layer coating by the same spray nozzle, have been determined for each layer. Temperatures and speeds of the flame were measured by means of two-color type high-speed cameras, and equations of their rela- tions with the flame spray coating conditions are derived from the measured result. Melting conditions of spray powders were also considered based on the foregoing, and the validity of flame spray coating conditions determined under this study is verified. 910401. Hot-gas spin testing of ceramic radial turbine rotor at TIT 1400°C. Yoshito Kobayashi, Mitsubishi Motors Corp.; Eito Matsuo, Mitsubishi Heavy Industries America, Inc.; Toharu Ina - g a ki, Mitsubishi Heavy Industries, Ltd.; and Tadao Ozawa, NGK Insulators, Ltd. The reliability of silicon nitride radial turbine rotors for auto- motive gas turbine was evaluated with hot-gas spin test and reli- ability analysis. The turbine rotors were made of a newly devel- oped silicon nitride, having a 4 point bending strength higher than 700 MPa at 1400°C. The turbine rotors withstood at a tur- bine tip speed of 500m/s at TIT 1400°C, the same level as the rated condition of turbine rotors for the two-shaft type automo- tive gas turbines. The reliability of turbine rotors is discussed in relation to the hot-gas spin test results and failure probability analysis using CARES program developed by NASA as well as three-dimensional flow analysis and finite element analysis. 1991 SAE Transactions Section 5 910402. Property characterization of PC/ABS blends for use in energy management applications. Daryl Hertema, Dow Chemi- cal Co. With the implementation of air bags into today's vehicles, the functional requirements of the instrument panel have changed significantly. Screening of different candidate systems is difficult due to the expense and time involved in testing to the FMVSS requirements. Plastic material properties also vary with tempera- ture and strain rate which increases the complexity of the testing required. It is the objective of this paper to investigate the response of PC/ABS blends to this environment. Also, a sum- mary of mathematically modeling plastic materials with com- mercial software in energy management environments is pres- ented. This paper will discuss the results of testing PC/ABS blends at strain rates and temperatures typical to that of impact condi- tions and correlation of these tests to different material models used in finfite element codes. 910403. Thermoplastic glass mat reinforced knee bolster development. Tim A. Brademeyer, Inland Fisher Guide Div., Gen- eral Motors Corp. The desire to combine the roles of the instrument panel carrier with structural functions traditionally fulfilled by steel reinforce- ment and tie bars provided the catalyst to search for a material and construction capable of combining the advantages of plastic processing with the structural characteristics of steel. Candidate materials and constructions were initially judged against a criteria list of design flexibility, tooling cost and leadtime, piece cost, developmental leadtime, product maturity, weight, and physical properties. The most promising alternates were tooled and tested with a knee impactor and a barrier sled in order to assess performance to occupant safety objectives. Ultimately, a thermoplastic composite proved capable of meeting all the struc- tural requirements while enhancing design flexibility and reduc- ing tooling leadtime and cost, piece cost, and vehicle mass. 1991 SAE Transactions Section 5 910404. Fundamental studies of polyurethane foam for energy absorption in automotive interiors. James A. Thompson-Colón, Mobay Corp.; Mark Huber, Chrysler Motors Corp.; and John W. Liddle, Mobay Corp. This paper describes and characterizes energy-absorbing poly- urethane foam as exemplified foam made with Bayfill EA sys- tems. This paper emphasizes its use for automotive passive restraint systems. Static and dynamic properties will be pres- ented. In addition the effect of velocity, weight, density, and vehi- cle environment on energy absorption will be discussed. 910405. Development of a thermoplastic composite knnebol- ster. Murry C. Kaufman, GE Plastics ; and Michael J. Larson and Alan J. Barrett, Chrysler Motors Corp. A first surface thermoplastic composite knee bolster system has been developed by Chrysler Corporation for the Eagle Pre- mier vehicle, resulting in a major breakthrough for occupant safety interior design. It provides significant weight and cost sav- ings versus the multi-piece steel assembly it replaced. This new design, in conjunction with a motorized two point seat belt sys- tem, meets all FMVSS 208 requirements for occupant protection and safety. 1991 SAE Transactions Section S 910407. (SP-854) A geared infinitely variable transmission for automotive applications. Frank A. Fitz and Paul B. Pires, Epilogics, Inc. Epilogics, a young engineering firm in Los Gatos, CA, has developed the first fully-geared, high torque, high efficiency, infi- nitely variable transmission (IVT) suitable for automotive appli- cations. To prove its torque capacity, Epilogics demonstrated a prototype of its patented transmission concept in a Class VII die- sel truck in June 1989. In addition to being ideally suited as a transmission for motor vehicle drivetrains, the IVT can provide a means to efficiently and flexibly drive engine accessories inde- pendently of engine speed. Products have already been designed or built to drive alternators at a constant speed (irrespective of engine/vehicle speed) and to control cooling fan speeds indepen- dently of engine/vehicle speed. Outside of automotive applica- tions, experimental designs of automatically adjusting manual sailboat winches and continuously variable bicycle transmissions have been implemented. Under normal operating conditions, the efficiency of the Epilogics transmission exceeds 90% as derived mathematically and corroborated experimentally. The device does not rely on traction to transmit torque and can therefore match the torque capacity of any typical gear drive. The size, weight, and cost of the device closely approximates that of a four- speed manual transmission. 57</page><page sequence="57">910408-910418 910408. (SP-854) The design and development of an experi- mental traction drive CVT for 2.0 litre FWD passenger car. Thomas G. Fellows and Christopher J. Greenwood, Torotrak Development Ltd. A high power continuously variable ratio transmission (CVT) is being developed based on a double sided, full toroidal traction drive variator with a novel control system. Road trials in a 107 kW passenger car are now in progress, having been preceded by computer modeling and component rig tests. 1991 SAE Transactions Section 6 910409. (SP-854) Modeling, simulation and control implemen- tation for a split-torque, geared- ne ut ral, infinitely variable trans- mission. Hamid Vahabzadeh and Samuel M. Linzell, Power Sys- tems Research Dept., General Motors Research Labs. Split-torque, geared-neutral transmissions have been shown to improve vehicle performance over a conventional continuously variable transmission. Although control of these transmissions has presented significant problems in the past, we have been able to achieve good driveability and fuel economy through the use of an integrated engine/transmission control philosophy. Development of the transmission/engine control strategies are based on detailed dynamic models and computer simulations of the driveline. In developing the control laws, specific attention has been given to providing characteristics similar to that of a conventional automatic transmission, such as creep and hill- holding capabilities. Test results show adequate transmission response with high initial jerk if demanded, excellent stability at the geared-neutral point, and smooth transitions through the synchronous point as well as in all other driving conditions. 1991 SAE Transactions Section 6 910410. (SP-854) SCVT a state of the art electronically con- trolled continuously variable transmission. Sadayuki Hirano, Suzuki Motor Corp.; and Alan L. Miller and Karl F. Schneider, Borg-Warner Automotive, Inc. Described in this paper is the design and development of an electronically controlled continuously variable transmission. The development was carried out by a Japanese and American part- nership for use in vehicles with lOOOcc and 1300cc engines. This paper describes the technical features of the transmission and the development of the starting clutch, hydraulic control, electronic control, and the chain belt sheave system. The test results of vehicle performance and fuel economy are included. 1991 SAE Transactions Section 6 910412. Stress relaxation behavior of magnesium die casting alloys. T. Kr. Aune, Norsk Hydro Magnesium Tech.; and D. L. Albright, Norsk Hydro Magnesium Div. The phenomenon of stress relaxation in a solid corresponds to a time-dependent decrease in stress under given constraint conditions. An apparatus for stress relaxation compression test- ing was constructed and utilized to evaluate a series of die cast magnesium alloys. The behavior of the alloys was determined over a 100 hour test period. In general, the percentage of stress remaining after this time decreased with increased initial stress and with increased test temperature. Of the materials tested, mag- nesium alloy AE21 showed the best relaxation resistance relative to 383 aluminum alloy. 910413. Properties of magnesium plaster castings. Nicolas Fantetti, Andreas Thorvaldsen, and Alain Couture, Institute of Magnesium Technology. The demand for magnesium prototypes is growing very rap- idly with the increasing number of new applications for magne- sium die castings. Plaster mold casting is becoming more used amongst all other prototyping methods because it can produce castings with thin walls, smooth surface finish and close dimen- sional tolerances. However, plaster mold casting of magnesium alloys has only been used until now by a few foundries because of the risks of violent reaction if the process is not carefully con- trolled. For this reason, very little quantitative information about properties of plaster cast magnesium alloys is available in the lit- erature. In this study, mechanical, corrosion resistance and microstructural properties of alloy AZ91E are reported as a first phase of the work being conducted at the Institute. As cast (F), solution annealed (T4) and solution annealed and aged (T6) properties of 12,5 mm (V2 inch) diameter test bars were studied. The influence of chilling, grain refining and combination of both was investigated. Comparative data on corrosion resistance of plaster cast and sand cast plates are also reported. The experimental results show that: chilling and grain refining significantly improve the mechanical properties of plaster cast AZ91E alloy; solution annealing and aging heat treatment further increases the mechanical properties of plaster cast AZ91E; and the corrosion rate measured in preliminary tests for plaster cast AZ91E is lower than that of sand cast AZ91E. 910415. Machining magnesium with water base coolants. Allan Spicer, Joe Kosi, Jake Pajek, and Chris Billups, Magnesium Products Ltd. Magnesium Products Limited has been very successful in con- verting from machining magnesium die castings dry to machin- ing with oil-in-water emulsuions, more comonly called water sol- uble oils. When machining with water soluble coolants one can expect: 1) excellent fire protections; 2) improve tool life; 3) ease of house- keeping; and 4) improved productivity. Problems previously encountered with water soluble coolants such as splitting out of solution, hydrogen gas generation, and salt deposits on tools and machines have been singled out and addressed, with solutions tested in production environments. 910416. Creep of diecast magnesium alloys AZ91D and AM60B. Chris Suman, AMAX R&amp;D, Magnesium Corp. of Amer- ica. Long term creep tests of diecast AZ91D and AM60B were con- ducted for periods of 30 days to nine months at temperatures up to 150°C. Stresses from 19 to 111 MPa were employed. Thermally activated creep did not occur when the temperature was below 100°C and the stress below 25 MPa. Under these conditions the creep rate eventually diminished to zero. AZ91D metal matrix composite specimens reinforced with 15 volume percent silicon carbide creep tested at 150°C exhibited much improved creep resistance over monolithic AZ91D. 910417. Clearance and Reynolds number efTects on the effi- ciency of radial flow compressors. Wilbur A. Spraker, Jr., Sch- witzer Inc. The effects of Reynolds number and contour clearance on cen- trifugal compressor efficiency are considered based on experi- mental data and an analytical model. Results allow a usefully accurate estimation of the effects of variation of these parame- ters. 1991 SAE Transactions Section 3 910418. Second law analysis of turbocharged engine opera- tions. Fabio Bozza, Roberto Nocera, Adolfo Senatore, and Raff- aele Tuccillo, Dipartimento di Ingegneria Meccanica per l'Energetica, Universita' di Napoli. In this paper the turbocharged diesel engine operation is ana- lyzed by means of a second law based method. The instantaneous release and storage of availability inside the several components (cylinders, manifolds, compressor and turbine) are evaluated by following a theoretical-experimental methodology that has been recently proposed by the authors. 58</page><page sequence="58">910418-910424 Examples of availability balances are compared for different values of some parameters which influence the combustion and the exhaust process, or for several arrangements of the engine and turbomachine system. The availability analysis of the engine transient development will show the amounts of mechanical energy employed for both in-cylinder storage and turbocharger acceleration and of those available for conversion into external output. These amounts will be compared with the fuel availability and with those destroyed during the several processes (i.e. combustion, gas exchange, tur- bocharger operation). 1991 SAE Transactions Section 3 910419. Hybrid charging system for heavy duty diesel engines. T. Tornita and D. Ishihara , Ishikawajima , Harmia Heavy Indus- tries Co., Ltd.; and N. Kondoh, A. Ohkita, and N. Ikeya , Ishikawa- jima, Harima Heavy Industries Co., Ltd. In Japan, the next stage exhaust gas emission registration will be introduced around 1994. In case of heavy duty diesel engines, the level of NOx will be limited to 6.0g/kWh and the limit of par- ticulate will be added to it. Its limit will be 0.7g/kWh. In U.S.A., regulation of particulate was already effective in 1988 and it will be tightened in 1991 and 1994. To pass these regulations, turbo- charging with an intercooler is recommended to increase air flow, because reduction of black smoke at high load condition will be achieve by the improvement of combustion process. Also it will reduce negative effects by retard of injection timing that reduce NOx level. Although this improvement will be effective over approximate lOOOrpm of engine speed, it will not be effective under lOOOrpm because an engine can not get sufficient air flow due to poor performance of a turbocharger at this range. This is still one of unsolved problems at present. Systems to improve this defect are wastegate and variable geometry turbine. But wastegate system is suffered by poor fuel consumption at the high speed range of an engine. Variable geometry turbine system is also suffered by poor boost pressure at the very low engine speed. On the other hand, a supercharger, which is a positive displace- ment type compressor, can produce theoretically constant boost pressure throughout whole engine speed range because it is driven directly by a crankshaft and does not follow the flow char- acteristics of a turbine. It may be therefore possible to obtain a high performance system by combining these two boosting devices. That is "hybrid system". In this paper, the test results will be reported that obtained by applying this hybrid system to a diesel engine for trucks. Smoke level, specific fuel consumption, shaft torque and acceleration were improved. 1991 SAE Transactions Section 3 910420. An intake charge cooling system for application to die- sel, gasoline and natural gas engines. Roy C. Meyer and S. M. Shahed, Southwest Research Institute. Low intake manifold temperature, well below ambient, has many applications in internal combustion engines. In diesel engines, it can reduce NOx to a level of 2.0 g/hp-hr or below, going beyond the 1994 heavy duty diesel engine emissions stan- dards. In gasoline engines, it can allow high compression ratio, turbocharged operation without end gas knock. This will permit ready conversion of some heavy duty diesel engines to gasoline operation at increased power density and lower emissions. In nat- ural gas engines, it will allow base diesel engine to be converted to stoichiometric natural gas operation without increasing ther- mal loads. A three way catalyst can then be used to reduce emis- sions. 1 991 SAE Transactions Section 3 910421. A small turbocharger for passenger car and truck applications. Shohei Oguma and David Elpern, Garrett Automo- tive Group, Allied- Signal, Inc.; and Phillippe Brocard, Garrett S.A. - France , Allied- Signal, Inc. The Garrett Automotive Group of Allied-Signal, Inc. has developed a new small turbocharger to meet the worldwide demand for fuel efficient and low emission small engines for pasenger cars and light trucks. This new turbocharger, designated the GT15, is smaller, lighter and lower in cost than Garretťs suc- cessful T2 turbocharger and is also designed to meet the more stringent durability requirements of the future. 910422. Development of the Mitsubishi TF07 model turbo- charger for 1994 U.S. and 1993 European diesel emission stan- dards. Takashi Mikogami, Eito Matsuo, Nobuyasu Matsudaira, and Akira Hishikawa, Mitsubishi Heavy Industries America, Inc.; and Masaki Endoh, Mitsubishi Heavy industries America, Inc. The exhaust emission gas regulations on truck diesel engines are becoming increasingly stringent in various countries in the coming years. The *94 EPA (U.S.A.) regulations include the entire working range of engines, including transient conditions; thus requiring a large-scale improvement in engine properties. For this reason, various engine components are now undergo- ing a series of improvements; in particular, the injection system has experienced a major renovation. However, the improvement of a naturally-aspriated engine has its own limit; and the turbo- charged engine with inter-cooler becomes essential. Mitsubishi Heavy Industries has been pushing ahead with the development of turbochargers for use with the truck diesel engines. To assist the diesel engine manufacture to meet these new emission regulations, we have developed various turbochar- ged options for improving engine performance, in addition to our continuing efforts for improving the aerodynamic properties. The TF07 model turbocharger has been the development tar- get of our efforts. The TF07 model turbocharger applies to 6 to 9 liter truck diesel engines. The characteristics of the TF07 turbo- chargers and the effects of various options are explained in this paper. 910423. New developments in wastegated passenger car turbo- charger aerodynamics. Douglas A. Milliken, Ronren Gu, and Michael Yee, Garrett Automotive Group, Allied-Signal, Inc. Passenger car OEM's are always interested in new ways to improve vehicle transient response with turbocharged engines. Increasingly, there is also demand for smaller turbocharger pack- age size to fit within ever decreasing engine compartment space. Component weight reduction becomes more critical as emission requirements stiffen and pressure to reduce cost is constant. These four critical requirements for the future passenger car turbocharger are all addressed at once by Garretťs development of a new family of very compact high flow compressors and tur- bines for wategated passenger car application. 910424. (SP-864) Potential for lightweight design of a hybrid connecting rod for automobile applications. Ingo Kuch and Peter Kümmerlen , Research Vehicle Eng. Using a split hybrid connecting rod developed by Daimler- Benz, the industrial applicability in the engine is verified. The connecting rod consists of several components such as a compres- sion-stressed shank and a tension loop made of CFRP, a split crankshaft bearing and a small connecting rod eye made of tita- nium. Beyond weight savings the use of these materials offers spe- cific advantages like good damping properties of CFRP reducing noise emission of the engine and high bending strength and stiff- ness of titanium. A prerequisite for making optimum use of the low oscillating mass of the hybrid connecting rod is a lighter design of the entire engine through weight reductions of attached parts. Due to high material and fabrication costs, mass production of split hybrid connecting rods is not practicable at present, whereas unsplit ver- sions can successfully be utilized in high efficiency engines. 1991 SAE Transactions Section 3 59</page><page sequence="59">910425-910431 910425. (SP-864) A free machining titanium alloy for connect- ing rods. Atsuyoshi Kimura, Sadayuki Nakamura , and Sachihiro Isogawa , Daido Steel Co., Ltd.; and Toshihiko Matsubara, Kenji Kimura, and Yasunori Sato, Honda R&amp;D Co., Ltd. Some fundamental research on alloy design of the new tita- nium alloy and process design such as forging and surface treat- ment were carried out in order to develop new titanium alloy connecting rods. Free machining TÍ-3A1-2V alloy is the best alloy for connecting rods because it has mechanical properties equiva- lent to quenched and tempered medium carbon steels, a popular material for connecting rods. The alloy can be machined at higher speed than the most popular titanium alloy TÍ-6A1-4V. Forging in the B phase temperature range is desirable to enable one heat forging of connecting rods and to eliminate crack initiation. New technology such as induction heating in forging, pickling after forging and coating on large ends were developed. As a result of this research, new titanium alloy connecting rods which can be applicable to mass production have been developed. 910426. (SP-864) A study of jump and bounce in a valve train. Kouichi Hatamura, Hirotumi Omoti, and Toru Kurisu, Mazda Motor Corp. Valve train motion was investigated with computer simula- tion technique. The application of a 5-mass model was found to accurately predict the valve train behavior. It was identified that valve train stiffness and close-side characteristics of valve life curve have significant effects on bounce occurrence. A valve train with high stiffness tends to develop bounce after jump, while on one with low stiffness, bounce starts in the absence of jump. These findings allowed to develop a new cam form with use of harmonic curves for elevating the revolution limit of the valve train. 910427. (SP-864) Camshaft chain drive package components for internal combustion engines - The system approach. P. J. Owen, J. R. Evans, and J. L. Pochet, Renold Automotive. This paper deals with the design, development and supply of complete camshaft chain packages with particular reference to the whole system approach. The whole system embraces the tim- ing chain, tightside guide, cam to cam guide, slack side pivot blade, tensioner assembly and cam and crank sprockets -also included are associated oil pump and accessory chain drives often complete with engine front cover assemblies. With the rising demands for quality and cost savings, the rela- tionship between vehicle engine makers and component suppli- ers has entered a new era of profound change which is transform- ing the automobile component industry. The demands now placed on cam chain components resulting from multi cam and multi valve systems are discussed together with the requirements of a more dedicated and detailed technical approach to all associated camdrive items. The involvement and committment by the component sup- plier in the way of facilities is dealt with in detail, involving com- puter aided design, stress calculation, development samples and finally series production supply. The achievement of 300.000 km durability for all component systems is discussed involving a variety of modern engine designs embracing multi cam, multi valve types. The work culminates in a state of the art appraisal of latest technology and techniques now necessary for effective cam driv- ing. The vital importance in the formulation of close associations with engine makers, is highlighted, so both supplier and user can optimise on low cost, high quality design of all cam drive compo- nents focusing on the supplier user partnership approach. 910428. (SP-864) Development of titanium alloy valve spring retainers. Moriyuki Mushiake, Kenichi Asano, Noriyuki M ¿ya- rn ura, and Shuji Nagano, Mitsubishi Motors Corp. Beta Ti alloy valve spring retainers are newly developed for use in mass produced automobiles for the first time. Ti alloy valve spring retainers with a weight saving of 42%, compared to steel retainers, have reduced the inertial weight of the valve train components by 6%. And this weight reduction has the benefit of increasing the upper limit of the engine speed, which improves the engine performance. Ti alloy valve spring retainers are cold forged by the conventional fabrication facilities for steel retain- ers, using TÌ-22V-4A1 (the beta Ti alloy) which possesses excellent cold workability in a solution treated condition. Oxygen surface hardening is applied to protect Ti alloy valve spring retainers from wear damage. In addition, aging treatment and shot blasting are performed to improve strength and stiffness of valve retain- ers. 1991 SAE Transactions Section S 910429. (SP-864) Development of nickel-base superalloy for exhaust valves. Yoshitoshi Hagiwara , Honda R&amp;D Co., Ltd.; Masao Ishida, Honda R&amp;D CO., Ltd.; Tomoo Oka, Honda R&amp;D Co., Ltd.; and Rikizo Watanabe and Koji Sato, Metallurgical Lab., Hitachi Metals, Ltd. These days, nickel-base superalloy has been applied to reduce the valve weight of motorcycles. Inconel 751 is excellent in per- formance but expensive in cost. Therefore, we verified the con- stituents of nickel-base superalloys corresponding to the require- ments of valves and we succeeded in developing a new superalloy and applying it to motorcycle exhaust valves. The characteristics are summarized as follows: 1) the basic composition is Fe-46Ni-18Cr-4Ti-lAl-0.3C-0.004B. It is a precip- itation-hardened nickel alloy characterized by precipitation of NÌ3 (Al, Ti) and, crystallization and dispersion of fine TiC; 2) it has the following distinctive features: a) superior to inconel 751 in wear and heat resistance; b) superior to 20-1 IP steel in resis- tance to lead oxide corrosion and c) applicable to both unleaded and low-lead gasoline; and 3) the exhaust valves using this new superalloy are lighter in weight by 18% and lower in cost by 13% as compared to the conventional type using 20-1 IP hard-faced with Stellite. They have been mass-produced from 1990. 1991 SAE Transactions Section 5 910430. (SP-864) Analysis of thermal fatigue resistance of engine exhaust parts. K. Akiyama and M.

The thermal fatigue resistance of engine exhaust system parts has conventionally been evaluated in thermal fatigue tests con- ducted with a restrained specimen. However, the test results have not always been consistent with data obtained in engine endur- ance tests. Two new evaluation methods have been developed to overcome this problem. One is a method of predicting thermal fatigue life on the basis of nonlinear elastic and plastic thermal analyses performed with a finite element model and the ABAQUS program. The other is a method of evaluating exhaust system parts using an exhaust system simulator. This paper describes the concepts underlying the two methods and their rela- tive advantages. 1991 SAE Transactions Section 3 910431. (SP-864) Nissan's new V8 and L4 aluminum cylinder block.

At this time, we would like to introduce the design concepts at Nissan related to this factor. 60</page><page sequence="60">910431-910441 Nissan has been using aluminum cylinder blocks in the MA series engine for MICRA since 1982. They were developed for application with the super-light engines for the liter car. Now, we have made new aluminum cylinder blocks for compact and lux- ury class passenger cars based on the knowledge gained from our latest research and improvements on the MA engines. 1991 SAE Transactions Section 3 910433. (SP-864) Evaluation of cylinder bore and cylinder head deformations using holographic interferometry. Richard B. Hathaway, John E. Turley, and Chien Yi-Ho, Western Michigan Univ. In the design of automotive and heavy equipment engines, accurate analysis of factors which influence immediate and long- term effects is essential. Fastener torque, thermal and pressure variations are utilized to evaluate basic sensitivity of the engine to these parameters by measurement of cylinder bore and cylin- der head distortions. Holographic interferometry was used to measure the cylinder deformation caused by the applied thermal and mechanical loads. A cast iron V-6 engine was used as the test engine. Influences of bolt torquing, as would occur during initial assembly and/or service were evaluated. Pressure on the cylinder walls was simulated by creating a vacuum in the water jackets of the engine block. The effects of thermal loads were evluated using a temperature controlled liuqid flowing through the water jackets. Incremental steady-state loads were applied to investigate the deformation of the engine at specific points in the operating cycle. 1991 SAE Transactions Section 3 910434. (SP-864) Development of light weight high strength aluminum alloy piston with cooling gallery manufactured using squeeze casting technique. Masato Sasaki, Masayoshi Sasaki, Y Nishimura, and Eiiji Okamura, Atsugi Unisia Corp. In recent years, demands for increased output and low fuel consumption in automobile engines have been mounting. Light weight and high performance is demanded of the main operating parts, such as pistons. In response to these demands, the crown thickness and pin boss unit thickness has been reduced by tremendous improve- ment in the fatigue strength compared to strength obtained by conventional methods, utilizing squeeze casting techniques. In addition, the thickness of the inside face of piston has been reduced by making use of a split core. Furthermore, by manufac- turing the cooling gallery, the heat load has been reduced; by introduction of hollow regions, an extremely light weight and compact piston has been developed. Three new techniques are indicated here. Firstly, the tech- nique of attaining soundness in material and excellent fatigue strength by the squeeze casting technique, which is superior to those attained by conventional methods. Secondly, the technique of using split core for forming of an undercut part on the inside surface of the piston in the squeeze casting method, that is to say, the technique of preventing deformation and damage to the core due to pressure of the molten metal and preventing the perme- ation of the molten metal in the split core. The third technique is the technique of manufacturing a pressure resistant and imper- meable removable core for the compact cooling gallery, used in the squeeze casting method. 1991 SAE Transactions Section 3 910435. (SP-864) A study to decrease oil consumption for NSOR-two-ring package piston. Shoichi Furuhama , Tetsu Hyuga, Masaaki Takiguchi, and Shinji Serizawa, Musashi Insti- tute of Technology. Furuhama proposed the new two ring package consist of a pressure ring and a narrow single-rail oil ring (NSOR) in 1985. Number of studies have been done for the purpose of reducing the oil consumption (OC) in this ring package. However, OC reduction problem has been still remaining to solve as only one serious problem of this ring package. The reasons of a larger OC in the new ring package than the conventional three ring has been hardly understood, considering the OC control ability on second ring in three ring package will not so large since the fact that the oil film thickness is thicker than that of the oil ring. In this study, the mechanism of OC increase in new ring pack- age was found out at last, as a result, OC of new ring package pis- ton was improved up to the same level of conventional three ring package piston.

(SP-859) Development and application of a reduced thermal expansion polycarbonate/ABS engineering thermoplas- tic blend for automotive exterior body panels. Thomas D. Burns, Dow Chemical Co. A novel engineering thermoplastic polymer has been devel- oped for use in automotive exterior body panels. This material provides a unique combination of properties including reduced thermal expansion compared to conventional thermoplastics, Class A surface aesthetics, excellent part dimensional stability and reproducibility, a superior balance of mechanical properties, and good processability. This paper describes the development of this material and its application in exterior door panels. 910438. (SP-859) Repair procedures for polyurea exterior auto body panels. Mark Stypczynski, Karl Roye, and Charles Moore, Kent Industries ; and Eloy Martinez, and John McLaren, Dow Chemical. The continual development and usage of reinforced reaction injection molded (RRIM) polurea automotive body panels has created a need for materials that can be used to restore damaged polurea to its original strength and appearance. Repair materials and techniques have been developed by Kent Industries that allow damaged panels to be restored in a cost effective and timely manner in both the manufacturing plant and after-market envi- ronments. This paper will address the key criteria for the selec- tion of repair materials, review cost considerations for repair of panels versus replacement, and describes the techniques required for achieving successful repairs with superior painted panel sur- face quality and gloss. 910440. (SP-839) RTM - Fast resin system for class A sur- face. D. Wiseman, Reichhold Chemicals, Inc.; and M. Togo, Dainippon Ink and Chemicals, Inc. The resin transfer molding (RTM) process provides a closed system for environmental protection. By using a low profile addi- tive, an excellent surface quality part can be molded, but for auto- mation there is a demand for faster molding cycles; and there is always a need for higher mechanical properties. A low profile unsaturated polyester resin system has been developed that meets the requirements of a fast molding cycle while maintaining good mechanical properties and a Class A surface quality. 910441. (SP-859) Lotus Elan - An RTM composite success. Peter W. Vaccarella and James C. Jensen, Ashland Chemical, Inc.; and Albert A. Adams, Lotus Cars Ltd. With the Elan's launch, Lotus is moving into a new era of low- volume production. By the middle of the next decade, a maxi- mum of 3000 a year will be produced at Hethel and it was these requirements, combined with a desire for more design freedom, that led Lotus to carefully examine its current VARI (vacuum assisted resin injection) process and develop a unique, flexbile system for the Elan. It was decided to develop a manufacturing process to employ a larger number of separate panels to allow future design free- dom. The aim was to jig assemble panels which would allow accu- rate and consistent control of the complete assembly. 61</page><page sequence="61">910441-910448 Evaluation of alternative materials and processes for body panel manufacturing began in 1987, leading to the conclusion that the Lotus patented VARI process was still the most cost effective for the new car. A new patented 'fiberform' process has been developed by Lotus Engineering to provide pre-formed fiber reinforcement which is self-locating inside the VARI tools during the molding process. Parallel to this study, various adhesives were assessed, includ- ing epoxies acrylics and rigid urethanes being used in the motor industry at that time. Results showed that an elastomeric modu- lus polyurethane proved to be ideal. In the early 1980's, Lotus developed the paint-in-mold process (VARIP), using non-shrink resins during the curing process to ensure dimensional stability and the absence of surface deforma- tion. Although zero shrink, or low profile, resins have been avail- able since the 1970's, these required a 150°C molding tempera- ture which was not compatible with the VARI process. The search was then on for a low profile resin which could be molded at the more acceptable temperature of 60°C. Lotus evalu- ated a unique material, AROTRAN™ low profile resin, supplied by Ashland Chemical, Inc. of Columbus, Ohio, USA which met its demands, and this led to the development of the new produc- tion process for the Elan. An added sophistication is that the production molds have an electroplated nickel shell surface which not only extends tool life, but also gives a high standard of finish to the body panels, allow- ing minimal preparation for the painting process. There is virtu- ally no contraction during curing, thereby ensuring excellent dimensional control. It has also been possible to design panels with relatively sharp edges by employing 'fiberfornť glass reinforcements. All the outer body panels are a nominal two mm as they are cosmetic and not load bearing. However, there are some excep- tions: the undertray, bulkheads, bumper armatures and door inners are thicker to contribute to the structural performance. 910442. (SP-859) Atryl® - A smooth-surface SMC system for exterior auto body panels. L. R. Ross , Owens-Corning Fiberglas; S. P. Harde beck, Customer Service Lab., Owens-Croning Fiber- glas ; and E. L. Wilson, Owens-Corning Fiberglas. A four-component resin system has been developed which exhibits improved surface quality and mold flow. The system consists of a monomer, an unsaturated polyester, a low profile additive, and an additional low molecular weight compatible compound. Systems of this type were found to have a synergistic effect in improving surface quality and mold flow. The character- istic of the low molecular weight compound that was found to be important is its ability to remain compatible with the curing unsaturated polyester and styrene. The Atryl® resin system is a combination of styrene, a propyl- ene maleate unsaturated polyester, a saturated polyester thermo- plastic, and one or more compatibile compounds. The compati- ble compounds were selected from a wide range of low molecular weight materials. Numerous four-component resin systems have been prepared and evaluated in SMC. The surface quality and physical properties have been found to meet or exceed automo- tive specifications. 1991 SÄE Transactions Section S 910443. (SP-859) A versatile new resin system for class A body panels. Ronald A. Andrekanic, Robert M. Stickel, and Stanley Sobotkowski, Aristech Chemical Corp. Advances in surface appearance, production efficiencies and overall part quality are required to keep thermoset composites competitive as key materials for the automotive industry. In response to these challenges, a versatile molding resin has been designed to meet the demanding requirements of the nineties. Polyester resin MR 13006 lends itself well to the production of SMC, TMC, and BMC molded parts. Class A surfaces have been obtained consistently with combinations of MR 13006 and Neulon T Plusr. Diffractor and Loriar readings under 85 along with good mechanical properties are achievable. Compounds formulated with the MR 13006/Neulon T Plusr combination can be molded by either compression or injection techniques, and they are characterized by fast cure rates and wide molding "windows." High-quality surfaces can be obtained with a range of formulations and molding conditions, making these systems very well suited to commercial molding operations. A study was conducted via a design of experiments to opti- mize compound formulations. The DOE resulted in the following conclusions: 1) a higher filler loading gave improved surface qual- ity; 2) surface quality was inversely proportional to glass content; and 3) directly proportional to filler loading. The optimum for- mulation projected by the design should yield excellent surface quality while maintaining good mechanical properties and SMC moldability. 910445. Perspectives on applications of variable valve timing. T. W. Asmus, Chrysler Corp. While variable valve timing (VVT) holds the potential to alle- viate some of the compromises normally associated with engine operation over broad speed and load ranges, generalizing its ben- efits in a quantitative manner is difficult. Details of base engine design and the means of VVT execution and engine duty cycle play major roles in determining the outcome of such an applica- tion. With the profusion of VVT means available, the matter of selecting an appropriate system for a given engine and duty cycle is difficult particularly when there is a host of competing features and technologies. This treatment of VVT is based on assessments of compro- mises associated with static valve timing and provides a frame- work for considering VVT as an engine performance option. Extensive use is made of pressure and geometric data, and several generalizations are made relative to strategies for incorporating common VVT systems. 910447. Variable valve actuation systems for the optimization of engine torque. Wolfgang Demmelbauer-Ebner, Alois Dachs, and Hans Peter Lenz, Institute for Internal Combustion Engines, Technical University of Vienna. Fixed valve lift characteristics and timings of internal com- bustion engines usually represent a compromise with regard to the requirements placed on power output and torque. In order to minimize the compromise, numerous variable valve actuation (VVA) systems have been proposed that give adjustable valve operation depending on the engine speed. This paper presents a review of VVA systems which have been investigated mainly for the optimization of engine torque. Of most interest are systems which have already been tested in complete engines or even installed in production line cars. 910448. A camshaft mechanism for synchronous phasing valve timing. Lance Phoenix and John B. Phoenix, Affiliation not listed. This paper is a description and analysis of the behaviour of a purely conceptual mechanism or system which is able to vary continuously both the opening and closing angle of internal com- bustion engine valves which are operated by a double overhead camshfat arrangement of substantially conventional type. The mechanism is interposed between the camshaft and the drive from the crankshaft and is able to vary the instantaneous phase of the camshaft so as to permit each cam to spend a longer or shorter time in contact with its tappet for a given engine speed. There is an implicit acceptance in the paper that published work on variable valve timing has demonstrated its desirability if the full potential of the normally aspriated internal combustion engine is to be realised. 62</page><page sequence="62">910448-910457 The difficulties of producing suitable mechanisms, as shown by the long history of (largely unsuccessful) interest in the subject, is acknowledged. 910450. Performance evaluation of a camless engine using valve actuators with programmable timing. Larrie A. Gould, Wil- liam E. Richeson, and Frederick L. Erickson, Philips Industrial Electronics Co. An electronic valve timing (EVT) approach is described which utilizes high-speed, electro-pneumatic actuators producing nearly square wave valve lift profiles throughout the nominal engine speed range. The resulting impact on engine "breathing" com- bined with the controllability afforded by totally programmable valve timing produce an engine with performance capability radi- cally different from any traditional internal combustion engine. A comparison test was conducted on a 1.9 liter, four-cylinder engine to investigate the effects of these unconventional valve dynamics. The primary focus of this paper is the presentation and discussion of the results of this evaluation. 910451. A design and experimental study of an Otto Atkinson cycle engine using late intake valve closing. S. C. Blakey, Sheffield City Polytechnic ; R. J. Saunders, University of Sheffield ; and T. H. Ma and A. Chopra, Ford of Europe. Previous work has established that part load fuel consumption of a spark ignition engine may be improved by means of both load control by variable valve timing (VVT) and variable com- pression ratio (VCR). The Otto-Atkinson cycle can be achieved by combining VVT with VCR. This paper explores the design aspects, production constraints and performance of such an engine, in which VVT is realised by late intake valve closing (LIVC). The LIVC aspect of the chosen design makes use of two inde- pendently operated intake valves, such that variable dwell is obtained by phase control only of one of the valves. This allows a considerable degree of compatibility with a conventional 16 valve cylinder head. The first version of this design has been built and successfully tested. A broad range of possible VCR design solutions has been ana- lysed for performance and feasibility. Production contraints and a need for rapid transient response were identified as the main determining factors. The most promising option could be con- fined to the cylinder head, and has been built and demonstrated. 1991 SAE Transactions Section 3 910452. A novel continuously variable desmodromic engine valve timing machanism. William E. Ingalls, Ingalls Co.; and J. F. Cardenas-Garcia and M. A. Rodriguez-M arquez, Texas Tech Univ. This paper introduces and illustrates the design concepts of a novel continuously-variable valve duration and timing mecha- nism. This totally mechanical design is adaptable to existing spring-loaded poppet valve systems and may also be used in des- modromic form. The design can simultaneously and/or indepen- dently control intake and exhaust valve opening and closing, allowing the valve duration window to be moved to any point in the operating cycle of the engine. Preliminary calculations of the optimum cam profile for this mechanism were obtained using a computerized engine-siumlation program. 910453. Parametric investigation of variable valve timing applied to a turbocharged diesel engine. H. J. Leonard and C. R. Stone, Dept. of Manufacturing and Engrg. Systems, Brunei Univ.; and S. J. Charlton, School of Engrg., University of Bath. This paper explains the reasons for applying variable valve timing to a diesel engine, in order to reduce the likelihood of inlet port fouling at part load. The results from a cycle simulation are compared with experimental results, from an engine tested with three different valve timings. Good agreement between the model and the engine is demonstrated by comparisons of experi- mental and simulation results for both global parameters, and cycle resolved pressure measurements (cylinder and manifolds). The cycle simulation has thus been used to predict the benefits that accrue from the application of variable valve timing to a tur- bocharged diesel engine. Reducing the valve overlap was found to be beneficial at part load. The greatest reduction in the reverse flow of exhaust residuals into the inlet manifold, was obtained if the inlet valve opening was delayed by phasing the inlet valve events. 910454. High temperature liquid lubricant for advanced engines. J. M. Perez, C. S. Ku, and Stephen M. Hsu, National Institute of Standards and Technology. Liquid lubricants are crucial to the successful development of advanced engines for the next decade. Engines are being opti- mized to meet emission standards as well as improved durability and fuel economy. New materials such as super alloys, ceramics and coatings offer an opportunity for better, more efficient engines. Lubricant research is focused on the severe environment and temperature requirements of an advanced engines with a top ring reversal temperature of over 400°C. This paper describes key lubricant considerations including oxidation and thermal stabil- ity, volatility, deposit formation, friction and wear control. Coop- erative research efforts between industry and NIST resulted in several candidate high temperature liquid lubricants. 910455. Self-lubricating materials for high temperature ring/ cylinder application. Peter A. Gaydos, Batteile. In support of development efforts for advanced heat engines, self-lubricating materials were evaluated for their friction and wear characteristics above 260°C. The work focused on the ring/ cylinder interface and tested self-lubricating ring or cylinder spec- imens against plasma-sprayed chromia or other ceramic materi- als. Three materials were chosen for the evaluation. Two of them were solid lubricant compacts, and one was a self-lubricating coating. The compacts were the Westinghouse (Boes) compact and a commercially available molybdenum disulfide-based com- posite. The coating consisted of a wear-resistant matrix filled with solid lubricating materials to reduce friction. The Boes com- pact resulted in high temperature friction and wear results that were in some cases equal to or better than those of earlier tests run with liquid lubrication. The other compact and the coating both had much higher wear and coefficients of friction than the Boes compact. The work showed the potential of solid lubricants to lubricate the ring/cylinder interface in low-heat-rejection engines effectively. 910456. Uncooled two-stroke gas engine for heat pump drive. Patrick Badgley, Dave McNulty, and Melvin Woods, Adiabatics, Inc. This paper describes the design and analysis of a family of nat- ural gas fueled, uncooleld, two-stroke, lean burn, thermal- ignition engines. The engines were designed specifically to meet the requirements dictated by the commercial heat pump applica- tion. The engines have a power output ranging from 15 to 100 kW; a thermal efficiency of 36 percent; a mean time between fail- ure greater than 3 years; and a life expectancy of 45,000 hours. To meet these specifications a family of very simple, uncooled, two-stroke cycle engines were designed which have no belts, gears or pumps. The engines utilize crankcase scavenging, lubrication, stratified fuel introduction to prevent raw fuel from escaping with the exhaust gas, use of and ceramic rolling contact bearings. The thermal ignition combustion system (TICS) is used for ignition to enable the engines to operate with a lean mixture and eliminate spark plug erosion. 910457. Advances in high temperature components for the adiabatic engine. Melvin Woods, Adiabatics, Inc.; and Ernest Sch- warz and Walter Bryzik, U.S. Army Tank. 63</page><page sequence="63">910457-910462 An advanced low heat rejection engine concept has been selected based on a trade-off between thermal insulating perfor- mance and available technology. The engine concept heat rejec- tion performance is limited by available ring-liner tribology and requires cylinder linear cooling to control the piston top ring reversal temperature. This engine concept is composed of a tita- nium piston, headface plate and cylinder liner insert with thermal barrier coatings. Monolithic zirconia valve seat inserts, and ther- mal barrier coated valves and intake-exhaust ports complete the insulation package. The tribological system is composed of chrome oxide coated cylinder, M2 steel top piston ring, M2 steel valve guides, and an advanced polyol ester class lubricant. 910459. A computational study of wall temperature effects on engine heat transfer. Mark J. Jennings and Thomas Morel, Ricardo North America. Recently, several theories have been offered as possible expla- nations for claimed increases in diesel engine heat transfer when combustion chamber surface temperatures are raised through insulation. A multi-dimensional computational fluid dynamics (CFD) analysis, using a recently developed near wall turbulent heat transfer model, has been employed to investigate the validity of two of these theories. The proposed mechanisms for increased heat transfer in the presence of high wall temperatures are: 1) pis- ton-induced compression heating of the near wall gas which increases the near wall temperature gradient when wall tempera- tures are high; and 2) increased penetration of hot, burned gases into the near wall flow during combustion through reduction of the flame quench distance. Calculations of heat transfer in a motoring engine demonstrated that the piston-induced pressure work energy source did have a noticeable effect on the shape of the temperature profiles in the thermal boundary layers on all combustion chamber surfaces. However, it was not enough to cause heat transfer to increase with wall temperature. Calcula- tions of heat transfer during combustion in a constant volume chamber revealed that, in spite of changes in quench distance, total heat transfer during the combustion period decreased with increasing wall temperature for quench distances in the range expected to occur in diesel engines. The study shows that neither of the above mechanisms can cause heat transfer to increase with wall temperature, which is an important result for the ongoing development of insulated diesel engines. 1991 SAE Transactions Section 3 910460. The effects of ceramic coatings on diesel engine per- formance and exhaust emissions. Dennis N. Assanis and Kevin Wiese, Dept. of Mech. and Industrial Engrg., University of Illinois at Urbana-Champa ; and Ernest Schwarz and Walter Bryzik, U.S. Army Tank. An experimental investigation of the effects of ceramic coat- ings on diesel engine performance and exhaust emissions was conducted. Tests were carried out over a range of engine speeds at full load for a standard metal piston and two pistons insulated with 0.5 mm and 1.0 mm thick ceramic coatings. The thinner (0.5 mm) ceramic coating resulted in improved performance over the baseline engine, with the gains being espeically pronounced with decreasing engine speed. At 1000 rpm, the 0.5 mm ceramic coated piston produced 10% higher thermal efficiency than the metal piston. In contrast, the relatively thicker coating (1 mm), resulted in as much as 6% lower thermal efficiency compared to baseline. On the other hand, the insulated engines consistently presented an attractive picture in terms of their emissions charac- teristics. Due to the more complete combustion in the insulated configurations, exhaust CO levels were between 30% and 60% lower than baseline levels. Similarly, unburned HC levels were 35% to 40% lower for the insulated pistons. The NOx concentra- tions were also 10% to 30% lower due to the changed nature of combustion in the insulated engines. Finally, smoke emissions decreased slightly in the insulated engines. 1991 SAE Transactions Section 3 910461. Performance of thin thermal barrier coating on small aluminum block diesel engine. Katsuyuki Osawa, Izumi Indus- tries, Ltd.; and Roy Kamo and Edgars Valdmanis, Adiabatics, Inc. The cylinder of the aluminum engine block without iron sleeve was coated directly with thin thermal barrier coatings of zirconia and chrome oxide. The cylinder head and valve face and the piston crown were also coated. These three engine compo- nents were tested individually and together. The fuel consump- tion performance of this 84 X 70 mm direct injection diesel engine improved 10% with only coated cylinder bore. When the fuel injection timing of the coated cylinder bore engine was retarded by about 2°CA, emissions characteristics were approximately the same level as for the baseline engine with 8% improvement in brake specific fuel consumption compared with the baseline engine. At constant fuel flow rate to the engine, the exhaust and cylin- der head temperatures were higher for the insulated bore case. One can summarize the combustion temperature must have been higher and heat release rates were faster in the insulated case. Although contributing factors for the improvement are unkown at this time, it is believed to be a result of 1) friction improve- ment, 2) combustion improvement, and 3) thermal insulation. These factors are discussed in the paper. 910462. Observation of the combustion process in a heat insu- lated engine. Hideo Kawamura, Shigeo Sekiyama, and Katsunori Hirai, Isuzu Ceramics Research Institute Co., Ltd. The technologies which comprise heat insulated turbo com- pound engine are summarized as 1) establishment of heat insula- tion structure; 2) improvement of combustion under high tem- perature ambient condition; and 3) establishment of energy recovering from exhaust gas. So far, we have almost finished to solve the problem (1) and now proceeding with the themes of high temperature combustion and recovering of energy. Especially, it is said that in heat insulated engine temperature of compressed air goes up since temperature on the surface of combustion chamber wall goes up and combustion proceeds under high temperature ambient condition. There are several problems in high temperature combustion. However, there are still some problems left unimproved such as a) deterioration of combustion due to the reduction of degree of constant volume caused by the contraction of ignition delay, prolongation of diffusion combustion time; b) increase of NOx under the high temperature ambient condition; and c) deteriora- tion of smoke due to the decrease of volumetric efficiency. Of these problems, we induced the reason of a and b as follow. Namely, the main cause is that the mixture of air fuel increase the combustion times due to rate of proceeding combustion of combustible mixture with unevenness equivalent ratio as the air mixing speed can not catch up with the rapid acceleration of ther- mal cracking speed and oxidization speed at the time of combus- tion under the high temperature ambient condition. There are several possibilities in high temperature combustion which means that we can decrease the generation of NOx by con- trolling equivalent raio of air and fuel, as shown by Dr. Kami- moto, and that we can solve problem of insufficient combustion caused by decreasing of ignition delay time under high tempera- ture ambient condition by reduction of combustion time as a result of increasing reaction velocity due to improvement of mix- ing in air and fuel. In present study, we were successful in visualizing the high temperature combustion and verified our assumption, and thereby, we think that the key technology to improve the high temperature combustion resides on high speed generation of air fuel mixture. 64</page><page sequence="64">910463-910473 910463.

This paper describes the preliminary development of an on- board integration network for vehicle dynamics. The underlying philosophy is explained and the basic requirements are set forth.

(P-241) High-reliability physical layer for in-vehicle high-speed local area network. Motoharu Tanaka, Kyosuke Hashimoto, and Yusaku Himino, Furukawa Electric Co., Ltd.; and Atsuhiko Suzuki, Furukawa Electric Technology Inc. Recently, because of the requirements of performance and safety, it has become the concern to adopt intercommunication functions for the coordinated real-time control of the power train, brakes, suspension, and so on. For the transmission of these real- time control signals, a type of controller area network (CAN) for CSMA/CD with a non-destructive arbitration (NDA) protocol has been proposed. In such protocols it is considered essential to have a physical layer having a high degree of reliability, but at high speeds con- ventional physical layers have not yet been achieved the nine requirements of fault tolerance that are included in ISO recom- mendations. To overcome this difficulty a physical layer has recently been built that provides these fault tolerance requirements at a trans- mission speed of 1 Mbps. This paper reports on its configuration, and on the results of evaluation. This physical layer utilizes shielded twisted pair wires as the transmission medium, effecting balanced-mode transmission at normal times and unbalanced-mode transmission during the occurrence of faults, thereby achieving the nine fault tolerance requirements. Evaluation under in-vehicle environments has confirmed that this physical layer provides high levels of performance and reli- ability. 910467. (P-241) Higher level drivers for networked systems in cars. Wolßard E. Lawrenz, /+ME GmbH. The overall complexity of future cars requires new design methods for effective and high quality results. A new VLSA- approach (VLSA = virtual leveled systems architecture) for mod- eling networked systems is proposed. As a support for the appli- cation design engineers a set of so-called virtual memory network drivers is described encapsulating the implementation details of the actual network protocol resulting in more economic and higher quality solutions. In the first step a software network driver set for VMO-level (VMO = virtual memory driver level O) is proposed for CAN networks based on 96 and 51 -family con- trollers. As a complement to the design phase support a set of net- work development tools is mentioned helping the engineers in the test phases of networked systems. 910468. (P-241) A design methodology for multiplex system software. Mark P. Zachos, United Technologies Automotive; and Karsten Fuchs, United Technologies Grundig. The purpose of this paper is to suggest a methodology for designing multiplex system software and defining the operational requirements of its hardware. The methodology will only study here the design phase of the software development cycle, a later paper will propose a complete design method. The goal of the methodology is to create reusable system objects which can be used again in future system applications. Reusing these objects in other systems will reduce the cost of multiplex system develop- ment. Cost savings will also result from decoupling the software from the hardware so software development can commence long before the hardware design has been completed and, using library objects that have previously been tested and proven to be reliable so software bugs are less likely to occur. 910470.

Additional gains can be achieved by incorpo- rating electronics within the junction boxes to make them "ac- tive". Active junction boxes may communicate with each other over serial datalinks, in this case using the J1850 (carlink) protocol, to further reduce harness complexity and provide system flexibility.

This type of experimental rig has been used by engineers for many years to evaluate valve discharge coefficients. This study is believed to be the first high speed flow visualization of the air flow in a system of this type. Particular emphasis was placed on the characteriza- tion of intake generated swirl and tumble motions within the cyl- inder. A 40 watt copper vapor laser was used to expose motion picture films at 5000 frames per second. The light scattering medium was phenolic microballoons. Based on the flow visualization results, selected LDV mea- surements were made to quantify the visual observations. A pro- pylene glycol aerosol was used for seeding in the LDV experi- ments. The observed and measured back-flow from the down- stream plenum into the cylinder casts serious doubt on the useful- ness of using tumble, and to some extent swirl measurements in a steady flow rig to estimate these conditions in real engines. This observation provides evidence of a fundamental difference which can exist between the steady flow field and that of a motored pis- ton cylinder assembly. The flow visualization confirmed that the 65</page><page sequence="65">910473-910479 choice of a solid body rotation model would be inappropriate for a description of tumbe or swirl in this assembly. 1991 SAE Transactions Section 3 910474. Turbulence length scale measurements by two-point laser doppler anemometry in a steady flow. Hafedh Belmabrouk and Michel Lance, Ecole Centrale de Lyon, C.N. RS. ; and Natha- lie Grosjean and Marc Michard, Société Metraflu. We propose here an experimental method, based on two-point laser doppler anemometry which makes possible direct measure- ment of spatial velocity correlation function from which the inte- gral and Taylor's length scales are calculated. The technique has been carefully checked on simple flows and we present here a first application in a steady flow simulating the induction stroke of an internal combustion engine. Profiles of integral length scale, Tay- lor length scale and dissipation rate are determined at severi dis- tances from the cylinder head. The effect of valve lift is also taken into account. 910475. Application of particle tracking velocimetry to the cyclic variability of the pre-combustion flow field in a motored axisymmetric engine. David H. Shack and William C. Reynolds, Stanford Univ. A particle tracking velocimetry (PTV) system has been devel- oped to measure two dimensional velocity fields in a motored axisymmetric engine with a transparent cylinder. The intake flow was seeded with phenolic microballoons (40 pm hollow spheres) and illuminated by a 1 mm thick horizontal sheet of pulsed laser light from a 25 watt copper vapor laser capable of 30 ns pulses. Photographs containing tracks of dots representing the multiply exposed path of each particle were produced. These images were digitized by a custom scanner capable of 3456 by 5184 pixel reso- lution and binarized using an iterative threshold routine in order to locate the particles. Software then determined how the individ- ual particles are organized into tracks and presented the results for operator verification. Velocity magnitude and direction were computed for each track and the results were interpolated to a fixed grid for further analysis. Cases of 50 realizations each were run at TDC compression for various operating conditions (swirl speed, valve lift) and the distribution of various scalar parameters of the flow (swirl center location, velocity at origin, swirl center spacing) were computed in order to quantify the repeatability of the flow. 1991 SAE Transactions Section 3 910476. Gas flow investigation by stereography in spark igni- tion engine. Keiji Saneyoshi, Keiji Hanawa, Makoto Kaneko, and Haruki Kobayashi, Subaru Research Center Co., Ltd. Stereoscopic photography using four mirrors and a 16 mm high speed camera has been developed to observe in-cylinder gas motion three dimensionally. The one-camera system can simul- taneously produce both left and right pictures under the same optical conditions. The measurable range of the system is from 400 to 500 mm and the resolution is 1.7mm. In-cylinder phenom- ena can be observed cycle-by-cycle without any modification of a cylinder head. To confirm its effectiveness, the system was applied to a bot- tom view type single-cylinder SI enigne with four valves. The bore and stroke are 92mm and 75mm, respectively. The rotation speed in a test was 1500rpm and a volume efficiency was 40%. The film speed of the high speed camera ranged from 3,000 to 6,000 pictures per second. In-cylinder gas motion during combus- tion was examined three-dimensionally by tracking bright flame spots produced by a sodium compound added to the fuel. Two typical gas motions, swirl and tumbling were generated by chang- ing shape of intake ports. In the case of swirl motion, a simple vortex was observed and vertical flows were seen frequently on the intake valve side. In case of tumbling motion, two contraction flows directed against each other and parallel to the ridge of the pent-roof of the head together with a flow directed from the intake to the exhaust valve were observed. 1991 SAE Transactions Section 3 910477. Effect of intake port flow pattern on the in-cyliner tumbling air flow in mlti-valve SI engines. S. Omori, K. Iwachido, M. Motomochi, and O. Hirako, Mitsubishi Motors Corp. LDV measurements, have been conducted to determine the in-cylinder gas flow produced by intake ports of various designs. The analysis of these measurements revealed the formation and development processes of tumble and clarified the requirements of the tumble formation by intake ports. The air flow from the intake port upper section toward the combustion chamber on the exhaust side has been found a gov- erning factor for the increase of tumble intensity. By tuning the intake flow to have an appropriate direction in the earlier stage of the intake process, a directed flow ascending the cylinder wall is generated in the later stage of the intake process. At an early stage of the compression process, the structure of the tumbling vortex becomes clear. As an index of the tumble intensity, the instantaneous kinetic moment of air around the geometric center of in-cylinder space was proposed. It was examined that the tumble intensity at top dead center in compression stroke has already been determined by the middle of the intake process. Varous intake port designs were tested to evaluate the correla- tion between the flow discharge coefficient and the tumbling intensity. A clear trade-off relation was observed by the conven- tional port design. 1991 SAE Transactions Section 3 910478. Turbulence characteristics of tumbling air motion in four-valve S.I. engines and their correlation with combustion parameters. O. Hadded, Ricardo Consulting Engineers ; and I. Denbratt, Volvo Car Corp. An experimental investigation has been carried out of the tur- bulence characteristics of tumble air motion in four-valve pent roof combustion chambers. This was conducted on an optically accessed single cylinder research engine under motored condi- tions at an engine speed of 1500 rev/min. Four cylinder heads with varying tumble magnitude were evaluated using conven- tional and scanning laser doppler anemometry (LDA) measure- ments. Analysis algorithms developed to account for the effects of mean flow cyclic variations and system noise were used to obtain unbiased estimates of turbulence intensity and integral length scales. The cylinder heads were also evaluated for combus- tion performance on a Ricardo signle cylinder hydra engine. Mix- ture and EGR loops at 1500 rev/min and 1.5 BMEP were carried out and cylinder pressure data was analysed to derive combus- tion characteristics. Tumble air motion in a four-valve pent rool chamber resulted in a bi-modal turbulence generation, the first peak occurring at 1 10° BTDC and the maximum turbulence at 20° BTDC compres- sion. This bi-modal turbulence generation occurs with moderate or high tumble builds and limits the turbulence generation close to TDC. Chamber shrouding to increase tumble does not increase turbulence near TDC due to early mean motion breakdown. Turbulence at the spark plug at ignition correlates well with early combustion delay angle suggesting a linear relationship. Mean flow cyclic variations do not show any correlation with combustion variability from these measurements. The use of a combustion model for further correlations is suggested. 1991 SAE Transactions Section 3 910479. Autocorrelation based analysis of ensemble averaged LDA engine data for bias-free turbulence estimates: A unified approach. A. D. M. Hilton and J. B. Roberts, School ofEngrg. and Applied Sciences, University of Sussex ; and O. Hadded, Ricardo Consulting Engineers. 66</page><page sequence="66">910479-910487 Earlier work has shown that the in-cylinder flow in internal combustion engines can be modeled, with reasonable accuracy, as the sum of an ensemble averaged mean component, a non- stationary 'turbulence' component and a 'cycle -to -cycle' varia- tion component, the latter being phase-locked to the engine cycles. The development of the LDA technique has enabled direct measurements of the in-cylinder velocity field to be taken, either at a single position in space over the engine cycle, or over a range of spatial positions, at effectively one point in the engine cycle (scanning LDA). Previously, different approaches have been developed for sep- arating the various flow components in the model described above, dependent on the type of data acquired. In this paper a sin- gle 'unified' method is presented, based on the computation of autocorrelation functions and a completely parametric represen- tation of the various components in the flow model. This method can be applied to both single position and scanning LDA data, and enables the magnitude of the various flow components to be quantified. Results of applying the method to some experimental engine data are presented. For this purpose both single position and scanning LDA data, acquired under the same engine conditions, were processed. A quantitative comparison between the extracted flow component magnitudes and estimated length scales, from the two types of data, is given. Through the use of a comprehen- sive simulation model of the data, an estimate of the level of the statistical uncertainty associated with the extracted flow compo- nents is obtained. 1991 SAE Transactions Section 3 910480. An experimental investigation of the flow characteris- tics in the swirl chamber of a C.I. engine. S. Subramaniyam , Dept. of Automobile Engrg ., Madras Institute of Technology ; and V. Ganesan and P. Srinivasa Rao , Dept. of Mech. Engrg., Indian Institute of Technology. The global flow characteristics such as mean velocity, turbu- lence intensity and scales of turbulence have been measured in a swirl combustion chamber of a compression ignition engine using a constant temperature hot-wire anemometer. The experi- ments were conducted at 400 rpm under motoring (non-firing) conditions. Ensemble averaging procedure was adopted to calcu- late the mean velocity and turbulence intensity after comparing the merits and demerits of this method with the individual cycle mean method and the frequency separation method. The experimental results indicate that the mean velocity and turbulence intensity show significant spatial and temporal varia- tions in the swirl chamber. These variations are observed to be maximum from 60 degrees bTDC to TDC of compression. The values of mean velocity at chamber periphery are found to be higher than the values near the chamber axis. Macro-time scale varies from about 160 to 530 jxs and macro- length scale varies from about 2.5 to 5.5 mm during the last part of the compression stroke at 400 rpm and at the compression ratio of 8.5. The effect of speed and compression ratio on flow velocity has also been studied. 910481. Improvement of combustion system of a small D.I. diesel engine for low exhaust emissions. F. E. Cordone, M. V. Prati, B. M. Vaglieco, and G. Valentino, Istituto Motori, CNR. Improvement of combustion system for low emissions of a single cylinder diesel engine is presented. In particular the effects of spray angle, holes diameter and number, compression ratio and combustion chamber geometry on engine performance and emissions are evaluated. The fluid-dynamic behaviour of combustion system is ana- lyzed by LDA technique. Engine tests have been carried out at two engine speed and at different start of combustion. The particulate matter has been analyzed in terms of soluble organic fraction and dry soot. 910482. Application of heavy duty diesel engine to future emis- sion standards. Masatoshi Shimoda, Kenji Funai, Kiyohiro Shi- mokawa, Tetsuya Otani, and Isao Joko, Hino Motors, Ltd. Future emission standards for heavy duty diesel engines will require extesive development using an integrated approach. This paper describes the latest results from Hino heavy duty diesel engine combustion research program. Improvement of the NOx/particulate/fuel economy trade off requires fuel injection equipment of pump line nozzle (PLN) sys- tem and unit injector with high pressure capability, injection rate control and timing control, and a combustion system matched with high pressure injection. Combustion characteristics (ignition delay, combustion period, heat release curve), fuel consumption, particulate, and exhaust gas emission of each injection system are compared and discussed. The unit injector system has an advantage of lower particulate level, especially dry soot, than the pump line nozzle system. The potential for further improvement through engine modifi- cation and aftertreatment is also discussed. 910484. The development of a novel variable compression ratio, direct injection diesel engine. Rafal A. Sobotowski, BP Oil Co.; and Brian C. Porter and Anthony D. Pilley, Ricardo Consult- ing Engineers Ltd. A production, direct injection diesel engine was modified to incorporate BP Oil's novel variable compression ratio (VCR) engine concept. The operation of the VCR mechanism was dem- onstrated and the performance and emissions potential of the concept evaluated. The VCR prototype achieved twice the specific power output of the baseline turbocharged aftercooled engine. Its exhaust smoke emissions at high load were consistent with conventional direct injection (DI) diesel engines using equivalent fuel injection equipment. Light load particulate emissions and high load fuel consumption indicated a need for further development of the combustion system. Unexpectedly low HC emissions were achieved considering the large crevice volumes in the combustion chamber of the pro- totype engine. Likewise, exceptionally low NOx emissions were demonstrated. It is believed that the low HC and NOx emissions could be inherent features of the unique combustion system con- figuration. Further development of this novel engine concept is recom- mended using a prototype engine incorporating recent advances in diesel engine technology. 1991 SAE Transactions Section 3 910485. A study on shallow W-type combustion system for high-speed diesel engine. Huang Yiliang and Wong Jianxin, Shandong Polytechnic Univ.; Sun Maochen and Liu Weiguo, Shandong I.C. E. Research Institute ; and Zhang Yuanxiong and Liu Qingde, Shdñdong Huafeng Machinery Works. The authors of this paper have experimented on four and six- cylinder engines of &lt;p 102 X 125 mm with shallow w-type combus- tion system, showing satisfactory results. In a 1200-2800 r/min speed range the prototype engine showed excellent performance characteristics, moreover, it required less accuracy in making their inlet ports. Based on fuel injection and combustion heat release pattern measured under various matches of combustion chamber, injection system and inlet port, the authors have stud- ied each effect of design parameters on combustion characteris- tics and put forward the key points for optimum combustion match. 910487. The survivability of diesel fuel components in the organic fraction of particulate emissions from an IDI diesel. M. K. Abbass, G. E. Andrews, S. J. Kennion, and P. T. Williams, Dept. of Fuel and Energy, University of Leeds; and K. D. Bartle, School of Engrg., Univesity of Leeds. 67</page><page sequence="67">910487-910497 A mass balance has been carried out between fuel and particu- late SOF n-alkanes and the survivability of a range of fuel n-alkanes was determined. Similarity the survivability of fuel PAH was determined and compared with the equivalent boiling point n-alkanes. A better AA1 single cylinder IDI engine was used with direct particulate sampling at 50C from the exhaust. The PAH and n-alkane fuel component survivabilities were mainly below 0.1%, indicating that unburnt fuel was the dominant source of particulate PAH. However, at maximum power there was an order of magnitude difference in the survivabilities of some PAH and n-alkanes. This indicated a possible pyrosynthesis source of PAH or a role of the engine and exhaust deposits in releasing PAH. The results confirm previous conclusions from test on a DI engine. 910488. A study of particulate formation on the combustion chamber wall. Hiroharu Yamaguchi, Hideaki Tanabe, and G. Takeshi Sato , Kanazawa Institute of Technology. In the small high speed DI diesel engines, wall quenching plays an improtant role on the particulate formation process. In order to clarify the particulate formation process, authors have analyzed the deposit on the combustion chamber wall, which are the results of the wall quenching. Deposit is sampled at 22 locations on the combustion chamber wall. On the wall of the piston cavity, dry and SOF desposits gener- ate. The deposit quantity is the highest on the side surface of the cavity, but SOF ratio is the smallest in the cavity. 910489. The effect of injection parameters and swirl on diesel combustion with high pressure fuel injection. Shigeru Shundoh, Toshiaki Kakegawa, and Kinji Tsujimura, Advanced Combustion Engrg. Institute Co., Ltd.; and Shinji Kobayashi, Japan Automo- bile Research Institute, Inc. This paper reports on research works of ACE toward the most appropriate injection and combustion system for heavy-duty direct injection diesel engines. Selected items for the study are the effect of nozzle hole diameter, injection rate pattern, swirl ratio, and supercharging under high pressure fuel injection. According to those experimental results, the combination of over 150MPa injection pressure with controlled injection rate, smaller nozzle hole diameter, and quiescent combustion systems shows the best performance and emission. The mechanisms of the combustion improvement are discussed from the turbulent mixing viewpoint, including the results of combustion observation. 1991 SAE Transactions Section 3 910491. (P-242) Fluid level sensors designed for 0.3 to 3 meter tanks. Richard E. Riley and Philip Lawson, Spectrol Electronics Corp. Fluid level sensors for fuel and other liquids have been designed using two resistor technologies. One method provides a sensor with a variable resistance 2 wire signal in the 0 to 500 ohm range for use with most conventional magnetic gauges. Another method provides a Potentiometrie 3 wire signal for use with electronic gauges. Both resistor technologies are suitable for fuel level sensors in trucks, off-road vehicles, and storage tanks. Descriptions of sev- eral recent applications are discussed. 910492. (P-242) Capacitive fuel level sensor: Performance and system approach. Francis Geslot, Magneti Marelli. Recent advances in materials have made it possible to develop a capatible measurement fuel level sensor capatible with the new oxygenated fuels and competitive with present products. Not only does this design bring higher levels in both the reliability and the quality of the fuel level measurement, but it also presents sev- eral characteristics that allow to offer extra functions at a low marginal cost. A presentation will be made of the product and the results of its evaluation in various environment conditions. Sev- eral different cases of use will be discussed. 910493. (P-242) Temperature sensor for vehicle. Akifumi Tamaoki, Takuo Shibata, and Hisao Sirai, Toyota Motor Corp. A high reliability and low cost temperature sensor for motor vehicle has been developed.

(P-242) Encoders, switches and other electronic com- ponents utilizing new thick film material technology. Richard E. Riley and Daniel R. Sparks, Spectrol Electronics Corp. A new thick film material system produces smooth long wear- ing conductor patterns surrounded by a non-abrasive insulating surface. The insulator/conductor interface is essentially co-planar which allows extremely long life with a sliding contact. Mechani- cal, electrical and environmental integrity are excellent due to use of high temperature cermet materials on the alumina ceramic substrates. Manufacturing costs are low due to the process sim- plicity. Several automotive electronic components utilizing this tech- nology are described. 910495. (P-242) Semiconductor sensors and microstructures in automotive applications. Roger H . Grace, Roger Grace Associates. This paper presents an overview of semiconductor sensors as they apply to automotive applications. We will track the develop- ment and application of sophisticated automotive sensors from their first application in the early 70's to the current day. The focus of the paper is silicon piezoresistive pressure sensors and accelerometers and silicon/gallium arsenide microwave based proximity, displacement, velocity and motion sensors. Currently competing technologies of force sensing resistors and piezo films are also presented. General characteristics and unique features of all these sensor technologies are addressed. The total available market for automotive sensors in 1990 and 1996 is presented as well as general information including histori- cal and future penetration levels of electronic systems and sen- sors. Current and future applications of these sensors in the main application areas of: comfort, convenience and security; safety; drive train; and vehicle diagnostics is given. Market and technology trends for semiconductor sensors are addressed. 910496. (P-242) Surface micromachined accelerometer: A technology update. Richard S. Payne and Kristin A. Dinsmore, Analog Devices Semiconductor. The measurement of acceleration has been accomplished using several technologies in high-reliability applications such as detonation, guidance control, and shock and vibration measure- ment. Electro-mechanical, piezoelectric, piezoresistive and capacitive acceleration sensors are available and in use today. The application of these technologies in the automobile indus- try has been slow, largely due to their high cost. Today numerous companies are working hard to develop a cost-effective, reliable and complete automotive accelerometer for use in airbag deploy- ment, seat belt retraction, door lock control, adaptive suspen- sions, anti-lock brakes and traction control systems. This paper will compare and contrast the various technologies now being applied to the development of a small and cost-effective elec- tronic accelerometer device, and report on the progress in devel- oping a complete, monolithic, signal-conditioned accelerometer which will optimally address automotive requirements. 1991 SAE Transactions Section 6 910497. (P-242) A capacitive oil deterioration sensor. George S. Saloka and Allen H. Meitzler ; Electronic Materials and Devices Dept., Ford Motor Co. There is a need for sensors that respond to chemical and physi- cal properties of engine oil. In response to this need, an experi- mental design of an engine-mounted, capacitive sensor has been 68</page><page sequence="68">910497-910505 developed to monitor changes in the dielectric constant of the engine oil. The sensing element is a small, air-gap capacitor that is mounted in a spacer ring that fits between the oil filter and the engine block. Embedded in the same spacer ring is the associated circuitry. Experiments have been carried out with experimental capaci- tive oil sensors mounted on engines using a typical full- formulated, factory-fill oil. The oil dielectric constant initially decreases and is less than the starting value while the anti-oxidant additives are active. After about 1600 km, the antioxidant addi- tives become sufficiently depleted to allow oxidation products to accumulate and for the oil dielectric constant to increase at a steady rate of about 1% per 1000 km. 910498. (P-242) Development of an optical fuel composition sensor. Hiroyoshi Suzuki and Kenji Ogawa, Himeji Works , Mit- subishi Electric Corp. Two types of the fuel composition sensor (FCS) are under development for the following purposes: 1) detection of methanol concentration in methanol blended gasoline fuel for FFV; and 2) detection of gasoline quality, heavy or light, for vehicles using ordinary gasoline at the fuel. Measurement of refractive index or dielectric constant is effec- tive for the purpose of above (1), and measurement of refractive index is effective for the purpose of the above (2). Of the sensors of these two types, the FCS of new optical type which has been developed earlier is described in this report. The FCS is designed compact, has a high response, and gives liner voltage output within any desired range of refractive index. As the primary advantages, the FCS is resistive to deposits on optical parts and is highly durable as a result of applying refrac- tive method and photo-position detection system. 1991 SAE Transactions Section 4 910499. (P-242) Application of rapid optical measurement to detect the fluctuations of the air-fuel ratio and temperature of a spark ignition engine. K. Sohma, T. Yukitake, and S. Azuhata , Hitachi Research Lab., Hitachi Ltd.; and Y. Takaku, Sawa Works, Hitachi Ltd. The fluctuations of excess air ratios and temperatures in a combustion chamber of a spark ignition engine have been mea- sured with the optical diagnostic technique. Excess air ratios and temperatures were estimated by the ratio of light emission inten- sities of 431 nm and 517 nm, 502 nm and 797 nm respectively. Data collection rate was set up at 50 kHz, which was fast enough to detect the fluctuation in one combustion cycle. Two types of fuel injector were evaluated from the viewpoint of fluctuation of excess air ratio. Mean droplet diameter was 200 jim in Type-I and injector and 110 ^m in Type-II. Probability density function (PDF) showed that Type-II provided smaller variance of excess air ratio than Type-I. PDF of flame temperature was proved to be well correlated to the engine knocking. During an engine knocking, the average temperature was lower than that obtained at normal operation. 1991 SAE Transactions Section 3 910500. (P-242) Inlet flow characterization of thermal mass air flow meters. M. C. Lai, T. Lee, and J. S. Xu, Mech. Engrg. Dept., Wayne State Univ.; and S. Kwak, Ford Motor Co. The accuracy of mass air flow rate measurement by thermal mass air flow sensors (MAFS) is critical to computer-controlled engine operations. However, accurate measurements are usually limited by the principle and the size of the thermal anemometer. Detailed flow field information at the inlet plane of a MAFS is needed to improve MAFS design and operation. In the present investigation, point velocity measurements (mean and fluctuating components) along the inlet plane of a MAFS are conducted by using a laser doppler anemometer sys- tem. The effects of the size of the thermal elements on the accu- racy of the MAFS mass air flow measurements are explored. The effects of a dust-aged filter and a partially blocked filter on the flow structure are also examined. It is found that the velocity dis- tributions are complicated at the inlet plane and are strongly influenced by the geometry and by the filter blockage effects. The experimental results are useful to mass air flow sensor design and operation, and to the verification of the accuracy of numerical calculations. 1991 SAE Transactions Section 3 910501. (P-242) Air-fuel ratio sensor utilizing ion transporta- tion in zirconia electrolyte. Takao Sasayama and Teruo Yamauchi, Hitachi America, Ltd.; Robert Byers, Hitachi Far- mington Hills Technical Center; Seikoo Suzuki, Hitachi, Ltd.; and Sadayasu Ueno, Sawa Works, Hitachi Ltd. To detect an air-fuel ratio in wide range is very important to control the automotive engines with low fuel consumption and low exhaust emissions. Although the application of zirconia elec- trolyte for this purpose has been proposed by the authors several years ago, there remained several problems due to the contamina- tion of gas diffusion apertures which are exposed to the exhaust gas environment. Here the behavior of ions transported in zirconia electrolyte have been analyzed to optimize the structure and characteristics, and to guarantee the long life operation of sensor. Gas contents and their reactions in combustion process under the wide range air-fuel ratio have been analyzed, and these results were reflected to the analysis of ion transportation in zirconia electrolyte. Exper- imental results supported the analytical results, and they showed the possibilities of long life operation of zirconia air-fuel ratio sensor utilizing ion transportation phenomena. Results of dura- bility tests in typical engines have also been shown in this paper. 910502. Why adhesives work: Practical applications of theory. Daryl J. Doyle, GMI Engineering and Management Institute. Some adherends require extensive surface preparation prior to adhesive-bonding while other adherends will form strong adhe- sive bonds with little or no surface preparation. This paper will attempt to explain the reasons that the above statement is true. Several theories of adhesion will be discussed and the practical application of each will be described. Chemical and physical characteristics of adherend surfaces and several methods for sur- face analysis will be identified. Finally, an overview of surface preparation methods along with the advantages and disadvan- tages of each will be described. 910503. The effects of substrate surface contamination on adhesives. Philip J. Brown, Industrial Group, Loctite Corp. As most all bonded assemblies rely upon intimate contact of the substrates, the condition of the actual bond area becomes crit- ical to insuring optimum strength. When surfaces are contami- nated, obviously bond strength is sacrificed. The author discusses various surface finishes, roughness, common industrial contami- nants, methods of testing, and effects of all of the above on bond strength. 910504.

A readily extractable thermoplastic material in the SMC contributed to the formation of weak boundary layers which could lead to near-interface failures and allow the growth of bubbles in the curing adhesire near the interface. The distribu- tion of components in near-interface failure specimens was deter- mined using FTIR and ESCA. A mathematical model of pore penetration by a curing liquid was developed to investigate dynamic wetting phenomena. 1 991 SAE Transactions Section 6 910506. Structural repair of composites.

(SP-865) Progress toward nondestructive, on-line measurement of sheet metal formability. A. V. Clark, National Institute of Standards and Technology; Norbert Izworski, Ford Motor Co.; and M. Hirao and Y. Cohen, National Institute of Standards and Technology. A completely nondestructive means of r-value measurement is being developed. Unlike the modul-r method, it requires no specimen removal and has potential for on-line measurement. The method employs noncontacting ultrasonic transducers which generate waves propagating at three different angles rela- tive to the sheet rolling direction. A prototype instrument based on these principles has been jointly developed by researchers at Ford Motor Company and National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST). At present, there are correlations between ultrasonic and mechanical measurements of r. The ultrasonic measurements generally agree with mechanical measurements to 0.1 or better. A method based on metallurgical theories is being developed to use ultrasonic velocity measurements to predict not only r, but individual r values. To date, all measurements have been made on static sheet. We are currently developing a device to move sheet metal at con- trolled velocity. This will allow simulation of on-line operation, as in a rolling mill. In addition, a circuit has been developed to automate the velocity measurements and transmit them to a computer. The eventual goal is to predict r-values from these measurements, using metallurgical theories. The predictions should be done in about 1 s, allowing for possible on-line mea- surement and control of r-value. 910510. (SP-865) The effect of surface finish on the drawing characteristics of chromium-plated sheet metal forming tools. James H. Lindsay, Physical Chemistry Dept., General Motors Research Labs.; Harmon D. Nine, Physics Dept., General Motors Research Labs.; and Mary K. Mickalich, Chevrolet- Pontiac-G M of Canada Group, General Motors Corp. Experience in stamping plants has suggested that there are considerable differences in the ability of different chromium- plated dies to form sheet metal. Earlier laboratory work indicated that differences in friction resulting from different surface fin- ishes among chromium-plated dies might be an important factor in the observed behavior. The effect of surface roughness was studied by measuring the friction of sheet metal drawn through chromium-plated drawbeads in a drawbead simulator. Surface roughness was varied by polishing the as-plated surface to smoother finishes, step-by-step, and measuring the friction at each step. It was found that rough finishes exhibited the highest friction. As the finish became smoother, friction was reduced. However, friction reached a minimum and began to rise as the finish became still finer. This suggests that in production tools there is an optimum surface roughness which will give the best forming for sheet metal stamping. 1991 SAE Transactions Section S 910511.

The effects of bead surface roughness on friction, die pickup, and sheet surface damage in the drawbead test were investigated. Beads of HRC 58 hardness were prepared from centerless-ground rod by circumferential honing to 0.05 jim roughness, followed by finishing with 100, 400, or 600 grit SiC paper in the axial direc- tion. Paraffinic base oils with viscosities of 4.5, 30, and 285 mm2/s were used neat and in conjunction with stearic acid. The effects of bead roughness depended on the nature of metal transfer, especially its distribution and firmness of attachment. The presence of a boundary additive increased, decreased, or had no effect on friction depending on the particular coating and bead finish. 1991 SAE Transactions Section 5 910512. (SP-865) Obtaining LDH stability. Norbert Izworski, Ford Motor Co.; and Alejandro Graf, University of Michigan. There are quite a few studies on the influences of coatings and base materials on the results of LDH (limiting dome height) test. Although these influences are hard to quantify, and the interde- pendence of one variable with the other makes interpreting the results even more complicated, a basic understanding has been achieved. The influence of temperature is not clear, but there are some indications that increasing temperatures have a detrimental effect on the LDH values. A previous investigation carried out at Ford Motor Company on a QC LDH machine reveals that the LDH decreases with increasing temperature of the system (basi- cally three temperatures were monitored: punch, binder, and hydraulic oil reservoir). Such a behavior can have important con- sequences in the industrial implementation of the LDH test: if temperature has a significant effect, then the statistical value of the results is reduced. This investigation was conducted at the Stamping Develop- ment Laboratory of Ford Motor Company. Although the LDH test machine used is not a QC type, the general trends obtained are believed to be applicable to other machines. 1991 SAE Transactions Section 5 910513. (SP-865) Stretch-flange formability of high-strength steel. Nobuhiko Matsuzu, Atsushi Itami, and Kazuo Koyama, Kimitsu R&amp;D Lab., Nippon Steel Corp. A high stretch-flange formability is required of the suspension parts and road wheels. So, the factors effecting stretch-flange for- mability of hot rolled high strength steel sheet were investigated. The stretch-flange formability was evaluated with a punched hole expansion ratio (X = d/do). 70</page><page sequence="70">910513-910521 The inclusion (MnS etc.) deteriorates X. The hole expansion property is affected by a microstructure. Bainite is most desirable. Incidentally, the form of the cementite in bainite has effect on it. Increase of Si accelerates a fine dispersion of cementite and improves the hole expansion property. The microstructure has the effect on the shape of burr on the punched face, a micro-crack condition or a crack propagation property and as the result, it affects the hole expansion property. 910514. (SP-865) Approximate formability analysis of two- step stretch flanges. Michael L. Wenner, Mathematics Dept., General Motors Research Labs. Many stretch flanges in sheet metal parts are formed from material which has been significantly strained in a previous form- ing operation. This paper uses the assumption of axisymmetry and an engineering approximation to develop a formula for the final flange length, given the shape of the intermediate configura- tion and the trim location. The maximum flange length is limited by splitting of the metal at the free edge, and the strain level at which splitting takes place depends strongly on the strain state and magnitude of the intermediate configuration. Using the above-mentioned formula with experimentally determined form- ing limits, a computer program is developed to calculate maxi- mum flange lengths for balanced biaxial prestrain. Comparison is made to some limited experimental data. 910515. (SP-865) Pre-bent effect on binder wrap of a trunk deck-lid. S. C. Tang and J. H. Wu, Ford Motor Co. An existing binder computer program including a preproces- sor to establish a finite element model has been modified so that it can analyze the blank of a trunk deck-lid outer panel with pre- bend. The formula for computing the spring-back shape after a blank under cylindrical bending with a specific radius is derived in this paper. Using this spring-back shape as a starting configura- tion instead of a flat blank, the modified program computes the binder wrap of an automotive body panel. Two trunk deck-lid outer panels were analyzed to illustrate the effects of pre-bend. 910516. (SP-865) Blank development and metal flow analysis for multi-stage drawing of box shaped stampings. Ahmad Assem- poor and Medhat Karima , Forming Technologies Inc. Blank development is the basis for calculating the material cost and hence the product cost, at the quoting stage. Under- standing the metal flow under the binder is a critical activity dur- ing the tooling design stages, as well as during phototyping. The paper describes a computer aided blank development and metal flow analysis system, that will assist in performing the functions described above, before the tools are built, for box shaped parts drawn in multi-stage forming operations with a flat punch face, and a flat binder. Development of the minimum blank shape, using the SLF technique for shrink flanged components is not new. The paper addresses the extension of the approach to: 1) multi-stage forming operations; and 2) the incorporation of the effect of thickness changes on the blank shape. Applications are given in the paper using the computer program BLANKDEV. 910517. (SP-865) Simplified formability analysis for die devel- opment and production troubleshooting. D. J. Hogarth , C. A. Gré- goire , and S. L. Caswell National Steel Corp. Formability analysis of automotive body stampings has typi- cally employed use of circle grid analysis (CGA) techniques. These methods are widely accepted by users and suppliers throughout the industry. Although a proven means of measuring sheet metal deformation, the CGA methodology is not without drawbacks. Utilization of thickness strains to determine forma- bility both compliments CGA and simplifies strain analysis. Using the constant volume equation, a four-step approach to thickness strain analysis (TSA) is provided. Differences between original and final thickness can be readily converted to strain readings and plotted on developed thickness strain diagrams (TSD). Also presented is a case study which illustrates effective TSA techniques during tooling development to ensure an ade- quate part safety margin. This alternative technique to formability analysis offers many benefits over traditional CGA methods. Some of these include: ease of understanding, improved reproducibility, less time con- sumed, and less labor intensive. The advantages of using thick- ness strains have the potential to directly impact sheet metal for- mability and design via increased acceptance and understanding by tool and die makers and engineers. 1991 SAE Transactions Section 5 910518. (SP-860) Development of substrate formulation via simplex mixture design. Robert V. Hoy and Harry Stefanou, ARCO Chemical Co. The intent of this paper is to demonstrate the benefits of using experimental design techniques in product formulations. In this example, an optimized product was developed using minimal experimental trials by the use of a simplex mixture design. The resultant product was tailored within mechanical property, weight, and cost constraints. The new formulation was devel- oped, prototyped, and tested quickly in order to be available to substitute for a heavier, more expensive steel and aluminum part. 910519. (SP-860) Evaluation of thermoplastic materials for automotive interior trim applications. Tonja R. Sutton and Wes J. Spaulding, Dow Chemical Co. Material and design engineers are constantly faced with the task of selecting the best thermoplastic material for interior trim applications. The purpose of this paper is to relate the results of physical property testing and part evaluation to their plastics selection process to allow a more optimized material choice for automotive interior applications. The thermoplastics that were evaluated in this study are the two largest volume plastics used today in interior trim, ABS (acrylonitrile, butadiene, styrene ter- polymer) and polypropylene. 1991 SAE Transactions Section 5 910520. (SP-860) Advances in urethane foam composites for interior trim. Michael P. Dempsey and Michael F. Hurley, Mobay Corp. The use of low density urethane foam composites in automo- tive interior trim is an established technology. In existing applica- tions such as door trim panels, increasing production volumes are providing the impetus for process modifications and improved formulations. In emerging applications such as instru- ment panel covers new performance requirements must be met. The development of new Baydur STR/F formulations to address these needs are discussed. 910521. (SP-860) Thermoplastic adhesive films for automotive interior trim applications. Stephen M. Imfeld, Richard H. Bran- don, Michael J. Kocsis, Mark T. Stewart, and Laurie P. Benedict, Dow Chemical Co. Joining dissimilar parts in automotive interior trim applica- tions has been accomplished by utilizing mechanical fasteners, organic and water based adhesives, and more recently, thermo- plastic polymers. Recent trends toward reducing solvent emis- sions and waste management problems, improving the consis- tency of adhesive application, integrating parts, lowering parts fabrication costs, and designing a specified bond level has increased the use of thermoplastic adhesive films as bonding agents in several applications. Initial efforts began over fifteen years ago with Dow Adhesive Films (DAF) being designed for bonding interior trim fabrics to various substrates. Films have subsequently been designed to improve performance of many interior trim parts in many ways such as: improving water resistance, allowing the part to be 71</page><page sequence="71">910521-910529 molded before installation, imparting a slip surface to a part, and supporting a non-woven fabric. Recent developments include adhesive films which: have deeper draw characteristics, activate at faster machine cycle times, provide encapsulation to fiberglass insulation, or provide a barrier to liquid foam systems without the need for additional wet adhesives. This paper will describe the functions and applications of Dow Adhesive Films into inte- grated automotive interior parts, highlighting several of these applications. 910522. (SP-860) Interior parts - Data sheet versus real life performance. Mitch Sierodzinski and Dan Weissmann , Mon- santo Chemical Co. The design and material selection for interior trim parts must take into account the expected service life and environment of the part. This environment is largely the high temperatures encountered in the automobile interior and occasional contact with various interior cleaning agents. Material selection is customarily based on information found in material data sheets. This data is generated by using standard ASTM test specimens and test methods. While those results are useful, the data is generated under molding conditions which may be far from the ones under which actual parts are produced. Molding conditions, material characteristics, part design, and gating play a major role in the real performance of the molded parts. This paper will demonstrate the effect of some of those param- eters on the actual performance of interior parts. 910523. (SP-860) Environmental aspects of mixed metal oxide colorants. Sunil S. Parikh , Mark A. Cushman, David E. Poulin , and Kathleen T. Mailhot , Monsanto Chemical Co. The cadmium and lead salts (along with organic colorants) especially pigments used for coloration of thermoplastic poly- mers, have been regarded as technological and functional necessi- ties in nearly every sphere of our daily lives. They also greatly influence our mood and thus contribute enormously to the very quality of the lives we lead. At the same time, we have come to realize that our achieve- ments and continuing technological progress are only worthwhile provided they pose no hazard to the environment as well as human life. The regulatory agencies, corporate laboratories, cus- tomers, consumers and employees alike have identified problems with lead and cadmium colorants. To meet these challenges, a color chemist must become familiar not only with what pigments are available, but how they differ from one another. The use of environmentally safer colorants are a trend for the 1990's. Monsanto has been exploring alternates to cadmium pig- ments in their resins for several years. 910524. (SP-860) Single-step multifunction molding- A design for world competition. Siebolt Hettinga, Hettinga Equip- ment, Inc. Low pressure molding is a radical departure from conven- tional injection molding. It enables designers to combine totally different materials in a single step, to produce parts with multiple functions. By taking this approach, manufacturers can reduce assembly labor, material cost, and part weight while improving their competitive position. But because it is so different, designers and processors are required to re-think their approach to product design and manu- facturing. A more integrated, systems approach is required and this demands a willingness to look at new technologies. Already, textile and film suppliers are gearing up to meet the demands of new process technologies, such as low pressure molding. 910525. (SP-860) Water-blown integral skin foams for steering wheel applications. Michael Scarpati, Bari W. Brown, Richard P. Harrison, and Blair J. Zagata, Polymers Div., BASF Corp. New technology for the cost effective production of high qual- ity integral skin steering wheels is discussed in this paper. ELAS- TOFOAM® WB water-blown integral skin polyurethane foam systems were developed to replace the conventional CFC (chloro- fluorocarbon) blown systems currently used to manufacture steering wheels and other interior trim parts. Comparisons are made between the typical, CFC-blown foams and the water-blown foams in terms of reactivity profiles, physi- cal properties and processing. Several other inherent differences between the two materials are also reviewed. In addition, the cost effectiveness of the new foam systems is compared to CFC-blown systems. Finally, the advantages of utilizing water-blown prod- ucts for the production of steering wheels are summarized. 910526. (SP-860) Improvement of PC/ABS blend in weld line strength for automotive parts. Mikio Kodama and Katsuji Abe, Sumitomo Naugatuck Co., Ltd. PC/ABS blends are being used in applications for automotive parts because of their good balance in heat resistance, impact strength, and dimensional stability. The weld line strength of the blends is, however, much inferior to that of each base polymer, and this poor strength sometimes causes trouble in the performance of the final product. A study was made on the composition of PC/ABS blends for improving this poor weld line strength. As the result of this study, it was found that a specific composi- tion of ABS (high molecular weight SAN, higher rubber content, and high molecular weight PC) and an additive (modified polyolefine) could remarkably improve the weld line strength. Electron microscopic photographs and physical properties showed that the specific additive could improve the compatibil- ity of PC and ABS resins. This paper focuses on the conclusion of the development effort of the improved PC/ABS blend. 910527. (SP-866) A heat transfer study comparing insulated and conductive radial lip seal running surfaces. David M. Toth, Chassis Products Operations, Federal-Mogul Corp. The operating temperature of the primary lip of a radial lip seal is a critical parameter of seal performance. The vehicular industry is requesting unitized seals with extended life for high speed applications. The rubber lined steel running surface config- uration used in most unitized seal designs creates an unfavorable operating condition for the primary lip operating temperature. This condition, as observed in testing, is a result of poor heat transfer capability away from the primary lip. An analysis using finite element modeling and a verification technique utilizing an infrared energy measurement device of this heat transfer and of a primary seal lip running on a solid steel shaft is discussed. 910528. (SP-866) Manufacturing and engineering advance- ments in PTFE seal technology. Michael A. Savoia, Div. of Fed- eral Mogul, Mather Seal Co. PTFE began to see limited use as a seal material in the late 1950's. In the 70's and 80's, it became the material of choice for diesel engine crankshaft seals in North America. Despite its well documented success in these applications, the use of this material in the automotive market was hampered by the additional costs necessary to manufacture it. With the introduction of an econom- ical method for bonding PTFE to metal, the finished cost of a PTFE seal becomes competitive with elastomeric seals in sizes and types conventionally used in the automotive market. 910529. (SP-866) Operation of radial lip seals on roller- burnished and other shaft surface finishes. Bruce Lyle Murden, Transmission and Axle Seal Engrg., Sealing Products Operations, Federal-Mogul; and Stanley N. Smith, Sealing Products Opera- tions, Federal-Mogul Corp. 72</page><page sequence="72">910529-910537 The shaft surface upon which a high performance radial lip seal operates is the second most important element of a sealing system, second only to the seal itself. For many years the standard specification for shaft surface finish or texture was "0.25 -0.50 jim Ra plunge ground with no machine lead". Since this has been a costly and difficult process to create and control for many appli- cations, other shaft processing methods have been used. This paper outlines the initiation of a study to evaluate the perfor- mance of radial lip seals on a variety of shaft surface finishes. The converter hub or front pump seal application has been selected for this study due to the unique shaft finishing processes incorpo- rated. 910530. (SP-866) The correlation of rotary shaft radial lip seal service reliability and pumping ability to wear track roughness and microasperity formation. Les Horve, CR Industries. The performance of elastomeric radial lip seals for rotating shafts and hub applications can be correlated to the texture of the wear track on both trimmed and molded sealing lips. Seals with rough wear tracks have an abundance of microasperities that pro- vide good pump rates and excellent service reliability. Seals with smooth wear tracks have no microasperities, poor pump rates and poor service reliability. The pumping ability of seals with smooth wear tracks can be enhanced for a short time by artifi- cially roughening the wear tracks. Pumping ability and service reliability can be improved by changing elastomeric material for- mulations to provide microasperities in the wear track. 1991 SAE Transactions Section 6 910531. (SP-866) Analysis of cracking phenomena on carbon- rings of mechanical seals for an automotive air conditioning com- pressor. Takao Shimomura, Takashi Yanagisawa, Keiichi Chiba, and Hiroshi Hirabayashi, Eagle Industry Co., Ltd.; and Toshikatsu Nakajima, Okay ama Univ. Mechanical seals have been applied as a sealing device for an automotive air conditioning compressor. Sometimes, the leaking trouble occurs under the conditions such as excessive wear, blis- tering formation and cracking phenomena on the carbon-ring. This paper is concerned with the analysis of cracking phenom- ena based upon finite element method (FEM) calculation and experimental investigation. 910532. (SP-866) Sealing phenomena of a lip-type seal for an automotive air conditioning compressor. Keiichi Chiba, Takao Shimomura, and Hiroshi Hirabayashi, Eagle Industry Co., Ltd. Instead of end-face type seals, lip-type seals have recently been widely applied as sealing devices for automotive air conditioning compressors, and have shown good sealing performance in prac- tical applications. This paper is concerned with the sealing phenomena of lip- type seals, which run under hydrodynamic lubrication between the lip/shaft surfaces. 1991 SAE Transactions Section 6 910533. (SP-866) The effect of environmentally conditioned gear lubricants on unitized radial lip oil seals. William K. Nickert, Federal-Mogul Corp. There have been persistent, unexplained unitized wheel seal leakers in commercial vehicles. These leakers occur regardless of seal design or manufacturer. A study of these leakers concludes that stressed EP gear lubricants in combination with water can cause excess wear of unitized seal components. This paper describes the investigation into seal leak causes, duplication of the phenomenon in the laboratory, and suggestions for remedial action. 1991 SAE Transactions Section 6 910534. (SP-866) Investigation of leakage phenomena and improvement of sealing performance of seal rings used for rotary shafts of automatic transmissions. Toshihiko Kuroki and Mit - suhiro Sowa, NOK Corp. In automotive automatic transmissions, seal rings made of cast iron or polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) have conventionally been installed between the rotary shaft and housing to prevent oil leakage. Recent trends have indicated that there is an increase in the number of cars with automatic transmission, and leakage past the seal rings has become more critical from a functional view point. In this presentation, the leakage phenomena will be dis- cussed, and seal rings with an improved shape and material will be introduced. The result of this design is a lower rate of leakage. 1991 SAE Transactions Section 6 910535. (SP-866) The influence of designing factors on the sealing performance of C-seal. Takashi Yanagisawa, Masamitu Sanada, Tadashi Koga, and Hiroshi Hirabayashi, Eagle Industry Co., Ltd. C-shaped metal seals (C-seal) are used as static seals under the conditions such as high vacuum, high pressure, high temperature and cryogenic states. The correlation between the sealing performance and design parameters as loading force, deformation, and the surface rough- ness of contacting faces have been investigated. This paper is concerned with the relationship between the sur- face condition of the coated-lead layer of C-seals and the surface roughness of mating flange. The effects of surface condition on leakage are examined fundamentally. Annular coated-lead layer on the surface of a C-seal prevents leakage, though there exist the fine defects or surface irregularities on the flange. It becomes clear from the test results that the surface conditions of the flange and loading force closely relate to the leakage rates with the deflection of C-seal under the load and the behavior of the contact condition of flange surface. 1991 SAE Transactions Section 6 910536. Development of test procedure for quantifying perfor- mance benefits of solar control glazings on occupant comfort. Ronald R. Hymore and Robert F. Tweadey, Glass Div., Ford Motor Co.; and Donald F. Wozniak, Climate Control Div., Ford Motor Co. The evaluation of the performance benefits of solar load reducing glazings using production vehicles is key to the estab- lishment of the product cost/benefit ratio. Climatic windtunnels normally use to evaluate heat gain and vehicle cooldown can not provide true solar simulation. Comparative testing using a test car and a control vehicle must therefore be conducted outside in uncontrollable ambient conditions. The subject paper deals with the development of a testing methodology capable of quantifying thermal performance differ- ences, as low as 5%, resulting from component differences, including glazings. The procedure described includes the use of B&amp;K thermal comfort meters to standardize the refrigeration sys- tem performance and to evaluate the rate of vehicle interior cool- down. Data taken during summer test programs in the Southwest for evaluation of heat absorbing glazings will be reviewed. Data to be presented include interior air and surface temperatures dur- ing soak testing and cooldown comparisons under city drive con- ditions. The general relationship of comfort meter data to driver comfort index will also be discussed. 910537. Climate measurements for glass with different energy properties. Fredrik Norin, Volvo Car Corp. Recent developments in glass treatment techniques have made it possible to improve vehicle compartment climate con- siderably. At the same time, it has become obvious that tradi- tional temperature measurements do not cover the total need for describing climate properties. This is due to the fact that human heat balance, which is the fundamental process behind feeling 73</page><page sequence="73">910537-910546 cold or hot, is a function not only of temperature but also of draft and radiation. Coating glass is one means of preventing solar radiation from coming into the compartment. In doing so, the solar heat load through the glazing can be reduced by some 50%. This, of course, gives a lower compartment temperature in park- ing conditions and also a faster cool-down in hot climate. It has two major secondary impacts on the human being: at a given air flow through the compartment, the necessary inlet temperature is increased, thereby causing less draft; and direct radiation on body surfaces is also reduced. The total evaluation of glass with reflecting or absorbing prop- erties must therefore include measurements with instruments like the Bruel and Kjaer comfort meter or the Voltman system as presented in SAE reports no. 850042 and 890049. The latter system, which gives a total picture of heat load on different body parts in a given situation, is of course the most sophisticated method for this part of the evaluation. In this paper, some suggestions are given for testing routines. They include: parking heat-up and idling cool-down tests; and Voltman on-road testing and simulated on-road testing outdoors. 910538. Comparisons of solar control coated glass and absorb- ing glass. Ronald D. Goodman , Libbey -Owens-Ford Co. The relative merits of solar reflective glass and solar absorbing glasses are compared to base glass in the following areas: 1) direct v. indirect solar gain; 2) direct solar absorption by the car interior; 3) direct solar absorption by human skin; and 4) UV transmis- sion. The comparison indicates that both solar reflective and solar absorbing glasses have advantages in all areas over base glass. The solar reflective glass is superior to solar absorbing glass in reducing heat gain because of its lower solar absorption. 910539. A heat transfer simulator for evaluation of automotive glazing systems. Harold H. Hopfe, Monsanto Fellow. The Monsanto automobile heat transfer simulator (MHS) is a computer software package that is used to model the solar rejec- tion performance of automotive glazing systems. The simulator allows user inputs that are descriptive of the vehicle design, the surrounding environment and vehicle operating conditions. A variety of glazing options is available, including absorbing and reflecting glass, laminated safety glass with absorbing or reflecting polyuinylbutyral interlayer, and hybrids of these materials. It is not necessary that all lights in the vehicle be of the same construc- tion. Each light can be separately specified. The exposure envi- ronment is determined by specification of geographic location, time of year, time of day and vehicle heading. The specification of operating conditions includes the nature of the surrounding terrain, wind direction and speed, vehicle speed, vehicle ventila- tion and air conditioning. Outputs of the simulator include vehicle inside air tempera- ture, internal surface temperatures for shaded and directly exposed parts of the vehicle and the temperature of each glazing component. The simulator has two operating modes, a steady state "snapshot" mode and a continuous dynamic mode that operates over a 24 hour period. Operation of the simulator under static soak conditions has thus far shown excellent agreement with previous work con- ducted by Sullivan and Selkowits, Lawrence Berkeley Labora- tory. In addition to predicting vehicle interior air and surface temperatures, the simulator also calculates a heat stress index as a measure of occupant comfort. The application of MHS to a broader variety of situations comprises essentially a logical exten- sion of the Lawrence Berkeley work. 910540. Photo sensor for glass primer application when bond- ing windshield. Shinji Okuda and Tsuyoshi Magata , Sunstar Engrg. Inc. A new sensor has been developed for use in window glass bonding on automated and unmanned lines to determine the application condition of primer on window glass. This sensor uses light transmission to detect whether primer (black) has been applied to the portion of the window glass which is coated with a ceramic coating (black). This makes it possible for inspection to be carried out at the same time as a single robot is applying primer to the window glass, assuring outstanding cost perfor- mance. 910541. Solar control glass with neutral color for automobiles. E. Ando, J. Ebisawa, and K. Suzuki, Asahi Glass Co., Ltd.; and M. Ono, Fabricated Glass Div., Asahi Glass Co., Ltd. This paper describes monolithic solar control glass with high durability and neutral color (colorless reflection) for automotive windows. Layer systems of the solar control coating are com- posed of doubled layers (oxide/nitride/glass) and triple layers (oxide/nitride/oxide/glass), where a titanium nitride film is cho- sen for solar energy reduction and a novel zirconium based oxide film with a low refractive index is used as a protective layer together with reducing optical interference color. The nitride film and the oxide film are prepared by reactive DC magnetron sput- tering from a titanium target and an alloy targe without inten- tional substrate heating, respectively. Durability of the double layer coating is investigated against abrasion, chemicals and weathering. When the coating is applied to all windows of a pas- senger car, the reduction of a solar heat load is evaluated through an air-conditioner at simulated car speed under simulated solar radiation. 910542. Electrochromic materials for automotive applications. M. Ahsan Habib, Physical Chemistry Dept., General Motors Research Labs. The state of the art in electrochromic materials is briefly reviewed. These materials have potential for architectural and automotive applications for they provide control of radiant solar energy transmission. Optical properties of these materials can be reversibly changed by electrochemical oxidation and reduction. These optically switchable materials can provide control of solar heat load on air conditioning systems, reduce glare for rear view mirrors, and enhance privacy in an automobile. The main fea- tures of the electrochromic characteristics of the best-known groups of materials are described. The properties of some of the well-known materials such as WO3, Ni (OH)2, viologens, poly- aniline and Prussian Blue are discussed with particular reference to the mechanism of electrochromic reactions. 1991 SAE Transactions Section 6 910545. Electrochromic automotive glass. Hufya Demiryont, Glass Div., Ford Motor Co. Possible active and passive glass is reviewed in terms of "cool automotive glass". Electrochromics, electrochromic materials, and electrochromic device performance criteria are evaluated as a most promising active glass to control the interior light and heat level of a car. Various automotive applications of electrochromic glasses are also reviewed. 910546. Automotive insulating glass - Improvements in com- fort. Reinhold Fritsch, Flachglas AG. Calculations of U-values, glass surface temperatures and con- densation behavior, radiation exchange, and shading coefficients of automotive single and double glazings have been carried out at various car velocities. These criteria are considered to have a significant influence on passenger comfort and safe driving. The advantages of various types of double glazings compared to single glazings are pointed out in detail. This paper shows an improve- ment on all criteria for double glazing with solar control and low-E coating compared to tinted single glazing at both low and high car velocities. 1991 SAE Transactions Section 6 74</page><page sequence="74">910547-910558 910547. Improvement of the vehicle amenity with compound curved solar roof panel. N. Imajyo, K. Adachi, and S. Yaba , Asahi Glass Co ., Ltd.; K. Sato and T. Imamura , Fabricated Glass Div., Asahi Glass Co., Ltd.; and S. Kikugawa, Asahi Glass Co., Ltd. The present paper describes solar roof panels and their appli- cations to car ventilation. The solar roof panels contain hydroge- nated amorphous silicon solar cells. The process used for the solar cell fabrication is basically the same as conventional pro- cesses; hydrogenated amorphous silicon layers are deposited by plasma enhanced chemical vapor deposition (CVD). In our pro- cess, however, the hydrogenated amorphous silicon solar cells are directly fabricated onto the compound curved surface of the outer glass of the sun roof. Then they are hermetically sealed by laminating with the inner glass. We applied the solar roof panels to power supply unit for the car ventilation during parking. The solar roof panels were mounted onto the roof of the cars as a sun roof. Then we moni- tored the temperature decrease, while the ventilator was driven by the solar roof panels. Also the cooling effect of air conditioning after ventilation during parking was estimated. In the case of summer season, there was 13 degrees difference between with and without ventilation. Moreover, the subtracted heat with air conditioning system was decreased 17% with venti- lation during parking. From these results, it can be concluded that the driver would feel more comfortable, when he takes his seat after parking under sunshine. 910548. Application of all aluminum automotive body for Honda NSX. Yasunori Komatsu, Keisuke Ban, Takanobu Ito, Yasuo Muraoka, Takanori Yahaba, Kunihiro Yasunaga, and Makoto Shiokawa, Honda R&amp;D Co., Ltd. A sports car's high performance, pursued as its major design point, forces the car to be as light as possible. Because of this, the NSX's body and chassis is build by making the best use of alumi- num. This paper describes the development of aluminum for the NSX, and the forming and connecting technologies needed to achieve an all aluminum body. 910549. Development of magnesium steering wheel. Yoshinari Kawase and Hiroaki Shinto, Toyota Motor Corp.; and Takaomi Yoshida, Tokai Rika Co., Ltd. This paper describes the development of one-piece die cast magnesium steering wheel frame for a steering wheel incorporat- ing an air bag system. The light weight magnesium frame was designed to have proper stiffness, strength and characteristics of energy absorption. Magnesium alloys with various aluminum contents were tested, and AM60B alloy was selected because of its favorable properties of strength and elongation. New manu- facturing techniques, for example, a vacuum hot chamber die casting system and a surface defect inspection system were devel- oped in order to produce high quality castings. The characteris- tics of energy absorption were evaluated in the laboratory and on actual vehicle crash test, and the results were satisfactory. The magnesium steering wheel frame is about 45% (550g) lighter than the steel one. It has been in production in Toyota passenger cars with driver side air bags. 910551. The potential for vehicle weight reduction using mag- nesium. Jam es Davis, Norsk Hydro Magnesium. Reducing vehicle weight can play a significant role in reducing fuel consumption, while simulatenously improving performance and handling. Magnesium, if it is utilized effectively, can contrib- ute to major reductions in vehicle weight. The potential for reducing the weights of several vehicles is discussed. The purpose of this paper is to show the great potential for achieving major vehicle weight reductions, by taking a whole-vehicle approach to utilizing magnesium. 910552. Wheels and other automotive parts through the pore- free die casting process. Tadao Ito and Takanori Takikita, Nip- pon Light Metal Co., Ltd.; and Isao Miki, Nikkei Techno - Research Co., Ltd. The pore-free die casting process (hereinafter referred to as PFD) is a special method in which die casting is accomplished by filling die cavities with oxygen gas, which easily combines chemi- cally with molten metal to prevent gas bubbles in the product. The PFD makes it possible to utilize pressure die casting to its maximum advantage and also to eliminate many disadvantages incurred by entrapped gas pores. Nippon Light Metal Company, Ltd. started commercial pro- duction of aluminum wheels using the PFD process in 1982 and has also begun fabricating and marketing high quality magne- sium products to meet the latest market requirements. This paper will review the principle and technology of the PFD, and PFD application in automobile parts including light- weight wheel and other products. The product characteristics such as mechanical properties, heat treatment, microstructure, internal quality, corrosion resis- tance, etc. of aluminum and magnesium castings made by the PFD will be described. 910553. Design concept of magnesium accessory drive brack- ets. Alexander Nassar, Jeep and Truck Engrg., Chrysler Motors Corp. Chrysler Jeep and Truck Engineering Division has developed a new accessory drive system for the 2.5L and 4.0L in-line engines. This system was designed to comply with program man- agement assumptions which were set to meet customer needs and satisfy government requirements. The design objectives dictated a lightweight and cost efficient engine without compromising its quality or durability. These objectives were achieved by introduc- ing magnesium as a replacement to aluminum in the engine accessory drive mounting brackets. The selection was based on strength-to-weight ratio, weight reduction, durability, corrosion performance, prototype requirements, and cost efficiency. 910554. Application of aluminum for automobile chassis parts. Yasunori Komatsu, Takeo Arai, Haruki Abe, Masakazu Sato, and Yasushi Nakazowa, Honda R&amp;D Co., Ltd. Several processes, such as casting, forging, and pressing, were used in the manufacturing of the Honda NSX's aluminum chas- sis. For casting, a high grade method which utilizes program con- trol of mold temperature was developed and put into practical use. For optimum forging, a selection of cold and hot processes were investigated and a process to save energy during processing was pursued. As a result, an overall weight reduction of approxi- mately 50% was achieved. 910556. Filiform corrosion resistance of painted automotive body sheet. John H. Powers, Alcoa Labs. Accelerated and outdoor exposure studies were conducted on three automotive body sheet alloys-2036, 2008, and 6009-in order to compare their filiform corrosion resistance after paint- ing. The effect of variations in pretreatment and sanding prior to painting were studied and the amount of filiform corrosion was quantified. Both spray and immersion pretreatments were evalu- ated. A field survey of automobiles with 2036 alloy aluminum hoods in service for up to 10 years was conducted. 1991 SAE Transactions Section S 910558. (SP-863) The effect of piston temperature on hydro- carbon emissions from a spark-ignited direct-injection engine. Richard M. Frank, Thermosciences Dept., General Motors Research Labs.; and John B. Heywood, Sloan Automotive Lab., Massachusetts Institute of Technology. 75</page><page sequence="75">910558-910564 Light-load unburned hydrocarbon emissions were studied experimentally in spark-ignited direct-injection engine burning gasoline where the piston temperature was varied. The test engine was a single-cylinder direct-injection stratified-charge (DISC) engine incorporating a combustion process similar to the Texaco Controlled Combustion System. At a single low load operating condition, the piston temperature was varied by 50 K by control- ling the cooling water and oil temperature. The effect of this change on unburned hydrocarbon emissions and heat release pro- files was studied. It was found that by carefully controlling the intake air temperature and pressure to maintain constant in- cylinder conditions at the time of injection, the change in piston temperature did not have a significant effect on the unburned hydrocarbon emissions from the engine. It was concluded that fuel wetting of the piston surface is not a significant effect on the unburned hydrocarbon emissions from the engine. It was con- cluded that fuel wetting of the piston surface is not a significant source of hydrocarbon emissions from engines of this type when burning gasoline. 1991 SAE Transactions Section 3 910559. (SP-863) The use of gas dynamics to link in-cylinder and exhaust system unburnt hydrocarbon measurements on a spark ignition engine. W. A. Woods and P. Brown , Dept. of Mech. Engrg., Queen Mary and Westfield College t University of London; A. Panesar, B P Research Centre , Sundbury-upon-Thames; and O. Sogut, Dept. of Mech. Engrg., Queen Mary and Westfield College, University of London. The paper reviews the ideas on the sources of unburnt hydro- carbons in spark ignition engines. Time resolved measurements made in-cylinder and in the exhaust system in previous investiga- tions have revealed large differences between the cylinder and the exhaust system. It is not possible to distinguish between reduc- tions by mixing and oxidation. The object of the present paper is to investigate the links between the two sets of measurements using a new development of engine gas dynamics. An outline is given of the authors' measurements and the new aspects of the gas dynamics model. The key idea of the latter is the introduction of the "the path line streams". A recent study using this method is described and the results discussed. It explains the role of mix- ing at entry to the exhaust valve annulus and the post flame oxi- dation process. It is concluded that the new technique has exten- sive possiblities in the understanding of the problem of unburnt hydrocarbons from reciprocating engines. 910560. (SP-863) Emission factors for small utility engines. Jeff J. White, James N. Carroll, and Charles T. Hare, Southwest Research Institute ; and Jacline G. Lourenco, California Air Resources Board. A major gap exists in available baseline emissions data on the small utility engine population between the mid-1970's and pres- ent day. As part of the input required for a standard-setting pro- cess, the California Air Resources Board has funded limited labo- ratory emission measurements on a number of modern small engines, both 2-stroke and 4-stroke designs. Exhaust constituents characterized in this study include total hydrocarbons, reactive hydrocarbons (RHC), methane, CO, NOx, CO2, O2, aldehydes, and particulate matter. A total of nine engines were evaluated, spanning the range from the smallest widely-used 2-strokes (about 20 cc displacement) to 4-strokes approaching 20 hp. 1991 SAE Transactions Section 3 910561. (SP-863) Detection of catalyst failure on-vehicle using the dual oxygen sensor method. John W. Koupal, Michael A. Sabourin, and William B. Clemmens, U.S. Environmental Pro- tection Agency. On-vehicle proof-of-concept testing was conducted to evalu- ate the ability of the dual oxygen sensor catalyst evaluation method to identify serious losses in catalyst efficiency under actual vehicle operating conditions. The dual oxygen sensor method, which utilizes a comparison between an upstream oxy- gen sensor and an oxygen sensor placed downstream of the cata- lyst, was initially studied by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) under steady-state operating conditions on an engine dynamometer and reported in Clemmens, et al. At the time that study was released, questions were raised as to whether the technological concepts developed on a test fixture could be transferred to a vehicle operating under normal transient condi- tions. This paper reports the results of a test program that used the dual oxygen sensor system coupled with a simulated on-board diagnostic algorithm to attempt detection of seriously deterio- rated catalytic converters on a test vehicle operated over the Fed- eral Test Procedure (FTP). This paper reports that, with some modifications, the algorithm reported in Clemmens was used to successfully distinguish between two properly converting cata- lysts and two poorly converting catalysts on the same test vehicle. 910562. (SP-863) Simultaneous removal of NO*, SOx and soot in diesel engine exhaust by plasma/oil dynamics means. Nagatoshi Suzuki, Manabu Higashi, and Satoshi Uchida, Niles Parts Co., Ltd.; and Kan-ichi Fujii, Ibaraki Univ. The soot included in the exhaust gas from a diesel-engine vehi- cle (Nissan LD20, 2 liters) has been eliminated completely (100%) independent of the load and cruising speed by a novel technique using a combination of discharge plasma and oil dynamics. As far as we know, this is the first success in suppress- ing the black exhaust gas. The NOx (NO2 ± NO) and SOx compo- nents have also been reduced about 70% at a lotation number of 1200 rpm and a load of 7kg-m (the maximum torque at 1200 rpm is about 1 1.4 kg m), corresponding to 60% of full load. This simul- taneous treatment has becoem possible by using oil. The SOx elimination is the first report in out investigation. Thus, the worst three air pollutants, soot, SOx and NOx, are removed simulta- neously. 910563. (SP-863) Impact of methanol fuel blends on activated carbon performance. Roger S. Williams and H. Ray Johnson, Westvaco Corp. Methanol-gasoline blends have attracted a great deal of atten- tion as automotive fuels for both environmental and economic reasons. To better understand the effect of methanol concentra- tion on activated carbon performance, cycling tests with new car- bons and several different methanolrgasoline ratios were undertaken. The data obtained indicate that the keys to activated carbon performance with methanol-blended fuels are the pore size/volume characteristics. It was determined that the working capacity to breakthrough for methanol blends of 0, 10, and 35% by volume were wimilar but that the working capacity for 85% methanol was significantly lower. When the same carbon was cycled sequentially with gasoline and different concentrations of methanol, the abesorption/desorption performance tended to adjust or recover to levels expected. 1 991 SAE Transactions Section 4 910564. The effect of enhanced ignition systems on early flame development in quiescent and turbulent conditions. R. M. Modien, M. D. Checket, and J. D. Dale, Dept. of Mech. Engrg., University of Alberta. Previous research on the effects of enhanced ignition systems has produced some conflicting results, possibly related to the var- ious diagnostic methods used. In this investigation, several meth- ods were used to measure the effects on flame development for different spark ignition circuits in quiescent and turbulent pre- mixed gaseous mixtures. Sparks from a standard ignition circuit, typical of automotive use, were compared with sparks from a breakdown ignition circuit and from a plasma jet ignition circuit. It is shown that burning velocity calculation methods based on pressure trace analysis tend to be biased by any effects which pro- 76</page><page sequence="76">910564-910571 vide a more spherical flame growth; particularly by projecting the spark kernel into the mixture away from the spark plug. Thus, the pressure trace-based burning velocity measurements gave false indications when comparing flames growing from dissimilar igni- tion systems. Instead, direct photographic flame growth measure- ments and simple combustion duration measurements were used for a less biased comparison. These diagnostics show that the higher energy ignition circuits provide much faster initial flame development. The same conclusion is demonstrated in both qui- escent and turbulent mixtures. The apparent slight increase in burning velocity of developed flames for the breakdown and plasma jet ignition systems is thought to be a result of electromag- netically induced motion of the spark which results in a more favourable flame geometry. 910565. Performance of multiple stream pulsed jet combustion systems. /. A. M ax son, D. M. Hensinger, K. Horn, and A. K. Oppenheim, Lawrence Berkeley Lab., University of California. In the course of our studies on pulsed jet combustion (PJC) a series of tests were carried out to determine the performance of multi-stream systems. This included multi-jet efflux, as well as dual-generator aggregated. The essential performance indicator of a PJC system is the pressure transducer record, yielding, in par- ticular, data on the rise time and amplitude of the pressure pulse, as well as the rate of pressure rise. Concomitantly with pressure measurements, a sequence of schlieren records were obtained to reveal the salient features of the fluid mechanical phenomena of the PJC process. Elucidated thereby are the effects of entrapment induced by large scale vortex structures of turbulent jet plumes, and their decisive role in governing the process of combustion, as influenced by their particular configuration. Our tests demon- strated the capability of multiple stream PJC systems to shorten the rise time and increase the amplitude of the pressure pulse, both effects of obvious potential benefit to engine performance. 910566. The effects of speed and manifold pressure on autoignition in a motored engine. S . Addogarla, D. J. Filipe, D. L. Miller, and N. P. Cernansky, Drexel Univ.; and R. M. Green, San- dia National Labs. This paper presents a comparison of the autoignition tenden- cies for straight chain hydrocarbons and mixtures of primary ref- erence fuels in a motored engine. Minimum initial gas tempera- tures required to produce autoignition were measured as a func- tion of ftiel type, engine speed, and inlet manifold pressure. In- cylinder gas pressure versus crank angle and exhaust gas carbon monoxide concentrations were also monitored during these experiments as indicators of chemical activity. Overall, the autoignition behavior of n-pentane, n-hexane, and their equiva- lent octane number primary reference fuel blends was found to be dissimilar in 1) the inlet temperatures at which autoignition occurred; 2) the amount of CO formed prior to autoignition; and 3) the effect of engine speed on minimum inlet autoignition tem- peratures. Possible causes for this behavior are discussed in the paper in terms of the negative temperature coefficient behavior of large hydrocarbons. 1991 SAE Transactions Section 4 910567. Engine knock characteristics at the audible level. Tassos H. Valta doros, Victor W. Wong, and John B. Hey wood, Sloan Automotive Lab., Massachusetts Institute of Technology. The effects of combustion chamber and intake valve deposit build-up on the knocking characteristics of a spark ignition engine were studied. A Chrysler 2.2 liter engine was run continu- ously for 180 hours to build up intake valve and combustion chamber deposits. In the tests reported here, the gasoline used contained a deposit controlling fuel additive. The engines's octane requirement increased by 10 research octane numbers during this extended engine operating period. At approximately 24 hour intervals during these tests, the engine was audibly knock rated to determine its octane requirement. Cylinder pressure data was collected during knocking conditions to investigate the knocking characteristics of each cylinder, and deposit build-up effects on those statistics. Cylinder-to-cylinder variations in knock statistics were studied. Analysis of the data indicated that some 20 to 40 percent of cycles knock before the knock is audibly detected. During non-knocking conditions, even when the engine ran on fuel 5 to 10 RON above its octane requirement, up to 10 percent of the overall engine cycles knocked. Compression ratio differences between cylinders did not correlate well with the dif- ferences in knock characteristics between them. 910568. Effect of fuel atomization at a fuel supply system on lean burn characteristics in a spark-ignition engine. Seiichi Shiga, Dept. of Mech. Engrg., Gunma Univ.; Kazumitsu Kobayashi, Japan Electronic Control Systems Co., Ltd.; Takuma Kon-No, Gunma Univ.; and Takao Karasawa and Toshio Kurabayashi, Dept. of Mech. Engrg., Gunma Univ. This paper presents the fuel atomization effect of a fuel supply system on the lean burn characteristics of a spark-ignition engine and its mechanism. The fuel supply system can realize extremely different two state of atomization, i.e., wall-film of fuel flow and ultra-fine spray (less than 7 um S.M.D. by Malvern measure- ment). For the first step of the study, the atomization effect is examined under steady operation; several operating parameters including cyclic variability are epxressed against the A/F over the wide range of operating condition. Within the operation limits, the fuel atomization does not affect any parameters, while it gives pretty much influence on the lean operation limit. Furthermore, this influencing behavior strongly depends on the throttle valve position and its opening. Combining these facts with the observa- tion of the visualized induction system, the importance of the throttle valve in determining the atomization effect could be shown, and the possible affecting mechanism could be derived. 910570. The 1990 methanol challenge: Summary of a success- ful student design competition. Robert P. Larsen and Norman W. Hill, Argonne National Lab. A follow-up to the 1989 Society of Automotive Engineers (SAE) Methanol Marathon called the Methanol Challenge was held in April 1990. One of a series of engineering student compe- titions using alternative fuels organized and conducted by the Center for Transportation Research at Argonne National Labora- tory, the Methanol Challenge pushed the technology for dedi- cated M85 (85% methanol, 15% hydrocarbon fuel) methanol pas- senger cars to new levels. The event included complete federal exhaust emissions, cold-start and driveability, performance, and fuel economy testing. Twelve teams of student engineers from the United States and Canada competed in the Challenge using Chevrolet Corsicas donated by General Motors (GM) to the schools. The winning car from the University of Tennessee, simultaneously demonstrated extremely low emissions, dramati- cally increased performance, and significantly improved fuel economy. The success of the Methanol Challenge showed that student competitions produce a valuable educational experience, develop and demonstrate advanced technology, and provide an excellent way for industry and governmental sponsors to work together to benefit engineering education and other common goals. 910571. Texas Tech University. Mike Walser, Richard Taeu- ber, Gary Bourn, Mark Kasik, Jesse C. Jones, and Timothy T. Maxwell, Texas Tech Univ. Mechanical engineering students at Texas Tech participated in the 1989 SAE Methanol Marthon in which a 1988 Chevrolet Corsica was converted to run on M85, a blend of 85% methanol and 15% hydrocarbon fuel. This report describes modifications to the Corsica accomplished in preparation for the continuation 77</page><page sequence="77">910571-910582 of this program, the 1990 SAE Methanol Challenge. The modi- fied Corsica placed second overall. The objective of the Texas Tech team was to modify the Cor- sica to burn M85 fuel efficiently without exotic or expensive hardware changes. Modifications to the Texas Tech car (exclud- ing the fuel system components supplied by GM) could all be incorporated into production vehicles easily in a short period of time with little or no increase in manufacturing cost. The vehicle modifications made by the Tech team are described in the follow- ing sections of this paper. 910573. Florida Institute of Technology 1990 Methanol Chal- lenge Experience. Douglas E. Hahn , Florida Institute of Technol- ogy. The next decade will show a change in all motor fuels used in public transportation. As of this writing, methanol is viwed as one of the most promising of the new "clean air fuels." Florida Institute of Technology, in competition with 13 other Universities, designed and completed modification on a 1988 Chevrolet Corsica supplied by General Motors. These modifica- tions included high compression ceramic coated pistons in con- junction with turbocharging. Further research included camshaft testing, ignition and fuel curve changes, and a unique 6/3 cylinder cut-out scheme during low engine load conditions. The Corsica was then entered in the 1990 Methanol Challenge. 910574. The effect of brake system evacuation and fill on ini- tial brake pedal travel. Neil J. Clark, Bendix Automotive Systems -N.A. The effectiveness of a brake system evacuation and fill will be shown to be quantifiable in terms of initial brake pedal travel by way of a few simple hand calculations. This paper does not dis- cuss the mechanics of evacuation and fill, rather, it is a study into the impact of the evacuation and fill process upon initial brake pedal travel. First, initial pedal travel due to the evacuation and fill process will be quantified by a series of calculations. Secondly, empirical data will be presented which will demonstrate the close correlation of calculated results to those obtained in actual brake system tests. 910575. On the design of anti-squeal friction pads for disc brakes. Hany A. Sherif Dept. of Mech . and Elasticity, Military Technical College. Modeling of friction pad in disc brakes as a distributed param- eter system (mass-inherent damping-elasticity) is made in order to show the conditions of stable vibrations. The interface charac- teristics of the pad/disc assembly beside the negatively sloped friction-velocity relationship are taken into account. The inter- face characteristics are represented by the effective contact stiff- ness as well as the friction damping of both pad and disc surfaces. It is shown that continuous modification of the equivalent con- tact stiffness by wear mechanism or by any other mechanism, is the mean cause of squeal triggering. The analysis has shown that stability can be attained at all possible squeal frequencies of the friction pad by the good selection of its geometrical configuration (thick, wide and short brake pad) and its material loss factor within certain limits. Moreover, it is necessary to choose the appropriate way of pad fixation inside the caliper to give higher modes of vibrations. According to the considered model of longi- tudinal vibrations, it is found that stability of motion is indepen- dent of the value of coefficient of friction whereas it depends upon its negative slope. 1991 SAE Transactions Section 6 910576.

Systematic techniques of hose failure mode analysis. S. N. Miller, E.I. du Pont de Nemours &amp; Co., Inc. Systematic techniques to analyze industrial and automotive hose failures are presented. End use requirements for textile rein- forcement cords versus hose specifications and end use operating environments are assessed. Hose design criteria are examined from a reverse engineering manner. The facts mapping technique is offered as a vehicle to manage the data generated in the failure analysis. A defintion of a hose failure is offered. Proper selections of the hose inner-liner and cover materials and the reinforcement cord are emphasized. 1991 SAE Transactions Section 6 910579. (SP-867) RIM parts for automobiles - Life cycle energy and ecobalance. William J. Farrissey, Dow Chemical Co. In automotive construction, polyurethanes, are key materials in weight reduction and improvement of aerodynamic character- istics, both of which are crucial to the improvement in fuel econ- omy of automobiles, and hence conservation of energy resources and reduction of harmful emissions. Recycling of polyurethane materials results in further reduc- tion of the energy requirements for materials such as RIM fascia. Inclusion of 10% recycled process scrap into the formulation results in a corresponding 10% reduction in the energy require- ments for the part. Further energy savings can be realized by recovering the thermal energy - 28-32 MJ/kg (12,000-14,000 BTU/lb) - embodied in the RIM parts 12,000 at the end of their useful life. This reduces the total energy bill for polurethane parts an additional 25-30%, further solidifying the position of RIM polyurethanes as a material of choice in energy conserving, light weight, aerodynamic automotive parts. 910580. (SP-867) Recycling RIM thermoset polymers. Roy E. Morgan and John D. Weaver, Dow Chemical Co. A simple and economical process has been developed that allows the recovery of scrap RIM thermoset polymer generated in the manufacturing of fascia, body panels and other parts. This prcess consists of a size reduction process of the thermoset poly- mer into a very fine powder and iťs subsequent incorporation into virgin raw materials. Original polymer performance and sur- face quality are maintained. This "regrind" process provides pos- itive environmental and economical effects to molders of RIM polymers. 1991 SAE Transactions Section S 910581. (SP-867) Recycling of RIM scrap by compression molding. Ronald P. Taylor and Robert Eiben, Mobay Corp.; and Werner Rasshofer and Ulrich Liman , Bayer AG. This new process for recycling of RIM process scrap consists of granulating scrap parts, pre-heating, then compression mold- ing. Painted or unpainted parts, either reinforced or non- reinforced, can be recycled by this process. The degree of recovery of mechanical properties, relative to the original RIM part, depends on the key processing parameters, which include com- pression time, temperature, pressure and granulate size. 910582. (SP-867) Recycling of RIM polyurea elastomers by thermal processing. Sachchida N. Singh, Elvio Piccolino, Johan B. Bergenholtz, and Richard C. Smith, ICI Polyurethanes. Management of manufacturing scrap and post-consumer scrap from automobiles will increasingly influence both the acceptance of plastics and choice of plastics in the automotive industry. Polyurea elastomers made by reaction injection mold- ing (RIM) offer many processing, property and cost advantages desired by the automotive industry but their crosslinked nature has generally implied that the scrap cannot be recycled by a widely used recycling method, thermal processing. Recently introduced ICI Polyurethanes imine-polyurea materials for auto- motive exterior applications can be thermally processed using extruders into sheets, profiles, tubes, moldings etc. The extruded 78</page><page sequence="78">910582-910591 materials have good mechanical integrity and many end-use applications are possible. 910583. (SP-867) Energy recovery options for RIM polyre- thanes. James I. Myers , Mobay Corp.; and William J. Farrissey, Dow Chemical Co. This paper evaluated different energy recovery methods for reaction injection molding (RIM) polyurethane scrap material. Thermal processes examined included fluidized bed, rotary kiln, and mass burning. Off gases were tested for conventional air con- taminants. 910584. Nylon 6-clay hybrid-synthesis, properties and appli- cation to automotive timing belt cover. Toshio Kurauchi and Akane Okada, Toyota Central R&amp;D Lab., Inc.; Takao Nomura and Takeyoshi Nishio, Toyota Motor Corp.; and Shikio Saegusa and Ryuichi Degushi, übe Industries Ltd. e-Caprolactam was polymerized in the inter-layer space of montmorillonite, the clay mineral yielding a nylon-clay hybrid (NCH). X-ray and TEM measurements revealed that each tem- plate of the silicate, which was 1 nm thick, was dispersed in the nylon 6 matrix, and that the interlayer distance of clay increased continuously from 1.2 nm for the unintercalated material to 21.4 nm for the intercalated material. Thus, NCH is a polymer-based molecular composite or a nano-composite. NCH contains 1-15 vol% of monolayer clay. Injection-molded NCH showed excellent mechanical properties compared with nylon 6 in terms of tensile strength, tensile modulus and heat resistance. The tensile modulus of NCH was twice that of Nylon 6, and the heat distortion temperature increased from 65°C for nylon 6 to 145°C for the NCH containing only 1.6 vol% of a clay mineral. It was found that such excellent properties of an NCH system was due to the strong ionic interaction between nylon 6 and the silicate layer. Since NCH has a high modulus and a heat distortion tempera- ture, it has already been applied to automotive timing belt covers as an engine part. 1991 SAE Transactions Section S 910585. Nylon 46 - A new thermoplastic for demanding appli- cations. Stephen M. Hartig, DSM Engrg. Plastics, North America Inc. Nylon 46 is a new material with a wide variety of engine appli- cations. Compared to traditional materials such as 66 nylon, it offers improved temperature resistance, toughness, fatigue resis- tance, bearing properties, and creep. Application areas include timing chain tensioners, bearing cages, transmission compo- nents, sensors, and valve covers. 910586. Performance characterization of phenolic matrix com- posite gears. Dale H. Breen, ASME Gear Research Institute ; and John Lovell, Spaulding Composites. Fabric reinforced phenolic gears have been utilized in timing gears to provide quiet operation for many years. Even so, there is a dearth of performance information of the type required by engineers to use rational design approaches when assessing new designs or the capacity capability of current products. This study is ongoing. Its first objective was to select an appropriate test vehicle and approach. The power circulating method of testing gears was selected, a rig designed and studies made regarding crit- ical failure modes. Critical failure modes are, of course, the basis of design. They must be understood and prevented, conse- quently, the load and stress limits for their occurrence was deter- mined by actual gear tests. The first results pertain to the limits associated with two modes, flank wear and tooth bending fatigue. Conventional stress cycle curves are presented for both failure modes. Some 29 gear sets were tested over a considerable range of torques. A new method heretofore untried was used to make wear measurements. It involved replicating the teeth periodically throughout the test. Over 40 replicas were made. The data reported on herein is for Duralite®, a standard production mate- rial. Other materials are being evaluated. 910587. Fusible core technology: From research to industrial- ization. L. De Keyzer, Solvay and Cie S.A., Central Lab. Today, all automotive manufacturers are interested in the fus- ible core technology. This technique makes it possible to advan- tageously manufacture inlet manifolds in plastic instead of alumi- num. In plastic, weight is reduced by a factor of two and the perfor- mance of the engine are increased. Due to integration of functions during manufacturing the number of parts is reduced, thus result- ing in cost reduction. A study of this process is presented. The results and under- standing of this technology are currently incorporated in fully automated production lines. 910588. Composite (SMC) engine components. Kim R. Ham- ner, Plastics Div., Budd Co. Engine design for the 1990's has to meet substantially tougher goals than in the past. With E.P.A. and C.A.F.E. edicts from Washington, a more sophisticated customer, and world competi- tion, the big three automotive companies and truck manufactur- ers are looking at new designs and new materials to meet this challenge. Specifically, some of these goals are higher horsepower and torque per liter, reduced noise, lower weight, improved dura- bility, better aesthetics, and lower cost to meet world competi- tion. 910590. Accelerated corrosion test methods for evaluating external corrosion resistance of vacuum brazed aluminum heat exchangers. A. C. Scott and R. A. Woods, Kaiser Aluminum and Chemical Corp.; and J. F. Harris, Ravenswood Aluminum Corp. A program to develop an aluminum tube stock alloy for vacu- um-brazed heat exchangers with improved external corrosion resistance necessitated the use of accelerated laboratory corrosion tests to rank trial materials and ultimately qualify an alloy for production and sale. Brazed radiator sections and sheet samples were exposed to a variety of ASTM standard corrosion test envi- ronments. Metallographic examination of samples thus exposed demonstrated that the S WAAT test (ASTM G85:A3) closely rep- licated the air-side corrosion morphology found in aluminum radiators from the field. Samples exposed in test environments other than SWAAT did not generally exhibit the mixed inter- granular/pitting morphology found in field retrievals. In neutral salt spray (ASTM B117), for instance, smooth-sided hemispheri- cal pitting was the corrosion mode observed. Test techniques were developed for ranking SWAAT corro- sion performance of brazed sheet samples and heat exchangers based on time to perforation - the criterion of particular interest in this application - rather than subjective visual appearance ratings or unreliable pit depth measurements. These techniques were applied in the development of a new perforation-resistant tube alloy, "K319". 1991 SAE Transactions Section 5 910591. A corrosion resistant alloy for vacuum brazed alumi- num heat exchangers. R. A. Woods and A. C. Scott, Kaiser Alumi- num and Chemical Corp.; and J. F. Harris, Ravenswood Alumi- num Corp. Vacuum brazed aluminum automobile radiators have exhib- ited a susceptibility to intergranular corrosion on the external tube surfaces, induced by road salt splash high in chlorides. A novel brazing sheet material with greatly improved perforation resistance has been developed to address this problem. Relative external corrosion resistance of conventional and experimental alloy systems was determined by accelerated corrosion testing of brazed composites and radiator sections in SWAAT. The new 79</page><page sequence="79">910591-910600 material, designated K319, exhibits an order of magnitude improvement in time to perforation in this test. A subsurface layer, anodic to the core alloy, is developed during the brazing process and accounts for the material's greatly enhanced resis- tance to perforation. 1991 SAE Transactions Section S 910592. Development of pitting corrosion resistant condenser with zinc-arc-spray extruded multi-cavity tubing. Kazunori Ishikawa, Hiroshi Kaw ase, and Hitoshi Koyama, Furukawa Alu- minum Co., Ltd.; Yoshiharu Hasegawa, Nippondenso America, Inc.; and Kenji Negura, and Masayuki Nonogaki, Nippondenso Co., Ltd. We have developed a highly corrosion-resistant serpentine type condenser which is characterized by its manufacturing pro- cess that zinc is coated on the surface of a multi-cavity extruded tubing at the rate of 5-20 g/m2 by arc spray, and then, thus pre- pared tubing and corrugated fin stocks are brazed by the conven- tional Nocolok brazing process (herein after this is referred to as ZAS NB process). By this brazing process as well as conventional flux brazing (FB) process, a highly pitting corrosion-resistant zinc diffusion layer is formed on the surface of the tubing at the time when brazing is operating.

Corrosion resistance of the as brazed PF® heat exchanger as achieved by alloy selection. Ronald D. Tait, C. James Rogers, Andrew J. Cottone, Jerome P. Henkes, and Z. Philip Saperstein, Modine Manufacturing Co. The PF® (parallel flow) condenser possesses numerous advantages for the automotive designer. Light weight, compact dimensions, low refrigerant charge and high performance are well documented features. In addition, the PF condenser offers a cor- rosion resistant materials package. This helps to assure a long life in a vehicular application where a corrosive environment is pres- ent. The corrosion resistance of the PF® condenser is documented and explained in this paper. Laboratory accelerated corrosion tests (CASS) and field testing in the harsh climate of Montreal gave evidence of the effectiveness of cathodic protection by zinc. Observed (SEM -EDS) zinc diffusion profiles at the critical areas of the condenser characterize the diffusion layers. It is clear that these zinc concentration profiles are responsible for the excellent corrosion resistance. 1991 SAE Transactions Section 5 910595. (SP-855) A zonal method for predicting external auto- mobile aerodynamics. Lars Larsson and Leif Broberg, FlowTech International AB and Chalmers University of Technology ; and Carl-Erik Janson, FlowTech International AB. A system of computer codes for investigating the flow around three-dimensional bodies is introduced. The system is based on the zonal approach, where different methods are used in three dif- ferent regions of the flow field. By tailoring the method to the flow properties in each region, computations of the flow around the body may be carried out in a fraction of the time required for a single-zone Navier-Stokes solution. In the paper, results are pres- ented for an automobile-like body frequently used as a test case in automotive aerodynamics. It is shown that the important fea- tures of the wake flow are well predicted, although the change from the high drag to the low drag case near the critical slant angle is more gradual than indicated by the experiments. 1991 SAE Transactions Section 6 910597. (SP-855) Numerical simulation of road vehicle aerody- namics and effect of aerodynamic devices. Takuya Kataoka, Hiroshi China, Kunio Nakagawa, Kazuo Yanagimoto, and Masahiro Yoshida, Mitsubishi Motors Corp. Computational analysis of a flow field around a complex geometry such as a vehicle configuration becomes more reliable with the use of the most current numerical method. And the flow field around a vehicle with tires and wheel houses is simulated with accuracy. Recent market trends necessitate the use of aerodynamic devices to improve aerodynamic characteristics of a road vehicle. However, due to their complex shape, few computational studies of these devices have been performed. In this paper, a computational analysis system for vehicle aerodynamics is established and its reliability is discussed. As the effective application of the system, the contribution of movable aerodynamic devices is studied using the system. And the com- parison of wind tunnel test results with computational results is desirable. 1991 SAE Transactions Section 6 910598. (SP-855) A grid generating system for automobile aerodynamic analysis. S. Nakamura, M Spradling, and D. P. Fradl, Mech. Engrg. Dept., Ohio State Univ.; and K. Kuwahara , Institute of Space and Astronautical Science. This paper describes a new grid generating system particularly designed for automobile external flow analyses. The system con- sists of three major parts as follows: Part I collects the geometrical data of the automobile surface and develops an intermediate grid. Part II generates the surface grid on the surface of the automobile. The surface grid is used as the boundary condition for generating the three-dimensional grid for the flow space. Part III generates the three-dimensional grid for external flow analyses. In generat- ing the surface grid, a new approach of generating grid has been developed, in which two elliptic grid generation equations are solved directly on the physical domain. The three-dimensional grid is generated by the elliptic grid generation method blended with the hyperbolic method. An iterative solution algorithm based on the approximate factorization scheme has been devel- oped. 910599. (SP-851) Energy absorbed by vehicle structures in side-impacts. Aloke K. Prasad, Transportation Research Center of Ohio, Inc. CRASH (Calspan Reconstruction of Accident Speeds on the Highway) is one of the primary tools used by the National High- way Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA), U.S. Dept. of Transportation, for estimating the severity of impacts. It is a computer program which is used to estimate the velocity change (AV) of the centers of gravity of vehicles in an accident. This paper studies the validity of the linear AV versus crush relation- ship used in CRASH3 for modern passenger cars. It describes the experimental work done to investigate the crush-energy versus static crush for a number of models in side impacts. Finally, the crush-energy versus residual crush behavior for a large number of vehicle models tested for NHTSA has been characterized and tabulated. 1991 SAE Transactions Section 6 910600. (SP-851) One-dimensional model for predicting side intrusion injuries including effects of padding. F. Shokoohi and D. S. Breed, Automotive Technologies International, Inc. A new concept for interior padding for passenger automobiles is introduced. This type of padding is composed of closed cells filled with air, each cell contains an orifice or other type of restric- tor which allows the air to escape and provide energy dissipation. 80</page><page sequence="80">910600-910608 The results of this study shown that, in side impacts, this type of padding substantially reduces the side impact injury risk mea- sures proposed by the biomechanics community. This padding is inexpensive, light weight and returns to its original shape after minor impacts. According to the results of the present study this padding is approximately twice as effective as other types of pad- dings studied. 910601. (SP-851) Side impact modeling using quasi-static crush data. Priya Prasad and Tah Chuan Low , Advanced Vehicle Engrg. and Technology , Ford Motor Co.; and Clifford C. Chou, George G. Lim, and Srini Sundararajan, Ford Motor Co. This paper describes the development of a three-dimensional lumped-mass structure and dummy model to study barrier-to-car side impacts. The test procedures utilized to develop model input data are also described. The model results are compared to crash test results from a series of six barrier-to-car crash tests. Sensitiv- ity analysis using the validated model show the necessity to account for dynamic structural rate effects when using quasi- statically measured vehicle crush data. 1991 SAE Transactions Section 6 910602. (SP-851) An improved side impact model for use on microcomputers. Lonney S. Pauls, Springwater Micro Data Sys- tems. This paper discusses the side impact computer model, SIFEM (side impact finite element mode). The SIFEM model is being developed for use as an analytical design and evaluation tool for vehicle-to-vehicle side impacts. The SIFEM model uses two (2) two-dimensional, linked, rigid body models to represent the three dimensional movement of the occupant and a two-dimensional spring-mass model to represent the impacting vehicles. The model makes use of the elasto-plastic, finite element method to calculate the force-displacement characteristics of various spring elements in the model. This paper discusses the technical features of the model and the theoretical basis from which the model was derived. 910603. (SP-851) NHTSA passenger car side impact dynamic test procedure - Test-to-test variability estimates. R. W. Huit- man, T. G. Laske, G. G. Lim, E. I. Chrobak, M. T. Vecchio, and C. C. Chou, Ford Motor Co. A highly controlled six-vehicle crash test program was con- ducted to provide an estimate of the test-to-test variability of the NHTSA-proposed passenger car dynamic side impact test proce- dure. The results of this program showed that the rear seat test dummy response measurements are especially sensitive to vari- ous parameters of the test procedure. This paper provides esti- mates of front and rear seated SID dummy response measure- ment variability in four-door, 1990 Ford Taurus vehicles. Con- clusions and recommendations from this controlled crash test program are made to provide guidance to help reduce the test-to- test variability of the test dummy responses. 1991 SAE Transactions Section 6 910604.

Fredholm, and A. Prestad, Svenska Emissionsteknik AB. The medium and heavy duty diesel engine industry, alongside the engine component suppliers and petroleum industries, are working hard to develop production compatible solutions for the US 1994 model year. In this paper results are presented demon- strating how the 1994 regulations may be achieved by extensive development of the base engine. In parallel with these develop- ments research has continued into aftertreatment systems, either as a solution in themselves or as part of a cost effective systems approach. This paper presents results demonstrating the perfor- mance characteristics of oxidation catalysts in heavy duty appli- cations and reviews the optimisation process required to match the system to the application. 1991 SAE Transactions Section 3 910605. (P-240) Sulfur storage and discharge behavior on flow-through type oxidation catalysts. Makoto Horiuchi, Koichi Saito, and Shoichi Ichihara, Nippon Shokubai Kagaku Kogyo Co., Ltd. Sulfur storage/discharge behavior on a flow-through type oxi- dation catalyst (FTC) was investigated by engine dynamometer tests and laboratory tests, and the following results were obtained. In FTC wherein active AI2O3 was used as a substrate for sup- porting catalytic components, sulfur was stored in the form of aluminum sulfate in high temperature region while sulfate were adsorbed or adhered to the catalyst surface layer to be stored thereon in low temperature region. Although aluminum sulfate formed in high temperture region was relatively stable, sulfate stored in low temperature region were desorbed easily when the temperature rose. Therefore, it was attempted to optimize the substrate depos- ited catalytic components. And, FTC which would inhibit adsorption of sulfate was achieved successfully. 910606. (P-240) The measurement and sampling of controlled regeneration emissions from a diesel wall-flow particulate trap. Thomas D. Lay mac, Michigan Technological Univ.; John H. Johnson, Dept. of Mech. Engrg. and Engrg. Mechanics, Michigan Technological Univ.; and Susan T. Bagley, Dept. of Biological Sci- ences, Michigan Technology Univ. A diesel exhaust sampling system was specially designed to measure and collect emissions from a ceramic wall-flow particu- late trap during periods of controlled electric regeneration with the exhaust emissions bypassing the trap. This resulted in the regeneration emissions being independent of those produced dur- ing either baseline (no control) or trap (exhaust filtration) sam- pling conditions. This system provided data regarding the physi- cal, chemical, and biological character of regeneration emissions relative to baseline and trap emissions. Selected emission levels measured continuously during the regeneration process were also used to define the particle combustion process in the trap core. Variations in hydrocarbons (HC), oxides of nitrogen (NOx), and particulate volume concentrations during the regeneration pro- cess were used to define four stages of the combustion process: preheat; combustion wave formation; combustion wave propaga- tion; and combustion wave extinction. Particle concentrations were shown to be related to the location of the combustion wave front in the trap. Total particulate matter (TMP) mass emission rates from the trap were found to be two to three orders of magni- tude lower than those measured at baseline or trap conditions, while peak particulate concentrations were similar to baseline and trap emission rates. 1991 SAE Transactions Section 3 910608. (P-240) Effects of fuel properties on diesel engine emissions - A review of information available to the EEC-MVEG group. L. C. van Beckhoven, Ministry of Housing, Physical Plan- ning and Environment. A review and further analysis of available experimental and literature data on the effect of fuel properties on diesel engine emissions has been made. The only fairly consistent significant effects were found for particulate and hydrocarbon emissions. For these emissions it is concluded that modern DI diesel engines optimised for perfor- mance and emissions are mildly susceptible to fuel volatility or viscosity. No special effect of heavy ends nor significant effects of aromatics content could be established. Sulphur content in the range of 0.30 to 0.05 %w affected particulate emissions by 15 to 30% at low particulate levels. 81</page><page sequence="81">910608-910613 Modem IDI diesel engines, small and large, were clearly sus- ceptible to cetane number, aromatics or density of the fuel. Of these cetane number was the dominant factor. 910609. (P-240) The effect of a ceramic particulate trap on the particulate and vapor phase emissions of a heavy-duty diesel engine. L. D. G raíz, Dept. of Mech. Engrg. and Engrg. Mechanics, Michigan Technological Univ.; Susan T. Bagley, Dept. of Biologi- cal Sciences, Michigan Technology Univ.; K. S. King, Caterpillar, Inc.; K. J. Baumgard, Dept. of Mech. Engrg. and Engrg. Mechan- ics, Michigan Technological Univ.;D. G. Leddy, Dept. of Chemis- try, Michigan Technological Univ.; and John H. Johnson, Dept. of Mech. Engrg. and Engrg. Mechanics, Michigan Technological Univ. Exhaust emissions were characterized from a Cummins LTA10 heavy-duty diesel engine operated at two EPA steady- state modes with and without an uncatalyzed Corning ceramic particulate trap. The regulated emissions of nitrogen oxides (NOx), hydrocarbons (HC), and total particulate matter (TPM) and its components as well as the unregulated emissions of PAH, nitro-PAH, mutagenic activity and particulate size distributions were measured. The consistently signficant effects of the trap on regulated emissions included reductions of TPM and TPM- associated components. There were no changes in NOx and HC were reduced only at one operating condition. Particle size dis- tribtuion measurements showed that nuclei-mode particles were formed downstream of the trap, which effectively removed accu- mulation-mode particles. All of the mutagenicity was direct- acting and the mutagenic activity of the XOC was appromixately equivalent to that of the SOF without the trap. When the trap was used, the particle-associated mutagenicity decreased mainly due to the reduction in the concentration of particles. The trap XOC showed no mutagenic activity. There was some shifting of PAH into the vapor phase when particle emissions were reduced with the use of the trap. Under the test conditions chosen for this engine, the ceramic particulate trap reduced the concentration of emitted particles without increasing the levels of particle- associated mutagenicity, PAH or nitro-PAH. 1991 SAE Transactions Section 3 910610. Light-off performance of catalytic converters: The effect of heat/mass transfercharacteristics. Michael J. Ryan, Dept. of Chemical Engrg., Rice Univ.; E. Robert Becker, Envi- ronex; and Kyriacos Zygourakis, Dept. of Chemical Engrg., Rice Univ. The heat and mass transfer characteristics of a monolith reac- tor influence both its light-off performance and the steady-state temperature and concentration profiles. The transient behavior of an adiabatic monolith reactor is bounded by two limiting chan- nel geometries: 1) cylindrical passages and 2) slits confined between parallel plates. These geometries represent extremes in heat/mass transfer characteristics for monolith channels and, therefore, allow the analysis of light-off behavior for the practical range of geometries and process conditions in automobile exhausts. Also, these two geometries allow an analytical solution for the velocity, concentration and temperature profiles in the gas phase. This study analyzes the light-off performance of monolith reactors with comparable voidage and surface area using automo- tive exhaust oxidation kinetics. The energy balance for the solid walls includes all three modes of heat transport: convection, con- duction and radiation. The Nusselt and Sherwood numbers are calculated as a function of position along the monolith channel. For substrates of equal gas/solid contact area and equal ther- mal mass, the parallel plate monolith reactor lights off faster and achieves higher conversions than the cylindrical passage reactor at low flow rates. As the flow rate increases, however, the cylindri- cal passage monolith reactor lights off faster. The reaction zone in the parallel plate channels is closer to the reactor outlet than in the cylindrical channels. Our calculations show that the prop- erties which give good light-off behavior also lead to more effi- cient cooling at the steady state and lead to reaction zone blow- out early in the life of the catalyst. Poorer heat transfer in cylindri- cal channels delays reaction light-off, but retains heat better. Radiation is not important in the temperature range encountered in automobiles. At high temperatures, however, it has a signifi- cant effect on the temperature profile. 910611. Warm-up characteristics of thin wall honeycomb cata- lysts. Hiroaki Yamamoto and Fumihiko Kato, Nissan Motor Co., Ltd.; and Jun Kitagawa and Minoru Machida, NGK Insulators, Ltd. CH emission standards will be tightened during the 1990's in the US. A key issue in reducing HC emission is improving the warm-up characteristics of catalysts during the cold start of engines. For this purpose, studies are under way on reduction of heat mass of ceramic substrates. Reduction of cell walls in sub- strates to thickness smaller than the current thickness of 12mil or 6mil has resulted in reduced heat mass, and also reduced flow restriction of substrates. The warm-up characteristics of low bulk density catalysts are better than those of high bulk density, i.e., the warm-up charac- teristics of thinner wall or lower cell density catalysts are better than those of thicker wall or higher cell density catalysts. A rela- tionship between geometric surface area and warm-up character- istics is observed. 910612. Electrically-heated catalyst system conversions on two current-technology vehicles. Martin J. Heimrich, Southwest Research Institute; and Steve Albu and Juan O sborn, California Air Resources Board. Two different configurations of electrically-heated catalyst systems were installed on two new production vehicles. A 1990 Buick LeSabre was evaluated with a heated catalyst placed directly in front of the main production catalytic converter while a 1990 Toyota Célica was evaluated with an electrically-heated catalyst placed between the main close-coupled catalytic con- verter and a smaller downstream production catalytic converter. Initial laboratory studies involved examination of heating strate- gies to minimize electrical energy requirements, a variety of off- board battery and recharging configurations for their effect on emissions, and multiple air injection strageies to achieve mini- mum hydrocarbon emissions while avoiding a NOx penalty. Final efforts involved installation of optimized, complete on- vehicle electrically-heated catalyst systems for subsequent on- road mileage accumulation. The vehicle conversions, albeit unaged, exhibited FTP emissions which show promise of meeting the California Ultra-Low Emission Vehicle standards, and have contributed to adoption of low emission standards by the Califor- nia Air Resources Board. 1991 SAE Transactions Section 4 910613. Electrically heated metal substrate durability. William A. Whitten berger, Carnet Co.; and Joseph E. Kubsh, Research Div., W. R. Grace and Co. Emission performance of an electrically heated catalytic con- verter is presented for both low-mileage tests and after exhaust aging using a 300 h dynamometer schedule. The aged converter system maintained its ability to significantly reduce cold start hydrocarbon and CO emissions on a late model gasoline-fueled passenger car. In these tests HC and CO emissions were reduced by 76% and 92%, respectively during the first 140 seconds of the FTP urban driving cycle by operating the aged converter with resistance heating and air injection, in comparison to operation of the same aged converter in an unheated configuration. These reductions for heated operation versus unheated operation were comparable to the 80% HC and 96% CO cold start emission reductions observed in low-mileage testing of the same converter. 82</page><page sequence="82">910613-910620 The air injection strategy used in the resistively heated operation increased cold start NO* emissions in the first 140 s of the FTP by 60% versus unheated operation of the low-mileage converter. After engine aging, the converter exhibited similar NOx perfor- mance in the cold start phase for both heated and unheated oper- ation. No changes in heat-up performance were observed for the heated catalyst after the aging protocol or after hot vibration test- ing using a 760°C inlet engine exhaust temperature. 1991 SAE Transactions Section 4 910614. How to achieve optimum physical properties in the metal catalyst. Rei jo Lylykangas and Pekka Lappi, Kemira Oy, Exhaust Catalyst Plant. Traditionally exhaust catalysts have been dimensioned and adjusted to suit vehicles on the basis of the characteristics and parameters of the ceramic catalyst. The metal catalyst differs, however, so much from the ceramic one that the dimensioning principles of the ceramic catalyst are not altogether appropriate for it. The metal substrate gives the catalyst designer a great deal of latitude in dimensioning, so that the optimum function- durability-price relationship can be achieved. In the metal cata- lyst the cell density can easily be changed. The geometric surface area, pressure drop and conversion efficiency will all change at the same time. This paper examines the effect of cell densities and catalyst volumes on the functioning of the catalyst. The catalyst performance depends strongly on the temperature. The effect of thermal insulation on a metal catalyst is also examined. 910615. Development of a highly heat-resistant metal sup- ported catalyst. Takashi Tanaka, Nippon Steel Corp.; and Toshi- hiro Takada, Toyota Motor Corp. A metal support has a potential to improve an engine output and the conversion efficieny. In order to satisfy both require- ments, the back pressure drop should be reduced and the high- temperature use of the catalyst converter has to be a must. To develop such a metal support, a manifold converter without a retainer is the best choice. Removing a retainer resulted in joining the metal honeycomb-core to the jacket. Brazing was selected. Installing as a manifold converter led a metal support to the severe environment in which the high mechanical durability was required. The back pressure drop, the adhesion of the washcoat and the conversion performance have been investigated for the high- temperature use. To develop the brazed structure to meet the high mechanical durability, analyzing the temperature distribu- tion and the fracture modes in a metal support has been con- ducted through the endurance engine-bench test. As a result, a highly heat-resistant metal supported catalyst has been success- fully developed. It has been adapted to new Toyota Camry since July in 1990. 910616. Reduction of vibration and noise in the powertrain of passenger cars with elastomer dampers. Peter Schwibinger, David Hendrick, Wei Wu, and Yasuhiro Imanishi, Freudenberg-NOK. The paper describes a theoretical and experimental approach to solve vibration and noise problems in the powertrain with vibration control products on an elastomer basis. Crankshaft dampers can reduce the torsional, and - if prop- erly tuned and designed - also the bending vibrations. The paper compares the crankshaft vibrations for different damper designs which shows the potential for further vibration and noise reduc- tions. Shafts in the drivetrain are excited to torsional and bending vibrations by the inertia and gas forces of the engine, cardan joints and gear mesh. For the following two problems vibrations and noise are investigated: 1) a torsional resonance of a driveshaft; and 2) a bending resonance of a halfshaft. Measurements show that noise and vibrations from the dri- vetrain can also be reduced significantly with tuned elastomer dampers. 1991 SAE Transactions Section 6 910617. Reduction in exhaust noise through valving modifica- tions achieved with a gas dynamics simulation model. Satoshi Takeyama, Hideyuki Takeda, and Yasuo Takagi, Nissan Motor Co., Ltd. One of advanced requirements in current high output power engine design, as is seen in a four valve engine, is to reduce the exhaust noise without a reduction in engine performance. In order to examine the relationship between output and exhaust noise level, a gas dynamics simulation model was extended so as to predict the exhaust generated noise. The gas dynamics model used in this study is developed based on a finite difference method in which unsteady compressible flow is solved by two-step Lax-Wendroff method. Using this simulation model, timing changes were found to be effective in reducing the exhaust noise level without showing any trade-off on engine performance. These results were validated by the experiment. 1 991 SAE Transactions Section 6 910618. Influence of airway structures on engine cooling fan noise. Hiroshi China, Kenji Ohno, and Makoto Kurachi, Mitsu- bishi Motors Corp. The influences of air way structures in engine cooling system on fan discrete noise were investigated. Each structures such as stays, horns and air leak preventive duct, affect the uniformity of inflow air distribution and the non uniformity of inflow air causes to fluctuate the lift of fan blades. This lift fluctuation results in the increasing of the discrete noise level from the fan. It is found that the exponent functional relations between dis- crete noise level and the velocity defect in the wake of structures. The possibility of predicting method of noise level from the engine cooling system was mentioned by using this functional relation. 910619. A method of synthesizing exhaust noises. Yoshiyuki Umemura and Yoshihiko Kozawa, Toyota Central Research and Development Labs., Inc. This paper presents a new method of synthesizing exhaust noises for modulating their timbre based on the order compo- nents of engine revolution. This method makes it possible to syn- thesize exhaust noises in real-time using a computer system with an ordinary digital signal processor, because this method uses inverse Fourier transform in its main processing part to make waveforms from order components of engine revolution. For example, the speed of calculation by this method is about 100 times higher than that by an ordinary direct method in the case of a variable acceleration curve. Since this method guarantees the continuity of the waveform between processing segments, a good sound quality can be provided for various modulations of noise timbre. 910620. Research in regard to sensory characteristics measur- ing for the impulse noise of the engine valve system. Tetuhiko Nomura, Nobuhiko Adachi, and Kunihiko Suzuki, Toyota Motor Corp. This research proposes an automatic measuring method for the impulse noise of the valve system in engine production line. This research is composed of the following two parts. Part one: the most suitable method for indicating the impulse noise of the valve system - the representative characteristic values- is selected from the general measuring methods for impulse noise. As the result, the crest factor in the frequency band above 1kHz became optimal. Part 2: by detailed sensory characteristic analy- sis it was found that impulse noise can be heard better with 83</page><page sequence="83">910620-910627 increasing frequency and that there is little influence in the fre- quency band with the same frequency as the background noise. Thus the crest factor was obtained for each frequency, and the sensory test for the impulse noise of the valve system is deduced by this linear coupling. As the result of multiple reguression anal- ysis, a high accuracy prediction equetion with a multiple correla- tion coefficient of 0.91 has been obtained. 1991 SAE Transactions Section 6 910621. The 1990 GM sunrayce USA - A summary. Philip D. Patterson and William L. Siegel, U.S. Dept. of Energy. This student design and competition event involved 32 uni- versity teams from North America which built and raced solar cars along a 1644 mile route from Florida to Michigan. General Motors was the major sponsor of the event and Chevrolet, the Department of Energy, and the Society of Automotive Engineers were co-sponsors. After three days of solar car inspections and testing, the school teams began eleven days of racing. The average race day covered about 165 miles and included a mandatory pit stop at the halfway point. The solar cars were allowed two hours of solar charge before and after each race day. The universities of Michigan, Western Washington, and Maryland were the top three finishers. The race had 32 winners, as evidenced by the fact that the schools produced operating solar cars which delighted and inspired the thousands of youngsters who saw them. 1991 SAE Transactions Section 6 910622. Sunrunner- The engineering report. Justin Beres, University of Michigan. Solar energy has been successfully applied to automobile pro- pulsion. Designers of solar-powered vehicles must address issues such as aerodynamic efficiency, vehicle weight, and energy collec- tion capacity.

Development of sequential twin turbo system for rotary engine. Seiji Tashima, Tomoo Tadokoro, Haruo O kim oto , and Yasushi Niwa, Mazda Motor Corp. In today's automobile markets, there has been a strong and growing demand for higher output and better fuel economy engines. In order to improve rotary engines to satisfy this market demand, Mazda has devoted much effort to turbocharging sys- tem development and achieved the sequential twin turbo system, which overcame the problems typical of conventional turbochar- ging systems; insufficient torque at low engine speeds and turbo lag. This system, which has two turbocharging units that operate in accordance with engine speeds (one unit at low engine speeds and both units at high engine speeds), features: 1) compact and reliable turbo operation control system and 2) reduced temporary torque drop occurring when the second turbo starts. With this new turbo system, Mazda's rotary engines have achieved an output performance equivalent to large displace- ment engines and smooth driving performance, while maintain- ing their light weight, compact size and better fuel economy. 1991 SAE Transactions Section 3 910625. 3-D computations of premixed-charge natural gas combustion in rotary engines. J. Abraham, Rotary Engine Div., John Deere Technologies International ; and F. V. Bracco, Mech. and Aerospace Engrg. Dept., Princeton Univ. A three-dimensional model for premixed-charge naturally- aspirated rotary engine combustion is used to identify combus- tion chamber geometries that could lead to increased indicated efficiency for a lean (equivalence ratio =0.75) natural gas/air mix- ture. Computations were made at two rpms (1800 and 3600) and two loads (approximately 345 Kpa and 620 Kpa indicated mean effective pressure). Six configurations were studied. The configu- ration that gave the highest indicated efficiency has a leading pocket with a leading deep recess, two spark plugs located circum- ferentially on the symmetry plane (one after the minor axis and the other before), a compression ratio of 9.5, and an anti-quench feature on the trailing flank. 1991 SAE Transactions Section 3 910626. Analysis of frictional power losses associated with the side and apex seals of a wankel rotary engine. T. Rachel and H. J. Schock, Mech. Engrg. Dept., Michigan State Univ.; and T. Bart- rand, Lewis Research Center Group, Sverdrup Technology, Inc. A mathematical model has been implemented in a computer code to predict seal dynamics in a rotary engine. Using cell pres- sure and engine speed as inputs, along with geometric housing equations, one is able to model apex seal lift off, shifting and fric- tional power associated with the apex and side seals. Results show that at moderate to high engine speeds the apex seal's fore and aft movement is dominated by a transverse acceleration because the velocity of the seal must change as it follows the tro- choidal housing. The seal lift off from the housing is dominated by a radial acceleration which also depends on the engine speed. The resultant frictional power loss associated with the apex seals is an exponential function of the engine speed, whereas the fric- tional power loss associated with the side seals is a linear function of engine speed. For a medium power output condition (412.5 kPa at 5000 rpm), the magnitude of the apex seal frictional power surpasses the side seal frictional power at slightly above 5000 rpm. 1991 SAE Transactions Section 3 910627. The development of a stratified charge rotary engine apex seal material. G. S. Revankar, Deere and Co. The rotary engine has evolved into an alternate power source, along with the reciprocating engine and is finding many applica- tions including automotive, industrial, and military. Recent advances in rotary engine technology include development of stratified charge engines with multifuel capability. These engines operate at higher peak pressures than the homogeneous charge type and require higher component mechanical strength proper- ties and improved wear resistance for the sliding surfaces. The apex seal makes line contact with the rotor housing surface and, more than any other seal in the engine, is subjected to high con- tact loads and sliding surface temperatures which make it suscep- tible to high rate of wear. Combustion chamber pressure tight- ness, and thus engine performance, depend to a great extent on the apex seal wear. This requires that the phenomena associated with seal wear be studied carefully before a proper seal material can be selected. The paper presents the design and use of a rig to study the seal wear under approximate engine simulation condi- tions and describes the development and evaluation of a new seal material made as a result of the rig tests. 1991 SAE Transactions Section S 84</page><page sequence="84">910628-910638 910628. Isuzu new H-series diesel engines. Katsumi Takenaka, Yoshiyuki Nitta, and Kimi Kubota, Isuzu Motors Ltd. The medium duty commercial vehicle "Isuzu Forward" pow- ered by the newly designed 6HE1 six cylinder engine was placed on Japanese market in April 1990. At the same time the engine family of the four cylinder version 4HF1 engine mounted in the light duty commercial vehicle "Isuzu Elf" was introduced in Jap- anese market in August 1990. These H-series engines are succes- sors to the B-series engines, which have been used worldwide for vehicles, industrial machinery and boats. The basic structure of OHC and ladder frame of these engines made it possible to improve the design of the inlet and exhaust ports and valves, and improve the stiffness of the cylinder block and the cylinder head. In turn this provides higher performance, durability and reliability. This paper describes the special features and construction of these new H-series engines, together with newly adopted technol- ogy- 910629. Development of a new Lombardini prechamber diesel engine family. R. Bosisio , F. Cagnolati, and G. Duri , Lombardini FIM SpA ; and F. E. Cordone, and B. M. Vaglieco, Istituto Motori, CNR. Technical information on the development of a new Lom- bardini prechamber diesel engine family, called FOCS, is given. Market requirements in terms of high performance, low fuel consumption, light engine weight and low noise and pollutant emissions have been met. The engine family consists of 2, 3, and 4 cylinder models with 72 mm cylinder bore and with two stroke-length (62, 75 mm) ver- sion covering 505 cc, 611 cc, 916 cc and 1222 cc displacement. Comparison of performance and emissions between FOCS 602 and competitive engines nowadays available on the interna- tional market is reported. 910630. The development of high-performance viscous-rubber damper for higher boost turbocharged and charge-cooled diesel engine. Akio Kitagawa and Koji Shoyama, Hino Motors, Ltd.; and Tomoyuki Kurata and Shoji Gomi, Bridgestone Corp. A newly developed viscous-rubber damper, which employed an innovative structure and a new heat resistant rubber, solved some tough problems. This paper dealt more closely with the fea- tures of the new viscous-rubber damper and the new calculation method for the viscous-rubber damper. This damper has been employed for Hino new K13C (K-II) higher boost turbocharged and air to air charge-cooled diesel engine, which has extreme severity on the torsional vibration. 910631. A numerical simulation method for vibration stress waveforms of high-speed diesel engine crankshaft system. Kunio Shimoy amada and Shoichi Iwamoto, Dept. of Mech. Engrg ., Saitama Univ.; and Tomoaki Kodama, Yasuhiro Honda, and Katsuhiko Wakabayashi, Dept. of Mech. Engrg., Kokushikan Univ. A numerical simulation method by transfer matrix method is proposed to compute the vibration stress waveforms of a V-type, 8 cylinder diesel engine crankshaft in this work. This method will be able to predict the conditions of vibration stresses and be use- ful to design a crankshaft. The accuracy of this numerical method is confirmed by com- paring the simulation results of the computation with the mea- sured data. As a result of the comparisons with the measured data, it has been assured that the vibration stress waveforms can be computed with adequate accuracy by considering from 0.5-th to either 10-th or 12-th order per 0.5-th order harmonic compo- nents of exciting forces for a 4-cycle engine. 1991 SAE Transactions Section 3 910632. Development of fiber reinforced aluminum alloy for diesel piston applications. Alexandre Afonso, Metal Leve S.A. Ind. Com.; Gustavo Ferran, Metal Leve S.A. Inc. Com.; and Frank Chi, Carborundum Co. A preliminary study was done to select the more adequate composite material to be used as a reinforcement at the combus- tion bowl of higher output diesel engine pistons. From the three types of composites produced, namely, ceramic reinforced mate- rial (CRM), metal reinforced material (MRM) and fiber rein- forced material (FRM), FRM was selected after preliminary tests of mechanical properties, machinability and diesel engine tests, realized in a small monocylinder diesel engine. After this selection, FRM was characterized and compared to the aluminum base alloy (M-124R), and from this analysis the following relevant comments should be made. The reaction degree between the fiber and the matrix of M-124R is highly related to the processing and the heat treatment conditions, and these conditions will strongly influence the microstructure and the final properties of the produced compos- ite. The measured thermal expansion coefficients (CTE) of FRM in the axial and radial directions are the same and their aboslute values are 20% below the M-124R aluminum alloy. However, the measured Young's modulus is higher for axial FRM at room tem- perature. The measured UTS for axial and radial FRM are the same, and at 300C these values are 80% higher than M-124R. There is an anisotropy of the yield strength of FRM samples that changes with the temperature; at 300C the yield strength of axial and radial FRM are higher than M-124R alloy. The fatigue life at con- sistant load at 300C is one order of magnitude higher for the FRM compared to M-124R. A 2000hs engine test showed a real improvement in piston durability when the FRM was used as a reinforcement at the com- bustion bowl rim. 1991 SAE Transactions Section S 910633. Hot corrosion studies of automotive exhaust valves. Pnina Ari-Gur, Western Michigan Univ.; and Victoria Noble, Simon Narasimhan, and Jay M. Larson, Engine Component Div., Eaton Corp. This study compares the hot corrosion resistance of several internal combustion engine exhaust valve alloys in a simulated diesel engine environment. Hot corrosion of exhaust valves occurs when deposits accumulate on the head and are subjected to temperatures between 650 to 1000°C. Test specimens were subjected to a mixture of CaSÛ4, BaSC&gt;4, Na2S04, and carbon at 870°C. The materials tested included head material specimens and valves with cobalt based or nickel based seat facings. The depth of corrosion penetration was measured and the valve base materials and seat face coatings were ranked accordingly. The results indicate that nickel based valve alloys have poorer sulfida- tion resistance than iron based alloys, and nickel based seat fac- ings accelerate the corrosive attack on the base material in the faced region as compared to the unfaced portion of the valve. Valves with cobalt base Tribaloy seat facings exhibited the best resistance, followed by the iron base, Stellite and nickel base respecitvely. 910638. (SP-854) A pressure switch manifold for electronically controlled transmissions. David A. Czarn, Texas Instruments, Inc. The electronically controlled transmission has evolved to improve vehcile driveability, shift quality and fuel efficiency. The transmission's computer relies on sensing and modulating fluid pressure for diagnostic and control functions. A pressure switch manifold (PSM) has been developed to sense the pressures in selected hydraulic circuits, providing the computer with PRNDL position and clutch fill information. The device consists 85</page><page sequence="85">910638-910644 of multiple compact snap acting pressure switches electrically interconnected on a single assembly. The manifold mounts directly to the valvebody, with the switches coupled to the appro- priate fluid channels. In applications where the PSM is sub- merged in oil, a thermistor is designed in to provide for tempera- ture sensing. This paper describes the design, performance and application of the pressure switch manifold. 910639. (SP-854) Analysis of a new automatic transmission control system for Lexus LS400. Hiroji Taniguchi and Yasushi Ando , Toyota Motor Corp. A new automatic transmission, engineered from concept for "intelligent" and "anti-aging" (long life), has been designed and developed for Toyota's luxury passenger car, Lexus LS400. This system, which has resulted in silky-smooth shift quality without changes in the long term, is composed of a transmission com- puter that interacts with engine computer, a number of sensors, an electronically controlled hydraulic unit with linear solenoid valves and assorted devices. As new control logic being developed with the aid of computer simulation to achieve distinction, the hydraulic and engine con- trols are combined in this system. There is a "feedback control", where the clutch pressure is controlled according to the rate of acceleration and compensated for dispersion to applied pressure, engine torque and/or the coefficient of dynamic friction of clutches, and at the same time engine torque is reduced by retard- ing ignition timing. 910640. (SP-854) A practical approach to automatic transmis- sion reliability. Gary Robinson, BTR Engineering Ltd., Australia. A tailored reliability program was employed throughout the design and development of an electronically controlled four- speed automatic transmission. This paper describes the reliability trade-off study used to select the control system design philoso- phy and details the development of specific component reliability targets from the overall system requirements. A unique adaptation of the transmission electronic control system has enabled an extensive data collection program to be completed. From this information a detailed life cycle profile was defined based on various end user operating conditions and spe- cific customer durability tests. The results of this program are presented together with a comparison against the original compo- nent life targets set at the start of the transmission design. 1991 SAE Transactions Section 6 910641. (SP-854) Mathematical model and computer simula- tion of idle gear rattle. Andrew Szadkowski, Spicer Clutch Div., Dana Corp. This paper represents a mathematically rigorous and techni- cally realistic effort of describing the idle rattle phenomen. The two-degree-of-freedom model constitutes a relatively simple, analytical tool suitable for design and application purposes. It also introduces a new and more practical formulation of the rattle threshold. The model describes elastic-plastic collisions of mesh- ing gears and splines, and allows for multi-harmonic excitation. The mathematical model not only consists of differential equations of gear and spline oscillations, but also equations of collisions and separations of meshing elements. When the impacts occur, a special algorithm is used for determining energy of collisions. The model is based on the fact that impact energy levels directly correspond to idle rattle noise levels. The computer simulation presented in this paper is to meet the pressing need for an analytical and computer design method- ology for drivelines and their components. Powertrain systems are not only to accommodate rotating motion, but also to control and isolate torsional vibrations. Using a specially developed algorithm, the computer program solves nonlinear differential equations and estimates collisions of meshing gears and splines during rattle. The program is capable of calculating energy of impacts over a large time interval during steady-state motion of the system, identifying the rattle threshold in terms of design parameters, and determining the behavior of the system during rattle. The simulation program has been used to conduct basic studies of the rattle phenomenon. Some important results of this anlaysis are discussed in this paper. 910642. Optimization of nucleate boiling engine cooling systems - Condenser study. P. Palier and N. S. Ap, Valeo Ther- mique Moteur ; and Th. Bouyer, E.S.E.M. Université d'Orléans. Engine cooling by nucleate boiling requires a profound knowl- edge of cooling systems components: heat exchangers, water pumps, eventually liuqid-vapor separators, on the part of equip- ment manufacturers. Experimental and theoretical studies of the principal heat exchanger, i.e., the vapor-condensor, were effected. The experimental phase required the development, after careful study, of a test set-ups specifically designed for vapor-condensors. Tests are conducted under controlled intake pressures and tem- peratures, and sub-cooled outlet conditions. Under varying air- flows, outlet-liquid measurements yield instructive information relative to exchanger thermic performance. The influence on per- formance of tube shape, direction of liquid circulation (horizon- tal or vertical) and number of passes was also studied. Concur- rently, thermic visualization by infra-red camera permits qualita- tive evaluation of vapor distribution within the condenser. Ther- mic models based on exchange condensation theory permits comparisons between theoretical models and experimental results. We enunciate expected gains in performance and space- requirements due to the use of boiling liuqid cooling systems. 910643. The dimensionless correlation of airflow for vehicle engine cooling systems. Xintai Chang and Edward C. Chiang, Michigan Technological Univ.; John H. Johnson, Dept. of Mech. Engrg. and Engrg. Mechanics, Michigan Technological Univ.; and S. L. Yang, Michigan Technological Univ. An analysis of vehicle engine cooling airflow by means of a one-dimensional, transient, compressible flow model was carried out and revealed that similarity theory could be applied to inves- tigate the variation of the airflow with ambient and operating conditions. It was recognized that for a given vehicle engine cool- ing system, the cooling airflow behavior could be explained using several dimensionless parameters that involve the vehicle speed, fan speed, heat transfer rate through the radiator, ambient tem- perature and pressure, and the system characteristic dimension. Using the flow resistance and fan characteristics measured from a prototype cooling system and the computer simulation for the one-dimensional compressible flow model, a quantitative correlation of non-dimensional mass flow rate to three dimen- sionless parameters for a prototype heavy-duty truck was estab- lished. The results are presented in charts, tables, and formulas. This methodology may aid both the design and development of vehicle engine cooling systems by providing a systematic method of predicting and investigating the cooling airflow using a limited number of hardware tests. 1991 SAE Transactions Section S 910644. The theoretical development of vehicle engine cooling airflow models using incompressible flow methods. Xintai Chang and Edward C. Chiang, Michigan Technological Univ.; and John H. Johnson, Dept. of Mech. Engrg. and Engrg. Mechanics, Michi- gan Technological Univ. A one-dimensional imcompressible flow model covering the mechanisms involved in the airflow through an automotive radi- ator-shroud-fan system with no heat transfer was developed. An analytical expression to approximate the experimentally deter- mined fan performance characteristics was used in conjunction with an analytical approach for this simplified cooling airflow model, and the solution is discussed with illustrations. 86</page><page sequence="86">910644-910653 A major result of this model is a closed form equation relating the transient velocity of the air to the vehicle speed, pressure rise characteristics and speed of the fan, as well as the dimensions and resistance of the radiator. This provides a basis for calculating cooling airflow rate under various conditions. The results of the incompressible flow analysis were further compared with the computational results obtained with a previ- ously developed one-dimensional, transient, compressible flow model. The effects of the ambient air temperature, pressure, and heat transfer in the radiator on the cooling airflow rate were ana- lyzed, and the use of an empirical formula to estimate the varia- tion of the flow rate corresponding to heating of the air is pres- ented and discussed. 910645. Improved electric fan speed control for A/C condenser and engine cooling systems. Peter A. Kershaw and G. Clark Oberheide , Siemens Automotive, North American Motor Opera- tion. A two-speed DC motor utlizing a dual armature winding has been developed as an improved solution to fan speed control with respect to cost, reliability, power conversion efficiency, electro- magnetic compatibility, speed flexibility, and packaging con- cerns. This development provdies a simple means to select fan speeds optimally satisfying the air conditioning and engine cool- ing systems demand for heat rejection with lower noise and power consumption. This two-speed motor can also be employed in a two-fan sys- tem to output a variable voltage to speed control a second con- ventional fan motor. In this manner, the second motor acquires these advantages of the dual-wind motor. In addition, system advantages are gained by commonizing the RFI suppression for each motor and, in simplifying the vehicular wire harness con- nection to the two-fan system. 1991 SAE Transactions Section 5 910646. Computer-aided analysis of airflow in the design of automotive air-conditioning systems. George Anderson, Climate Control Div., Ford Motor Co.; Akin Ecer, Techalysis Inc.; Arvind Padgaonkar, Climate Control Div., Ford Motor Co.; and Hoo- shang Didandeh, Technalysis Inc. This paper describes computer software developed specifically for the analysis of airflow in the design of automotive A/C sys- tems and its applications for improving performance of such sys- tems. Traditionally, design of an A/C system involves building and testing of prototypes. The objective of this project was to develop predictive capabilities where an engineer can assembly a system in the computer to obtain desired air-flow performance. The computer program is integrated and customized for design- ing A/C systems. It has two parts: the first part, performance anal- ysis, requires the air circuit modeling of an A/C system where each component is modeled in terms of appropriate design parameters. A system analysis is performed to predict the interac- tion of the components and the total system performance. The second part of the computer program performs component analy- sis. The geometry of each of the part are first modeled on a CAD system and then imported to form a simpler engineers model. This model is used by the engineer as a tool for building a finite element grid and then to perform the finite element flow analysis. Obtained numerical results predict the details of the flow field and the critical regions for generating pressure losses. An engineer can modify the geometry of the part and rerun the program toward finding a gemoetry that can provide improved flow per- formance. 910649. Laboratory simulations of multipath and the effect on FM stereo signals. Richard D. Zerod, Ford Motor Co. Increasing application of high-performance audio media and sound systems requires new levels of performance be achieved in automotive FM reception. Multipath distortion has been identi- fied as a leading industry concern which often limits the quality of FM reception. Laboratory tests will be used to empirically quantify the effects resulting from a direct wave combining with a single reflected wave at the receiver. The reflected wave will be adjusted in ampli- tude, phase, and delay time to simulate conditions of mild, mod- erate, and severe multipath. The effects on the stereo signal will be characterized by the following parameters: 1) total harmonic distortion (% THD); 2) signal-to-noise ratio (dB); and 3) stereo separation (dB). Additionally, the effects of the modulating frequency and car- rier deviation will be explored. Data will quantify potential improvements in THD and signal-to-noise ratio by reducing the stereo separation in the receiver. Finally, field data will be shown to illustrate multipath conditions in the "real world." 910650. Amplitude modulation method for measuring linear excursion of loudspeakers. David Clark, DLC Design. A simple method for measuring the peak linear excursion capability (Xmax) of loudspeaker driver units is presented. The method measures the acoustic amplitude modulation of a small high-frequency signal by a very low-frequency signal. The low- frequency signal is increased to produce a target peak-to-peak modulation. A physical measurement of the peak-to-peak dia- phragm excursion is made and defined to be twice Xmax. 1991 SAE Transactions Section 6 910651. The dominant compliance of loudspeaker drivers. Robert J. True, International Jensen, Inc. Of all the loudspeaker driver parameters needed to predict important performance aspects such as the resonant frequency and the Q, none remain as elusive to the design engineer as the mechanical compliance of the driver. The other parameters are either easily measured (e.g. moving mass or voice coil resistance) or easily calculated (e.g. effective diaphragm area or free air loads), but this is not the case with the compliance. The reason for this stems from the fact that the total driver compliance is actually two separate compliances in parallel (from the spider and surround) and each of these employ complex geometries and are made from an array of materials which can be treated in a num- ber of different ways. In this paper a method for separating the total driver compliance into its individual components is docu- mented. The method is then used to evaluate the relationship of the spider compliance to the surround compliance as the sur- round material changes. Paper, cloth, and foam are the three most commonly used materials and each will be examined as they are interchanged on a particular driver. Also, it is known that both the surround and spider become more compliant as the driver becomes broken in and this change will be documented for the different materials. The driver under consideration will be the 5-V2 X 7-V2 inch. 910653. A plan to prevent ESD damage on electronic compo- nents at an auto radio process assembly. Celso Luiz Ridolfi and Miguel Afonso Aerosi, Ford Motor Co. Everybody has already had the ungrateful experience of walk- ing on a carpet tile and receiving an electric shock just by touch- ing a door knob. What many people don't know is that, simply the fact of walking a few meters over the carpet can generate some kilovolts of electrical charge and cause a damage of some thou- sand dollars on electronic devices such as computers, radios, elec- tronic controls, etc, due to the fact that they have components sensitive to a few hundred volts or less. The most common way of generating electrical static charge is frictioning two different materials against each other. Electrons are transfered from one surface to the other making one more positive then the other this imbalance can easily reach the order of some hundred volts. 87</page><page sequence="87">910653-910660 Today, the automotive industry uses a large quantity of a wide range of electronic components in its products (cars, trucks, etc.) not only for entertainment, but also on the drive control area, (engine, powertrain control etc.). Where no failure can be admit- ted because driveability and safety can not be jeopardized. So, it is very easy to understand why an electronic assembly plant that uses millions of sensitive devices every year needs a well defined plan to prevent the effects of electrostatic discharge. 910654. (SP-852) Integrated occupant-car crash simulation with the finite element method: the PORSCHE hybrid Ill- dummy and airbag model. Erich Schelkle and Rolf Remensperger, Porsche AG. The work involved in laying out restraint systems for motor- cars can be supported by numerical crash-simulations in the con- cept-phase. A prerequisite is that the interactions between dummy and vehicle structure are determined under realistic con- ditions. It is then possible to reduce time, costs and finally the development risk, because the subsequent safety tests with car prototypes can be realized with already optimized components. Until now the simulation of vehicle structure and occupant behaviour was realized very often sequentially in succession, that means without consideration of interactions between vehicle structure and occupant. First acceleration histories of the passen- ger compartment were determined by simulation of the vehicle structure with the finite element method (FEM). These results were used as input for crash victim simulations (CVS). This paper presents a new way for occupant safety, the inte- grated finite element crash calculation of a passenger compart- ment complete with steering column, airbag, knee restraint and hybrid III dummy. Experiences with such integrated FEM- simulations will be discussed. 910655. (SP-852) A new automobile crash sensor tester. D. S. Breed, V. Castelli, and W. T. Sanders, Automotive Technologies International, Inc. This paper examines how crash sensors are tested and describes a new general purpose impact machine which can be used. The paper describes the pulse shapes in common use (hav- ersine and half sine), pulse accuracy, longitudinal and cross-axis vibrations and pulse durations and how this machine performs these tests. Other tests including pulse angularity, temperature, vibration and other environmental tests. Finally, this paper dis- cusses available sensor test equipment from the standpoint of pulse accuracy, data acquisition accuracy, pulse amplitude and duration capability, coast or dwell capability, the ability to simu- late an actual crash pulse, ability to impose cross axis vibrations and the ability to test against a mathematical mode. 910656. (SP-852) Crash recorder for safety system studies and as a consumer's product. Ove Salomonsson, Mannesman Kienzle GmbH; and Magnus Koch, Volvo Car Corp. This paper first describes a joint development project between Mannesmann Kienzle GmbH and Volvo Car Corporation regarding an advanced crash recorder (CR) to be installed in the vehicle test fleet by Volvo. The objective of the project is manily to gain experience con- cerning the correlation between crash severity, vehicle damage and bodily injuries of the occupants by getting access to extensive and accurate in-vehicle data from reallife accidents. The crash recorder monitors and records a number of vari- ables during the phases of pre-impact, impact and postimpact. Parallel to this device a low-cost consumer's device has been developed by Mannesmann Kienzle and the full concept of this device will be presented. The objective of this low-cost accident data recorder (ADR) is to provide a qualified in-vehicle monitoring system providing vehicle trajectories data for direct use in computeraided accident reconstruction. The result of the specific accident reconstruction can be used for settling liabilities of driver and/or product or for aggregating data in the society's traffic research activities. A short outlining of the European community perspective on this issue in the light of ongoing activities within the research pro- gram "Drive" is given. 910658. (SP-852) An advanced 50th percentile hybrid-Ill dummy database - Validation. Martin Heinz, FAT Ak5 Working Group, Subcommittee Crash-Dummy; Bernd Pletschen, Porsche AG; and Harald Wester and Thomas Scharnhorst, Volkswagen AG. The integration and productive use of computer simulation in the car development process requires highly sophisticated pro- grams and high quality databases, especially in the very sensitive area of safety. Therefore, measurements with crashdummys have to be conducted and analyzed in detail. The project reported here, was supervised by the German Automobile Technology Research Association (Forschungs- vereinigung Automobiltechnik) and carried out by a team recruited from various German car manufacturers. Based on the outcomes of the measurements of mechanical and geometrical crash dummy properties, a database for the dynamic rigid body simulation program MADYMO-3D has been developed. The simulation results proposed for this new database are compared with the experimental results from sled tests con- ducted by Volkswagen. The dummy used as an occupant for the sled tests is the same as the dummy used for the measurements of its physical properties. The present study deals with the ques- tions and problems occurring during the validation process of the 50th percentile hybrid Ill-dummy database. Assumptions, approximations and changes made in order to optimize the data- set are documented. The quality of the actual dataset is confirmed by the corre- spondence of the test and simulation results and also compares favorably with the earlier states of the dataset evaluation. 910659. (SP-861) A regenerative active suspension system. Glenn R. Wendel and Gary L. Stecklein, Southwest Research Institute. Active automotive suspension systems have been under development for a number of years with recent introductions of various versions. A suspension system can be considered "ac- tive" when an outside power source is used to alter its characteris- tics, and these systems can be placed into one of three different categories: semi-active damping; fully active; and low frequency active. A regenerative pump concept can minimize the power requirement for the low frequency active system. It utilizes four independent variable displacement pump/motor combinations on a common shaft to actuate each individual suspension unit. This paper overviews the system configuration, describes the power and energy-saving features of the system, and discusses possible pump configurations and control strategies. 910660. (SP-861) Control strategies for active chassis systems with respect to road friction. Andreas Dreyer, Il 1 - T eves; and Heinz-Dieter Heitzer, Aachen Technical Univ. Active chassis control has become a very important subject in the recent years, because it offers new opportunities in the improvement of vehicle handling performance. This paper pres- ents a new and sophisticated approach to stability control by lon- gitudinal tire force control. It is based on the idea to take the driv- er's action as input for the control instead of waiting for the reac- tion of the vehicle. In order to estimate the safety margin it is nec- essary to determine the operating points of the tires in the tire performance graphs with the help of special sensors and a com- puter. The described system also allows to develop control strate- gies in order to involve more functions of an integrated active chassis system. 1991 SAE Transactions Section 6 88</page><page sequence="88">910661-910666 910661. (SP-861) High speed control of damping force using piezoelectric elements. M akoto Shiozaki, Shigeru Kamiya, and Kazuma Matsui, Nippondenso Co., Ltd.; Ryohei Kizu , Toyota Motor Corp.; and Masatoshi Kuroyanagi, Nippondenso Co., Ltd. Semi-active suspension is one of many effective devices to improve vehicle stability, controllability and riding comfort. A practical means to realize semi-active suspension is to vary the damping force of the shock absorber. In this paper, we propose a new type of shock absorber using a piezoelectric sensor and actuator. The piezoelectric sensor and actuator are built into the piston rod which is a part of the shock absorber. The piezoelectric element provides a fast response and a high actuation force. We used the piezoelectric element in shock absorbers in order to take advantage of these two features. High level compatibility between stability, controllability and riding comfort is expected, since damping force changes very quickly using this new type of shock absorber. In this paper, several topics are discussed. First, a general description of the damping force control system with simple con- figuration is explained. Second, features of the piezoelectric sen- sor and interface circuits used to detect road surface conditions are shown. Third, features of the piezoelectric actuator and dis- placement magnification chamber are discussed. Fourth, reduc- tion of noise generated at the moment of valve opening is dis- cussed. This noise is generated by a rapid pressure change when the damping force changes quickly. The methods to realize quick damping force change with low noise are discussed. Effective reduction of the noise is shown to be influenced by the shape of a valve through experiments. 1991 SAE Transactions Section 6 910662. (SP-861) Improvement of vehicle motion and riding- comfort by active controlled suspension system. Eiichi Yasuda, Shun-ichi Doi, Katsuhiko Hattori, Hideyuki Suzuki, and Yasutaka Hayashi, Toyota Central Research and Development Labs., Inc. The adaptation of the active control technology to practical suspension systems of vehicles has remarkably improved the safety and ride-comfort of vehicles. This paper presents a study on the practical realization methods of an active suspension sys- tem that combines high response and low energy dissipation. The effects of active control on the stability of vehicle motion and ride-comfort were investigated by practical tests using an experi- mental vehicle. The integrated active suspension system consists of a motor- controlled oil pump, which is active power source, and a motor- controlled variable orifice, which is semi-active adjustable ele- ment. Multi-controller computer systems for individual controls of each suspension unit and an integrated control of the whole body behavior are also installed. The control of this system is based on a feed-forward strategy to control handling maneuvers, and a feedback control strategy using the changes in state variables to control the response to road input disturbances. The design objective is to minimize the values of the performance index representing vehicle attitude and ride-comfort. Experimental results are obtained from the controlled experi- mental vehicle. The effectiveness of the system is verified by the measurements of the body behavior during handling maneuvers, and of the vibration characteristics during running on various roads. Compared with a non-controlled vehicle, the roll angle of the experimental vehicle caused by steering is decreased by over 50%, and the ride-comfort characteristics is fairly improved in the frequency range below one to several Hertz. 1991 SAE Transactions Section 6 910663. (SP-849) Two-stroke engine technology in the 1990's. Floyd A. Wyczalek, FWLilly Inc. This is an assessment of current two-stroke automotive engine technology, implementation policy, vision, goals, and engine development and commercialization strategy. It includes a his- torical review of key two-stroke Otto cycle and diesel cycle engine developments, a summary of the specifications for the new: Toyota S-2 gasoline and S-2 diesel engines, Suburu Super 2-stroke, Orbital two-stroke engine series, and Industrial Tech- nology Research Institute (ITRI) two-stroke technology in Tai- wan. Although two-stroke engine technology has been under devel- opment since the end of the 19th century, currently the only mass produced vehicles powered by two-stroke cycle engines are the Trabant and Wartburg, with 594 cc two cylinder and 993 cc three cylinder engines respectively, essentially unchanged in cylinder configuration and porting since 1931. VEB Sachsenring Automo- bilwerke Zwie kau -Trab ant and VEB Automobilwerke Eisenach- Wartburg are the manufacturing plants in East Germany, (GDR). Annual production peaked in 1987 at about 218,000 cars per year, but declined to 146,000 Trabant two-stroke vehicles by 1989, when, in the autumn of 1988, the Wartburg switched to the four-stroke 1.3L4 VW engine. Furthermore, Trabant will switch to the four-stroke 1.0L4 VW Polo and two-stroke engine produc- tion essentially ended September 1990, because the Trabant/ Wartburg two-stroke engines do not meet the vehicle perfor- mance and exhaust emission standards of West Germany (FRG). On the other hand, in Australia, Japan, Taiwan and the United States interest in the development of two-stroke automo- tive spark ignition engines has increased significantly. Because of this revival of activity in America and the Orient, coupled with the contrary switch from two-stroke to four-stroke cycle gasoline engine production in Europe, this assessment was undertaken to determine the prospects for two-stroke mass production in the Western and Oriental nations. 910664. (SP-849) Air-forced fuel injection system for two- stroke D.I. gasoline engine. Michael M. Schechter and Michael B. Levin, Ford Motor Co. Late fuel injection directly into the cylinder of a 2-stroke engine is desirable to prevent escape of some fuel into exhaust system during cylinder scavenging. This leaves little time for fuel evaporation and mixture preparation and puts a premium on the degree of fuel atomization needed during the injection process. Although a respectable degree of atomization can be attained in fuel systems with high pressure, liquid-only injection, further improvements can be made when compressed air is used to assist atomization. A novel air-forced (AFI) fuel injection system for in-cylinder injection in a 2-stroke engine is described. The system employs compressed air to force a metered quantity of fuel from the fuel injector internal cavity past a spring loaded poppet valve. A fog- like cloud containing a rich mixture of fuel and air is injected into the cylinder. As a result, an exceptionally fine atomization is achieved. At the same time, the shape of the air-fuel mixture spray can be varied as may be required by engine operating condi- tions. The basic concept and operating principles of 2 generations of AFI systems are reviewed together with advantages and short- comings of both systems. The injector flow test results, injection stability and fuel atomization are discussed. Use of the Coanda effect to create various spray shapes is demonstrated. 1991 SAE Transactions Section 3 910666. (SP-849) High speed fuel injection system for two- stroke D.I. gasoline engine. Michael M. Schechter, Eugene H. Jary, and Michael B. Levin, Ford Motor Co. Two-stroke gasoline engines are known to benefit from using in-cylinder fuel injection which improves their ability to meet the strict fuel economy and exhaust emissions requirements. A con- ventional method of in-cylinder fuel injection involves applica- 89</page><page sequence="89">910666-910671 tion of plunger-type positive displacement pumps. Two-stroke engines are usually smaller and lighter than their four-stroke counterparts of equal power and need a pump that should also be small and light and, preferably, simple in construction. Because a two-stroke engine fires every crankshaft revolution, its fuel injection pump must run at crankshaft speed (twice the speed of a four-stroke engine pump). An electronically controlled fuel injection system has been designed to satisfy the needs of a small automotive two-stroke engine capable of running at speeds of up to 6000 rpm. The fuel flow to individual engine cylinders is controlled by solenoid valves capable of one cycle response and individual cylinder adjustment of injection quantity and timing. The design and operating principles of the pump and injectors are described, and the tests results of cylinder-to-cylinder distribution, cycle-to-cycle variability and fuel atomization as well as testing methods are discussed. 1991 SAE Transactions Section 3 910667. (SP-849) Development of diesel fuel S.I. engine using an ultrasonic atomizer. Kazushi Tsurutani, Tonen Corp . CR á DL; Hiroyuki Takezi, Ultrasonic Engrg. Co., Ltd.; and Daijiro Hosogai, Tonen Corp. Our aim to develop an engine to drive an emergency portable fire pump resulted in the development of a small-light-weight two-stroke diesel spark ignition engine which utilized an ultra- sonic atomizer. As the base engine we used a 499cc twin cylinder two-stroke S.I. outboard motor engine. The fuel supply for this engine was controlled by a carburetor. In this original form it was not possible to run the base engine using only diesel fuel and although a mixture of diesel fuel and gasoline would run the engine it produced a large quantity of white smoke emissions. To solve these problems it became necessary to atomize the diesel fuel, improve the fuel-air mixture and facilitate easier com- bustion. First we installed an ultrasonic atomizer to the intake of the base engine. Due to the fine spray and low penetration pro- duced by the ultrasonic atomizer we obtained good mixture and distribution. The spray angle was constant as determined by the horn tip configuration, regardless of the fuel flow rate. In addi- tion, wall wetting of the inlet channel was greatly reduced. Although previously impossible, with the use of an ultrasonic atomizer it has become feasible to run a two-stroke S.I. engine with diesel fuel. Engine performance and fuel efficiency was equivalent to that of the original engine using kerosene fuel. Fur- ther, there was no exhaust smoke and stable combustion was achieved. As this diesel fuel engine is extremely light we investi- gated the possibility of using this to drive an emergency portable fire pump. 910668. (SP-849) A one-dimensional model for monolithic con- verter: numerical simulation and experimental verification of con- version and thermal responses for two-stroke engine. Dario Cun- dari and Marco Nuti, Piaggio V.E. S.p.A. A transiet one-dimensional model developed to simulate the thermal and conversion characteristics of adiabatic monolithic converters operating under warm-up conditions is presented. The model takes into account the gas-solid heat and mass transfer, axial heat conduction, chemical reactions and the related heat release. The model has been used to analyze the transient response of an axisymmetric catalytic converter during a warm-up as a func- tion of catalyst design parameters and operating conditions in order to observe their effects on the lightoff behaviour. The experimental test was carried out in two steps: the first on a sample for lightoff test and the second on two-stroke 150 cc engine with Pt/Rh metal-supported catalyst and full open- throttle condition. The simulated temperatures are close to test results. The predicted conversion efficiencies are qualitatively acceptable. 1991 SAE Transactions Section 4 910669. (SP-849) Scavenging flow measurements in a motored two-stroke engine by fiber LDV. Yuji Ikeda, Mitsuyasu Hiko- saka, and Tsuyoshi Nakajima, Dept. of Mech. Engrg., Kobe Univ. The flow velocity in a scavenging port of a small two-stroke engine was measured directly by a specially developed fiber LDV. The measurement was carried out under motored conditions at engine speeds of 1500 to 5000 rpm, and with throttle-opening ratios of 100, 50, and 20%. The performance of the FLDV was improved for measuring the scavenging velocity in the backscat- ter mode. The flow in the scavenging port changed significantly from -11 m/s to 47 m/s with the engine cycle, and the pressure difference between the crankcase and the exhaust pipe provided the typical features of the flow but not the absolute values. The results show that the scavenging flow entered the cylinder just before scavenging port opening (SO) and reached a maximum at the crank angle of 145°, which was constant for all conditions. A second velocity peak was formed by the back pressure from the exhaust pipe. The charging rate of the fresh air into the cylinder was obtained to evaluate the engine performance. 1991 SAE Transactions Section 3 910670. (SP-849) Scavenging flow measurements in a fired two-stroke engine by fiber LDV. Yuji Ikeda, Mitsuyasu Hiko - saka, and Tsuyoshi Nakajima, Dept. of Mech. Engrg., Kobe Univ.; and Tetsuya Ohhira, Motor Cycle Dept., Suzuki Motor Corp. The flow characteristics of a small two-stroke engine were investigated. Direct velocity measurements were carried out by a fiber laser doppler velocimeter (FLDV) developed under the fired conditions at engine speeds of 3000, 4000, and 5000 rpm. The first velocity peak in the firing engine was much higher than that in the motoring engine, and a negative velocity region and a large second velocity peak were observed, which were caused by the back pressure from the exhaust pipe. With increasing engine speed, the spatial velocity distribution varied in the sca- venging port due to the reverse flow from the cylinder into the crankcase. The charging flow rate of the fresh air was obtained and compared with that of the motoring case. 1991 SAE Transactions Section 3 910671. (SP-849) Measurements of flows during scavenging in a two-stroke engine. H. Sean Hilbert and R. E. Falco, Dept. of Mech. Engrg., Michigan State Univ. This paper introduces a new measurement technique into the field of engine diagnostics. LIPA (laser induced photochemical anemometry) is used to measure velocities and velocity gradients over a chosen plane in a motored two-stroke engine during sca- venging. The LIPA technique consists of tracking a phosphoresc- ing grid which is created by laser lines directed into the flow. A 308nm pulsed excimer laser beam is divided into 15 lines which are sent through the appropriate optics to create the grid. The grid energizes the seed chemical that is premixed in the carrier gas. The seed chemical used consists of a mixture of phosphorescent gases with nitrogen as the carrier. The results are not bias by out of plane motions, or the inertia or the charge of particles. In each plane forty-four simultaneous points of data are taken with an approximate grid mesh size of 3mm x 3mm. These measure- ments are taken over thirty consecutive cycles. Each measure- ment is taken by photographing two separate grids. The first grid is non-deformed, and the second (deformed) grid is photo- graphed 0.14 milliseconds later. Each intersection of the grid lines is considered a data point, and because the deformations are on the order of a grid mesh size there is no ambiguity in tracking data points from one photo to the next. By measuring the distance and direction each intersection travels and by knowing the time delay between each photograph, the two velocity components in the grid plane, the turbulence intensities, the Reynolds stress, and the vorticity are calculated. A loop scavenged, crankcase charged 125 cc Kawasaki single cylinder engine was modified to allow optical access. Images were taken of grid formed in planes parallel to the piston head near 90</page><page sequence="90">910671-910678 bottom dead center. Using a gated intensified CID camera, the data frames were recorded on V2 inch video tape. Averages over the area of interest and over the ensemble of two-dimensional maps were used to look at mixing, cyclic variability, and general flow phenomena. 1991 SAE Transactions Section 3 910672. (SP-849) Computations of two-stroke engine cylinder and port scavenging flows. P. H. Epstein , Rolf D. Reitz, and D. E. Foster, University of Wisconsin-Madison. A modification of the computational fluid dynamics code KIVA-II is presented that allows computations to be made in complex engine geometries. An example application is given in which three versions of KIVA-II are run simultaneously. Each version considers a separate block of the computational domain, and the blocks exchange boundary condition information with each other at their common interfaces. The use of separate blocks permits the connectedness of the overall computational domain to change with time. The scavenging flow in the cylinder, transfer pipes (ports), and exhaust pipe of a ported two-stroke engine with a moving piston was modeled in this way. Results are presented for three engine designs that differ only in the angle of their boost ports. The calculated flow fields and the resulting fuel distribu- tions are shown to be markedly different with the different geom- etries. The calculated results indicate that: velocity profiles vary with time and are not uniform across the ports; boost port flow at high boost angles breaks up the toroidal vortices in the cylinder that are generated by the side ports and puts more fuel into the cylinder head dome and; trapping efficiency increases with increased boost angle. These results suggest that the computa- tional methods developed in this work will be useful as a design tool for assessing the influence of engine design parameters on scavenging efficiencies in two-stroke engines. 1991 SAE Transactions Section 3 910674. (SP-849) A study of the transient characteristics of a small two-stroke spark ignition engine. Yuzuru Kubota and Sigenobu Hayashi, Muroran Institute of Technology; and Shuichi Kajitani and Norihiro Sawa, Ibaraki Univ. A two-stroke engine has various advantages. It is simple in structure, light in weight, high in mechanical efficiency, superior in accelerating ability, etc. However, its fuel consumption is bad, its combustibility under partial load is poor and it is usually accepted that its exhaust gas is problematic. With increasing traffic flow volume, it has become recently necessary to operate transiently each vehicle with frequent stops and starts, as well as decelerations and accelerations. From this standpoint, the authors have formed a simple dynamic model of two-stroke engine, and by means of simulation investigated how its performance can be improved while it is transient operated, in combination with experiment. The results confirm that the calculations from the model coin- cide approximately with experiment. The influences of various factors on the performance have been revealed. 910675. (SP-847) The potential of small loop-scavenged spark- ignition single cylinder two-stroke engines. Franz J. Laimböck, Two-Wheeler and Small Capacity Engine Div., Graz University of Technology. The applications of small loop-scavenged, single cylinder, two-stroke spark-ignition engines are widespread due to the spe- cific advantages of this engine concept. Today's engines have, or will soon have, to face stringent pollutant and noise emission reg- ulations and fuel consumption reductions. Advanced technical solutions will have to be applied even in the most compact and lighyweight high output power units, which are represented in this paper by a chainsaw and by the most demanding form, namely the two-wheeled, which still has the highest specific out- put of all homologated vehicles. This paper presents the prelimi- nary solutions, the state-of-the-art research and development and the author's view on the chainsaw and two-wheeled applications and an outlook focusing on the problems espeically where the detailed pollutant emissions and their reduction are concerned. Comparisons with the four-stroke cycle and other two-stroke cycle scavenge principles are made. Technical data and detailed dimensions of low emission engines are listed, as well as the exact ingredients of gasoline and two-stroke oil. A comparison of the pollutant emissions of CO, HC, NOx, PAH, aldehydes, ketones and phenols for different vehicle categories is also given. 1991 SAE Transactions Section 3 910676. (SP-864) Saturn DOHC and SOHC four cylinder engines. Donald J. Reilly, Richard P. Andersen, Robert J. Casparian, and Peter H. Dugdale, Saturn Corp. This paper describes two 1.9L four cylinder engines developed for the new Saturn vehicles introduced in the Fall of 1990. A single overhead cam (SOHC) 2 valve/cylinder single point fuel injected (TBI) design is utilized as a base engine with a dual overhead cam (DOHC) four valve/cylinder multi-point fuel injected (MPFI) configuration selected for an optional derivative. Market objectives for the SOHC engine included exceptional driveability achived by high torque at low engine speeds com- bined with excellent fuel economy. Objectives for the DOHC engine included excellent driveability characterized by high torque at low engine speeds as well as good high speed power and good overall fuel economy. Both engines were developed in con- junction with specific automatic and manual transmissions to achieve fully optimized powertrains. One of the strategic technologies selected was the lost foam casting process. This process was used with aluminum alloy for the cylinder block (a world first) and cylinder heads, and with ductile iron for the crankshaft. Significant advantages of this pro- cess include flexibility to optimize component mass and the abil- ity to minimize machining requirements. A high degree of integration during the design process with all aspects of manufacturing, supplier partners and UAW technicans resulted in achieving the aggressive reliability, mass, packaging, cost and investment targets for both engines. 1991 SAE Transactions Section 3 910677. (SP-864) A new 1.6-liter twin-cam 16-valve Nissan engine. M akoto Yasuda and Hirostugu Maruyama, Nissan Motor Co., Ltd. Nissan has developed a new GA16DE engine for use in the new 1991 Sentra. The major development aims for this engine were to achieve ample torque at low to intermediate engine speed and smooth throttle response. These aims, of course, had to be compatible with good fuel economy, quietness, maintenance-free operation and high reliability. In addition, it was necessary to achieve a compact package size despite the twin-cam design. All of those objectives have been attained through the use of a super- long and aerodynamic intake system, variable valve timing con- trol, a low friction, maintenance-free, direct acting valve system, dual direction fuel injectors, and a two-stage cam drive system. This paper discuss the major development objectives, basic engine structure and principal component parts. 1991 SAE Transactions Section 3 910678. (SP-864) The new Audi V6 engine.

(SP-864) Ford's all new 4.6 liter SOHC V-8 engine for the Lincoln Town car. James R. Clarke and Michael J. Evans, Ford Motor Co. Ford is introducing the first high volume domestically designed and produced overhead camshaft V-8 engine. As the first entry of a family of V-8 engines, the 4.6L 2 valve per cylinder engine was created to replace Ford's workhorse small block V-8 family of pushrod engines. That family of engines was first pro- duced in 1962 in a 221 cu. in. version and have since evolved into the 302 cu. in. (5.0L) engine which previously powered the Town Car. Design goals of the engine family were: 1) higher horsepower output combined with reduced engine displacement; 2) improved fuel efficiency and reduced emissions; 3) reduced noise and vibra- tion; 4) advanced technology; 5) precision manufacturing; and 6) improved quality and durability. Program execution was accomplished by extensive use of teamwork processes, including cross functional teams (CFTs) among design engineering, manufacturing engineering, suppliers, purchasing and vehicle engineering. In the the Lincoln Town car the engine delivers 210 hp @ 4600 rpm and 270 ft-lbs @ 3400 rpm, delivering 90% of its peak torque from 1200 rpm through the normal operating range. The vehicle has achieved improved performance feel as indicated by a 1.5 sec- ond reduction on 0-60 mph time while maintaining competitive fuel economy. 910681. (SP-864) An application of ejector type exhaust sys- tem to a small spark ignition engine. Shuichi Kajitani and Nori- hiro Sawa, Ibaraki Univ. It is important not only to increase a thermal efficiency of a spark ignition engine, but also to decrease a driving loss of auxil- iary component of engine such as a cooling system. For example, there is a limitation of cooling performance when a requirement of aerodynamics design of a motorcycle or an automobile is severe. We propose an active application of ejector pump drove by exhaust energy to the cooling system. There were several applica- tions of ejector systems to the intake or exhaust system, but there was nothing for the design of it. In this report, one of the fundamental researches conducted in our laboratory, the effects of the dimensions of the ejector on the ejector performance are discussed. The results are followings: 1) the more the engine speed decreases, the more the ejector efficiency (G2/G1: Gl is the mass of charging air in the engine, G2 is the mass of entrained air by the ejector system) increases. The maximum value of ejector effi- ciency with four cycle engine is of order 4 to 5, and that with two cycle engine is of order 6 to 8 at the optimized ejector design. This quantity of air is about a half of the cooling air required by the test engine. Therefore, this ejector type cooling systems is very attractive auxiliary ones; 2) the more the nozzle diamenter of exhaust pipe decreases, the more the ejector efficiency increases. There is no change of a mass of intake air (volumetric efficiency) within the region of (fn)/(fe) ^ 0.3, where (fn) is the section area of the nozzle, and (fe) is the section area of the exhaust pipe; 3) the maximum value of ejector efficiency is obtained at (fm)/(fe)=5 and (lm)/(dm)=7- 15, where (fm),(lm) and (dm) is the section area, the length and the diameter of the mixing cham- ber, respectively; and 4) the location of nozzle is very important. The maximum value of ejector efficiency is obtained at (a/dm) = 1.0- 1.5, where (a) is the distance between the nozzle and mixing chamber. 1991 SAE Transactions Section 3 910682.

The turbo/intercooled Syclone engine is the latest variant off the famed GM 90° small block engine platform. Application is specifically to the Syclone short wheelbase all wheel drive pickup truck to be marketed by GMC in 1991. The engine project was a joint venture between General Motors Powertrain Division and PAS TRIAD of Troy, Michigan. Engine manufacture will origi- nate at the GMPD Romulus 4.3L plant with final assembly at the Shreveport vehicle assembly facilities of GMC Truck and Bus and PAS TRIAD. Features of the engine include: high specific performance (1430 KPa BMEP); air to water intercooling with an independent cooling loop; electronically controlled wastegate for boost and knock control; high dynamic range multi-port fuel injection; communication with standard 4.3L engine where possible to facilitate manufacturing process and quality management; and use of upgrade materials for highly stressed critical components including pistons, cylinder head gaskets, main bearing caps, and exhaust manifolds. Time for concept to market was held to 18 months via an intensive concept evaluation, design/development program. The early engine feasibility work featured a "probe" durability test where the engine was run successfully at 600 N-m torque, approx- imately twice the BMEP of the standard 4.3L. Engine validation was done to a jointly developed test plan that was specifically tai- lored for the vehicle usage expected. 910683. (SP-864) Review of Saturn's powertrain analysis methodology.

Centralized hydraulic systems implementation will reduce the number of hydraulic tanks and result in energy conservation, floor space savings, reduce maintenance, and improve machine response. A central hydraulic power unit is a large reservoir that will service the needs of several machines. Through the systems programmable controller, pumps can be cycled off and on as the systems need change. Computer generated flow analysis were performed on each machine. The analysis determined the system sizing. By combining both the pump flow and accumulator output, the system peak flow and pressure are maintained, improving machine response time. The consolidation of the hydraulic systems has eliminated potential leak points, and has improved maintainability. 910687.

A mathematical mode is presented that simulates belt tension forces in an automotive belt drive during rapid engine accelera- tion. The model is formulated as a base excitation problem in which the known motion of the crankshaft is used to excite the system. The elasticity of the belt is included by using linear elastic springs in the open spans and on the arc of contact of the belt with each pulley. The complete model includes the movement of the automatic tensioner arm, the variation of accessory load torques with speed, the effects of centrifugal tension, and the inertia of each component.

Plastic materials used to produce soft bumper fascia are reviewed, with an emphasis on thermoplastic compounds. The manufacturing processes used to produce soft bumper fascia from RIM urethane, thermoplastic polyolefin and thermoplastic polyester elastomers are compared. The critical contribution of the painting operation to the total cost structure of fascia manu- facture will be outlined. A property comparison of thermoplastic olefins with thermo- plastic polyesters demonstrate that faseias from thermoplastic polyesters can be produced in thinner walls. It is shown that total part cost must be considered in choosing between these two res- ins, as low resin cost can be negated by high paint costs. 910690. (SP-859) Improving RIM economics. Martin C.

This examination shows that, while RIM is today a competitive alternative to mold large; complex; painted parts, an opportunity exists to substantially improve the economic viability of both RIM, the product and RIM, the man- ufacturing process.

(SP-859) Future requirements for automotive compos- ite bumper beams. Joseph Greene and James McFadden, C-P-C Div., General Motors Corp. This paper presents material and design requirements for future bumper applications to meet the challenges future styling changes will bring. Automotive composites applications have increased steadily over the past several years. Composite bumper beams are becoming more common due to the increased number of low volume vehicles and to the greater emphasis toward weight reduction. Typical bumper systems and impact bars are pres- ented with advantages and disadvantages shown. The competing composite materials are compared with each other and to the cur- rent dominate bumper material, steel. Material, processing, and design developments are needed in composites to be competitive with current steel and future 'world class' steel. Composite mate- rials are needed with increased stiffness, strength, and thermal stability. A competitive piece cost target for composite bumper beams is two dollars per pound of material used. The glass pre- form reinforced composites best meet the stiffness, stability, and cost criteria in the expanding bumper field. 910694.

Nelson, Textron. 93</page><page sequence="93">910694-910701 A modular integrated front end (MIFE) has been designed, prototyped and tested. The backbone of the MIFE is a structural RIM (SRIM) beam/support, which incorporates the bumper beam, the radiator support, headlamp cans, turn signal and side marker lamp supports and reinforcement brackets. With the SRIM process, it was possible to integrate these 20 plastic and stamped steel components into one part resulting in a weight sav- ings of 13 Kg (28.5 lbs).

A new, low cost, structural reaction injection molding resin has been developed for automotive applications requiring high mechanical strength and impact resistance. Primarily targeted at bumper beam applications, this new resin also displays very good thermal properties which make it a unique candidate for use in assembly sequences requiring high temperature exposures. Ther- mal and mechanical properties are presented as a function of glass level and glass configuration. At levels of over 50% by weight reinforcement, flexural modulus values of more than 14 GPa (ca. over 2 million psi) and coefficients of linear expansion comparable to steel are achievable.

An electronic ABS with integrated brake booster is described in the paper. The system has been developed with special regard to the application in 4WD-off-road-vehicles. The special require- ments resulting from that are outlined, followed by description of the system and components fulfilling these requirements: a brake booster with integrated ABS modulating valves, an electric pump to generate and an accumulator to store the hydraulic energy required for brake boost and ABS modulation, inductive sensors to pick up wheelspeeds and an ECU to monitor and con- trol the total system and to interface with external diagnostic devices. Some special features of the ABS control strategy are outlined which enable this system to remain operative under all condi- tions without any exception. Furthermore description is made of the system safety concept and the testwork carried out to prove electro-magnetic compatibility. 1991 SAE Transactions Section 6 910699.

These sophisticated sys- tems are available for driven and non-driven wheels. The paper describes developments leading to ABS capable wheel bearings. The influence of the surrounding parts and the operating conditions on the design of the wheel bearings is pres- ented.

Development and analysis of new traction control sys- tem with rear viscous LSD. Toru Iwata and Terukiyo Murakami, Nissan Motor Co. Ltd.; and Minoru Tamura, Nissan Motor Co. Ltd,. Traction control systems (TCSs) serve to control brake pres- sure and engine torque, thereby reducing driving wheel spin for improved stability and handling. Systems are divided into two basic types by the brake control configuration. One type is a one- channel left-right common control system and the other is a two- channel individual control system. This paper presents an analy- sis of these two types of TCS configurations in terms of handling, acceleration, stability yaw convergence and other performance parameters. The systems are compared with and without a limit- ed-slip differential (LSD) under various road conditions, based on experimental data and computer simulations. As a result of this work, certain Nissan models are now equipped with a new Nissan Traction Control System with a rear viscous LSD (Nissan V-TCS), which provides both the advantages of a rear viscous LSD in a small slip region and a two-channel TCS in a large slip region. As a result, this system works to improve traction, stabil- ity and overall performance under various road conditions. 1991 SAE Transactions Section 6 910701. Three-dimensional analysis and modeling of a Wan- ke 1 engine. M. S. Raju, Sverdrup Tech., Inc., NASA Lewis Research Center; and E. A. Willis, Propulsion Systems Div., NASA Lewis Research Center. A new computer code, AGNI-3D, has been developed for the modeling of combustion, spray, and flow properties in a strati- fied-charge rotary engine (SCRE). The mathematical and numeri- cal details of the new code are described by the first author in a separate NASA publication. The solution procedure is based on an Eulerian-Lagrangian approach where the unsteady, three- dimensional Navier-Stokes equations for a perfect gas-mixture with variable properties are solved in generalized, Eulerian coor- dinates on a moving grid by making use of an implicit finite- volume, Steger-Warming flux vector splitting scheme. The liq- uid-phase equations are solved in Lagrangian coordinates. The engine configuration studied was similar to existing rotary engine flow-visualization and hot-firing test rigs. The results of limited test cases indicate a good degree of qualitative agreement between the predicted and measured pressures. It is conjectured that the impulsive nature of the torque generated by the observed pres- sure nonuniformity may be one of the mechanisms responsible for the excessive wear of the timing gears observed during the early stages of the rotary combustion engine (RCE) development. It was identified that the turbulence intensities near top-dead- center were dominated by the compression process and only slightly influenced by the intake and exhaust processes. Slow mix- ing resulting from small turbulence intensities within the rotor pocket and also from a lack of formation of any significant recir- culation regions within the rotor pocket were identified as the major factors leading to incomplete combustion. Detailed flow- field results during exhaust and intake, fuel injection, fuel vapor- ization, combustion, mixing and expansion processes are also presented. The numerical procedure is very efficient as it takes 7 to 10 CPU hours on a CRAY Y-MP for one entire engine cycle when the computations are performed over a 31 X 16X20 grid. 94</page><page sequence="94">910702-910709 910702. Calculations of spray and spray combustion in a strat- ified charge wankel engine. A. Karadag , Z. Li, G. W. Howe, and T. I. P. Shih, Dept. of Mech. Engrg., Carnegie Mellon Univ.; M. S. Raju, Sverdrup Technonlogy, Inc., NASA Lewis Research Cen- ter; and H . L. Nguyen, E. A. Willis, and J. J. McFadden , Propul- sion Systems Div., NASA Lewis Research Center. A computer program - LeRC3D.Wankel- was developed to study the flow, spray, and spray combustion in the combustion chambers of Wankel rotary engines. LeRC3D.Wankel is based on an Eulerian-Lagrangian formulation. The gas phase was mod- elled by an Eulerian approach using the density-weighted, ensem- ble-averaged conservation equations of mass, momentum (full compressible Navier-Stokes), total energy, and species, closed by a low Reynolds number k-e turbulence model. The liquid phase, made up of fuel droplets, was modelled by using a Lagrangian approach in which droplet groups are tracked in time. The com- bustion process which takes place after fuel droplets evaporate and mix with the surrounding air was assumed to be chemical kinetics controlled via a two-step global mechanism. This paper describes the formulation employed in the computer program as well as the essence of the numerical method used to generate solu- tions. Some computed solutions for the flow field are also pres- ented. 910703. A numerical study on the effects of apex seal leakage on wankel engine flow fields. Z. Li and T. I. P. Shih, Dept. of Mech. Engrg., Carnegie Mellon Univ.; H.J. Schock, Mech. Engrg. Dept., Michigan State Univ.; and E. A. Willis, Propulsion Systems Div., NASA Lewis Research Center. A numerical study was conducted to examine how leakages across apex seals affect the flow field in one combustion chamber of a motored, two-dimensional, Wankel rotary engine. Results are presented which show the effects of engine speed, leakage area, and compression ratio on velocity field, distribution of tur- bulent kinetic energy, and volume-averaged pressure when there are apex seal leakages. These results indicate that apex seal leak- ages can have a significant effect on the flow field. This study is based on the density-weighted-ensemble- averaged continuity, "full compressible" Navier-Stokes, and total energy equations, closed by a k-e model of turbulence with wall functions. The numerical method used to obtain solutions was the approximate factorization algorithm of the ADI type. All convection terms were treated by second-order accurate upwind differencing through flux-vector splitting. All diffusion terms were treated by second-order accurate central differencing. 910704. Fuel-air mixing visualization in a motored rotary engine assembly. T. Morita, F. Hamady, T. Stuecken, C. Somer- ton, and H. J. Schock, Mech. Engrg. Dept., Michigan State Univ. A high speed flow visualization technique was utilized to study fuel spray development and the fuel-air mixing process in a direct fuel injection motored rotary engine assembly. Kerosene fuel was injected through a single hole nozzle at an angle of 60° from the horizontal axis into the combustion chamber. The noz- zle was installed in a servojet fuel injection system that was mounted in the central housing of a rotary engine. A 40 watt cop- per vapor laser was synchronized with a high speed rotating prism camera to expose motion picture films at 5000 frames per second (fps). The fuel spray structure was studied at injection pressures of 44 and 70 MPa, and at nominal injection durations of 1.2 and 2.8 ms. The engine shaft speed was 2000 rpm. A sequence of successive frames was selected from high speed films and then used to analyze the fuel spray characteristics. The flow field and rotor motion which had contributing effects on the fuel spray behavior were also considered. The spray tip velocities and penetration distances of the fuel spray were quantified by analyz- ing the high speed films and were found to be significantly influ- enced by injection pressures. 1991 SAE Transactions Section 3 910705. Cepstral analysis for the recovery of apex seal interac- tion forces in rotary engines. J. Daniel Britton, Deer and Co. A new method has been developed to recover apex seal inter- action forces from housing acceleration measurements in rotary engines. The development was motivated by a need to rapidly compare and evaluate seal design concepts during rotary engine development when engine builds and test conditions change fre- quently. The new method is based on cepstral analysis techniques and offers several advantages compared to conventional signal processing techniques. By transforming information from the time domain to the cepstral domain, computations required to recover interaction forces are simplified. Furthermore, window- ing in the cepstral domain can be used to minimize the effects of the vibration transfer path making this procedure relatively insensitive to changes in engine structure and operating condi- tions. The method was tested and verified using a beam and a rotor housing before being applied to an operating rotary engine. The transfer path of an assembled single rotor engine was mea- sured and used to recover the apex seal interaction forces under motoring and firing conditions. The results are encouraging, sug- gesting that this method might have broader applications to other engine monitoring and diagnostic situations, but additional development work is needed. 1991 SAE Transactions Section 3 910706. Three-dimensional steady-state wall heat fluxes and thermal analysis of a stratified-charge rotary engine./. Abraham, D. Ramoth, and J. Mannisto, Rotary Engine Div., John Deere Technologies International. A three-dimensional model is used to compute the flow, sprays and combustion in a stratified-charge rotary engine. Wall temperatures estimated from available measurements are used as boundary conditions for the energy equation. The computations provide local and instantaneous heat fluxes on the rotor and the rotor housing. The instantaneous heat fluxes are integrated in time over one cycle of the rotor to obtain estimates of local cycle averaged heat flux through the rotor and the rotor housing. These are then used as boundary conditions in a thermal analysis of the rotor and rotor housing with known coolant-side flow rates and heat transfer coefficients. The thermal analysis is done using a finite-element three-dimensional code which provides updated estimates of the rotor and rotor housing wall temperatures. These wall temperatures agree within ±20°C of the measured wall tem- peratures. The coupling of the two codes extends very signifi- cantly the information obtained from the wall temperature mea- surements and, in particular, allows one to identify wall regions with extreme heat fluxes. 1991 SAE Transactions Section 3 910708. (P-241) Beryillum copper contact material solves automotive electronic connector problems. Rich Lowe, Brush Wel- Iman Inc. In the automobile, technology and environmental demands have evolved beyond the performance capabilities of tradition- ally used connector contact materials such as brass (C26000), tin- brass (C42500), phosphor bronze (C51000) and copper iron (C19400). Beryllium copper alloys (C17410 and C17200) meet the performance demands of the new automotive environment. With a combination of strength, conductivity and resistance to stress relaxation, there is good reason why beryllium copper con- tact material is transitioning into automotive applications along with high performance electronics. 910709. (P-241) Application of molded printed circuit board to automotive electrical units. Jun Nishihashi, Yoshikazu Kamei, Masayuki Ishiwa, Hirokazu Shiroishi, and Kenichi Fuse, Furukawa Electric Co., Ltd. MPCB (molded printed circuit board) is a PWB (printed wir- ing board) with injection molding. MPCB will combine the PWB with structural parts such as cases and reinforcements for various 95</page><page sequence="95">910709-910717 purpose. The purpose of this study is to investigate the suitability of MPCB for automotive electronics through pilot production. As a result, MPCB has enabled simple assembly and space-saying. The prototypes have proved themselves to be superior to the con- ventional models in the basic performance and reliability. The study indicates that MPCB is new effective method to embody efficient hardware in automotive units and therefore this technol- ogy can innovate and diffuse in the automotive unit-assembly. 910710. (P-241) Use of one ST9 timer for handling a J1850 40 Kbit/sec. implementation. Pietro Malusardi, SGS-Thomson Microelectronics . This paper describes a mixed hardware and software imple- mentation for the SAE-J1850 protocol. This implementation is general and can be adapted to most J1850 based systems. Each node is entirely managed by one ST9 microprocessor. That means that the same micro controls the application and the bus. To interface with the bus the micro uses one ST9 16-bit timer and two register banks. As a result this system can be imple- mented using any ST9 microprocessor. Only a simple external circuitry is needed to drive and buffer the bus, as well as filtering the incoming signals. Bit decoding, CRC check/generation and consistency checks are done inter- nally to the micro, thanks to the sophisticated hardware of the standard ST9 16-bit timer. The data link, network, transport, session and presentation layers are implemented by software. Therefore this implementa- tion is perfectly suited for nodes with application layers of medium complexity, such as doors, lights, speed control, A/C control, instrumentation, distributed audio modules, etc. 910711. (P-241) Hardware/software partitioning for automo- tive multiplex systems. Scott Eisenhart and Dave Baum, Texas Instruments Inc. When integrating Class B multiplexing into automotive sys- tems, cost-effective solutions will require an optimal partitioning of the multiplex protocol between hardware and software. The system designer is confronted with making tradeoffs based upon application through-put requirements, device availability, and cost goals. This report discusses a model for determining the sys- tem software/hardware partitioning. The model is then applied to a sensor node application to provide further insight. 910712. (P-241) J1850 multiplex development tools. Robert J. Louch, Ford Motor Co.; and Donald C. Franks, Software Services Corp. Design and testing of J1850 multiplex communications net- works requires a range of support tools which facilitate the pro- cess from initial concept, thru bench development and vehicle implementation. In the early stages of design, vehicle features, I/O, and functionality of the various option mixes must be mapped into modules, and communications requirements and message strategy between modules defined and simulated. When modules become available, a means of emulating network traffic on the bus is required in order to evaluate actual module responses. Network monitoring and diagnostic tools are also nec- essary at both low and high detail levels. This discussion will cover several multiplex design and analysis tools which are under development at Ford. 910713. (P-241) Use of simulation on a J1850 network. Donald C. Franks, Software Services Corp.; and Robert J. Louch, Ford Motor Co. Designing a multiplex network configuration for vehicles using a J1850 compatible network can be a difficult and time con- suming task. Parameters such as network bus rates, module trans- mit queues, module transmit message rates, and other message characteristics all have an effect on the latency of messages trans- mitted on the network. These parameters can also effect the con- trol strategy used within network modules. This paper will dis- cuss the use of network traffic simulation and evaluation in a sys- tems engineering approach to the design of vehicle multiplex sys- tems. 910714. (P-241) Serial bus thruput doubling by using variable pulse width modulation. Carl Hu, Arch Willis, Russ Pogue, and Dan Carman, Delco Electronics Corp. The 10.4 kbit/s SAE J-850 serial data link specifies variable pulse width modulation (VPWM) encoding for its single wire sys- tem. This paper begins with a description of serial data link requirements in an automotive environment, and then discusses two key areas which lead to the use of VPWM and its implemen- tation. A comparison of encoding approaches and their relative merits and weak points arrives at the use of VPWM for single wire low radiated emissions arbitrated busses. The second key area of implementation is covered in a discussion of timing and synchronization approaches with emphasis on system integrity in a characteristically noisy environment. 1991 SAE Transactions Section 6 910715. (P-241) Survey of encoding techniques for vehicle mul- tiplexing. Fred Miesterfeld and Rick Halter, Chrysler Corp. This paper proposes the adaptation of a modulation technique called modified frequency modulation (MFM) to vehicle multi- plexing. MFM was developed during the latter 1960's for use in magnetic disk drives. Disk drives use MFM encoding to achieve a maximum density of recorded data on a disk. The advantage in vehicle multiplexing is that the technique is synchronous with an average of 0.75 transitions per bit. Another advantage is that it can tolerate a large amount of rise and fall time wave shaping, which can significantly reduce radiated EMI. The paper will com- pare the EMI characteristics generated by NRZ, PWM, VPWM, Machester, and MFM encoding. Included are typical encoding requirements such as symbol generation, arbitration capabilities, latency, invalid bit testing as well as encoding techniques effect on the host microcomputer. 910716. (P-241) JSAE recommended practice evaluating method of the automotive distributed control multiplex systems. Naoki Hiwa, Yoshikazu Nobutoki, and Hiroaki Sakamoto, Mazda Motor Corp.; Norio Fujiki, Nissan Motor Co., Ltd.; Toshiaki Isobe, Toyota Motor Corp.; Teruhisa Inoue, Furukawa Electric Co., Ltd.; and Kazuya Akashi, Electric and Electronic Products Dept., Fujikura Ltd. While basic automobile performance is improving along with the growth of higher value-added features, rapidly increasing use of electrical and electronics systems with complex wire harnesses is becoming a problem. This is bringing the automotive distrib- uted control multiplex system to commercial reality. At present, standardization of protocols is under deliberation by SAE and ISO, and several protocols are being considered as candidates. To select a multiplex LSI having an optional protocol, we have estab- lished a method to evaluate automotive distributed control mul- tiplex system from the standpoint of users. The method will per- mit comparison of various multiplex LSIs including physical lay- ers and their protocols' performance/reliability, while helping clarify their features and areas of applications. It is our hope that through this activity of ours, we will be able to make some contribution to global standardization in the field. 910717. (P-241) An evaluation of latency time by simulation for distributed multiplex system. Kiyoshi Inoue and Yutaka Mat- suda, Furukawa Electric Co., Ltd.; and Takeshi Nakada, Furukawa Information Technology Co., Ltd. Currently both the SAE and ISO are working on the standard- ization of distributed multiplex transmission protocols, and the Japanese Society of Automotive Engineers (JSAE) is in the pro- cess of evaluating the performance and reliability of a number of 96</page><page sequence="96">910717-910722 communication protocols with a view to contributing to this work of standardization. This paper summarizes the aspect of the JSAE's communica- tion protocol evaluation program that concerns response. CSMA/CD with non-destructive arbitration systems that are used in motor vehicles resemble ordinary CSMA/CD systems in that transmission delay times vary in accordance with traffic. Thus when there is a stringent need for response, it is essential to make judgments on the basis of the probability in terms of delay time. It is, however, impossible to determine delay proba- bilities experimentally due to the problem of the number of test runs, and this creates a need for methods using simulation and analysis. It may also be noted that none of the simulation and analysis techniques developed for CSMA/CD heretofore takes up the issue of delay time probability. The authors have, therefore, developed a method of simula- tion that establishes delay time probabilities for frames of any given level of priority under any given level of traffic. In order to allow measurements to be made rapidly, actual measurements of delay times under heavy traffic were made and compared with the results obtained by simulation, thus verifying the validity of the simulation model. Comparatively good agreement between simulation and bench tests was obtained, demonstrating the validity of the simulation model. In addition a model using a simplified delay-analysis method (S-DAM) was developed and the results obtained were close enough to those from the simulation that it has been possible to use S-DAM as a guide in the design of ordinary in-vehicle LAN systems. 910718. (P-241) An evaluation of multiplexing system for auto- motive distributed control. Norio Fujiki, Nissan Motor Co., Ltd.; Naoki Hiwa, Mazda Motor Corp.; Toshiaki Isobe, Toyota Motor Corp.; Teruhisa Inoue, Furukawa Electric Co., Ltd.; and Kazuya Akashi, Electric and Electronic Products Dept., Fujikura Ltd. On board multiplexing communication system is regarded as a necessary technology for the future of electronic system in auto- mobiles. Many companies are developing multiplexing systems and the ISO and SAE are active in establishing standards for com- munication protocols. The proposed communication protocol specifications have different specifications. Consequently, no compatible evaluation standards existed, and it was difficult to compare one protocol to another. Therefore, to assist the standardization activities of the ISO and SAE, we have developed an evaluation method for distrib- uted multiplexed communication systems and evaluated each of the proposed protocols using this method. These evaluations were performed from the point of view of the future users of these systems. In this paper we present the results of the experiments on dis- tributed multiplexed communication systems each of which con- sists of communication IC and the proposed physical layer. These evaluations were performed by the twelve corporate members of the JSAE serial data communication evaluation subcommittee. 1991 SAE Transactions Section 6 910719. Investigation of in-cylinder fluid motion using a head gasket instrumented with ionization probes. Peter O . Witze, Com- bustion Research Facility, Sandia National Labs.; and Stefan C. Bopp, University of Erlangen. Ionization probes installed in the head gasket of an engine have been used to infer the shape of the burned volume from measurements of when the flame contacts the gasket. It is demon- strated that the technique can be extended to infer fluid motion by using one of the ionization probes as the ignition site, with the ensuing flame serving as a flow marker. It is shown that swirl motion, and its direction, can be detected, and that flame propa- gation velocities can be measured. A comparison of estimated swirl velocities with laser doppler velocimeter measurements show remarkably good agreement. The most valuable feature of the technique is that is can be applied to any production engine without modification. 1991 SAE Transactions Section 3 910720. The application of an air-to-fuel ratio sensor to the investigation of a two-stroke engine. D. Watry and R. Sawyer, University of California, Berkeley; R. Green, Sandia National Lab.; and B. Cousyn, CORIA, Univeristy of Rouen. A rapid response air-to-fuel ratio sensor manufactured by Nis- san has been evaluated for use as a diagnostic tool in engine research. The sensor was calibrated for use with methanol and the time response of the sensor was investigated. Using the sensor's capacity as an extended range oxygen sensor, it was used to moni- tor the exhaust of a methanol fueled, two-stroke research engine fitted with a prototype air-assisted direct-injection fuel injector. Measurements made at various locations in the exhaust line indi- cated high levels of short circuited intake air and revealed fluctua- tions in the measurements due to the sensor's sensitivity to tem- perature and pressure. 910721. Calculation of heat flux integral length scales from spatially-resolved surface temperature measurements in an engine. David Boggs, Ford Motor Co.; and Gary L. Borman, Uni- versity of Wisconsin-Madison. Instantaneous heat flux rates were measured in a spark ignited CFR engine. A new heat flux probe was used which had seven thin film platinum resistance thermometers, spaced 1 mm apart, on a macor substrate. Instantaneous heat flux was measured at each sensor location and the integral length scale of heat flux was calculated from the spatial cross correlation data. A swirl flow condition was generated by use of a shrouded intake valve, and tumble flow was created by rotating the shrouded valve 90°. An unshrouded valve gave a more quiescent flow condition. Under motoring conditions, peak heat flux was 70% higher for swirl flow conditions than quiescent flow conditions, and the total heat rejected during the closed portion of the cycle was 50% higher with the swirl flow than the quiescent flow. The peak heat flux for swirl flow compared to tumble flow was 30% higher and the total heat rejection was 10% greater. Heat flux integral length scales near TDC of compression were on the order of 1 mm and were greater for swirl flows than for either the tumble flow or the quiescent flow. The heat flux integral length scale did not change for a change in compression ratio from 10 to 6, corresponding to a change in TDC clearance height from 12 mm to 22 mm. Combustion had the effect of increasing the heat flux integral length scale over the unburned case. It is reasoned that the increased viscosity of the burned gases caused preferential dissi- pation of the shorter length scales. 1991 SAE Transactions Section 3 910722. Heat transfer in engines: Comparison of cars thermal boundary layer measurements and heat flux measurements. Robert P. Lucht, Combustion Research Facility, Sandia National Labs.; Derek Dunn-Rankin, Dept. of Mech. Engrg., University of California; Thomas Walter, Technical University of Munich; Thomas Dreier, University of Heidelberg; and Stefan C. Bopp, University of Erlangen. We have used broadband coherent anti-stokes raman scatter- ing (CARS) to measure the gas temperatures near the cylinder heat surface in an operating single-cylinder research engine. The CARS measurements were performed in both motored and fired engines at the bore half-radius position. A toroidal contoured head was used to allow laser probing to within 25-50 'im of the surface, and the spatial resolution of the measurements was approximately 50pim. Two different shrouded intake valves were used to produce high and low swirl conditions which resulted in much different velocity boundary layers at the measurement location. The measured CARS profiles are quite different for the 97</page><page sequence="97">910722-910728 low and high swirl cases in the motored engine, but surprisingly similar for the two cases in the fired engine. The results indicate a distinct thickening of the boundary layer during the expansion stroke of the fired engine. The heat flux as a function of crank angle was also measured for the high and low swirl cases in the motored and fired engine at the CARS measurement location. 910723. Diesel smoke measurement and control using an in- cylinder optical sensor. Peter G. Hartman and Steven L. Plee, Barrack Labs.; and James E. Bennethum , Detroit Diesel Corp. An in-cylinder optical sensor has been developed to measure and control the exhaust smoke or soot emission from heavy-duty diesel engines. The sensor directly measures the radiant emission from incandescent soot particles during and after main combus- tion. Results show a strong correlation between both the mea- sured duration and end of radiant emission, and the amount of soot emitted by the engine. Test results also demonstrated some potential benefits of in-cylinder control using the optical sensor. In one test, the optical signal was used to control high-load soot emission during changes in air intake pressure and temperature. In a second test, the optical signal was used to minimize the vari- ability in exhaust soot levels caused by manufacturing variations in fuel-injector flow characteristics. 1 991 SAE Transactions Section 3 910724. A comparison of the Bosch and Zuech rate of injection meters. Glenn R. Bower and David E. Foster, University of Wis- consin-Madison. This paper will discuss the fundamentals of the Bosch rate of injection meter which has been the standard measurement tool for the last 25 years and a newly developed tool which uses the Zuech constant volume technique. A fundamental and experi- mental comparison is presented. Using a high pressure accumula- tor type injector, each of the injection systems produced almost identical injection rate shapes. The integrated values of these traces (injection quantity) were within a few percent of the physi- cally measured quantities. 910725. Particle sizing using a two-dimensional image. P. V. Farrell, Dept. of Mech. Engrg., University of Wisconsin-Madison. Particle size data is available from the scattered light pattern collected by a still camera in a typical particle image velocimetry (PIV) experiment. While most PIV experiments are primarily interested in fluid velocities for a seeded flow, in a fuel spray the spray droplets may be used as the scattering particles in dilute areas of the spray. Conventional PIV processing can provide a local average particle velocity in the plane of illumination. In addition, analysis of the scattering signature of the ensemble of particles in a small area of the PIV photograph can provide an average particle size. Examples of the proposed experimental technique will be given, as well as a suitable inversion scheme for obtianing particle size distributions from the diffraction pattern using an integral inversion. 1991 SAE Transactions Section 3 910726. Planar liquid and gas fuel and droplet size visualiza- tion in a DI diesel engine. J. T. Hodges, Recherches Avancées Motuers, Institut Français du Pétrole ; and T. A. Baritaud and T. A. Heinze, Recherches Avancées Moteurs, Institut Français du Pétrole. In an optically accessible direct injection diesel engine with pressure and temperature conditions close to those of actual engines, the gaseous and liquid phases of the fuel were simulta- neously visualized by planar exciplex fluorescence to yield instantaneous information sensitive to droplet breakup and vaporization in a non-combusting spray. Semi-quantitative results were extracted from the technique to give spatially inte- grated ensemble average data concerning the temporal evolution of the mass concentration of the respective phases. The ensemble scattering polarization ratio technique was also applied to yield the droplet size and concentration at the leading edge of the jet. Within the jet core, planar measurements of the depolarization of elastically scattered light indicated the presence of longitudinal fluctuations in droplet concentration. Cycle to cycle coherence in the depolarization profiles was observed. 1991 SAE Transactions Section 3 910727. Optical diagnostic for diesel-sprays with {s-time reso- lution. Rudolf R. Maty and Günther W. Mayer, Daimler-Benz AG; Bernhard Reck, ITLR, University of Stuttgart ; and Rainer A. Schaudt, Daimler-Benz AG. Droplet formation and subsequent evaporation in diesel sprays occur so fast that conventional diagnostic tools are gener- ally too slow to resolve time dependent features. To overcome this drawback a very fast optical diagnostic system has been developed, providing a time resolution of 4 'is per sampling point over the full duration of automotive type diesel sprays. In order to accomplish this high speed the simultaneously measurable quantities had to be reduced to the two most essential values: mean droplet size and number of droplets in the test sec- tion. A combined extinction-diffraction technique is used to determine the two free parameters in a generalized droplet distri- bution function which has been derived from a detailed analysis of spray characteristics using photographic recordings of droplet distributions. It is shown that these two parameters are sufficient to characterize with good accuracy the full width of variations occuring in practical droplet distributions. The optical diagnostic system is controlled by a PC-based data aquisition and evaluation system. It is easily calibrated by a series of thin wires covering the measuring range from about 4-80»i.m and can be used even in quite dense sprays with extinction signals down to 50%. This is accomplished by taking multiple diffraction automatically into account, if the extinction signal falls in the range:(80-50)%. If required the measuring range may be easily shifted to larger sizes by minor alignments in the optics. This will not affect the dynamic range of approximately 1 to 20 in measurable droplet ratios. The theoretical derivation of the mathematical background function, the layout of the optical setup and the calibration scheme are described in detail. The diagnostic is tested on a single hole nozzle using different injection pressures. The time depen- dent profiles of mean droplet diameter and number of droplets in the spray cone have been measured at different distances from the nozzle for injection pressures in the range 200-300 bar into atmospheric air. A good agreement has been achieved between our optical data and published data in the literature. 1991 SAE Transactions Section 3 910728. Measurement of soot and flame temperature along three directions in the cylinder of a direct injection diesel./. Samy Mohammad, Ain Shams Univ.; and Gary L. Borman, University of Wisconsin- Madison. A single cylinder diesel engine with simulated turbocharging was instrumented and run to acquire radiation data at two wave- lengths, simultaneously at three locations, along with cylinder pressure data and injection data. The 8 hole injector was indexed to acquire data, at three angles of 0°, 11°, and 22.5° from the spray axis. The engine speed was 1500 rpm, the equivalence ratio (based on fuel to oxygen ratio) was 0.47, and the partial pressure of oxygen was 58 kPa for all runs. The radiation data were pro- cessed to produce the flame temperature and soot concentration using the two-color theory. The soot concentration and tempera- ture increased in the outward radial direction, with the highest values at the 11° locations except for near the injector where the highest values were on the axis. The flame appeared to start at the spray tip when it was almost half-way distant from the bowl wails. The spray slowed down as it moved radially outward. The flame appeared earlier at all loca- 98</page><page sequence="98">910728-910736 tíons as the oxygen concentration was increased, indicating faster chemical reactions and spray penetrtion. The peak soot concentration was highest for the intermediate oxygen ratio (25%), however, during the expansion stroke, the concentrations crossed over giving the lowest concentration for the highest oxygen ratio (27%). 910729. Exciplex-based fluorescence method for remote prob- ing of fuel droplet temperature. Toshikazu Kadota , Dept. of Mech. Engrg., University of Osaka Prefecture ; Katsuya Miyoshi , Dept. of Mech. Engrg., Hiroshima Univ.; Yoshio Tani gu chi, Mazda Motor Corp.; and Mitsuhiro Tsue, Dept. of Mech. Engrg., University of Osaka Prefecture. Exciplex-based fluorescence was employed for the remote, nonintrusive, instantaneous and point measurements of fuel droplet temperature. A hydrocarbon droplet doped with naph- thalene and TMPD was allowed to evaporate in a heated gaseous mixture of oxygen, nitrogen, carbon dioxide, and water. The fluo- rescence emission spectra from a droplet subjected to nitrogen laser excitation were measured with an optical multichannel ana- lyzer. Photographic observation showed that a droplet fluoresced with a green color at room temperature. As the temperature was raised, fluorescence became purple. The ratio of fluorescence emission intensities at two different wavelengths was an appro- priate criterion for in situ determination of droplet temperature. Oxygen in the ambient gas was found to be a major quencher for the fluorescence. Droplet velocity relative to the ambient gas did not have an appreciable influence on the fluorescence emission spectra. 910730. A quantitative analysis of schlieren photography for internal combustion engine diagnostics. Hitoshi Ouchi, Takemi Chikahisa, and Tadashi Murayama, Hokkaido Univ. This report describes the possibility of quantitative analysis of Schlieren photographs as an internal combustion engine diagnos- tic. Using a recently developed photographic analysis system, it was attempted to analyze Schlieren photographs. Results showed simple integration calculations produced significant distortion in the analyzed results. To eliminate the distortion, some correction techniques were developed in this research. Accuracy of the ana- lyzed results were evaluated roughly with uncertainty analysis. The results showed that this analysis technique can be one of the approximate diagnostics for the measurement of fuel vapor and density distribution in internal combustion engine research. 910731. The low NOx truck engine. J. R. Needham, D. M. Doyle, and A. J. Nicol, Ricardo Consulting Engineers Ltd. A brief study has been undertaken with exhaust gas recircula- tion (EGR) applied to a prototype low emission, heavy duty, direct injection (DI) diesel engine aimed at evaluating the poten- tial for low nitrogen oxide (NOx) emissions. By virtue of the very low smoke levels achieved with the prototype engine, EGR can be applied at full load for substantial reductions in NOx down to c. 2.5 g/kWh (1.9 g/hph) over the European R-49 13-Mode test. These results were achieved with competitive particulates and fuel consumption and without recourse to engine de-rating. Com- pliance with the NOx emissions proposed for the year 2000 Japa- nese market was also demonstrated. These results are summa- rised in this paper and justify the need for a major research pro- gram aimed at demonstrating the full potential of using EGR to develop a fuel efficient, low emission truck engine concept for the 1990's and beyond. At an early stage this research must address whether such a concept will ever provide acceptable durability using a practical EGR system. 1991 SAE Transactions Section 3 910732. A method of estimate H2 in engine exhaust and factors that affect NOx and particulate in diesel engine exhaust. Otto Uyehara, University of Wisconsin. This paper consists of two parts. The first part, the author develops a method to estimate the hydrogen (H2) generated from the combustion of the fuel. The second part deals with the cause and effect of the existence of the pollutants NOx and particulate in the exhaust of a diesel engine. The concept of throttling in the injection nozzle is introduced to explain the results obtained in the combustion chamber of the diesel engine. 1991 SAE Transactions Section 3 910733. A comparison of the particulate composition between turbocharged and naturally aspirated DI diesel engines. M. K. Ab bass, G. E. Andrews, R. B. Ishaq, and P. T. Williams, Dept. of Fuel and Energy, University of Leeds; and K. D. Bartle, School of Engrg., Univesity of Leeds. A naturally aspirated Perkins 4-236 engine was compared with a similar turbocharged Perkins engine. The higher pressures and temperatures of a turbocharged engine should make the pyrosyn- thesis of PAH more likely than for a NA engine and this was investigated using the fuel n-alkanes as tracers for the unburnt fuel of the same fuel distillation fraction as the PAH. The results showed that the below C20 the NA and TC survivabilities of fuel n-alkanes onto the particulates were similar at below 0.02%. For higher n-alkanes the turbocharger was much more efficient at burning the fuel, with survivabilities of C24 a factor of 10 below the NA results. The higher operating temperatures of the TC engine reduced the UHC emissions and this reduced the higher boiling fraction unburned fuel. In contrast to these results the fuel PAH apparent survivability's were higher, by approximately a factor of 10, for the turbocharged engine for equivalent boiling point compounds in the range C18-C22. Although for both engines less than 1% of the fuel PAH survived, the results possi- bly indicate some pyrosynthesis of PAH in the turbocharged engine. For the higher molecular weight PAH the survivabilities were similar between the two engines. For both engines fuel PAH was the dominant source of the particulate PAH. 1991 SAE Transactions Section 3 910735. Fuel and maladjustments effects on emissions from a diesel bus engine. Terry L. Ullman and David M. Human, South' west Research Institute. Substantial efforts have been made to reduce emissions from future heavy-duty diesel engines by control of selected fuel prop- erties. U.S. diesel fuel for transportation use is scheduled by EPA to have low sulfur (^0.05 wt. %) and a minimum cetane index of 40 by 1994 to reduce emissions. In addition, California has mandated that low sulfur diesel fuels contain less than 10 volume percent aromatics by 1994. Relative to emissions impact, diesel engine design and state- of-tune are perhaps even more important than proposed changes to diesel fuel. The work reported here examined emissions from a 1986 DDC 6V92-TA bus engine using fuels with variation in cetane number, aromatic level, 90 percent boiling point, and sul- fur content. The engine was run on these fuels with selected mal- adjustments to examine their interactive effects on bus engine emissions. Except for HC emissions, regulated emissions were affected more by state-of-tune than by variation in test fuel prop- erties. However, fuel properties did have significant effects on regulated emissions such that lower emissions were generally favored when the fuel had a low 90 percent boiling point, low aro- matic content, high cetane number, and low sulfur level. 1991 SAE Transactions Section 4 910736. A new approach of the two-color method for determin- ing local instantaneous soot concentration and temperature in a D.I. diesel combustion chamber. Hoang Xuan Quoc, Jean Marc Vignon, and Maurice Brun, Laboratoire de Machines Ther- miques, Ecole Centrale de Lyon. 99</page><page sequence="99">910736-910741 The instantaneous soot formation in a diesel combustion chamber is generally measured using an auxiliary light source, typically a laser, which leads to use experimental engines with simplified geometries and reduced compression ratio. The proposed optical method use thermal radiations of soot particulates inside the flame to investigate their concentration and temperature. This method, based on the diffraction theory for small particles, is applicable to industrial diesel engines with- out major modifications of their main characteristics. Measure- ments are performed at two locations inside the combustion chamber of an industrial DI diesel engine. The presented results show a radial stratification of the soot concentration, soot parti- cles being present primarily in the bowl location. With heavy loads, a second stage of soot generation and oxidation is observed. 1991 SAE Transactions Section 3 910737. The influence of fuel properties on diesel-soot sup- pression with soluble fuel additives. Noboru Miyamoto and Hideyuki Ogawa, Dept. of Mech. Engrg., Hokkaido Univ.; Zhixin Hou, Komatsu Ltd.; and Masahiko S hi buy a, Hokkaido Univ. Diesel soot suppression effects of catalytic fuel additives for a range of fuels with different properties were investigated with calcium naphthenate. A single cylinder DI diesel engine and a thermobalance were used to determine the soot reduction and its mechanism for seven kinds of fuels. Experimental results showed that the catalytic effect of the fuel additive was different for the different fuels, and could be described by a parameter considering cetane number and kine- matic viscosity. The fuel additives reduced soot more effectively for fuels with higher cetane number and lower kinematic viscos- ity. This result was explained by soot oxidation characteristics for the different fuels. Oxidation of soot with the metallic additive proceeds in two stages: stage I, a very rapid oxidation stage; and stage II, a following slow or ordinary oxidation stage. The degree of soot oxidation in stage I increased with calcium additive con- tent, and was more remarkable for fuels with higher cetane num- ber and lower kinematic viscosity. 1991 SAE Transactions Section 4 910738. Variability in particle emission measurements in the heavy-duty transient test. David B. Kittelson, Dept. of Mech. Engrg., University of Minnesota ; and John H. Johnson , Dept. of Mech. Engrg. and Engrg. Mechanics , Michigan Technological Univ. A study of the sources of variability in particulate measure- ments using the heavy-duty transient test (40 CFR Subpart N) has been conducted. It consisted of several phases: a critical examination of the test procedures, visits to representative facili- ties to compare and contrast facility designs and test procedures, and development of a simplified model of the systems and proce- dures used for the heavy-duty transient test. Some of the sources of variability include; thermophoretic deposition of particulate matter onto walls of the sampling system followed by subsequent reentrainment in an unpredictable manner, the influence of dilu- tion and cooling upon the soluble organic fraction, inconsistency among laboratories in the engine and dynamometer control strat- egies, and errors in measurements of flows into and out of the sec- ondary dilution tunnel. The paper presents an examination of these and other sources of variability, gives recommendations for decreasing variability, and identifies critical research areas. Prin- cipal recommendations include: standardized engine and tunnel conditioning procedures, reduction of heat transfer during sam- pling and dilution, control of dilution ratio, tighter specification of the test cycle, and more accurate measurement of flows to and from the secondary dilution tunnel. Details of particle dynamics which were unimportant when particulate emission standards were greater than 0.1 gm/bhp-hr must be re-examined. 1991 SAE Transactions Section 3 910739. Effects of EGR with a supplemental manifold water injection to control exhaust emissions from heavy-duty diesel powered vehicles. Matsuo Odaka, Noriyuki Koike , Yujiro Tsuka- motOy Kazuyuki Narusawa, and Koichi Yoshida , Traffic Safety and Nuisance Research Institute, Ministry of Transport. Combined system with EGR and manifold water injection was developed for trial to control exhaust NOx emissions from heavy-duty diesel powered vehicles and its effects were experi- mentally studied under not only steady-state but also actual driv- ing conditions including transient. From the experimental analyses under steady-state condi- tions, it was recognized that higher NOx reduction may be possi- ble with this combined system compared with the use of each method alone under the same level of other pollutants. Then, several control conditions of the system were chosen and their effects to exhaust emissions were investigated under actual driving conditions, and consequently, about 50% of NOx reduction was recognized without significant increase of other pollutants by the combination of EGR at light and medium load regions and limited water injection at heavy load regions where accelerator opening is 70% or over. Any control condition of EGR and water injection did not deeply affect fuel consumption. 910740. Effects of cooling water temperature on particulate emissions from a small high speed DI diesel engine. Hideaki Tanabe, Sadayuki Nakagawa, and G. Takeshi Sato , Kanazawa Institute of Technology. Authors have experimented the effects of cooling water tem- perature on the particulate emission characteristics from a high speed DI diesel engines. A single cylinder small high speed DI diesel engine is operated under various engine and load conditions. Cooling water temper- ature is varied from 313 K (40°C) to 363 K (90°C). Particulate is collected using a single stage full size dilution tunnel. Dry soot and SOF emissions are measured, as well as total particulate. SOF increased when the cooling water temperature decreases, as well as HC increases. SOF also increases as load decreases. This suggests that the SOF emits at the cold starting and warming up periods. This also suggests that the SOF can be reduced by increasing cooling water temperature. 910741. Experimental survey of lubricant-film characteristics and oil consumption in a small diesel engine. Victor W. Wong and David P. Hoult, Sloan Automotive Lab., Massachusetts Institute of Technology. Parallel measurements of lubricant-film behavior and oil con- sumption in two identical small production IDI diesel engines are presented. Oil consumption was measured using tritium as a radioactive tracer, and instantaneous film thickness data between the piston and liner were obtained using laser fluorescence diag- nostics. The data covered single-and multi-grade lubricants and five different ring configurations (two piece versus three-piece rings at various ring tensions). The data illustrate 1) oil-film pro- files under the rings, especially around the leading and trailing edges; 2) accumulation of oil on piston lands and skirt; 3) circum- ferential variations around the bore; 4) observation on ring rota- tion; and 5) the piston-skirt oil-pumping mechanism. Effects of lubricants and piston-ring configurations on oil-film characteris- tics are investigated, and the oil consumption data are compared with oil-film thickness measurements. Radial tension appeared to have little effect on lubricant films on the piston lands for the two-piece oil-control rings; however, the effect was definitely present for the three-piece rings. The higher-tension ring allowed greater oil accumulation on the sec- ond land than the lower-tension ring at all speeds and operating conditions. Ring tension also affected little ring rotation rate, except for the three-piece rings, which appeared to require a threshold tension for rotation to occur. 100</page><page sequence="100">910741-910750 The crown land was virtually dry on all four strokes of the engine cycle, and thus does not appear to contribute directly to oil consumption. Measured oil consumption rates differ substan- tially from calculated lubricant flows up and down the piston liner. However, similar to earlier results obtained on a heavy- duty diesel engine, current results indicate that two separate loops of oil transport may exist on the piston: a major loop that passes through the oil-relief holes under the oil-control ring, and a minor one on the upper piston lands that may play an important role in oil consumption. 1991 SAE Transactions Section 4 910742. Direct observation of the friction reduction of multi- grade lubricants. David P. Hoult, Victor W. Wong, and James H . Azzola , Sloan Automotive Lab., Massachusetts Institute of Tech- nology. The oil film thickness distribution between the top ring and liner was observed using laser fluorescence (LF). Five different commercial lubricants, two single grades and three multigrades, were studied at two azimuthal, mid-stroke locations for five speed/load combinations in a small IDI diesel engine. Cavitation is never observed. The lubricant always separates tangent to the ring surface. The rheology of the oil flow under the ring is consis- tent with a non-Newtonian viscosity without elasticity. The dif- ference between lubricant type (single or multigrade) corresponds to differences in inlet and outlet conditions. Using an analytical model together with the measured oil distributions, calculations demonstrate a difference in friction between single and multi- grade lubricants. The multigrade lubricants have a lower friction coefficient, consistent with improvements in fuel economy reported in the literature. 1991 SAE Transactions Section 4 910743. A systems approach to oil comsumption. Stephen H. Hill and Steven J. Sytsma, Sealed Power Div., Sealed Power Tech- nologies Ltd. Partnership. Reduced vehicle oil consumption is desired to conserve petro- leum resources, lower vehicle operating cost, decrease exhaust hydrocarbon levels, increase catalyst life, and enhance the cus- tomer's preception of vehicle quality. To effectively accomplish this and provide optimum remedial measures, it is necessary to know the relative contribution of each of the three systems con- suming oil. The systems of interest are the power cylinder system, the engine overhead system, and the PCV system. Controlling factors and evaluation techniques are discussed for each system individually, and test results showing the relative contribution of each system are presented. 910745. Frictional performance test for transmission and drive train oils. Charles H. Rogers and Barry L. Post, Caterpillar Inc. Lubricating oil affects the performance of friction materials in transmission, steering and brake systems. The TO-2 test mea- sured friction retention characteristics of lubricating oils used with sintered bronze friction discs. This paper introduces a new friction performance test for drive train lubricants that will be used to support Caterpillar's new transmission and drive train fluid requirements, TO-4, which measures static and dynamic friction, wear, and energy capacity for six friction materials, and replaces the TO-2 test. The new test device to be introduced is an oil cooled, single-faced clutch in the Link Engineering Co. M1158 oil/friction test machine. 1991 SAE Transactions Section 4 910746. The use of the scanning Brookfield technique to study the critical degree of gelation of lubricants at low temperatures. Theodore W. Selby, Savant, Inc. Scanning Brookfield Technique (SBT) studies have provided the background for a new concept in rheological characterization of gelation in lubricating oils at lower temperatures. Using the typical SBT temperature/viscosity range, the concept requires calculation of the first derivative of the MacCoull/Walther/ Wright empirical equation. The derivative values show peaks at the temperatures at which gel formation begins and these peak heights, which are termed the gelation index, are shown to corre- late with valves of yield stress from the literature. They are also shown to correlate with the presence and severity of air-binding pumpability failure in the field and in the ASTM pumpability studies. In regard to the latter, the study shows that the Scanning Brookfield Technique seems to be the only widely used pumpa- bility technique to correctly predict air-binding engine response to oils which gelate below -22°C since it is the only ASTM method to impose the slow-cooling conditions necessary for gel formation below that temperature. 1991 SAE Transactions Section 4 910747. Effects of NO* and unburned gasoline on low temper- ature sludge formation in engine oil. Yasuhiro Murakami and Hisamoto Aihara, Nissan Motor Co., Ltd. It is generally known that NOx reacts with unburned gasoline, olefins in particular, to form sludge precursors. In this study, the authors investigated the process by which NOx and unburned gasoline mix into the engine oil and analyzed the mechanisms whereby stop and go driving accelerates sludge formation. It has been found that NOx detected in the engine oil as nitrite ions mixes into the oil in the crankcase. The NOx concentration in the engine oil increases rapidly when the crankcase gas temperature is nearly equal to the dew point of the water vapor in the crank- case. Unburned gasoline is mainly absorbed into the oil through the oil film on the cylinder walls and the oil in the ring grooves. During low-temperature engine operation in stop-go driving (i.e., when the vehicle is stopped), NOx and unburned gasoline are absorbed into the engine oil and, in high-temperature engine operation (i.e., when the vehicle is moving), NOx and unburned gasoline are released from the oil. NOx encounters unburned gas- oline in the combustion chamber during the compression stroke and also in the crankcase. It then reacts with olefins in the unburned gasoline to form sludge precursors. 910748. Investigations of lubricant sludge formation in the field: Development of an effective new fleet test technique. ScotE. J ay nes, Mary F. Salomon, Alan T. Riga, Ralph E. Kornbrekke, and Kirk E. Davis, Lubrizol Corp. A new field test procedure for evaluation of the sludge forma- tion tendencies of lubricants has been developed. The procedure has the benefits of short running time, reduced variability, and dramatic separation of API SF versus API SG oils. This paper discusses development of the operational procedure and evalua- tion of four lubricants, including commercial-type API SF and API SG oils as well as experimental future oils. Significantly improved sludge ratings were obtained with an experimental API SG oil. The sludge formation process was studied using infrared spec- troscopy, TAN, dielectric measurements, viscosity, quasielastic light scattering particle size, and transmission electron micros- copy techniques. These analyses show production of contami- nants which form insoluble particles that build up and precipitate out of supsension as sludge. Certain drain analyses can be used as tools for predicting field sludge deposition time. Finally, sludge formation in the field test and the ASTM Sequence VE engine test are compared. 1991 SAE Transactions Section 4 910750. Diesel deposit forming tendencies - Microanalysis methods. J. M. Perez, Patrick T. Pei, Y. Zhang, and Stephen M. Hsu, National Institute of Standards and Technology. Deposit forming tendencies of diesel lubricants are normally conducted using full scale engine tests. The use of bench tests to evaluate diesel lubricant deposit forming tendencies and two microanalysis methods, the "two-peak" pressurized DSC method 101</page><page sequence="101">910750-910760 developed at National Institute of Standards and Technology and the Penn State Thin Film Microoxidation test, are described in detail. Correlation of the two laboratory bench tests using con- ventional diesel lubricants and reference fluids are reported. Both methods can be utilized to evaluate diesel lubricants. The advan- tage of using the "two-peak method" to developing high tempera- ture liquid lubricants is demonstrated. 910752. Effect of load and other parameters on instantaneous frictional torque in reciprocating engines. Stanley L. Marek , Wayne State Univ.; Walter Bryzik, U.S. Army Tank; and Naeim A. Hen ein, Wayne State Univ. The effect of many operating parameters on the instantaneous frictional (IFT) torque was determined experimentally in a single cylinder diesel engine. The method used was the (p-o&gt;) method developed earlier at Wayne State University. The operating parameters were load, lubricating oil grade, oil, temperature and engine speed. Also IFT was determined under simulated motor- ing conditions, commonly used in engine friction measurements. The results showed that the motoring frictional torque does not represent that under firing conditions even under no load. The error reached 31.4% at full load. The integrated frictional torque over the whole cycle and the average frictional torque were deter- mined. A comparison of the average frictional torque under load was compared with the average motoring torque. 910753. What every modular framer should know about glass. Stephen P. Gerhardt, Glass Div., Ford Motor Co. This paper is an attempt to strengthen the glass/framer rela- tionship by disseminating glass information, vernacular and insight to the modular framer. The report contains a brief discus- sion of glass basics, but will mainly focus on the glass characteris- tics of size, sag, thickness, glass tempering, edge quality, off-form, rate-of-change and appearance. Each glass property or character- istic will be described and/or defined and an indication of how that property specifically affects or impacts the modular framer. Discussions will be limited to tempered glass. 1991 SAE Transactions Section 5 910754. CAPS: A new generation in window encapsulation. Gary W. Tray lor, Charles E. Ash, and Neil J. Crateau, Libbey Owens Ford. A novel approach for imparting weather stability to encapsu- lated glass parts is discussed in this paper. This system (CPS) was developed to meet customer demands for cost and quality improvements. The manufacture of encapsulated parts using CAPS is dis- cussed. Also, the tests completed to insure that CAPS meets the demanding scrutiny of the automotive community are outlined. Tests include accelerated weathering, real time weathering, physi- cal properties, adhesion and atmospheric cycling to demonstrate that this process is capable of withstanding the rigorous world of transportation. Conclusions reached from the discussion include: 1) CAPS provides a high-quality encapsulated glass assembly; 2) this sys- tem offers excellent cost reduction opportunities; 3) it is ideally suited for parts requiring single-sided decorating; and 4) CAPS provides distinction through color and texture. 910755. Characterization of in-mold coatings on RIM encap- sulated modular windows. Raj K. Agrawal, Kerry L. Fox, and Niall R. Lyn am, Donnelly Corp. In-mold coating (IMC) is used to provide protection against ultraviolet (UV) degradation of reaction injection molded (RIM) polyurethane encapsulated modular windows. IMC is a cost- effective method of producing weatherable RIM encapsulated windows. Coating thickness along with intrinsic UV absorbance plays an important role in providing the needed protection from UV degradation. The effectiveness of various thicknesses of in- mold coatings was measured using a spectrophotometer. The thickness of the in-mold coatings was measured using a scanning electron microscope (SEM). Experiments were conducted to determine the desired coating thickness for the IMC process. A statistical analysis was performed on the coating thickness of in- mold coated windows produced under experimental conditions in order to determine the process capability to provide the desired coating thickness. This data was used to establish a lower limit on mean thickness to enable statistical process control. 910756. Recent developments in bonding RIM urethane auto- motive modular glass. Stephen A. Westley, Chemical Products Div., Lord Corp. Automotive modular glass is expected to show exceptionally strong growth in the next five years. The benefits of modular ver- sus conventionally produced windows have been proven and documented in the literature. Key to the growth and success of the modular window, is the availability of a primer which will bond the urethane gasket to the glass in a cost effective manner resulting in a durable seal for the life of the window. In order to expand the state of the art for window encapsula- tion, this paper will provide new technical data relating to the effect of the variables experienced in the bonding process on adhesion and environmental resistance. A new primer for encap- sulation offering both improved in-plant process quality control and superior failure analysis testing will be announced. The marketing aspect will briefly examine market share and growth and its impact on modular glass. 1 991 SAE Transactions Section 5 910758. Application of RIM urethane to one side of glass for automotive windows. Louis R. Csokasy and Peter J. Kubizne, Excel Industries, Inc. A product has been developed which uses the application of RIM urethane to one side of automotive glass. This is accom- plished by the use of silane coupling agents which form a chemi- cal bond between the glass and urethane. An analysis of bond stability and durability was performed. Long term environmental tests were completed along with shear tests and a finite element analysis to measure the bond strength between glass and urethane. This process will allow the manufac- ture of automotive window modules which can be assembled eas- ily in a vehicle and be perfectly flush to the exterior sheet metal. 1991 SAE Transactions Section 5 910759. Developments in modular windows for automotive applications. Raj K. Agrawal, Anoop Agrawal, and Jack Thomas, Donnelly Corp. Modular assemblies are now widely used in the automotive industry. This concept involves supply of modules or integrated subsystems to the automobile manufacturers. A growing portion of rear quarter windows, windshields and backlites are supplied as modules which can be directly attached to the body sheet metal of an automobile. The conventional window gasketing technique of gluing an extruded elastomer to glass can no longer meet design needs for improved aerodynamics and better styling. In the mod- ular approach, all the components required for fit and function of the window are supplied to the OEM manufacturer as an inte- grated pre-assembly suitable for direct installation at the automo- tive production line. These components typically include the glass, the elastomeric encapsulant necessary for sealing, tracks for sliding windows, and associated trim such as bezels, division bars, stud mounts, etc. This paper briefly describes differences between the conventional and the modular approach, and out- lines current trends and practices in modular technology. Materi- als and processes are reviewed and future developments dis- cussed. 910760. Advanes in one-component in-mold coating technol- ogy. Jeffrey Laikind, Titan Finishes Corp. 102</page><page sequence="102">910760-910769 An advanced single-component in-mold coating has been developed for use in RIM encapsulated windows. The coating offers excellent protection from weathering with superior pro- cessing characteristics. 910761. Window encapsulation with internal mold release RIM polyurethane. Thomas N. Thompson and Brian R. Sud- daby, Mobay Corp. In 1982 the introduction of internal mold release systems rev- olutionized the reaction injection molding (RIM) polyurethane fascia industry. IMR technology significantly reduced the fre- quency of spraying external mold release agents, making substan- tial increases in productivity possible. This technological gain has been industry proven and well documented. IMR technology can benefit the molding efficiency for RIM window encapsulation by reducing the need for spraying external mold release and by reducing the mold cleaning time. The unique requirements for manufacturing modular automotive windows mandated that the standard IMR systems, used for fascia, were not suitable for this application. New IMR systems were devel- oped which improved storage stability and flow ab i lity, while pro- viding excellent releasability, physical properties, adhesion, and processing. This paper details the selection criteria for an IMR system for window encapsulation, as well as test results for the commercial system, MP-10,000 IMR. 910762. Galvannealed sheet steel with Fe-P flash electro- coating for exposed automobiles. Mö/ißbw Ohori, Kazuaki Kyono, Makoto Isobe, Akira Y asuda, Koichi Hashiguchi, and Koji Yam ato, Kawasaki Steel Corp. The effects of Fe-P flash electro-coating on several properties of galvannealed sheet steel with coating of 60 g/m2 were investi- gated to apply galvannealed sheet steel not only to inner panels but also to exposed panels. The allowable range of Fe content in galvannealed coating for anti-powdering property is from 7 wt% to 9.5 wt%. However, this range of FE content gives higher coeffi- cient of friction for the galvannealed sheet steel against die due to the existence of soft phase, £, at surface. The amount of Zn peeling off by flaking increases with the decrease in Fe content below 10 wt% in the case of no lubrication. Fe-P flash electro- coating of galvannealed sheet steel is effective to decrease the coefficient of friction and the amount of Zn peeling off by flaking, and does not influence the anti-powdering property. Fe-P coating also improves drastically the properties of phosphatability and anti-cratering in cathodic electrodeposition, which are generally very poor in galvannealed sheet steel. On these knowledge, the Fe-P flash electro-coated galvannealed sheet steel with the excel- lent coating adhesion, superior frictional property, phosphata- bility, anti-cratering and cosmetic corrosion resistance has been produced and successfully applied to the exposed panels of the automobiles. 1991 SAE Transactions Section 5 910763. Evaluation of anti-cratering properties of precoated steel sheets using current-time profile and mechnism of cathodic electrocoat primer cratering. Takahiro Kubota and Masaaki Yamashita, NKK Corp. A new method of evaluating the anti-cratering properties of precoated steels has been developed which detects minute differ- ences among materials. The anti-cratering properties of pre- coated steel sheets are evaluated by measuring the variation of current with electro-deposition time (current-time profile) at the initial stage of cathodic electrocoat deposition. Although some current peaks were observed in the current-time profiles, the slight differences of anti-cratering properties in precoated steel sheets were able to be evaluated by measuring the last current peak height. In the case of cratering at high applied voltage, the peak height of the last current peak was high and the variation of the current was vigorous. On the other hand, when few craters were generated, the last current peak height was low. Furthermore, our results were: variation in resistance which is calculated by means of measured current and voltage from the relation "V=IR", optical microscopic study of uncured film in the course of electrodeposition, and no electric discharges occur- rence in the case of cratering. These results led to the conclusion that electro-deposited films are ruptured by local hydrogen gas generation and these defects cause cratering. 910764. Effect of organic film on press-formability of organic composite coated steel sheet. Taketoshi Taira and Yoshio Sindou, Kimitsu R&amp;D Lab., Nippon Steel Corp. Organic composite coated steel sheet, consisting of Zn-Ni elec- tro-plated layer and the organic film with a thickness of about 1 lim, has been developed to provide excellent press-formability and weldability as well as corrosion resistance required for auto- mobile panels. In this paper, we describe the results of studies on the relation- ship between the composition of the organic film and press- formability of organic composite coated steel sheet. The results are as follows: 1) drawability of organic composite coated steel sheet is improved to the level similar to Zn-Ni elec- tro-plated steel sheet, because the organic film cotaining lubri- cants can reduce the frictional resistance at drawbead; and 2) the powdering of Zn-Ni layer occurred in press forming can be decreased by the organic film with lubricants. Organic composite coated steel sheet with the organic film containing lubricants has excellent drawability similar to Zn-Ni electro-plated steel sheet and can decrease powdering in press forming. 910765. Effects of forming conditions on exfoliation of galvan- nealed steel sheet. M. Urai and J. Iwaya, Kakogawa Works Kobe Steel, Ltd.; M. Arimura, Kokogawa Works Kobe Steel, Ltd.; and H. Sakai and M. Miyahara, Kakogawa Works Kobe Steel, Ltd. The exfoliation behavior of heavy coat galvannealed steel sheet was investigated by an actual press forming of the front fender. With the increase in coating weight from 45g/m2 to 60g/m2, the exfoliation changed from powdery to flakey (flaking) in the bead-slided portion. The flaking phenomenon was repro- duced experimentally due to sliding at high speed press forming under high normal pressure (high ironing ratio, small bead radius, and high bead height). Flaking resistance of Fe-Zn electro- plated galvannealed steel sheet was also studied. The effect of Fe-Zn electro-plating changed depending on the various forming mode. 910766. Actual development situtation concerning waterborne OEM-coatings. Dieter Engel, Herberts GmbH. As part of a fu tu re -oriented development concept for OEM- automotive paints, aqueous paints are a corner-stone of the prod- uct range. Herberts, a company of the Hoechst group, recognized the trend toward environmentally oriented systems early on and is today one of the pioneers of this advanced paint technology. Thanks to its wide resin basis, the company has been able to regis- ter patents for all types of aqueous coatings. 910769. Development coating systems for stainless steel and stainless steel clad aluminum automotive trim. Curt Horvath, General Motors Corp.; and Gardner H ay nes, Texas Instruments Inc. Stainless steel and stainless steel clad aluminum (bimetal) have been used for bright exterior trim for many years. The need to manufacture bright or colored trim with the same tools has led to the development of various coating systems to color stainless steel or bimetal trim. This paper describes the mechanisms of coatings disbondment that can occur on trim. Accelerated tests for determining disbondment resistance are described and the 103</page><page sequence="103">910769-910776 results from these tests for a wide range of coatings are presented. Coating systems that are acceptable for stainless steel and stain- less steel clad aluminum are identified. 910770. (SP-865) From stamping engineering to an alternative computer-assisted environment. Medhat Karima, Forming Tech- nologies Inc. The time and cost to introduce new quality products are emerging as major competitive factors in the world automotive market. The industry will need to achieve substantial improve- ment, if metal stampings are to be introduced within the time frames being established by major international companies. There will need to be significant advancement in the technology of designing and tooling metal stampings. At present limitation is the lack of predictability in the actual forming operations of metal stampings. To achieve predictable results, without extensive development and trial and error, requires that the present "ART" of tooling development be trans- formed to an experience-enhanced science based technology. This suggests that an alternative system is required. The alterna- tive system would utilize computer aided analysis tools. While much work has been done to develop such systems, to date there has been little acceptance by the industry. This is because of the lack of a clear fit between computer simulation aids and the flow of the stamping engineering tasks. This paper describes the implementation of an alternative sys- tem being developed by Forming Technologies Incorporated on behalf of a consortium of Canadian steel producers and metal stampers. The system is called FTICASE (FTI computer aided stamping engineering). The FTICASE environment is based on the requirements pre- viously identified by researchers in the field, and mimics the functional task flow in the practitioners' environment. The envi- ronment provides a tool kit of computer programs, based on a classification system for non-exposed panels. The system design is open ended, and while not yet complete, the framework, and infrastructure of the system is basically in place. Some examples of tools of the FTICASE system are shown in this paper. 910771. (SP-865) Sheet metal pressings - The integration of finite element analysis within the design process. T. J. Keer and R. M. V. Sturt, Ove Arup and Partners. The ability to simulate the stamping process at an early stage in the product design cycle brings benefits to the designer of sheet metal components. Numerical simulation using the finite ele- ment technqiue allows problems to be identified and isolated before expensive tools are cut. Manufacturing process simulation is not yet used on a routine basis by the designer at the CAD sta- tion, but this paper attempts to show that simulation techniques have reached a level at which they can be used with confidence by the design engineer. 1991 SAE Transactions Section 5 910772. (SP-865) Square punch forming: Section analysis and bending study. Chuantao Wang , Dept. of Industrial Systems and Engrg., Ohio State Univ.; and R. H. Wagoner, Dept. of Materials Science and Engrg., Ohio State Univ. Square punch/open die experiments were conducted to study the stretch forming of full-width blanks and plane strain strips. In order to measure bending effects, strains on both surfaces of the sheets were measured for three punch profile radii, using cir- cle grids with 1.27 mm diameter. Two rigid-viscoplastic finite ele- ment programs, SHEET-S and SHEET-3, were used to predict plane-strain and 3-D strain distributions. The numerical results were compared with experimental data and good agreement was observed. It was found that the section analysis approach may be valid for a wide range of applications not strictly meeting the plane strain conditions, such as the biaxial stretch case. The bend- ing effect is studied and a geometrical correction of the mem- brane FEM predictions, through t/2r, was introduced. The mem- brane section analysis program agreed well with measurements for r/t (radius of curvature/sheet thickness) values greater than 3 and when compound curvature was not present. For scan lines over corners with compound curvatures, 3-D membrane FEM was found to be more suitable than the section analysis. 1991 SAE Transactions Section 5 910773. (SP-865) Use of a mixed shell element for efficient modeling of sheet metal forming. T. Y. P. Chang, A. F. Saleeb, and J. Yuan, Dept. of Civil Engrg., University of Akron. A mixed shell element is utilized to model the sheet metal forming process. The shell element is capable of representing both bending and membrane actions of the sheet. To model the interface effect, a generalized contact/friction formulation is derived on the basis of a perturbed Lagrangian variational princi- ple together with a classical Couloumb friction law. Two numeri- cal examples are presented to illustrate the application of the pro- posed formulation. 910774. (SP-865) Plane strain deep drawing: Finite element modeling and measurements. Chuantao Wang, Dept. of Industrial Systems and Engrg., Ohio State Univ.; and R. H. Wagoner, Dept. of Materials Science and Engrg., Ohio State Univ. Plane strain, deep drawing experiments were performed to obtain precise strain information for comparison with membrane section-analysis finite element modeling (FEM) results obtained using a FEM program, SHEET-S. Strains on both outer and inner specimen surfaces and draw-in displacements were carefully measured at various punch heights, for varying blank holder loads, and for three square-punch edge radii representing r/t ratio (radius/sheet thickness) of 3, 6, and 9. SHEET-S, a rigid- viscoplastic section analysis finite element program, for plane strain stretching and deep drawing with general tooling shape, has developed and tested by plane strain deep drawing of strips. Sim- ulations and experiments are in good agreement for the large r/t ratios, but deteriorate for r/t - 3, especially for low blank holder loads. Bending and unbending at these locations appear to domi- nate the deformation modes, casuing significant differences from the strains predicted by the membrane FEM. A simple bending modification of membrane FEM results was necessary and intro- duced through t/2R correction, which gave good prediction of peak surface strains in cases of r/t ratio large than 6. 910775. (SP-865) Applications of a two-dimensional metal forming analysis tool to production stamping problems. Alan Brooks and R. Jhita, BOC-FAD ; and C. M. Ni, General Motors Research Labs. In any new car program many factors influence lead time and associated cost. One of these factors is die tryout. To reduce time and expense the BOC Flint Automotive Division is complement- ing this function with simulation methods. Changes in geometry, bead height, material properties, etc., can be evaluated more quickly at a lower cost using this analytical approach. In most cases failure occurs in highly localized areas of the die. Quite often a plane strain or axisymmetric assumption can be made along a critical die contour. In these cases a two- dimensional analysis can be used to determine the strains included by the forming operation. The objective of this paper is to demonstrate the successful application of these two- dimensional metaiforming techniques within the Flint Automo- tive Division. These applications also illustrate the ability of this technology to bridge gaps between die engineering and design concerns while abetting simultaneous engineering. 1991 SAE Transactions Section 5 910776. (SP-865) Modeling of die tryout. M. P. Sklad, McMaster Univ.; J. F. Siekirk, General Motors Corp.; C. B. Har- ris, Engineering Systems Consultants; and D. J. Grieshaber, Gen- eral Motors Corp. 104</page><page sequence="104">910776-910783 This paper presents recent progress in the development of computer software for die tryout simulation in industrial sheet metal forming processes. Outlined are the limits of material for- mability within which any sheet metal stamping must perform, as well as a sequence of steps involved in the prelimiary evalua- tion of forming severity based on a computer model of the form- ing process. 910777. (SP-865) On a geometric based mechanistic program for tooling contact analysis of stampings. Sheng-Dong Liu and Medhat Karima, Forming Technologies Inc. It is a well known industry fact, that the geometry of material in contact with tooling, is a major factor which affects its forma- bility. A collary to this is that many problems can be identified and solved using geometry based mechanics approaches. Because of the simplicity in modeling, and hence speed of processing, the geometric based tooling contact techniques are gaining more and more acceptance as tools for product, process, and tooling design of automotive stampings. The paper describes the implementation of a stretch/draw for- mulation of tooling contact, in two dimensions. The formulation is based on a belt friction assumption, with special elements developed to deal with thickness distribution around the contact area. The program tracks the change in the location of the neutral point at every forming step. The program is designed to handle multi-tooling as well as multi-stage forming operations. 910778. (SP-865) Auto FLD - Using microsoft excel macros to aid in tool development and tryouts. Carl J. Risch, Armco Steel Co., L.P. By use of a microsoft excel macro, auto FLD generates FLD (forming limit diagrams). There are many options available to customize the charts. FLD charts may be calculated on either metric or english units of measure for thickness. Since the loca- tion of the FLDo point is a function of both thickness and n val- ues for printing charts of various values of thickness and n valve the user may select a range of thicknesses and n values. Normal FLD charts may be printed or a series of iso-thickness strain lines can be added to the FLD charts. Analyzed strain grid points can also be plotted with references and identity noted on chart. These options may be selected in any combination. For engineers who are responsible for following tool development trials, a material data sheet generator is also included. Used in combination with the FLD charts the material data sheet would allow the material used at each tool show to be fully characterized. The entire system would be very useful to any engineer involved in formability analysis and tool development. 910780. (SP-860) Mini-van headliner-based air distribution system. Manohar R. Kulkarni and Thomas R. Worsham, John- son Controls, Inc. Production of vehicles incorporating supply of conditioned air only in the front makes it difficult for the rear and middle passen- gers to achieve thermal comfort. This discomfort is only likely to increase as the mini-vans are extended in future models. A pro- posed solution consists of utilizing a new headliner technology to fabricate air distribution channels directly in the headliner thus eliminating need for any blow molded ductwork. As a part of the integrated headliner project, flow information was developed for air distribution through headliner and also a method of determin- ing its distribution effectiveness. Details of the work are described in this paper. 910781. (SP-860) Design and application of thermoplastic adhesive films for headliner composites. Richard H. Brandon, Michael J. Kocsis, Mark T. Stewart, and Daniel G. Pikula, Dow Chemical Co. The construction of most automotive interior headliners requires an adhesive material to bond polyurethane foam-backed fabric to a molded headliner shell. More than ten years ago, the Dow Chemical Company qualified and began supplying a ther- moplastic adhesive polymer film for headliner applications which replaced wet adhesive systems at several fabricators. DAF 899 adhesive film has gained acceptance in the industry due to excellent performance, convenience, and cost effectiveness with- out additional waste handling or volatile organic emission con- cerns. Recent advancements in headliner design such as additional recessed areas with more demanding contours, new substrate materials and the desire for more efficient operations created an opportunity to design improved adhesive films to meet the emerging industry demands. A dvelopment program was initi- ated to determine the key film properties to maximize adhesion at reduced molding cycles with deep contoured parts while main- taining the desired performance properties at elevated tempera- tures. The research program resulted in the development of a multilayer, multicomponent thermoplastic adhesive film which exhibited excellent deep draw characteristics and significantly reduced molding cycle times. Both adhesive films may be pre- applied to foam-backed fabric to further improve fabrication effi- ciency. The paper will discuss the design procedures used to develop a new adhesive film system, headliner adhesive requirements, and review pertinent results from fabrication trials. Adhesive film performance on various headliner substrates and processes and recommended process parameters will also be reviewed. 1991 SAE Transactions Section 5 910782. (SP-860) Health aspects of glass fiber based products used in the automotive industry. John G. Hadley, Owens-Corning Fiberglas. Glass fibers have found widespread application in the auto- motive industry from soundproofing to insulations to reinforce- ments used in composite body parts. Recent concerns have been raised regarding potential health effects associated with the use of glass fiber products. This paper will review briefly the exten- sive research conducted over the last fifty years regarding the safety of glass fibers. It presents data on fiber exposures during the use and fabrication of glass fiber containing products, dis- cusses the differences between glass fibers and asbestos, and reviews the results from experimental animal studies, and studies of workers who manufacture glass fibers. 910783. (SP-860) Development of high strength substrate for use in modular headliner systems. A M. Bedford and T. R. Wil- shaw, John Cotton Ltd. Objective to develop a headliner substrate of particularly high strength which would meet the future demands of modular head- liner system construction. Research approach was to use readily available, low cost raw materials with known capability and enhance the material prop- erties through applied research. From the investigation emerged two significant material enhancements, one of which was polyphenolic oxide foams and the second being glass reinforced felts. This paper details the GRF results. Despite felt having a low cost material base, with good sound absorption properties, it has lost ground to more sophisticated laminates due to poor environmental stability, high weights and poor strength to weight ratios. The development of "glass reinforced felts" was aimed at resolving these deficiencies. Glass fibres have a well proven dimensional stability but hitherto have been difficult to "blend" through tradition carding/lapping/airlay process systems. Such methods of combining fibres generate atmospheric contamina- tion which in turn created operator difficulties in health and safety problems. The research program evaluated alternative pro- cess methods and devised a laminating technique which over- came all of these inherent difficulties. 105</page><page sequence="105">910783-910794 Bonding of glass and cotton felt fibres was evaluated using numerous liquid or powder resin/adhesive options. The paper details the bonding formulation and physical characteristics obtained from the new GRF material. A design requirement of the manufacturing process was to produce a variety of different headliner products simultaneously from a continuous raw material feed system. This design complication was resolved through mathematical grouping to achieve the best cutting pattern from continuous roll feed materials. The machine layout was configured to divert selected group sizes to the appropriate molding station using a series of transpor- tation conveyors and transfer tables. The paper details the pro- cess. The paper concludes by summarising the physical properties achieved and shows design concept examples of pre-assembled headliner systems ready to be "clip mounted" at the car plant trackside. 910784. (SP-860) Powdered adhesives and processing for headliner applications. Art Simmons and George Elliot, Astech- nologies, Inc. The increasing demand for a reduction in the use of environ- mentally hazardous materials combined with the need to gain a competitive advantage in productivity, has prompted many com- panies involved in the processing of soft trim components to con- sider thermoplastic adhesives as an alternative to other adhesives which are environmentally unsafe and require long cycle times to process. This paper examines the selection, application, and processing methods of thermoplastic adhesives in powder form and will pro- vide information which may be used in possible new applica- tions. 910785. (SP-860) Headliner systems-functional design param- eters for vehicle performance. James P. Shedlowsky, General Motors Corp. In the design of headliner systems for modern cars and trucks, there is frequently a lack in understanding of the primary func- tional contributions to vehicle interior noise control (and more recently to enhanced secondary roof structure). These contribu- tions may be very significant and are primarily determined by design and material parameters. It is, therefore, imperative that vehicle design and development engineers have a clear under- standing of these technical performance issues and the design and material parameters that affect them. 1991 SAE Transactions Section 5 910787. (SP-860) Thermoplastic polyurethane headliners: Properties, processing and European market. Werner Wagner, J. H. Benecke AG. Prefabricated headliners are now completely accepted in Europe and have almost fully substituted conventional suspen- sion headliners. This success in the European marked did, how- ever, take some time. The headliner versions developed in the USA and Japan pro- vided guidelines for the European development. The initial reason for using prefabricated headliners came from the assembly line. It was necessary to make it easier for workers to fit the headliner into the car. But there was a second important argument which still applies: cost reduction. The cost reduction argument became the pet of all who had developed a prefabricated headliner. This is ultimately the reason why in the early days of the changeover to the new system only very cheap solutions were ever discussed. This demand has since remained the most impor- tant challenge for all innovative steps. 910788. Digital sample-rate converts. Sangil Park, Digital Sig- nal Processing Operations, Motorola Inc. This paper discusses a real-time implementation of a sampling rate conversion technique between two arbitrary chosen sam- pling rates. In particular, a method to generate fractionally sam- pled data from discrete-domain (integer) data samples is ana- lyzed and implemented on the Motorola DSP56001 (24-bit digi- tal signal processor). This real-time implementation can be accomplished with a DSP56001 and 5k of data memory. As an example, the conversion from 44.1 kHz (compact disc sampling rate) to 48 kHz (digital audio tape sampling rate) is discussed. The assembly code for the main routine and the filtering method to generate interpolated samples are included. 1991 SAE Transactions Section 6 910789. Acoustic-echo canceller for full-duplex hands-free mobile phone. Sangil Park, Digital Signal Processing Operations, Motorola Inc. This paper discusses a real-time implementation of an adap- tive acoustic echo canceller for a hands-free cellular (mobile) phone operating inside a car. A 512-tap adaptive-finite-impulse- response (AFIR) filter, which is the implementation of the adap- tive least-mean-square (LMS) algorithm with tapped -delay-line (TDL) structure, is utilized for the acoustic echo canceller. A sim- ple double-talk detection algorithm and the normalized conver- gence parameter for the LMS algorithm are discussed and imple- mented on the DSP56001, which is also used as a host processor for the DSP5 6200s, A/D and D/A converters. DSP56001 assem- bly codes are included as well as experimental results and the schematic diagram for the hardware implementation. 1991 SAE Transactions Section 6 910792. Break through car audio with DSP. Atsushi Matsuda, Akira Shinada, and Keiji Morise, Mobile Electronics Group, Sony Corp. The authors have designed digital audio signal processing cir- cuitry having the following features for high fidelity sound repro- duction. The digital audio signal processing circuitry is suitable for car audio equipment: digital parametric equalizer for better fre- quency response; sound field controller for creating spatial impressions; linear phase digital crossover network; and time alignment controller for adjusting the phase difference which is caused by the distance difference of listener and loudspeakers. It is difficult to produce practical circuit incorporating the above features using analog signal processing circuits. The authors have designed circuits having these features using digital signal processing. 910793. New generation D/A converter and its automotive applications. Takashi Tokuyama, Alpine Electronics, Inc. Even though eight years have elapsed since the CD player was first introduced to the audio market, the analog-versus-digital controversy continues unabated, with proponents of each camp firmly entrenched in their beliefs. FEDAC (fluency DAC) is a digital-to-analog converter employing a new interpolation function which was developed based on studies done by Professor Toraichi and his team at Tsukuba University. As a D/A converter in CD players and other digital audio sources, the FEDAC has been highly acclaimed for its capability to reproduce musical presence, depth, and ambi- ence with vivid realism. The following describes the operating principle of the FEDAC. The cost and size reductions using digital processing technology are also described. 910794. CAP: A new CMOS car radio processor. Dieter Bacher, ITT Intermetall. The car radio of the future will be based on digital signal pro- cessing techniques. The CAP is one step in this direction. This single chip CMOS device handles all the features and the audio processing that turn a radio into a car radio by means of DSP 106</page><page sequence="106">910794-910803 algorithms. Most of the functions are programmable. This is the chance for the car radio manufacturer to realize his own ideas using standard hardware. The purpose of this paper is to give a brief insight into the major building blocks of this new chip. 910795. Digital signal processor for car audio application. Akira Yazawa, Takashi Nakamoto, and Minoru īgu chi, System Engrg. Dept., Consumer LSI Div., NEC Corp.; and Mitsuhiro Koyanagi, Consumer Digital LSI Engrg. Dept., NEC IC Micro- computer Systems, Ltd. A digital signal processor (DSP) for audio application, espe- cially for surround processing, has been developed. This LSI can control external delay RAM, which accumulates audio data to be delayed for surround processing. In order to reproduce surround sound faithfully, long delay time and high speed delay RAM access are necessary. Large external delay RAM space such as 2M bit and various address management operations are available. Minimum read access time 244ns and write access time 366ns are realized to simulate maximum to 85 reflected sounds. 910796. Unique power supply for automotive audio power amplifier. Robert E. Klacza, SGS Thomson Microelectronics. The pursuit of high performance sound systems demands increased power. Traditional approaches include bridge mode amplifiers and dc to dc step-up converters to achieve higher power outputs. Bridge mode amplifiers are now widely used. Cost, efficiency, and reliability are factors limiting the application of step-up converters. An integrated monolithic approach can overcome these limitations. Theoretically, this topology could yield an output in excess of one hundred and fifty watts into a four ohm load. 910797. Pop noise in automotive audio systems - Causes and cures. Alex Popovic, SGS Thomson Microelectronics. The audible "pop" sounding noise heard at the loudspeaker when a radio and/or amplifier module is switched on/off has become generically known as "pop-noise". This phenomenon has become a particularly sensitive issue in recent years especially to the "big three" in their drive to acquire true high fidelity sound- ing systems in the demanding automotive environment. The causes and cures are very well understood by power audio I.C. designers and producers and involve a close integration between optimization of IC design and final system implementation. This paper serves to explain these causes and what has been done to reach a satisfactory and acceptable cure. 1991 SAE Transactions Section 6 910798. RDS modules, ICs and system concepts for European car radios. H iro hide M iwa and Yoshio Taniguchi, Tokyo Cosmos Electric Co. Ltd.; and Hisao Iwamura, Nichimen Electronics R&amp;D Corp. Tuning to a frequency in conventional radio has changed con- ceptually to tuning to a network or program type in the radio data system (RDS), where fast, error-free switching to the best alter- nate frequency (AF) should be done as transparently as possible. The exact bit reception rate with relation to multipath interfer- ence becomes more important than the conventional S/N or RF sensitivity for the subcarrier filter and demodulator, where the dynamic behavior of multipaths must be considered. In addition to bit error correction, data error correction must be made by comparison with recursively transmitted data. Quick switching to the best or a good enough AF is done by collecting precise data during good reception and storing it ready for use in a data processor in addition to the conventional DTS processor. 910799. (SP-854) Thermal compensating tapered roller bear- ing for enhancement of transmission and transaxle performance. Ronald P. Dickerhoff, Harold E. Hill, and Gary E. Kreider, Tim- ken Co. Automotive transmissions and transaxles use aluminum housings for weight reduction and tapered roller bearings for increased reliability. The initial bearing setting is obtained by using selective shims to account for tolerance variations of the transmission or transaxle components. Aluminum transmission and transaxle housings have a coeffi- cient of thermal expansion approximately twice that of steel shafts and bearings. This difference results in a change to the ini- tial bearing setting, as temperatures vary. For a direct bearing mounting arrangement (cup adjusted), the bearing setting becomes looser as the operating temperature increases, and tighter as the temperature decreases. Improved operating bearing setting is achieved through the use of a thermal compensating bearing. This bearing incorporates an elastomeric ring in the outer race, or cup, which responds to temperature variations and maintains a close bearing setting range for improved bearing and transmission/transaxle perfor- mance. This paper describes the principles of a thermal compen- sating bearing and also provides test results illustrating the advantage of reducing transmission and transaxle shift force. 1991 SAE Transactions Section 6 910800.

Ken-ichi Abe and Tsuguo Kondoh, Toyota Central Research and Development Labs., Inc.; and Kagenori Fukumura and Masahiro Koj im a, Toyota Motor Corp. This paper describes a simulation study of the internal fluid flow of a torque converter. The study was conducted by using the steady-interaction technique to connect the boundaries between neighboring elements. This technique averages the flow variables in the circumferential direction on the connecting boundary sur- faces. A comparison of computational results with experimental data gives an estimate of the accuracy in predicting torque con- verter performance with this method. 910801. (SP-854) A study on the lubricating oil flow in the automatic transmission. Masahiro Kojima and Kagenori Fuku- mura, Toyota Motor Corp.; and Hideki Yasue, Toyota Technical Center L.A. The durability of an automatic transmission is greatly affected by its lubrication properties. However, it is difficult to estimate exactly the flow rate of lubricating oil at each part of the auto- matic transmission, because of its structural complexity under rotating conditions. This paper presents a simple model which can estimate the flow rate of lubricating oil in the automatic transmission. Using this method, we can obtain various informa- tion about the lubricating state at every part of the automatic transmission and can help our judgement of whether lubrication is sufficient. To test this model and its results, we tried some experiments and examined the lubricating state by measuring discharge rate of oil. The estimated data is in good agreement with the experimental data. This study should assist in the opti- mal design of the lubricating system in the automatic transmis- sion. 910803.

The study of energy losses in disengaged wet clutches is impor- tant to efforts to maximize the efficiency of automatic transmis- sions. This paper describes a simple, accurate method of investi- gating clutch drag using the SAE #2 machine. By recording coast down speed versus time with known inertia, average and instan- taneous torques can be calculated. Bearing and component losses can also be identified by running empty and partially built clutches. Many individual variables can be studied under labora- 107</page><page sequence="107">910803-910809 tory controlled conditions. Friction plate geometry, surface fin- ish, groove design, and plate flatness are evaluated at various levels of pack clearance, oil flow, oil level, and temperature. The influence of clutch speed on the magnitude of power loss is also shown. Results are analyzed to demonstrate the relative contribu- tion of each factor. Conclusions are drawn to maximize effective- ness of effort to reduce power loss. 1991 SAE Transactions Section 6 910804. (SP-854) The effect of groove pattern of paper friction plate on its life. Hajime Ohnuma, R&amp;D Dept., Daikin R/M Co., Ltd.; and Koji Kato, Dept. of Mech. Engrg., Tohoku Univ. In order to understand the effect of groove pattern of paper friction plate on its life, a three-step study was done. In the first step, the effect of friction surface temperature on the life of paper friction plate is evaluated. For this test, pressure and rotational speed was held constant, while durability tests were carried out in which the friction surface temperatures were independently changed by forced heating or cooling. Results showed that a critical value of the surface temperature exists above which the thickness change of friction paper increases rap- idly, and a surface temperature rise causes surface damage and a decay of the dynamic friction coefficient. In the second step, friction surface temperatures for three groove patterns were directly measured and differences in cooling effectiveness according to the groove pattern was observed. In the third step, the life of friction plates grooved in the same three pat- terns used in step two was investigated. This study concludes that a reduction of friction surface tem- perature for long life paper friction plate is improved by the design of an appropriate groove pattern. 1991 SAE Transactions Section 6 910805. (SP-854) Temperature compensation with thermovari- able rate springs in automatic transmissions. Dieter Stoeckel, Raychem Corp.; and Friedo Tinschert, Mercedes-Benz AG. The shifting comfort of automatic transmissions of diesel engines at low temperatures can be substantially improved by using springs with temperature dependent rates in the control valves. These springs utilize the shape memory effect of Ni-Ti alloys. They provide a simple and economic way to control both shifting pressure and shifting time. The Mercedes-Benz auto- matic transmission uses two different springs with thermovari- able rate (TVR) in the shifting pressure system to adapt the pres- sure in the switching elements to the lower torque of cold diesel engines. One spring is used in the shifting pressure control valve and one in the accumulator system. 1991 SAE Transactions Section 6 910806. (SP-854) Development of a rotary tri-blade coupling for four-wheel drive cars. Satoshi Ashida and Yukihiro Tanigawa, Toyota Motor Corp.; Hiroaki Asano and Masaji Yamamoto, Toyoda Machine Works, Ltd.; and Yoshio Kojima and Kazunori Yoshida, Toyota Central Research and Development Labs., Inc. A new type of torque transmit coupling has recently been developed for 4WD cars, that provides a better match to ABS, is of lighter weight, and uses a simpler operating mechanism. This coupling transmits torque with a multi-disc clutch that is engaged by the pressure of high viscosity silicone oil. The rotary blade gen- erates variably the silicone oil pressure, according to both differ- ential speed and direction of rotation between the front and rear wheels. This coupling provides a good match between 4WD perfor- mance and four wheel anti-lock braking system (ABS) by a modi- fication of the rotary blade shape. No additional devices are needed. This paper describes the characteristics of this coupling and the in-vehicle performance. 1 991 SAE Transactions Section 6 910807. (SP-852) Opportunities for frontal crash protection at speeds greater than 35 mph. Kennerly H. Digges, University of Virginia; and John B. Morns, National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, U.S. Dept. of Transportation. The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration has sponsored extensive research to improve the frontal protection of motor vehicles. Most of the research was conducted during the 1970's when belt usage rates were less than 10%. At that time, the research objectives did not anticipate the combination of air bags and three point manual belts as the restraint of choice for the 1990's. Consequently, little research was undertaken to extend the performance of this combination. However, the research con- ducted at that time offers opportunities for significant additional improvements in frontal protection. The purpose of this paper is to summarize some of the relevant research which was sponsored by NHTSA under the direction of the authors. Results will be highlighted which are particularly applicable to current vehicle configurations. Opportunities for further improvement, and required research are discussed. The IVHS program now under- way at the Department of Transportation offers a mechanism for achieving significant improvements in occupant protection. The ability to tailor occupant protection to occupant size and age, and vehicle crash configuration and severity are all potential benefits of "intelligent vehicle" technology. The resulting technology, could offer crash protection to a larger segment of the population and at crash severities well above 35 mph. 1991 SAE Transactions Section 6 910808. (SP-852) Are tank pressure curves sufficient to dis- criminate airbag inflators. J. T. Wang, Engrg. Mechanics Dept., General Motors Research Labs. The validity of the current practice of using tank pressure curves to discriminate airbag inflators is evaluated. Sled test results of two inflators, which have similar tank pressure curves, are first compared. Significant differences in airbag performance have been observed which suggests that the two inflators are not similar. The gas dynamics of airbag inflation are then reviewed to develop theories to explain the phenomenon. The dual- pressure method, which was previously developed for modeling airbag inflators, is found to be useful in this analysis. The analysis clearly shows that the inequality is due to the difference in gas temperature among inflators. We find that the higher the gas tem- perature the faster the gas venting and leaking will be. This is why different airbag performance is obtained from inflators which have similar tank pressure curves. Based on both theoretical and experimental evidence, we conclude that knowing the tank pres- sure curve alone is insufficient to determine the capability of an inflator for both driver and passenger airbag systems, as long as vents and/or leaks exist in the systems. The inability to discrimi- nate among inflators early in the design, could lead to late changes in the design of the restraint system when the actual per- formance of the airbag is measured during sled or barrier tests. Finally, four new methods to discriminate inflators are discussed. 1991 SAE Transactions Section 6 910809. (SP-852) Development of a collapse mode control method for side members in vehicle collisions. Yuichi Kitagawa and Ichiro Hagiwara, Vehicle Research Lab., Central Engrg. Labs., Nissan Motor Co., Ltd.; and Masaaki Tsuda , Product Development Systems Dept., Nissan Motor Co. Ltd. Side members are provided with beads that promote more effective absorption of crash energy in vehicle frontal collisions. In this work, finite element analysis was used to investigate a method of calculating the most effective beading position. First, it was found that an inelastic buckling mode as a numerical imperfection makes it possible to analyze the collapse behavior of beaded members. Second, a new method was developed for calculating the most effective beading position along the buckling mode of side members. When a side member is provided with beads according to this method, it collapses axially, enabling it to 108</page><page sequence="108">910809-910815 absorb crash energy more efficiently. It was also found that the buckling mode used as a numerical imperfection for determining the placement of beads should be calculated at the peak point of the load curve. 1991 SAE Transactions Section 6 910810. (SP-852) Collection of properties, development of input sets and modeling for simulation of unrestrained drivers of light trucks and vans in frontal collisions. Osvaldo Fessahaie, Information Systems and Services, Inc.; John Guglielmi, Dept. of Transportation, Transportation Systems Center; Donald Crane, Calspan Corp.; and Lee Stucki, National Highway Traffic Safety Administration. This paper presents an analytical evaluation of unrestrained drivers of light trucks, vans, and multi-purpose vehicles (LTV's) in frontal crashes. Of particular interest was modeling of impact with the steering assembly. The baseline condition was simulated and steering assembly improvements introduced to project esti- mates of benefits from these countermeasures. Compartment and steering assembly properties were collected for 15 LTV's representing the current LTV population. Com- puter model input sets were developed for simulating unre- strained driver frontal impacts with the steering assembly. The Passenger and driver simulation (PADS) model was employed for the simulations. The baseline 15 LTV "fleet" was modeled in different frontal crash situations and compared to accident statis- tics. Countermeausres were introduced and estimates of benefits projected. This study focused on unrestrained occupants, however, safety belt usage is increasing and the National Hightway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) is continuing to monitor acci- dents to assess causes of injuries to restrained and unrestrained occupants. 910811. (SP-852) Lower extremity injuries in frontal crashes: Injuries, locations, AIS and contacts. Donald F. Huelke, Charles P. Compton, and Timothy W. Compton, University of Michigan Transportation Research Institute. Frontal crashes (11-1 o'clock) were reviewed from the National Accident Severity Study file (NASS) for years 1980-87. Adult drivers and front right passengers, with lower extremity injuries of the pelvis, thigh, knee, leg or ankle/foot were reviewed. Analysis of age differences, injury contacts, and effectiveness of the 3-point restraint system were studied. Unrestrained drivers have a higher frequency of knee injuries than passengers, fewer leg injuries than passengers and both have the same frequency of ankle/foot injuries. Older unbelted drivers have more injuries to the pelvis, leg, and ankle/foot region than do young drivers. Pas- sengers have more leg injuries. The instrument panel is the major contact for most of the lower extremity injuries. Lap/shoulder belts significantly reduce lower extremity injury frequency. 910812. (SP-852) Hybrid III sternal deflection associated with thoracic injury severities of occupants restrained with force- limiting shoulder belts. Harold J. Mertz, General Motors Corp.; John Horsch, Biomedical Science Dept., General Motors Research Labs.; Gerald Horn, General Motors Corp.; and Richard W. Lowne, Transport and Road Research Lab. A relationship between the risk of significant thoracic injury (AIS ^ 3) and hybrid III dummy sternal deflection for shoulder belt loading is developed. This relationship is based on an analy- sis of the Association Peugeot-Renault accident data of 386 occu- pants who were restrained by three-point belt systems that used a shoulder belt with a force-limiting element. For 342 of these occupants, the magnitude of the shoulder belt force could be esti- mated with various degrees of certainty from the amount of force-limiting band ripping. Hyge sled tests were conducted with a hybrid III dummy to reproduce the various degrees of band tearing. The resulting hybrid III sternal deflections were corre- lated to the frequencies of AIS ^ 3 thoracic injury observed for similar band tearing in the field accident data. This analysis indi- cates that for shoulder belt loading a hybrid III sternal deflection of 50 mm corresponds to a 40 to 50% risk of an AIS ^ 3 thoracic injury. 1991 SAE Transactions Section 6 910813. (SP-852) An advanced database of the 50th percentile hybrid III dummy. M. Philippens, J. J. Nieboer, and J. Wismans, TNO Road-Vehicles Research Institute. This paper presents a measurement program of a sitting 50th percentile hybrid III dummy to determine a database for com- puter simulations. Geometrical, inertial, joint property and sur- face compliance measurements have been carried out. A descrip- tion of the measuring methodology is given. On the basis of these measurements a 20 segment database for the MADYMO 3D occupant simulation program is developed. The major advancements of this database compared to an earlier 15-segment database developed by TNO can be summarized as follows: five additional segments are incorporated in this data- base to account for the hands, the shoulders (clavicles) and the sternum; the database includes a complete omni-directional description for the neck as well as the lumbar spine; a detailed mathematical surface description is available, for instance to be used for computer animations; segment ellipsoids for contact interactions have been determined in a more accurate way; joint properties are determined with a special developed static joint measuring device; and segment surface and thoracic stiffness data are based on a large series of tests with different impactor faces, including tests with a seat belt. 910814. (SP-852) Application of a pedestrian impact model to the determination of impact speed. Denis P. Wood, Wood and Associates. A single segment pedestrian model is used to derive the throw distance -impact speed equations for the vehicle to pedestrian impact. Comparison with staged tests for adult pedestrians and cars shows that the model yields similar head contact positions and head impact velocities as those obtained experimentally. It is shown that the standard distance/velocity equation can be used to describe the pedestrian throw distance to vehicle impact speed relationship when an 'impact factor' term is introduced to specify the proportion of impact speed effectively transferred to the pedestrian by the impact process. The calculated throw distance and 'impact factor' to impact speed relations for 9 different car types are compared with the results of 84 staged dummy and cadaver tests. Statistically very highly significant correlation between the calculated and experimental 'impact factors' is obtained. The potential of using the difference between the pedes- trian and vehicle rest positions to determine impact speed is examined and very highly significant correlation is obtained between experimental and calculated data. General correlations are also derived. 910815. The internationalization of domestic U.S. auto pro- duction. David J. Andrea and Michael S. Flynn, University of Michigan Transportation Research Institute. Product life cycle theory suggests that there are four major stages in the international movement of production, markets, technology, and capital: market and product dominance by one country; export dominance by that country as world markets develop; development of multiple world markets and production sites; and, finally, a loss of dominance by that one single produc- ing country. Many would argue that the U.S. automotive industry is now in the fourth stage of the product life cycle. World eco- nomic development, combined with product and process tech- nology transfer, has produced effective competitors to the once dominant U.S. producers. These competitors challenge the Big Three through exports and/or U.S. production. Japanese and 109</page><page sequence="109">910815-910822 European auto manufacturers' and suppliers' investment in U.S. production capacity has created serious problems, as well as opportunities, for the traditional U.S. auto industry. Using primary research performed at the Office for the Study of Automotive Transportation and secondary sources, this paper outlines some of the major business strategy, labor, and political issues facing Japanese and U.S. automotive industry manage- ment as automotive investment is transferred to various world regions. 1991 SAE Transactions Section 5 910816. Nissan's new production system: intelligent body assembly system. Yoshitada Selcine, Shinji Koyama, and Hide- toshi Imazu , Nissan Motor Co., Ltd. Car makers are working hard today to shorten development and production lead times through the use of flexibile manufac- turing systems (FMSs) to meet diversified and individualzied customer requirements. To achieve this goal, Nissan has been developing many kinds of new technologies and systems such as: 1) the intelligent body assembly system for body assembly pro- cesses; 2) a press die stamping simulation method and unified database for press die manufacturing; 3) a robot and facility teaching system using CAD data; and 4) an automated assembly line for trim and chassis assembly operations. These new FMS methods have been implemented in many manufacturing areas, including the stamping shop, body assembly shop, painting shop, and trim and chassis shop. This paper focuses mainly on the intelligent body assembly system as a typical example of the new production systems and technologies being developed at Nissan. 1 991 SAE Transactions Section 5 910817. A new CAD/CAM system for the car design process. Hideo Yaginuma, Toshio Yamashita, and Takashi Uchida, Nis- san Motor Co., Ltd.; Toshiaki Mase, Body Design Dept., Nissan Motor Co., Ltd.; and Noriyoshi Kasai, and Kazuo Osada, Product Development Systems Dept., Nissan Motor Co., Ltd. Sophisticated product designs enrich people's lives and social demands for creation of good designs are quite strong. In the automobile industry, good design quality is one of the principal factors for determining market competitiveness. In this stuation where good design quality is required of every product, the authors have developed a CAD/CAM system which makes it pos- sible to create good and accurate designs by translating designers' ideas directly and quickly into high quality CAD models, a capa- bility that has long been desired. With this high performance sys- tem, freely formed curves and surfaces can be easily manipulated with a man-machine interface familiar to industrial designers accutomed to the conventional design process. The system also integrates photo-realistic rendering, stereography and NC milling machines for verifying differences between the realized shape and the image in the designer's mind. As a result, this system enables designers to create shapes without any interruption. This system contributes to simultaneous engineering because it can change the whole development process into a data-oriented operation by providing high quality geometric data from the early design stage. 1991 SAE Transactions Section 5 910819. Analysis aided design. Babak Famili, Applied Struc- tural Analysis, Inc. The purpose of this paper is to present the application of the finite element analysis, design sensitivity analysis, and optimiza- tion techniques at the system level to improve the design process and enhance the performance of various automotive systems. A systematic approach for the design of more efficient systems is established. It reduces the time and effort needed in the design process as well as the number of tests required for product verifi- cation. The procedure has been applied to the chassis, instrument panel, and other automotive systems, as a result, improving their performance significantly. 910820. (SP-857) Variable curvature headlamp reflector para- metric analysis. Gerald A. Erickson, Paul J. Allen, and Richard G. Tuck, Optical Profile, Inc. Homofocal reflectors are an approach to improving headlamp performance by creating sectionalized reflector surfaces that dis- tribute light rays in desired directions. As the sections become infinitely small, these reflectors may approach continuous, vari- able radius of curvature (VRC) surfaces. Using new reflector design software and the field (Tm) photometric analysis program, a range of variable curvature reflector surfaces have been evalu- ated. Aperture and filament position effects on photometric per- formance with a 9004 halogen bulb are described and the ability of this type of reflector to satisfy Federal automotive roadway illumination requirements with non-optically active covers is dis- cussed. 1991 SAE Transactions Section 6 910821. (SP-865) Reaction times to high-contrast brake lamps. Michael Sivak, Michael Flannagan, and Andrew W. Gellatly, University of Michigan Transportation Research Institute. High-contrast brake lamps are lamps that appear black or body color when they are not energized. In addition to stylistic advantages, there may be some behavioral benefits from using high-contrast brake lamps, such as a reduction in driver reaction times to brake signals during high levels of ambient illumination. There are two possible mechanisms for such an effect. The first mechanism is based on the increased brightness difference between the off and on states. The second mechanism involves the increased color difference between the two states. While the standard brake lamp goes from darker red to brighter red, the high-contrast lamp appears to change from black or body color to red. The present study was designed to evaluate the potential reac- tion-time benefits of high-contrast brake lamps. The study, per- formed in a laboratory, simulated a daytime driving condition with illumination from the sun being reflected by the lenses of the brake lamps. The subject's task was to respond as quickly as pos- sible to the onset of one of two brake lamps (a standard lamp and a high-contrast lamp of the same luminous intensity) in the near visual periphery, while engaged in a central tracking task. The results showed that reaction times were shorter to the high-contrast lamp than to the standard lamp. The difference in reaction time was highly significant statistically, but not large. On average, this difference was 19 msec, which corresponds to a sav- ing of 0.5 m of stopping distance from an initial speed of 100 km/hr. This finding indicates that high-contrast brake lamps might have a positive effect on the performance of following driv- ers. 1 991 SAE Transactions Section 6 910822. (SP-857) Rearward vision, driver confidence, and dis- comfort glare using an electrochromic rea rvi e w mirror. Michael Flannagan, Michael Sivak, and Andrew W. Gellatly, University of Michigan Transportation Research Institute. Electrochromic rearview mirrors can provide continuous levels of reflectivity and unobtrusive, automatic control. The availability of this technology has increased the importance of understanding how to select the best level of reflectivity for a given set of lighting conditions. For night driving with glare from following headlights, the best reflectivity level will always depend on a tradeoff among several variables. This study was designed to help clarify what variables are important and how they should be quantified. Twenty subjects, 10 younger and 10 older, performed a num- ber of visual tasks while viewing stimuli through an electro- chromic rearview mirror. Subjects were seated in an automobile mockup in a laboratory, and the reflectivity level of the mirror was changed before each of a series of discrete trials. On each trial, subjects saw reflected in the mirror a visualacuity stimulus and a glare source of varying intensity. They performed three 110</page><page sequence="110">910822-910832 tasks: 1) judgement of the location of a gap in the acuity stimulus; 2) rating of their subjective confidence in the gap judgement; and 3) rating of the discomfort they experienced from the glare source. Results showed that: 1) visual performance decreased with decreasing reflectivity approximately as a linear function of log reflectivity; 2) subjects' confidence consistently underestimated their actual performance but otherwise accurately reflected the effect of reflectivity on performance; and 3) the effect of reflectiv- ity on discomfort glare is not fully predicted by its effect on illu- mination at the subject's eye point. Implications of these findings for mirror design include: 1) the continuous reflectivity control provided by electrochromic mir- rors should be of value in achieving optimal tradeoffs in the pres- ence of glare; and 2) at least for discrimination tasks, even though changes in reflectivity are automatic and subtle, subjects recog- nize the resulting changes in seeing ability. 1991 SAE Transactions Section 6 910823. (SP-857) Definition of the cut-off in a dipped beam pattern. Robert Rendu , U. T.A.C. Aiming of dipped-beam headlamp is currently performed visually in Europe, using the cut-off line in the beam pattern. A good definition of a visual cut-off would allow uniformity in interpretations. This paper is a survey of studies on that question in Europe and the basis of proposition for such a definition at CIE level. 910824. (SP-857) Development of very thin rear combination lamp. Kouichi Masuyama , Stanley Electric Co ., Ltd. We have developed a thin type rear combination lamp com- prising a parabolic cylindrical reflector and a fresnel lens with lin- ear lens cut (hereafter linear fresnel lens). Currently available rear combination lamps are either reflec- tor or inner lens type. The reflector type uses the paraboloid of revolution reflector, and the inner lens type employs a fresnel lens. In both types, the filament of bulb is placed at the focus of the paraboloid or fresnel lens. An inner lens type rear combination lamp can be thinner by employing a fresnel lens of a shorter focal length. This is the rea- son why most of the lamps classified as the thin type are inner lens type. However, the inner lens type has an inherent shortcoming that "with a shorter focal length, difference of brightness at the lamp center and the periphery is increased". For this reason, efforts for the design of a thinner lamp have their limit. We have developed a rear combination lamp in which a cylin- drical parabolic reflector is combined with a linear fresnel lens in order to reduce the luminance difference at the center and the periphery, and whose thickness is about one-half that of the inner lens type rear combination lamp. We report the principle, struc- ture, and photometric performance of the lamp developed. 1991 SAE Transactions Section 6 910825. (SP-857) Valeo: Complex surface reflector technology foglamp application. Jean-Paul Ravier ; Guy Dorleans, and Alain Levilain, VALEO. A fog light is a device that is greatly appreciated by profes- sional drivers and also by those who must often drive through very humid areas, especially during winter months. Water drop- lets stay suspended in the air, acting as multiple segmented mir- rors, which reflects light coming from the headlights in every direction. This gives an impression of a wall of light to the unfor- tunate driver when not using his fog lights. The three characteristics of a good quality fog light are: 1) the width which enables the driver to see guard rails and curbs even on winding roads; 2) absence of vertically displaced light, thus no reflection toward the driver's eye; and 3) the homogeneity and bright illumination on the road. 910827. (SP-857) Computer simulation of light distributions for headlamp systems. Rainer Neumann and Henning Hogrefe , Automotive Lighting , Robert Bosch Corp. In the last years, motor vehicle lighting systems were required to be more efficient, to have shorter development times and to be of higher quality. One important tool used in complying with these demands is the computer calculation of the optical charac- teristics of the complete headlamp system. A newly developed software package is presented in this paper which permits the configuration of a headlamp in its basic optical components and the quantitative calculation of its light distribution, luminous flux and other optical quantities. It is now possible for the first time, to assess a headlamp's total light pattern in advance, with- out hardware (e.g. model headlamps etc.) being required. The simulation results show a high degree of concurrence between the computed and the measured light distributions. This will be demonstrated in detail using concrete examples. 910828. (SP-857) Development of smoothly curved reflector for headlamps. Takao Watanabe and Hiroshi Kaw a shim a, Koito Manufacturing Co., Ltd. This report describes the development of a reflector which uses a new type of curved reflective surface, in order to provide superior illumination within the design restrictions of today's slim, streamlined headlamps. 910829. (SP-857) Beam controllable headlighting system. S hoj i Kobayashi and Michihiko Hayakawa, Koito Manufacturing Co., Ltd. These headlighting systems control the headlamp beams according to the running state of a vehicle at night in order to pro- vide optimal illumination. The have two functions: to control the range of illumination according to vehicle speed and to control beam direction in response to the steering. Two optical systems were developed to realize these functions. One system uses two movable mirrors in each headlamp, while the other system uses a movable lens installed in front of the projector lamp. According to photometric data analysis done in our laboratory, both systems improve visibility on curved roads substantially. It was also found that they are effective in limiting glare projected onto oncoming vehicles. 1 991 SAE Transactions Section 6 910830. Properties of squeeze cast, magnesium-based compos- ites. S. Guldberg, H. Westengen, and D. L. Albright, Norsk Hydro Magnesium Div. The present paper deals with the pressure infiltration of short fiber preforms by molten magnesium alloys. Saffil aluminum oxide fibers and AZ91 and AS41 matrix alloys were the materials selected for the composites. The mechanical and physical proper- ties of the composites were measured. Significant changes from the matrix alloy properties were noted, indicating that consider- able improvements in the performance of cast, commercial mag- nesium alloys can be achieved by short fiber reinforcement of this type. The experience gained in the study demonstrates that exploitation of the technology depends upon the availability of high quality preforms and control of the thermal conditions dur- ing casting. 1 991 SAE Transactions Section 5 910832.

Factors affecting the fatigue performance of metal matrix composites for diesel pistons. Martin R. Myers , Zollner Corp.; and Frank Chi, Carborundum Co. The mechanical properties of an aluminum silicon alloy rein- forced with ceramic fibers has been investigated as part of a much larger program to develop metal matrix composite pistons for diesel engine applications. Tensile and fatigue tests were carried out over a range of temperatures typical of those experienced dur- ing engine operation. The influence on the properties of non- fibrous extrinsic particles, which originate from the fiber manu- facturing process, are considered in detail. These data show that the tensile and fatigue characteristics are much improved over those of unreinforced materials at tempera- tures in the range of the maximum engine operating temperature. The presence of extrinsic defects has little effect on the tensile properties but causes a reduction in the fatigue life, which may be greater than one order of magnitude at a given load. From these data it is clear that tensile properties alone cannot be used to select such materials for use in fatigue critical applications, such as that described here, and that the fatigue characteristics must be carefully considered. The influence of these properties on the thermal fatigue characteristics of diesel pistons is then dis- cussed. 1991 SAE Transactions Section 5 910834. Cost-effective high performance P/M aluminum matrix composites for automotive applications. Warren H. Hunt, Jr., Celeste R. Cook, and Ralph R. Sawtell, Alcoa Innometalx. The improvements in elastic modulus, wear resistance, and control of physical properties provided by incorporating ceramic reinforcements into aluminum alloys provide new opportunities for lightweight automotive structures. In some applictions, how- ever, properties such as ductility and fatigue resistance are also important, requiring aluminum matrix composites designed spe- cifically to meet these needs. This paper will review the character- istics of SiC particle reinforced aluminum composites produced by powder metallurgy methods, with particular emphasis on how this processing approach can provide materials with unique com- binations of properties. Currently available products will be high- lighted along with a review of the state of commercial readiness and costs of these materials. 910835. Production process of metal matrix composite (MMC) engine block. Masuo Ebisawa and Takashige Hare, Honda Engi- neering Co., Ltd.; and Tadayoshi Hayashi and Hideaki Ushio, Honda R&amp;D Co., Ltd. The weight-saving requirement for automobiles has become more important since the surge in the environmental issues. Pre- viously, in order to produce a lighter engine, an aluminum block with cast-iron liners and a hypereutectic aluminum-silicon alloy block have been developed as alternatives to cast-iron blocks. In a new approach, we developed a new aluminum engine block which has the cylinder bore surface structure reinforced with short hybrid fibers of alumina and carbon, to achieve a fur- ther weight reduction. Our previous report, SAE 890557, dealt with the characteris- tics of the metal matrix composite (MMC), the MMC engine block's technical advantages and outlined the production tech- nology. The most important factor in the application of composite materials for mass-produced parts is the development of appro- priate technologies, which ensure stable quality and high produc- tion efficiency. As a supplement to the previous report, this paper describes new technologies adopted to each stage of the production process to achieve mass production of the MMC engine block. 1991 SAE Transactions Section 5 910836. (SP-863) Influence of catalytic converters on acoustics of exhaust systems for European cars. H. Weltens, H. Bressler, and P. Krause, Heinrich Gillet GmbH &amp; Co. KG. The design of the converter has a considerable influence on exhaust emissions as well as engine performance and exhaust acoustics. Converters have an effect not just on the tailpipe noise but also on surface sound radiation of the exhaust system. The contribution of tailpipe and surface to noise emission of exhaust systems is for high performance engines in many cases approxi- mately the same. The surface radiation affects not just the exte- rior noise of the vehicle but also the interior noise. The subjective noise as well as the objective noise is also influenced. Surface sound radiation therefore, becomes increasingly more significant. This contribution will present results about the influence of the shape of the monoliths and the effect of different monolith mounting systems. The influence of thermal insulation and main shell design is also shown. The surface sound radiation of ceramic monoliths and metallic supports will be compared. In addition, we shall also see the effect of a converter on the tailpipe noise. 1991 SAE Transactions Section 6 910837. (SP-863) Comparison of metal-supported catalysts with different cell geometries. Friedrich W. Kaiser, Prosche AG; and Stephan Pelters, Porsche AG. The present paper shows the catalytic behaviour of different metal supported catalysts in fresh and aged conditions. Based on the same substrate dimensions as in the Carrera 2/4 series con- verter, cell densities of 2oo, 3oo, and 4oo cpsi were compared. Additionally, two converter types with special foil structures were investigated which claim to create turbulence effects. Benefits in weight and pressure drop were found with decreas- ing cell density. These effects can be explained by the constant wall thickness which is independent of the cell density for metal supports. The catalytic performance after aging does not vary a lot as far as HC and CO are concerned. Regarding NOx, a disadvantage occurs with smaller cell numbers. This is also true for the turbu- lence variant with 2oo cpsi. The differences in light-off behaviour are discussed supported by data from so-called FTP double-split tests and additional modal analysis. 910838. (SP-863) Emission optimisation by camshaft profile switching. C. Dopson and T. Drake, Lotus Engineering. High engine efficiency and low emissions on spark ignition engines can be achieved with a new camshaft profile switching device. This enables the use of two camshaft profiles for inlet and exhaust that can be switched independent of each other by any engine management input. This paper proposes the use of this device to give an excellent torque curve together with reduced emissions, by selecting from two discrete inlet and exhaust camshaft profiles and timings against engine parameters such as speed, load and temperature. 910839. (SP-863) Determination of efficiency of exhaust gas catalyst by F.T.I.R. spectroscopy. D. Bianchi and J. L. Gass, Université Claude Bernard Lyon I; and C. Bouly and D. Maret, E.C.I. A. A laboratory scale analytical procedure is described to deter- mine the efficiency of three way exhaust gas catalysts (Pt/Rh/ monolith) by F.T.I.R. spectroscopy. An extruded part of monolith was used to convert synthetic gas mixtures (CO/NO/Hydrocarbons/C02/H20/N2) which have compositions similar to motor vehicle exhaust gases. The catalyst efficiency was determined as a function of gas temperature and equivalent air-fuel ratio (with and without perturbation). F.T.I.R. spectroscopy appears as an alternative method com- pared to the present one using several specific detectors. Compar- ative data are obtained on the conversion of CO, NO and hydro- carbons. In addition F.T.I.R. spectroscopy was capable of giving 112</page><page sequence="112">910839-910846 the following informations: the conversion of each hydrocarbons (in case of mixture of hydrocarbons), the transient formation of N2O and the occurence of NO2. Adapted softwares for F.T.I.R. microcomputers give conversion as a function of the temperature of the gas and equivalent air/fuel ratio. This analytical system is used to study the deactivation of three way catalysts by lead compounds. 910840. (SP-863) New potential exhaust gas aftertreatment technologies for "clean car" legislation. I. Gottberg, J. E. Ryd- quist, O. Backlund, and S. Wattman, Volvo Car Corp.; and W. Maus, R. Brück, and H. Swars, Emitec GmbH. This paper will discuss the potential for an advanced electri- cally heated start-up catalyst integrated with the main under-floor catalyst. This prototype includes a non-preheated, (that is, key-on heated) catalyst system. The potential of the system will be viewed against the problems of the introduction of a high-power- consumer to the vehicles. This presentation will concentrate on the many theoretical and technological problems that have to be overcome to make an EHC-systems possible, rather than to pres- ent complete emission results and technical solutions. It is, how- ever, shown that this technology may be one way to achieve the very low emission targets legislated in California for all pollutants in the exhaust gases, if the problems are successfully overcome. 1991 SAE Transactions Section 4 910842. Performance of palladium automotive catalysts. Hideaki Muraki, Toyota Motor Corp. Automotive exhaust catalyst applications usually use various precious metals. The strengths and weaknesses of the various pre- cious metal use strategies have been widely discussed. Recently, there is a great interest in the use of palladium because of cost, availability, and performance advantages under certain operating conditions relative to more expensive precious metals. The main reason why a Pd catalyst is not applied to three-way catalysts is the fact that under reducing conditions Pd has a poor NOx reduction capability becaue of the self-poisoning of hydro- carbon. We have found that NOx reduction activity is improved by both the periodic operation effect and the addition of lanthana to the Pd catalyst. This paper reviews the performance of Pd cata- lyst in both engine and simulated exhaust gases under reducing conditions. 1991 SAE Transactions Section 4 910843. Studies of the functioning of automotive exhaust cata- lysts using in-situ positron emission tomography. K. A. Vonke- man, G. Jonkers, and R. A. Van Santen, Koninkttjke/ Shell- Laboratorium. Studying the reactions in an automotive exhaust catalyst is complex as the exahust gases contain many components of which the composition constantly varies and the catalyst contains dif- ferent active components. To elucidate reatction kinetics in exhaust catalysis, the application of a technique stemming from nuclear medicine, i.e. positron emission tomography, has been developed. Short lived positron emitting nuclides UC (ti/2 = 20 min), 13N (ti/2 = 10 min) and 150 (ti/2 = 2 min) have been used to synthe- sise actual reactant molecules such as nCO, nC02, nCH4, 13N2, 1500, C150 and C1500. Pulses of picomole amounts of these labelled reactants have been added to synthetic exhaust gases, which were led over commercial and model automotive catalysts in a small plug flow reactor. The labelled compounds were detected and identified in both reactant and product stream using a gas Chromatograph equipped with a proportional counter. On top of that, the labelled reactants in the catalyst bed could be monitored right through the reactor wall using a positron emis- sion tomograph, with a resolution of 1 cm in place and 1 s in time. Hereby, a large amount of information on the residence time of the reactants is obtained directly from the catalyst surface under actual reaction conditions. By means of these experiments the rate limiting step in the car- bon monoxide oxidation on platinum and rhodium under cold start conditions of a car were found to be the availability of free noble metal surface for the dissociative oxygen adsorption. The different behaviour of rhodium and platinum in the CO oxida- tion in the presence of NO was found to be the higher tendency for NO dissociation of rhodium. A strong interaction was found between gas phase CO2 and Ce02 at the catalyst surface, whereby the oxygen atoms contained in lattice Ce02 exhange rapidly with the oxgyen atoms of the adsorbed CO2. A mathematical model for the reaction kinetics was constructed and by simulating the experiments with this model the kinetic parameters were quanti- fied. The experiments demonstrate the utility of short-lived posi- tron emitter nuclides such as UC, 13N and 150, for non-invasive and in-situ catalyst research. The importance of using in-situ cat- alyst surface information in understanding the working of auto- motive exhaust catalysts under actual reaction conditions is emphasised. 1991 SAE Transactions Section 4 910844. The impact of sulfur on three-way catalysts: Storage and removal. Donald D. Beck, Martin H. Krueger, and David R. Monroe, Physical Chemistry Dept., General Motors Research Labs. Pelleted and monolith three-way catalysts were treated in a laboratory reactor under conditions closely simulating automo- bile exhaust and then characterized using x-ray photoemission and temperature programmed desorption techniques to deter- mine relative amounts and oxidation states of sulfur stored by the catalyst. Sulfur originating as SO2 in the feed was stored on the support component of both catalysts in the form of adsorbed sul- fates and sulfites and on the noble metals in the form of elemental sulfur. The monolith catalyst stored a greater amount of sulfur and equilibrated more rapidly with the sulfur content in the feed than did the pelleted catalyst. Operation in a rich environment removes sulfur from the sup- port components, while operation in a lean environment removes sulfur from the noble metal surfaces. The behavior is consistent with the observation that sulfur inhibits three-way activity in a rich environment. Sulfur poisoning becomes less important at operating temperatures above 700°C. 1 991 SAE Transactions Section 4 910845. Operating temperature effects on catalyst perfor- mance and durability. Michael L. Church, J. E. Thoss, and L. D. Fizz, Catalytic Systems Div., Johnson Matthey. To meet more stringent emission standards, catalytic convert- ers have been moved closer to the engine where higher operating temperatures offer increased performance. For current platinum/ rhodium three-way catalyst formulations, the increase in perfor- mance more than compensates for the increase in thermal deacti- vation. The largest advantage is seen for cold-transient FTP per- formance for HC and CO. 910846. Thermal behavior of metallic TWC: Evaluation of the structural and performance properties. Matti A. Härkönen, Eero Aitta, Antti Lahti, Marjo Luoma, and Teuvo Maunula, Kemira Oy. The aim of this work was to combine different surface analyti- cal techniques to study the effect of thermal/hyrothermal aging on the surface microstructure and catalytic efficiency of the metallic Kemira three-way catalysts, which contained different stabilizers (Si, Zr, La, Ba and their mixtures) as additives. On commercial ceramic and one commercial metallic catalyst were also tested and analyzed as a comparison. In summary, it can be stated that the performance of catalysts cannot be predicted solely on the basis of some separate proper- ties i.e. BET area, noble metal dispersion or crystal sizes of the washcoat components. The results of different analyses (XRD, 113</page><page sequence="113">910846-910853 XPS, SEM/STEM and chemisorption) must be combined in order to fully understand the catalyst characteristics. However, the best performance was obtained with the samples with small crystals of both Pt and Ce02 dispersed in an amorphous alumina. At high aging temperatures, the crystal growth of all components takes place. The different stabilizers have different effects of each catalyst component. Their preferential sequence is presented in the following examination. 910847. Development of an infrared method for ignition delay measurements. Mariusz Ziejewski and Hans J. Goettler, Mech. Engrg. Dept., North Dakota State Univ.; and Dan G. Dimitriu , Mech. Engrg. Dept., North Dakato State Univ. The paper describes experimental validation of a laboratory flow apparatus used to measure the ignition delay times of diesel fuels at atmospheric pressure in near quiescent air. To validate the proposed method the experimental data were compared with the results from the studies performed on non-engine combustion chambers with continuous air flow at atmospheric pressure and various temperatures. The proposed flow apparatus, described in an earlier paper, has the means to provide air temperatures in the range between 650 and 730°C. An infrared radiation detector monitors the evo- lution of the temperature inside the combustion chamber. Igni- tion delay is measured as the time interval between the beginning of the needle lift and the beginning of increase in infrared radia- tion detected by the sensor. Six test fuels were used. Five were mixtures of n-hexadecane (cetane) and heptamethylnonane with cetane numbers of 100, 95, 90, 85, and 80, and one was #2 diesel fuel with a cetane number of 50. The comparison of the relation between the apparent activa- tion energies and cetane number determined using the infrared method in a flow apparatus at atmospheric pressure and the tests performed on engines at elevated pressure give similar trends but the magnitudes are different, as expected. With the help of the calibration curves obtained in this study, it is possible to deter- mine the actual or apparent cetane numbers of fuels from their infrared ignition delays (ID¡r). 910848. Performance, exhaust emissions and durability of modern diesel engines running on rapeseed oil. Norbert Hemm er - lein , Volker Körte, and Herwig Richter, Porsche R&amp;D Center; and Günter Schröder, Ministry of Research and Technology (BMFT). In 1990 the Ministry of Research and Technology in the FRG proposed a comprehensive concept to sponsor biotechnical and energetical use of agricultural materials. Within this concept vari- ous modern diesel engines have been investigated with respect to performance, fuel consumption, exhaust emissions and durabil- ity characteristics using neat (100%) rapeseed oil as fuel. Energy consumption and engine performance are similar to operation with diesel fuel, exhaust emissions are higher with rapeseed oil. Diesel engines with divided combustion chambers and big cylin- der units are suited for continuous operation with rapeseed oil. 1991 SAE Transactions Section 4 910849. Conversion of a diesel engine for gaseous fuel opera- tion at high compression ratio. Nicos Ladommatos and Richard Stone, Brunei Univ. A Waukesha VR 220 naturally aspirated diesel engine has been modified to operate with a high compression ratio fast-burn spark-igntion combustion system. Since the application of great- est interest is for combined heat and power (CHP), the majority of data have been obtained with the engine operating at full throt- tle and 1500 rpm. The philosophy of the open chamber combus- tion system design is described, and this includes a discussion on the selection of the compression ratio. Results are presented for the energy balance and the emissions, for a wide range of air fuel ratios. The experiments have been conducted with natural gas and natural gas/carbon dioxide mixtures (to simulate bio-gas). Comparisons are made with the baseline engine performance data, some of which has been published earlier. 1991 SAE Transactions Section 4 910850. Exhaust emissions of an ethanol DI spark-assisted diesel engine equipped with a catalytic converter. S. Niemi and E. U. Ubong, Lab. of I.C. Engines, Helsinki University of Technol- ogy. The influence of the number of nozzle holes, turbocharging and an oxidizing catalytic converter in an ethanol fueled spark- assisted diesel engine (SADE) is investigated. Emissions, brake thermal efficiency and other performance parameters are mea- sured and compared with the base-diesel model. The results show that a SADE equipped with a 7-hole injector nozzle and an oxi- dizing catalytic converter reduces HC and CO emissions drasti- cally at low load, and meets the ECE-49 exhaust emissions stan- dard. Additionally, the SADE exhibits superior brake thermal efficiency at high loads. The brake specific HC and CO emissions are superior to the base-diesel model and the engine operates on lean mixtures at all speeds and loads. 10851. Development and optimization of methanol fueled com- pression ignition engines for passenger cars and light duty trucks. Paul Zelenka, Paul Kapus, and Leo A. Mikulic, AVL List GmbH. The paper describes the development of methanol fueled engines for passenger cars and light duty trucks working both on the compression ignition and glow plug assisted ignition princi- ple. Special emphasis was laid on development and optimization of the combustion process for both the glow plug assisted and the compression ignition system, the application of the engine man- agement system and the development of the exhaust after- treatment under steady state conditions on the engine dynamom- eter. The transient engine development in the test car was carried out on chassis dynamometer and under road conditions. The glow plug assisted direct injection methanol engine was in addi- tion equipped with oxidation catalysts for this development pro- gram. Additionally, the main purpose of the DI-methanol engine development was to demonstrate the feasibility for its use as a powertrain for passenger cars and light duty trucks to achieve a high break thermal efficiency equal to the comparable diesel engine. The emission results show that with both engine types the achievement of US 1994 emission limits will be possible, includ- ing a very low aldehyde emission level. 1991 SAE Transactions Section 4 910852. (SP-867) Automotive interiors - Design for recyca- bility. Francesco Forcucci, Himont Advanced Materials Europe; and David Tompkins, Himont Design Center. New developments in polyolefin-based materials have created a family of polypropylene products with a wide range of physical properties, including the ability to be easily recycled. When uti- lized by automotive and product designers as part of a "design for disassembly" strategy, these compatible materials will yield large subassemblies than can be reclaimed with a minimum of handling. 910853. (SP-867) Plastics recycling beverage bottles and beyond. Wayne Pearson, Plastics Recycling Foundation. The Plastics Recycling Foundation was formed about five years ago by twenty companies concerned about the recycling of post-consumer plastics packaging. This consortium approached Rutgers University and asked them to assemble a critical mass of people, equipment, and space necessary to undertake research in this field. 114</page><page sequence="114">910853-910860 Accordingly the Center for Plastics Recycling Research was formed at Rutgers with a three year contract of $750,000 per year commitment from industry. Industry was the sole source of fund- ing at that point. This was before the barge and before the Nation understood that it had a major issue dealing with solid waste. 910854. (SP-867) Separation techniques for auto shredder resi- due. Patrick V. Bonsignore, Bassam J. J ody y and Edward Daniels, Argonne National Lab. Disposal of automobile shredder residue (ASR), remaining from the reclamation of steel from junked automobiles, promises to be an increasing environmental and economic concern. Argonne National Laboratory (ANL) is investigating alternative technology for recovering value from ASR while also, it is hoped, lessening landfill disposal concerns. Of the ASR total, some 20% by weight consists of plastics. Pre- liminary work at ANL is being directed toward developing a pro- tocol, both mechanical and chemical (solvent dissolution), to sep- arate and recover polyurethane foam and the major thermoplas- tic fraction from ASR. Feasibility has been demonstrated in labo- ratory-size equipment. 1991 SAE Transactions Section 2 910855. (P-242) On-line determination of available torque in internal combustion engines. Georg F. Mauer ; Dept. of Mech. Engrg., University of Nevade, Las Vegas. The flywheel speed is recorded during snap acceleration, while operating the engine without external load and at fully open throttle. A non-contacting magnetic sensor at the engine flywheel detects the instantaneous speed. A digital circuit, which includes a microprocessor, samples and processes the speed data. The speed increment observed over a fixed number of engine cycles is a measure of the engine torque. Since the instantaneous fly- wheel speed exhibits significant variations, the speed increment is determined on the basis of a linear regression analysis of the speed waveform. The approach was verified experimentally on eight-cyclinder diesel engines. The results from the snap accelera- tion analysis were found to be consistent with dynamometer measurements within mean relative error margins below four percent. 910856. (P-242) New types of magnetoelastic transducers for sensing force related parameters. Ivan J. Garshelis, Magnetoelas- tic Device, Inc. A different perspective from which to view the operation of magnetoelastic force transducers is described. Unlike the more conventional approach based on the alteration of B-H loop shape by a stress dependent permeability, this perspective starts with the separate examination of the processes by which stress and magnetic field affect magnetization. The purpose of applying magnetic fields is identified as a useful means to observe the inde- pendent effects of stress. A transducer of novel construction, con- ceptually derived by a straightforward application of this perspec- tive, is also described. The concept is supported by data obtained from experimental transducers employing permanent magnets and solid state field sensors in place of the conventional exciting currents and detection coils. The basic device can be readily con- figured as a transducer for axial, flexural or torsional loadings. The simplicity of the design encourages its use in the construction of small, low cost transducers for any force related parameter. 1991 SAE Transactions Section 6 910857. (P-242) Computer-model simulation results for three magnetostrictive torque sensor designs. William J. Fleming, Seat- belt Systems Research and Development, TRW Vehicle Safety Systems Inc. New expressions are given in the present paper for the output signals and input power requirements for the three principal torque sensor designs - the branch, cross, and solenoidal designs. Procedures are described for evaluating model parameters. The parameters are then used in computer-model simulations of the three sensor designs. Calculations are made for each sensor configured to fit into the same space on the same shaft. The shaft was made of either maraging steel or SAE 1010 steel - both of which have useful magnetostrictive properties. It is shown that for a fixed shaft length, for both shaft materi- als, largest signal level is obtained from the solenoidal sensor, fol- lowed by the branch sensor, and the cross sensor gives the smal- lest signal. On the other hand, the solenoidal sensor consumes the greatest amount of input power and requires the highest excita- tion voltage. Physical origins of this behavior are discussed in the paper. 1 991 SAE Transactions Section 6 910858. (P-242) Different methods of knock detection and knock control. Karl P. Schmillen, FEV Motorentechnik ; and Manfred Rechs, Institute for Applied Thermodynamics, Technical University of Aachen. SI engines are exposed to the risk of knocking combustion if the resistance of the fuel against self ignition is too low. Knocking combustion cycles can be detected by means of the vibration sig- nal energy calculated in a predetermined time window. Based on a continuous signal sampling during quasi-steady engine opera- tion an appropriate data processing technique has been devel- oped to identify the engine operation conditions which are sus- pected to disturb the knock detection. To increase knock detection reliability a new strategy has been developed; characteristic features are: wideband filtering of the structure vibration, window energy calculation of the signal, determination of the standard deviation of the energy values. A knock control simulation code has been written for the stan- dard deviation strategy. Knock control system calibration can be optimized by aid of this program very efficiently. 1991 SAE Transactions Section 3 910859. (SP-859) High temperature performance of RRIM polyurea body panels. Douglas P. White and Kenneth J. Rettman, Dow Chemical Co. Reinforced reaction injection molded (RRIM) polyurea body panel systems have been commercialized and are being used for front fender applications on production vehicles. While these panels are painted on-line, they currently bypass steel corrosion protection primer (E-coat) cure temperature environments rang- ing from 175°C to 200°C. High temperature stable polyurea RRIM systems have been developed and have been exposed to production plant environments including E-coat cure and on-line painting. The results have been favorable giving high painted sur- face quality and stable mechanical properties. This report expands the characterization of high modulus pol- yurea RRIM composites by documenting part dimensional change through high temperature exposure of the assembly pro- cess. Attachment methods to minimize dimensional change of polyurea RRIM body panels are also discussed. 910860. (SP-859) Reinforcement optimization in high tempera- ture polyurea body panel material. Ronald A. Cageao and John A. Tranquill, Mobay Corp. Polyurea RRIM offers a proven technology for proposed verti- cal body panel programs. Applications to this point in time have involved non-standard assembly procedures, but polyurea RRIM is a viable candiate for programs involving an "E-coat" or "ELPO" step. The selection of a reinforcement is crucial to the overall performance of the composite. Physical properties are specified by the particular program, and they can be achieved by the correct selection of reinforcement level and type. The greater emphasis that has recently been placed on surface quality can also be satisfied through the proper reinforcement selection. Lastly, the interaction of the polyurea RRIM composite with an environ- ment which leads to an absorption of moisture may be controlled 115</page><page sequence="115">910860-910869 by choosing a reinforcement that will allow a high diffusion rate and subsequently a higher maximum use temperature. 910861. Development of Mitsubishi flexible fuel vehicle. Muneyoshi Namba, Takanao Yokoyama , Kazumasa lida, and Katsuhiko Miyamoto , Mitsubishi Motors Corp. A flexible fuel vehicle (FFV) was evaluated through various tests for its potential as an alternative to the conventional gaso- line vehicle. This paper presents the systems incorporated in the FFV and the test results. 50,000 mile emission durability tests were also performed and the potential of the FFV as a "low emis- sion vehicle" was assessed. As the result of extensive engineering work, we sucessfully developed a Galant FFV which exhibits very good durability and reliability. The emission control system which we have devel- oped demonstrated that the vehicle has a good potential to com- ply with the California formaldehyde emission standard of 15 mg/mile. However, due to the large portion of unburnt methanol in the tail-pipe emissions, FFVs will have more difficulty than gaoline vehicles in meeting non-methane organic gas (NMOG) standards applicable to "low emission vehicles". 1991 SAE Transactions Section 4 910865. Cold Starts using M-85 (85% methanol): Coping with low fuel volatility and spark plug wetting. Cameron J. Dasch and Norman D . Brinkman , General Motors Research Labs.; and Dan- iel H. Hopper ; Delco Electronics Corp. Spark ignition engines are shown to have difficulty starting on high methanol-content fuels not only because of low fuel volatil- ity but also because of electrical shorting of the ignition by metha- nol on the spark plugs. Using a concerted approach in which the fuel and ignition systems are optimized for fuel methanol, we have cold started a 2.5L spark ignition engine with port fuel injec- tion down to -29°C on a 10.5 psi Reid vapor pressure M-85 (85% methanol, 15% gasoline). To minimize the amount of spark plug wetting, an exponential decay fuel algorithm is used which quickly generates flammable vapor mixtures while limiting the cylinder wetting. To overcome the spark plug wetting which does occur, ignition systems are used which have peak delivered cur- rents twice as high as present-day automotive inductive ignitions. 1991 SAE Transactions Section 4 910866. Influence of operating conditions on output, exhaust emission and combustion variation of low compression ratio meth- anol-injection engines. Sigenobu Hayashi and Yuzuru Kubota, Muroran Institute of Technology ; and Norihiro Sawa and Shuichi Kajitani, I baraki Univ. In this study, accordingly, methanol fuel was supplied in suc- tion pipe with carburetor and with electronically-controlled fuel injector (EFI), which located in front of the suction valve, to clear experimentally the influence of various factors, such as the meth- anol-gasoline ratio (M/F), the difference in fuel feed system, the number of times of injection [n¡], the injection timing (Oinj), the engine speed (N), the volumetric efficiency (iļv), the suction pipe wall temperature (tw), the water content in fuel (yw) etc., on the engine performance (the output and the thermal efficiency), the exhaust characteristics (NOx, CO, UBF and HCHO concentra- tions) and combustion variation as well as obtaining a guideline to establish the optimum condition. The authors will be reporting about the results of above- mentioned. 910867. Silicone adhesive/sealants in composite headlamp systems. Therese M. Bauman, Dow Corning Corp. The current trend toward more aerodynamic body designs in the automotive industry has given rise to composite headlamp systems, which represents a major change in the marketplace worldwide. These composite headlamps have greatly enhanced design flexibility, but they have also brought about a need for sealing materials that can withstand the elevated temperatures associated with the new, smaller designs being engineered in the U.S. Further, these materials must provide good long-term adhe- sion to a variety of substrates. Organic products currently in use for headlamp sealing appli- cations have limitations, particularly in their ability to resist high and low temperatures and provide good adhesion over the life- span of the vehicle. The majority of the headlamp systems in use today incorporate glass lenses and plastic reflectors; therefore, an engineering sealant used to adhere the components must be capa- ble of adhering well to both materials. In addition, the adhesive/ sealant must exhibit sufficient elastomeric properties to allow for the widely different thermal expansion rates of these substrates. The development of a family of silicone sealants for the Euro- pean market first satisfied the demands of this application, and since the passing of federal regulations permitting the introduc- tion of composite headlamps in the U.S., these materials are offering several advantages to domestic car makers as well. The higher temperatures associated with emerging smaller headlamp designs require an adhesive/sealant which can resist both high and low temperature extremes. Silicone sealants retain their flexi- bility from -55°C to 200°C. The sealants offer excellent unprimed adhesion to a wide range of substrate materials, including glass, aluminum, steel, polycarbonate, acrylic, polyester, ABS and poly- amide. In addition, silicones in general exhibit excellent UV resistance, high tensile and tear strength, and good elongation proterties. The creativity of domestic auto engineers has prompted fur- ther development of new product offerings. As the technology driving these products continues to advance, it has become apparent that silicones offer the processing and performance advantages required by today's auto manufacturers. Recnet sili- cone research has produced some important variations in adhe- sives/sealants, including low-volatile versions of the material. 910868. Laboratory and field performance of zero phosphorus oils. T. Colclough, J. F. Marsh, and R. Robson, Exxon Chemical Ltd. Novel zero-phosphorus engine oils have been developed which are based on the use of combinations of copper and sul- phur compounds. Bench oxidation tests have shown that copper oleate and a sulphurised ester provide better oxidation and vis- cosity control than can be obtained with zinc dithiophosphates when used in combination with either soluble copper compounds or aromatic amines and hindered phenols. The good bench test results were confirmed in the Sequence IIID engine test where excellent control of viscosity was obtained. These oils, in some cases also containing a borate ester, performed well in the CRC L-38 bearing corrosion test and also provided good wear protec- tion in a motored rig test and in the Sequence IIID test. Field test- ing of the oils developed in this work showed that they provided satisfactory performance under normal driving conditions. 1991 SAE Transactions Section 4 910869. Modification of phosphate hopeite crystals and struc- tural determination of the high durable modified crystals by means of extended X-ray absorption fine structure. Noboru Sato, Honda R&amp;D Co., Ltd. Using hopeite crystals as phosphate layer formed on zinc coated steels of automobile body, EXAFS (extended X-ray absorption fine structure) method was applied to analyze the local structure of heavy metal components contained in these crystals. Analysis was done by observing XANES (x-ray absorp- tion near edge structure) spectra, Fourier transforms of EXAFS and reverse operations of Fourier transforms for these functional materials. The data supported that manganese components existed as Mn(II) in the modified hopeite crystals with a structure of Zn3-xMnx(P04)2*4H20. Furthermore, curve fitting analysis of EXAFS provided more dtailed information of the chemical struc- ture. 1991 SAE Transactions Section 5 116</page><page sequence="116">910870-910875 910870. Human factors issues surrounding the implementa- tion of in-vehicle navigation and information systems. Kurt Bar- row, Kansas State Univ. Many questions surround the possible implementation of an advanced driver information system into passenger vehicles. The technology to relieve increasing traffic congestion problems exists today, but the methods to safely use this technology do not. There are many concerns in the government, industry, and academic communities surrounding the implementation of graphic display monitors inside passenger vehicles. This concern stems from recent studies on the effect of cellular phones, touch panels, and electronic navigational systems on driver attention demands. These studies show that driver attention is taken from the roadway to operate these systems. However, more research into basic human/vehicle ergonomics needs to be conducted in order to determine how the demands of in-vehicle electronics affect highway safety. Recommendations include: maintaining and broadening the scope of human factors research, continued use of field testing, the implementation of preproduction standards and regulations, increased driver education and training, and continuation of real- istic engineered systems. 1991 SAE Transactions Section 6 910871. Intelligent vehicle/highway systems in the U.S. - In need of a vision. Scott A. Lund, Iowa State Univ. Traffic congestion has become a major problem in the United States. Advanced technologies, referred to as intelligent vehicle/ highway systems (IVHS), offer the best solution. IVHS allow communication between vehicle and highway. IVHS include advanced traffic management systems, advanced driver informa- tion systems, commercial vehicle operations, and automated vehicle control systems. IVHS offer to reduce congestion, enhance safety, increase productivity, and improve U.S. compe- titiveness. IVHS development programs are underway in Europe and Japan. No national IVHS program exists in the United States. Three questions are asked. Is there need for a national IVHS program? Which system is intelligent, the vehicle or the highway? Which system comes first, the vehicle or the highway? Public and private section cooperation is needed. The federal government will coordinate effort between state and local govern- ments and private industry. The public and Congress must be convinced that IVHS are beneficial. 1991 SAE Transactions Section 6 910872. Space nuclear power sources: Safety policy in the development and application of the RTG and SP-100 systems. William Rigert, San Diego State Univ. Growth of the U.S. space program depends on the ability to develop cost-effective, reliable, and safe power sources. The radioisotope thermoelectric generator (RTG) has satisfied these requirements in low-power regimes, and the SP-100 (space power-100 KW electric) space reactor program aspires to fulfill high-power needs. The SP-100 is the basis for opening a wide range of new opportunities in space technology. However, safety aspects are a major issue in the launch and applications of space nuclear power sources (NPS). Space development may be com- promised if safety policy issues are not resolved, and life and the environment are at risk if these issues are not addressed carefully. This paper examines RTGs and the SP-100 program in terms of safety policy and provides corresponding public policy alterna- tive. 910873. A high speed fiber-optic link for color video applica- tions. M. Lynn and G. Miller, Packard Elect. Div., General Motors Corp. In the 1980's video displays for use in instrumentation and navigation applications were introduced into the automobile. However, the high cost of electromagnetically compatible wiring assemblies has spurred system designers to look for more eco- nomical alternatives. To meet this need, a low cost fiber optic data link has been developed for use in automotive video display systems. The data link multiplexes the CRT controller's red, green, blue, horizontal sync, and vertical sync signals onto a sin- gle plastic optical fiber. The multiplexing and LED driver cir- cuitry are integrated into the CRT controller module, and the receiver and demultiplexing circuitry are integrated into the CRT package. The data is transmitted at 57.6MBd. This paper first describes the wiring options available to the system designer in this application and explains why a multiplexed, single fiber sys- tem is the best solution. The key features of the multiplexing and demultiplexing schemes used are then discussed, and finally the system performance will be examined. 1991 SAE Transactions Section 6 910874. Bit-wise contention on multi-master optical networks. K. Jennings, M. Lynn, and R. E. Steele, Packard Elect. Div., Gen- eral Motors Corp. Automotive applications of data communication networks are increasing rapidly and becoming a significant portion of the vehi- cle electronics content. The number of vehicles with networks will continue to increase as standards such as the California Air Resources Board (CARB) "on board diagnostics II" standard (OBD-II) take effect. In addition to low speed (&lt;125 KBps) elec- trical networks, high speed networks are being developed for vehicle applications. Unlike the low speed diagnostic and data communication networks, high speed networks will be used in control applications where the data on the network becomes time critical. To reduce network latency, higher data rates are required. As the data rate of these networks increase, the effects of elec- tromagnetic interference become a significant factor and fiber optics becomes a viable candidate for the transmission medium. Many of the protocols being considered for automotive appli- cations are carrier sense multiple access with collision detect (CSM A-CD) protocols. These protocols are typically multimaster broadcast busses that allow random access to the bus by any of the potential masters. Examples of multiple access protocols being considered are: controller area network (CAN), vehicle area network (VAN), and automotive bit-serial universal-interface system (ABUS). A unique feature of the automotive CSMA-CD protocols is that, due to their short lengths, they can use bit-wise contention to resolve bus contention without the total loss of data. Bus contention occurs when multiple nodes simultaneously start to communicate on a broadcast bus network. Bus conten- tion can take two forms - destructive and non-destructive. Destructive contention protocols allow multiple nodes to trans- mit simultaneously but the information is lost due to the scram- bling of the various messages. These protocols are used where bus length precludes non-destructive bit-wise contention. Non- destructive contention uses bit-wise contention to resolve bus mastership within a bit time. Contention resolution must occur within a bit time in order to retain the information of the domi- nant bus master. The purpose of this paper is to discuss the impact of the use of an optical bus with bit-wise contention. 1991 SAE Transactions Section 6 910875. Highly heat-resistant plastic optical fibers. Tomiya Abe, Hideki Asano, and Kouichi Okino, Hitachi Cable, Ltd.; and Noriaki Taketani, Hitachi, Ltd. Plastic optical fiber has been widely used in the field of short distance optical transmission. However, heat resistance of com- mercial plastic fiber is so low that its applications are limited. Then, a plastic fiber of thermosetting acrylate resin core has been developed. This fiber shows 80%/m retention of light transmit- tance at lm after 1,000 hours at 150°C. It resists heat deformation and withstands up to 200°C for a short time period. Tests show this fiber has desirable mechanical characteristics, along with 117</page><page sequence="117">910875-910880 good environmental resistance. In addition, a fiber which has a silicon resin as a core material was developed which has even bet- ter heat resistance. 1991 SAE Transactions Section 6 910876. Optical star coupler for plastic fiber. Hatato Yuuki , Takeharu Ito, and Tetsuo Sugimoto, Systems and Components R&amp;D Dept., R&amp;D Group, Sumitomo Wiring Systems, Ltd. With the development of car electronics, an increasing num- ber of ECUs have been introduced to engine controls, brake con- trols (ABS), and navigation systems, etc. For further develop- ment of data communication units such as navigation systems as well as integration of car control systems, large capacity of data must be transmitted or received among ECUs in real-time pro- cessing. Optical communication, featuring noise resistance and high-speed processing, can meet the these requirements. Naturally, there is a need for the development of optical cou- plers, which are essential for the construction of optical fiber net- works. For this reason, we developed optical star couplers to be basi- cally connected with plastic fibers. These couplers will represent high performance at reasonable cost.

Dept., Nissan Motor Co., Ltd.; Masami Ichida , Engrg. Dept. No. 3, Nissan Motor Co., Ltd.; Tatsushi Ishii, Machine and Tool Des. Dept., Nissan Motor Co., Ltd.; Tomaru Ogawa, Materi- als Research Lab., Nissan Motor Co., Ltd.; and Masahiro Endoh, Production Development System Dept., Nissan Motor Co., Ltd. The use of CAE software in developing plastic components has advanced rapidly in recent years. This progress has been sup- ported by the development of practical analytical tools, based on the finite element and boundary element methods, and on the dramatic improvements seen in computer performance. Follow- ing the introduction of a flow analysis program in 1982, Nissan has developed and implemented advanced programs for use in developing plastic components and has integrated the programs into a unified in-house system. The system is being utilized at the design and manufacturing stages of interior and exterior trim parts and has produced concrete results in different phases of component development. Work is now proceeding on the devel- opment of a system that can simultaneously analyze both the component performance and the factors that need to be consid- ered in the manufacturing process. This paper describes the sys- tem structure, presents several application examples, including verification of the calculated data, and discusses the future out- look for CAE technology. 910878. Geometries of simple hinges hidden by flush con- toured surface doors. Donald L. Glossop, Jr., Ford Motor Co. Doors are very important part of transportation products as exemplified by the large number of them. In addition to doors for occupants to enter and exit there are doors for access to engine, cargo, luggage, air flow, fuel fill, etc. For transportation products, doors are usually designed to be flush with surrounding surfaces - and most of them have hidden hings. There are only a few mechanical alternatives to provide for the opening of doors and the use of simple pivoting hinges is pre- dominant. There are two kinds of simple pivot hidden hinges - inswinging and outswinging. These are named according to the initial motion of the edge of door with respect to its adjacent sur- face. Inswinging hinges are most prevalent for occupant entry/ exit doors since they are required for most rear doors and they provide more pleasing cut line shapes for current surfaces, usu- ally at lower cost. The door cut lines for hidden hinges which studio designers initially style on proposed products frequently cannot be achieved due to the inherent limitations. While achievable cut lines can be developed using trial-and-error methods, quicker and more reliable results together with a true understanding of the problems requires an analysis which identifies causes and simpli- fies their visualization. Such an analysis has led to a system for establishing the limits of surfaces and cut lines which has been named the "volume-in-space" method. It was developed originally for automotive occupant doors but is also applicable to other transportation items such as doors for luggage, engine, air flow, fuel, etc. as well as other pivoted parts such as convertible tops and aerodynamic suspension arms - and even non-transportation hinged applications such as cabinets and machinery housings. As the top end view of a hinge centerline for automotive occu- pant doors is observed, there are four basic limits to the volume in which the edge of the door must be contained. These limits are 1) the swing-by limit, determined by the requirement of the door swinging clear as it passes by the adjacent panel (or door) at initial movement; 3) the molding clearance limit, determined by the requirement that any randomly located molding on the vehicle surface must not be contacted when the door is fully opened; 3) the swung limit, determined by the requirement that the door and the body parts must not contact each other when the door is swung fully opened; and 4) the inner limit, determined by the most inward exterior surface possible with respect to the hinge on the door or other hardware in the door. By examining the parameters which affect each limit, projec- tions can be made regarding ways of increasing the size of the lim- iting "volume-in-space". Additional discussion is included on advantages for occupant entry/exit which have been gained in some products by orientating the hinge centerline at angles up to 4° from vertical, there are also opportunities for improving the door openings for both body structure and occupant entry/exit. 910879. (SP-851) Advances in the MADYMO crash simula- tions. H. A. Lupker, P. J. A. de Coo, J. J. Nieboer, and J. Wismans, TN O Road-Vehicles Research Institute. MADYMO is a well accepted multibody program for crash analyses. The main emphasis of the program is the prediction of the kinematics and dynamic behavior of crash victims during a crash. A brief description of the MADYMO history and theory is presented as well as recently developed couplings with explicit finite element programs for nonlinear structural analyses. The development of dummy databases is described with special emphasis on the development of the EUROSID dummy database using a new multibody module. This module is based on a recur- sive algorithm and allows modeling of other kinematic joints in addition to the currently available ball and socket joints. The use of MADYMO in impact biomechanics is illustrated with exam- ples from the area of vehicle safety and sports biomechanics. The use of MADYMO for structural modeling is illustrated by a side- impact simulation using MADYMO to model both car and occu- pant. 910880. (SP-850) Failure analysis of terminal pullout in auto- motive connectors. Zenon Hotra and Henry Siedlik, United Tech- nologies Automotive; Joseph T. Woods, GE Corporate Research and Development; and Raymond F. Kolberg and Corrine K. Bals, GE Plastics. The high costs of prototyping, revisions, and production tool- ing, with a higher emphasis on quality, concurrent with demands for miniaturization, higher-density packaging, stricter perfor- mance, and a shortened product development cycle, have led to the development of advanced analysis techniques that address the performance issues associated with failure prevention in automotive connectors. Because of the complex material and geometric nonlinearity demands in performance, traditional cal- 118</page><page sequence="118">910880-910888 culations are inadequate, and new methods, utilizing finite ele- ment analysis techniques were developed. These highly specialized analysis techniques will enable the designer and engineer to predict connector performance with a high degree of confidence. Concurrent with concept designs, structural analyses (in the areas of assembly, disassembly, and terminal retention) must be done prior to design release. It is crit- ical that the performance issues associated with connector fail- ures be addressed accurately during the conceptual design phase to limit or eliminate the need for design revisions at a later stage. 1991 SAE Transactions Section 5 910881. Development of a CNG engine. James J. Cole , South- west Research Institute ; Ed Kienzle, Hercules Engines, Inc.; Allen D. Wells, Gas Research Institute; and Roy C. Meyer, Southwest Research Institute. Impending emissions regulations for diesel engines, specifi- cally exhaust particulate emissions have caused engine manufac- turers to once again examine the potential of alternative fuels. Much interest has centered around compressed natural gas (CNG) due to its potential for low particulate and NOx emissions. Natural gas engine development projects have tended toward the use of current gasoline engine technology (stoichiometric mix- tures, closed-loop fuel control, exhaust catalysts) or have applied the results of previous research in lean-burn gasoline engines (high-turbulence combustion chambers). These technologies may be inappropriate for foreseeable emissions targets in heavy-duty natural gas engines. This paper describes the development of a mechanically simple CNG conversion of a 3.7L engine for Hercu- les Engines, Inc. which has met 1994 heavy-duty emissions tar- gets on the heavy-duty diesel FTP test cycle, and discusses the relationship between in-cylinder gas temperature and NOx emis- sions as well as the effects of air-fuel ratio, spark timing, and com- bustion chamber shape on exhaust emissions. A low-turbulence combustion chamber was designed for this engine which takes advantage of these relationships. 1991 SAE Transactions Section 4 910882. Management of reliability disciplines in support of customer satisfaction. J. Nirdosh Reddy and John C. Haldane, Ford Motor Co. The emerging global economy and global competition is hav- ing a significant impact on the management of businesses around the world. Customer satisfaction is essential. Quality of products and services and their reliability over time play a major role in satisfying the customer. A change in the mindset of organizations is required to meet these challenges. The focus of reliability efforts must shift from prediction to continuous improvement. Process oriented think- ing along with the concept of the internal customer must perme- ate the entire organization. Mechanisms like a reliability operat- ing process must be in place to capture lessons learned from prior failures and prevent their recurrence. Reliability disciplines - not reliability engineers - need to be deployed throughout the organi- zation. An environment must be created which empowers self managed teams to apply these disciplines throughout the product planning, design, development, manufacturing, assembly and service processes. 910883. (P-242) Smart actuators for body equipment. Cornelius Peter, Robert Bosch GmbH. The amount and complexity of actuating functions in a mod- ern car are significantly increasing. The often used centralized ECU for body functions will not be able to manage future needs. The electronic control boxes as separate units disappear almost completely. Control panels, positioning motors and sen- sors will be equipped with small onborad electronics including a standardized serial data link, for example CAN. The availability of these smart components is the key prereq- uisite to introduce powerful and cost effective multiplex systems in the area of body electronics. 910885. The combustion variation characteristics of the pre- combustion chamber type compression ignition engine. Shuichi Kajitani and Norihiro Sawa, Ibaraki JJniv. Many studies on the cyclic variation of combustion process are made with a spark ignition engine. However, there are scarcely such studies with a diesel engine. Because, in general, the combustion of diesel engine is believed very stable. However, there exist some combustion variations in a diesel engine. As it is universally known, the combustion in a diesel engines is the series of a pre-mixed and a diffusion combustion, which is com- pletely different from the combustion of a spark ignition engine. Therefore, it is impossible to determine the combustion variation of diesel engine by a direct application of the results of spark igni- tion engine. In this report, we discuss the several factors which indicate the combustion variation with a pre-chamber type diesel engine. The maximum pressure Pmax, the maximum rate of pressure rise (dP/dÖ) max, the combustion pressure at each crank angle, etc. are analyzed from the continuous five hundred of com- bustion pressure histories statistically. The several engine speeds, loads, compression ratios, charging air rates, exhaust gas re- circulation rates, injection pressures, and fuel temperatures were selected as the engine operating parameters. The results are summarized as follows: 1) the most suitable paramter, which shows the stability of the compression ignition engine, is the variation coefficient of the maximum rate of pres- sure rise V[(dP/d0) max]; 2) the more the load and injection pres- sure increases the more the V[(dP/d0) max] increases. And the more the engine speed and the compression ratio decreases, the more the V[(dP/d0) max] decreases; 3) the other parameters are the S(Pmax) and V(Pmax): the standard deviation of Pmax and the variation coefficient of Pmax. The engine speed, exhaust gas recirculation rate and intake air flow rate do not change the S(Pmax) and V(Pmax). However, the more the injection pres- sure, compression ratio and fuel temperature increases, the more S(Pmax) and V(Pmax) decrease; and 4) there are one-to-one cor- respondence between (Pmax) and (Pmax), (Pmax) and [(dP/d0) max], and [0 [(dP/d0) max] and [(dP/d0) max] respectively. 910886. Numerical simulation of door frame deformation due to aerodynamic suction force. Yuuji Hanaoka, Nobuyuki Murai, and Kiyohira Aoki, Isuzu Motors Ltd. Negative pressure around the front pillar of a vehicle travel- ling at high speed deforms the door frame in the outward direc- tion. This causes the aspiration noise. Finding a method for the reduction of the resulting air aspiration noise is a goal of this study which analyzes this phenomenon. The method proposed here can be applied to find effective measures to reduce aspira- tion noise at the early stages of vehicle development. 910887. New pretreatment and painting technology for all- aluminum automotive body. Yasunori Komatsu, Eiji Suzuki, Kat- suo Miyazaki, and Toshiya Nishino, Honda R&amp;D Co., Ltd. The Honda NSX, made entirely of aluminum, introduces a concept of using chromium chromáte as a method of chemical pretreatment. For other parts that contain a different type of metal, such as various parts of the chassis, a DACRO coating system as well as many other inventions are used. For the paint process itself, a new waterborne basecoat technology is also introduced to obtain a high-class appearance level for the NSX. 910888. Development of FRP rear axle components. Ingo Kuch and Gudrun Delonge-Immik, Research Vehicle Eng. 119</page><page sequence="119">910888-910895 The various stages of development for a composite rear axle will be illustrated. Starting with the verification of the industrial applicability of fibre-reinforced plastics (FRP) in the automobile and the substitution of individual components, a design concept for an integrated composite rear axle will be explained. A description will be given of the design, manufacture and testing of CFRP spring links made by hand laminating process, filament winding and thermoforming of long fibre-reinforced thermoplastics. The following development stage is the design of a leaf spring link which combines the load bearing function of the spring link with the spring-loaded property of a helical spring. A first design concept for an FRP rear axle will be presented. 1991 SAE Transactions Section 5 910889. Economic criteria for sensible selection of body panel materials. John V. Busch and Jeff R. Dieffenbach, IBIS Asso- ciates, Inc. In order to determine the best way to evaluate materials selec- tion from an economic standpoint, a discussion of conventional cost estimation is given versus a more precise technique, techni- cal cost modeling. Automotive body panels are used as an application for the costing techniques; conclusions about frabrication costs and parts consolidation are drawn with regard to these parts. 910890. Anti-seizure properties of bearing in heavy-duty diesel engines. Kenji Mihara, Yorihiko Inada, and Tomoyuki Mashiko, Komatsu Ltd. This paper deals with the anti-seizure properties of connecting rod bearing for which the overlay is worn due to extended engine operation. Trimetal bearings from operating engines were collected and their surface condition was evaluated. It was found that there were some bearings where the Ni-compound layer had been exposed. For such bearings the seizure-load-limit was lower than that for bearings whose overlay was still intact. In order to understand this tendency quantitatively, the effect of the bearing materials on anti-seizure properties were studied. Using these results, the authors analysed the correlation between bearing seizure and some parameters which can estimate the work load of the bearing. It was found that the "mean unit load of the bearing X velocity" can serve as a practical parameter for bearing seizure. 910891. Design of experiments in occupant simulation. A. C. Bosio and H. A. Lupker, TN O Road-Vehicles Research Institute. Mathematical modeling techniques are becoming increasingly important for automotive vehicle design for occupant protection. Clearly, the high cost of test vehicles and laboratory facilities makes it desirable to optimize the restraint design early in the vehicle development with a mathematical model. In this light, parameter screening techniques and optimization are, therefore, important analysis tools for the engineer to understand and to practice in his modeling work. In this paper, design of experiments methods are discussed and examples are shown for the use of linear (2k P) models for application in occupant simulation work. Results are presented for a phase zero MADYMO 2D airbag and 3-point seatbelt simu- lation study of the design factors that influence the HIC in a 50 kph frontal barrier crash test. 1991 SAE Transactions Section 6 910892. In-car early reflection studies using in-the-ear micro- phone techniques. Thomas D. Breithaupt, Blaupunkt Div., Bosch Corp. After prototyping numerous sound systems for automobiles, it is often frustrating for the design engineer to gather a number of listeners and each turns out to have their own perception of the system performance. Some people are sensitive to localization problems in the car yet are unaware of reflection induced fre- quency response problems. The converse holds true for other lis- teners that notice small anomalies in frequency but are oblivious to localization difficulties. A trained listener can often balance the frequency and imaging issues though by tilting their head or mentally biasing the acoustical data. The reasons for these differences in listeners is often due to the pinna, which is the visible part of the outer ear. In-the-ear™ microphones, recently developed by Etymotic Research, are placed in the ear canals of several listeners to measure these influ- ences in hope of understanding why these contrasting opinions exist. 910893. Experimental analysis of blowby and flow field inter- action in a motored rotary engine. F. Hamady, M. DeFilippis, T. Stuecken, and H. J. Schock, Mech. Engrg. Dept., Michigan State Univ. An experimental study of the blowby past the apex seals and its controlling effect on the flow field was conducted in a motored rotary engine. A high speed flow visualization technique and laser doppler anemometry (LDA) measurements were applied to ana- lyze the blowby past two-piece and three-piece engine apex seals under motored conditions 2000 rpm crank shaft speed. A light sheet from a 40 watt pulsed copper vapor laser was synchronized with a high speed rotating prism camera to record light scattered off microballoon particles onto motion picture films photo- graphed at 5000 frames per second. A sequence of photographs is selected from the films to demonstrate the blowby characteris- tics past the apex seals and their effect on the flow field during the intake and compression strokes. Detailed LDA velocity mea- surements using propylene glycol as seeding particles, 0.6 ^m in diameter, are also presented to quantify the blowby past the apex seals. Important aspects of the blowby and its interaction with the fluid motion are described. Experimental results demonstrated the existence of blowby for both two-piece and three-piece apex seals under the conditions selected. 1991 SAE Transactions Section 3 910894. Considerations in the use of the NHTSA cardfile. Kenneth L. Campbell and Dawn L. Massie, University of Michi- gan Transportation Research Institute. The cardfile was developed by NHTSA to aid problem identi- fication and cou n terme asu re development in the field of crash avoidance research. This paper summarizes the results of an eval- uation of selected cardfile data elements. Many of the variables of interest to crash avoidance, such as precrash stability, rural/ urban, roadway separation, avoidance attempt, and VIN, are entirely missing for one or more of the cardfile states. Such non- random missing data are likely to bias the resulting distributions. Other examples are described of missing and incompatible code values. Although five of the six states appear to code precrash sta- bility, in fact there is not a single category on this variable that is recorded in every state, and no single state has all the catego- ries. Thus the cardfile cannot reflect the true distribution of these attributes for the aggregate of the six states. The authors conclude that perhaps the most significant disadvantage of the cardfile is the appearance of uniformity that is created when, for many vari- ables, this is not the case. In order to make valid inferences from the cardfile, it is necessary to be familiar not only with the coding of the original state files, but also the additional translations that produce the cardfile. These problems illustrate the advantages that more uniform accident reporting at the state level would pro- vide. 1991 SAE Transactions Section 6 910895. Concepts, materials and efficiencies of piston com- pounded adiabatic engines. James A. E. Bell, Inco Ltd. A new practical concept for piston compounding engines is described. The calculated thermal efficiency of a fully insulated, piston compounded, overcharged diesel engine can exceed 60%. 120</page><page sequence="120">910895-910904 The design considerations for construction of such an engine from controlled expansion superalloys is also described. 910896. Plastic optical fiber for automotive use. Shinichi Teshima, Hajime Munekuni, Shigeka Katsuta , and Tadashi Shi- mizu, Asahi Chemical Ind. Co., Ltd. There are several advantages in using plastic optical fiber in automobiles. Plastic optical fiber for automotive applications can be classified according to two types of applications: those for the passenger compartment and those for the engine room. The two types can be distinguished by their heat resistance and transmis- sion loss properties. The two types of fiber should be installed in places where they would be suitable. In the passenger compart- ment, a 85°C to 105°C PMM A optical fiber should be used. In the engine room, fiber made of heat-resistant material such as poly- carbonate would be stable. This paper will describe the properties of optical fibers which can be supplied commercially. It will also describe the properties of optical couplers made through photoli- thography. In order to incorporate LAN into automobiles, optical components, such as optical couplers, are becoming applicable. 910897. Gas injection molding of thermoplastic composite win- dow guidance channel. Suresh Shah and Dave Hlavatý, Inland- Fisher Guide, Div. of General Motors Corp. Gas injection molding of reinforced engineering plastics for structural applications is a very innovative approach, but is still in an infancy stage. The requirements for window guidance chan- nel are: dimensional stability, high strength to weight ratio, no warpage and low wear. The composite materials with hollow tubular structure can only meet these requirements based on FEA analysis. We evaluated 30% glass filled polyester (short and long glass fibers). The part and tool designs are the key parameters for successful results which are discussed. Information on current gas injection molding technologies is discussed. The new software 'C- Gas flow analysis' was used to optimize gate design and process parameters. The design of experiments based on Taguchi method was used. Both available technologies, i.e., gas through nozzle and gas through runner or cavity were tested. The cross section analysis was done using CAT scan. This is the first structural application of gas injection technology which is fully tested and approved according to GM specifications. We received Society of Plastic Industries (SPI) 'Award of Excellence' for design and application development in February 1990. 1991 SAE Transactions Section S 910898. The use of methodical design information systems in the automotive industry.//./. Franke, Technical Univ.; J. Barren - scheen, Volkswagen AG; and U. Drebing, G. Bruss GmbH and Co. KG. A systematic approach to the design of seals and gaskets requires the storage of information on interactions between geometry and function in order to build up a methodoical design information system. The intentions of this systematic documentation are: 1) to col- lect and document all known variations of seals and gaskets; 2) to simplify and rationalize the design process; 3) to make the design process independent from the experience of the engineer; 4) to find correlations between geometry and function; 5) to help to optimize the function of the gasket; and 6) to help to imply the design process in a CAD-system. 910899. (P-242) Speed sensor integration in wheel bearing hub units. Steven F. Brown and Christian Rigaux, SKF Bearing Ind. Co. Advancements in vehicle wheel speed sensing technology present automotive engineers with unique design opportunities. Both the integration of speed sensors into wheel bearing hub units and the introduction of new speed sensor technologies will be dis- cussed. 910901. (SP-852) Effectiveness of safety belts and airbags in preventing fatal injury. David C. Viano, Biomedical Science Dept., General Motors Research Labs. Airbags and safety belts are now viewed as complements for occupant protection in a crash. There is also a view that no single solution exists to ensure safety and that a system of protective technologies is needed to maximize safety in the wide variaety of real automotive crashes. This paper compares the fatality preven- tion effectiveness and biomechanical principles of occupant restraint systems. It focuses on the effectiveness of various sys- tems in preventing fatal injury assuming the restraint is available and used. While lap-shoulder belts provide the greatest safety, airbags protect both belted and unbelted occupants. 1991 SAE Transactions Section 6 910902. Novel variable reluctance sensors. Joseph M. Adams and Takeshi Shirai, Delco Remy; and Andrzej M. Pawlak, Gen- eral Motors Research Labs. Variable reluctance sensors are widely used in automotive applications and well known for their low cost and reliability. Because of recent developments of new magnetic materials and manufacturing technologies, it was possible to introduce new sen- sor configurations which can lead to dramatic improvement in sensor performance. This paper describes a novel variable reluc- tance speed sensor with two permanent magnets located in the proximity of an exciter wheel and presents the magnetic analysis of this sensor. This novel sensor configuration has the ability to develop high signal strength over the high temperature range at low exciter wheel speeds and a large air gap between the sensor and the exciter wheel. In applications where the available space for the sensor is limited, it shows much better performance than prior art sensors. The sensor structure is devised to fit a very limited space and to provide high performance signal for a variety of applications. In particular, the presented sensor arrangement is suited for a driven integral bearing speed sensor design for ABS and traction control applications. A 2-D finite element mathematical model was used to optimize the sensor geometry. A number of sensors were built and tested. Bench test results showed an excellent cor- relation in comparison with analysis and good vehicle test perfor- mance was achieved. 1991 SAE Transactions Section 6 910903. The automobile - Unwanted technology: Part II the middle years (1930-1960). Jeffrey I. Godshall, Chrysler Corp.; James K. Wagner, Ford Motor Co.; and James A. Wren, Motor Vehicle Manufacturers Association of the United States. The following is an overview of American automotive histo- ry's most technologically productive era with emphasis on those advancements which were initially shunned by customers as overly innovative. In discussing this theme, the paper views the period's automotive technology from three points of view: powertrain and chassis, body, and overall car, highlighting what the authors consider to have been the most significant unwanted technology. It should be noted that some of these concepts and product features made but a brief appearance on the highways of America, disappeared and were never heard of again. Others came and went, only to reappear again when either the manufac- turing community or the motoring public was more receptive. 1991 SAE Transactions Section 6 910904. Bill Stout engineer/imagineer (1880-1956). James A. Wren, Motor Vehicle Manufacturers Association of the United States. "Never resort to mathematics until you have exhausted the possibilities of two toothpicks and a piece of string." Such was the sage advice offered by William Bushneil Stout, one of America's most prolific inventive minds in the world of transportation. The impact of Stout's achievements has been generally overlooked. When we pause to reflect upon his many contributions to the avi- 121</page><page sequence="121">910904-910925 ation and motor vehicle industries and other fields, it seems ironic that Stout's basic tenets of simplicity and practicality were espoused at the same time he was designing airplanes, automo- biles, buses, and trains which were considered to be too futuristic. Many in the automobile and aviation industries considered Stout to be merely a gadfly and constant critic of the status quo in engineering. Yet the very same men who criticzed him respected him enough to elect Stout as President of the Society of Automotive Engineers in 1935. He considered the honor to be one of the greatest thrills of his life. It's with a sense of deep appre- ciation and awe that we present some brief highlights of the career and especially the achievements of William Bushneil Stout. 910905. Global economy and competition: Engineering chal- lenges of the 90's. Hans L. Merkle , Robert Bosch. The issue of how to face global competition in the automotive industry is addressed, with particular emphasis on safety, quality, and economy. The author discusses some of the problems encountered by engineers in the design of new vehicles because they must deal with economic boundary conditions as well as technical boundary conditions. Also, the need for further increases in fuel efficiency is examined in the context of the auto- motive industry being in the midst of a transition period. 910920. Ion exchange systems for chromic acid recovery and purification from plating and anodizing operations. Joe Leather- dale and Michael Dejak, Eco-Tec, Inc. Chromic acid losses through dragout, bath dumps, and fume scrubber blowdown result in waste treatment expense, bath replacement, and environmental liabilities. Purification of the bath can eliminate bath dumping and improve performance by removing contaminates which are detrimental to the finishing operation. Closed loop recovery of rinsewaters (tied to scrubbers) can eliminate environmental liabilities and provide considerable savings. Ion exchange techniques are especially well suited to purification and recovery of chromic acid. In particular, a system which employs short resin columns and rapid operating cycles has been developed specifically for such applications. 1 991 SA E Transactions Section 1 910921. Development of high velocity oxy-fuel applied hard- face coating using Taguchi technique. Tuck Chon, Burton A. Kushner , and Anthony J. Rotolico, Metco/Perkin-Elmer. High velocity oxy-fuel (HVOF) sprayed hardface coatings (i.e.: chromium carbide/nickel chromium) are widely used in the air- craft industry for severe wear environment. The hardface coat- ings have the ability to withstand different forms of wear such as abrasion, adhesion, fretting, and particle erosion. Major aircraft engine manufacturers and repair facilities use these coatings for both original engine manufacture (OEM) and for repair and over- haul of critical engine components which experience various types of wear. The objective of this study was to develop effective spray parameters for optimized coating properties using a statistical method known as Taguchi technique. The properties evaluated were coating hardness, bond strength, particle erosion, abrasive wear and microstructures. By using Taguchi analysis the relation- ship between the various key parameters and coating properties can be determined. 1991 SAE Transactions Section 1 910922. New processes for corrosion control of active metals in severe environments. Mark F. Mosser, Sermatech Interna- tional , Inc. The corrosion of active metals such as magnesium and alumi- num continues in spite of the recent development of more corro- sion resistant alloys. Much of the corrosion occurs due to chloride ion attack aggravated by design problems that produce crevices and other corrosion prone surfaces. Many components made of obsolete alloys remain in service. In this paper basic protection schemes are reviewed for both magnesium and aluminum. Pretreatments and coating systems typically used are outlined with emphasis on problems at over- haul and reassembly. A novel coating primer/sealer process is described which provides a significantly more corrosion resistant surface for both magnesium and aluminum alloys. A mechanism for the operation of the coating film is offered; how it is combined with pretreatments to seal and prime the active metal surface is described. Data is supplied indicating corrosion resistance in salt spray tests, humidity tests and exposure to aerospace fluids. Compatibility with MIL-R-3043 sealant is described as well as MIL-P-23377 and MIL-C-83286 type epoxy polyamide/urethane paint systems. Components are described that utilize the process, including alloy, pretreatment and final use of components. 910923. Automated waterjet coatings removal of engine com- ponent coatings. Cliff Mitchell and Scott H of acker, United Tech- nologies, USB I. In the 1980's, USBI introduced automated waterjet coatings removal into NASA's Space Shuttle program by activating robot cells to remove thermal protection coatings from solid rocket booster components. In the 1990's, USBI has applied this tech- nology to coatings removal from jet engine components. Using this environmentally compatible, pollution prevention technol- ogy USBI has demonstrated the removal of ceramic coatings from vanes; magnesium zirconate coatings from combustion chambers and burner cans; plasma coatings from stator rings, knife edge seals, and lip segments; plasma and rubber coatings from high pressure compressor cases; hardface coatings from inner vane supports; tin bismuth shuttles removed from blades; boron nitrite coatings from forged disks; and aluminum oxide coatings from blades. This paper presents the results of USBI's evaluation on coatings removal from these and other compo- nents and documents the test methods used in evaluating, optimizing and proving the processes. Automated component processing work cells are also introduced; three distinct systems have been developed which meet different levels of part process- ing requirements. 910924. An alternative to hard chrome plating. Joji Takada, Takada Labs., Inc. A process of nickel-tungsten-silicon carbide plating was devel- oped as an alternative to hard chrome plating. This new plating process has superior abrasion resistance and several advantages over hard chrome plating. One meritorious effect of this process is that the plating bath contains no hazardous ingredients such as hexavalent chromium contained in a chrome plating bath. The plating solution is neutral in pH and causes no pollution control or labor safety problems. Therefore, this process will be an environmentally suitable candidate for a replacement process to hard chrome plating in the aerospace industry. This paper describes various features of the process. 1991 SAE Transactions Section 1 910925. Plastic media blasting - The maturing of the technol- ogy. Kenneth E. Abbott, Stripping Technologies, Inc. Plastic media blasting (PMB) is a process for the rapid, eco- nomic and safe removal of coatings from almost any product without the use of toxic chemical strippers, burn-off systems, sandblasting or hand or mechanical abrasion methods. Although resembling sandblasting, PMB does not use hard abrasives, such as silica sand. Rather, the process employs recycl- able plastic particles, which are pneumatically applied at low pressures of 20 to 40 psi. The plastic particles vary in hardness from 3.0 to 4.0 Mohs, as compared to hard abrasives which are in the 7 Mohs range. 122</page><page sequence="122">910925-910932 Since the plastic granules are harder than coatings but softer than underlying substrates, PMB can quickly remove primers and topcoats without harming sensitive substrates such as alumi- num, brass, copper, magnesium, thin steel and titanium. Addi- tionally, the process can be utilized on surfaces where chemical strippers cannot be used, or must be applied with caution, such as panels of honeycomb construction, engineered plastic, fiber- glass and advanced composites. 910926. Evaluation of size and shape of shot peening media by image analysis. Bob Gillespie, Premier Shot Co.; and Daniel B. Fowler, Struers, Inc. It is well known that plating and other coatings processes can cause reduction of fatigue resistance in metal parts. Shot peening prior to coatings processes will restore most, or all, of the lost fatigue properties. To assure repeatable and reliable results from the shot peening process, the shot must be controlled. The most critical characteristics of peening media are size and shape. Improperly size shot will give too little, too much or inconsistant layers of compressive stress. Improperly shape shot may cause surface damage and fatigue properties lower than in the unpeened condition. For the past forty years, the methods for measurement of shot size and shape have not changed. Shot size is measured by sieve analysis and shape is measured visually by an inspector. These inspection techniques lack speed, accuracy and repeatability and are subject to a significant amount of human error. This report describes a new method of evaluation that gives improved accuracy, repeatability and speed. Shot peening media can be evaluated simultaneously for both size and shape by image analysis. The results of inspection using an image analyzer are superior to sieve analysis and visual methods. Image analysis measurements provide much better control of peening media. The time saved in this faster technique can offset the cost of the image analysis system designed for shot evaluation. 1991 SAE Transactions Section 1 910927. Test procedure for dense particle separator. Robert Pauli, Pauli &amp; Griffin Co.; and Paul Lauer, America West Air- lines. Some early evaluations of plastic media resulted in adverse test data conclusions due to contaminated media and uncon- trolled blast parameters. Tests rerun with clean media confirmed the existence of acceptable test data. Existing equipment was not adequate for separation of dense non-magnetic particles like sand. Thus, Pauli &amp; Griffin Company developed a high-volume dense particle separator. Test data showed that the dense particle separator (DPS) was capable of removing 90% of the heavy parti- cles from any used 1.5 specific gravity media and 98% from any 1.2 specific gravity media. 910928. An environmentally acceptable paint stripping sys- tem. C. Rich, Brent Europe Ltd., Aerospace Systems Group; and P. Boyle, Ardox Inc., Aerospace Systems Group. Currently application paint removers for airframe and immer- sion paint removers for components use chlorinated hydrocar- bons as their main carrier solvent. Typically these would be dichloromethane for application paint removers and either dichloromethane or o-dichlorobenzene for immersion paint removers, depending upon the temperature of operation. In addi- tion these products may be activated by either phenol/cresol or organic acids or a combination of both. Current legislation is such that these raw materials, with per- haps the exception of the organic acids, present an environmen- tal/health and safety problem for the user. The acidic element of the formulation can cause operational problems as they cause hydrogen embrittlement of high tensile steels typically found in their undercarriages. The paper will discuss the problems associated with these raw materials and will look at the development of environmentally- friendly paint softeners. 1991 SAE Transactions Section 1 910929. Dynamic scheduling for aircraft plating. Steven Sinis- calchi, Dynamic Automation; GregArneson, Geotronics ; and Wil- liam Dascomb, Baker Brothers /Systems. The metal finishing operations of electroplating, anodizing, etching, stripping and similar wet processes have historically been manual functions in the aircraft industry. This is true of both OEM and overhaul operations throughout the U.S. This paper will describe the increasing use of automation for these pro- cesses and how the invention and application of sophisticated computer control programs provide the means to achieve this automation. A special control algorithm that employs dynamic scheduling will be described. Case studies of aircraft finishing applications will be presented. 910930. Electrochemical metallizing- An aircraft turbine engine restoration tool. Eric E. Serritella, Selectrons, Ltd. Electrochemical metallizing, a process whereby metal is selec- tively applied to rebuild and restore worn damaged mismachined and corroded components, has long enjoyed use as an aircraft engine manufacturing tool. Repair coatings, to corrode areas also have a long history of success. More recently, this high-speed coating process has been utilized as a turbine engine repair tool in F.A.A. approved overhaul and repair shops. Meeting both mil- itary and commercial aircraft specifications, electrochemical metallizing can be added to compliment an F.A.A. repair sta- tion^ rework methods, increasing overhaul capabilities. Worn stators, shaft diameters and endbell housings are easily rebuilt with electrochemical metallizing. Damaged gearbox faces can be restored. Many rotational engine components have been successfully refurbished. The paper will explore the use of electro- chemical metallizing to repair these engine components. The use of semi-automated electrochemical metallizing for "production" pre-braze coating on stators during overhaul will also be detailed. 910931. Use of plastic media blast (PMB) on composite sur- faces. Robert Pauli, Pauli &amp; Griffin Co.; and Charles E. Owens, United Airlines (Retired). Conventional paint strippers cannot be used on composite surfaces without damage to the substrate. Current practice is the use of hand sanding for paint removal from these surfaces. Plastic media blast (PMB) offers a more economical means of paint removal. In this paper, it is our intent to provide data supporting PMB as a viable process for paint removal from composite sur- faces. The PMB process eliminates health hazards associated with chemical stripping and reduces hazardous waste. Plastic medial dust is classified as a hazardous waste only if the paint sys- tem being removed contains sufficient quantities of hazardous ingredients. 1991 SAE Transactions Section 1 910932. Plastic blasting media development - A manufactur- er's view. Alan K. Nudelman, Composition Materials Co., Inc. Environmental and econominc considerations have energized the plastic media blasting (PMB) approach to coatings removal. However, little innovation has been evident since the initial introduction of plastic media in the early eighties. Challenges to manufacturers of plastic media include meeting higher quality requirements in the face of increasing costs for raw materials and removal of modern coatings form delicate composite substrata. The user's responsibility to select the correct media for the coating/substrate combination encountered is discussed. The problems caused by poorly manufactured media are identified and the causes discussed. Custom made media, the proposed solution to the problem, is presented. 123</page><page sequence="123">910932-910948 The media characteristics required are explained from a func- tional perspective. Obtaining all of these characteristics requires a continued search for new materials and R&amp;D in order to design custom media from known materials. The required R&amp;D is out- lined. 910933. Removal of coatings from jet engine components with ultrahigh-pressure waterjets. Jeffrey D. Watson and Steve Sisson, Flow International Corp. This presentation discusses the application of clean, ultrahigh- pressure waterjets to remove coatings from jet engine compo- nents during refurbishment and manufacture. Accurately applied, clean ultrahigh-pressure waterjets have been used and accepted for the removal of a number of coatings used in jet engines. In this paper the successfully removed coat- ings and related base metals are presented. Environmental and process advantages over existing methods are also covered. A coatings removal system that will remove a wide range of coat- ings from many different jet engine parts is introduced. 910934. A method for on-aircraft anodizing: Phos-anodizing containment system. E.A. (Bud) Westertnan and David F. Taylor ; Military Airplanes Div., Boeing Defense and Space Group. The phos-anodizing containment system (PACS) provides a safe, effective method for on-aircraft anodizing. The system can be used to anodize vertical, horizontal, and even inverted alumi- num surfaces. A surface prepared with the PACS method is equivalent to a tank-anodized surface. The resultant anodized surface provides the proper base for reliabile bonding or applica- tion of corrosion-inhibiting primers. 1991 SAE Transactions Section 1 910935. B-727 brake components salvaged by shot peen form- ing. David W. Axline, Metal Inprovement ; and John Eckersley, Metal Improvement. The shot peening process has been utilized to extend fatigue life on many parts for well over 60 years. Peen forming of metal parts to achieve desired shapes and contours also has been used for many years. Peen form correction is a derivative of the two aforementioned process. Peen form correction is now being used to return parts to serviceable condition. 910937. Electrodeless conductivity instruments in the plating shop. Roger W. Derby, QCI, Inc. The units of electric conductivity are defined and the prob- lems associated with conventional instruments are mentioned. The principle of operation of the electrodeless conductivity meter is explained along with manufacturing details. Applications to process control are mentioned and barriers to wider acceptance are discussed. 1991 SAE Transactions Section 1 910938. Brush plating applications utilizing AeroNiki® sulfa- mate nickel on aircraft components. John Langan, SIFCO Selec- tive Plating, Div. of SIFCO Industries, Inc.; and Mary Caporaso, United Technologies Pratt and Whitney. Since its development in 1982, the demand for "brush plated" sulfamate nickel coatings by the aircraft/aerospace industry has steadily increased. Many aircraft components once tank sulfa- mate nickel plated are now being plated without immersion using brush plating techniques. Reasons that substantiate the increas- ing use of brush sulfamate nickel as an alternative to tank sulfa- mate nickel are: minimal localized masking requirements; less danger of chemical attack to the part during preparation and plat- ing; faster rates of plating; little post-machining requirements; and, reduced environmental concerns with small solution vol- ume requirements. This paper examines the properties and char- acteristics of brush sulfamate nickel solutions (AeroNiki®) and the deposits obtained. In addition, testing programs will be reviewed which provide supporting data for consideration of the use of brush sulfamate nickel as an alternative to tank sulfamate nickel. Case examples of aircraft engine components currently being brush nickel plated will also be presented. 910945. Hall effect gear tooth sensors - A comparison of. Keith Moffatt, Honeywell Div., Micro Switch. This paper describes two of the leading hall effect geartooth sensing approaches and compares them to what the market would define as the "ideal" sensor. The two design approaches presented are commonly referred to as "zero speed" and "near zero speed" geartooth sensors. 910946. Active seat isolation for construction and mining vehi- cles. John Gniady and John Bauman, Aura Systems . This paper describes seats incorporating an active vibration and shock cancellation system for vehicles used by the construc- tion and mining industries. Integral to the system are compo- nents and techniques that Aura Systems has developed in the course of stepping up to state-of-the-art vibration isolation, can- cellation, and generation challenges in related areas. Aura has developed this through the use of magnetic actuators attached to the individual seat to dampen and eliminate disturbances by up to 80 db at all appropriate frequency levels associated with that seat. Further, the overall power efficiency, light weight and extremely high reliability/low maintenance characteristics of the system in comparison to alternative active suspension approaches - coupled with its performance across all load and disturbance environments - is unmatched. In addition to meet- ing performance goals, Aura's approach is cost effective, putting it well within the reach of potential users in the construction and mining industries. The need for such a seat suspension is para- mount to the long term health, safety and performance of the vehicle drivers. The reduction of long term health payments for disability alone would appear to outweigh any up front costs for such a seat. This paper reviews the vibration and shock cancella- tion problem for active seating in these industries, sets forth Aura's approach, and concludes with an indication of the perfor- mance that is anticipated. 910947. Multiaxial fatigue life prediction capabilities increase accuracy of fatigue analysis software. Chu-Hwa Lee, Hee Seung Ro, and Vipul Kinariwala, Engineering Mechanics Research Corp. Fatigue life prediction formula proposed by Fatemi-Socie has been implemented into the fatigue analysis software -ENDURE to account for the multiaxial, out-of-phase fatigue loading condi- tions. Shear strain amplitude on the maximum shear strain amplitude plane and the maximum stress normal to this plane are the parameters governing such fatigue damage. This approach is compatible with the Coffin-Manson law and can be easily incorporated with the uniaxial fatigue data and finite element stress analysis to perform multiaxial fatigue life predictions. The predicted lives show good agreements with the experimental results of thin-walled tubular and notched shaft specimens of Inconel 718 and 1045-HR steel. 910948. Metrology: A definition of quality. Clark R. Crain, John Fluke Manufacturing Co. Inc. Since defining quality so it will be accepted from company to company is a difficult task, this paper will discuss definitions of quality and how metrology can assist a company in defining its' quality. The title; Metrology: A definition of quality implies an explanation of how metrologists thinking has become important to companies committed to quality. This paper discusses the advantages quality programs derive from having metrology heav- ily involved in their processes and precedures. This paper also talks about the changing role of metrologists from strictly cali- brating of the test equipment to applying process metrology in order to ensure the overall quality of the products. 124</page><page sequence="124">910949-910960 910949. Measurements: A key to quality. Woodward G. Eicke, Measurement Associates, Inc. To remain competitive the United States must change its way of doing business. We must learn to produce the highest quality product at a competitive cost. There are many things that must be done to attain this goal. This paper addresses only one - measurements. The role of measurements in the decision making process will be addressed. The main thrust is the discussion of the elements of a measurement, modeling a measurement and error analysis. 910951. Ceramic seats and intermetallic coated valves in a nat- ural gas fired engine. Melvin E. Woods and William D. McNulty, Adiabatics, Inc. Significant reductions in valve and vale-seat insert wear have been demonstrated with the use of advanced materials for natural gas fueled engines. Total valve and insert wear was reduced by a factor of 10. It was demonstrated that the seat insert wear can be completely eliminated by using ceramic materials. All wear is then limited to the valve seat-face. The direct benefits to users of natural gas engines with advanced technology valve system materials can include reduced operating costs, greater convenience, and improved availability. 1991 SAE Transactions Section 5 910952. One piece diesel engine valves and powder metal seat inserts make in roads against traditional components. Frank J. Savel, TRW Valve Div. By the proper selection of material pairs, low wear rates can be obtained with unfaced valves and powder metal seat inserts in both intake and exhaust positions. These material pairs were identified by engine tests performed in a 317 KW heavy duty die- sel engine. The one piece valve eliminates two major manufactur- ing operations (two piece stem and hardfacing) with the addi- tional benefit of decreased machining and the inherent increase in reliability due to the simplified design. The near net shape low alloy powder metal seat inserts have an improved machinability over the cast materials. 1991 SAE Transactions Section 5 910953. Steel standardization Caterpillar's conscious evolu- tion. J. K. Spitler, Caterpillar Inc. Evolution in the standardization of steel sizes and chemistries has been taking place at Caterpillar over the last eight years. This has occurred through conscious optimization of several internal and external factors. The history, techniques and further poten- tial of the project will be presented. 910955. Development of three-dimensional laser machining techniques. George Chryssolouris, Paul Sheng, and Nicholas Anastasia, Lab. for Manufacturing and Productivity, M.I.T. Laser machining is an effective material removal process for types of materials which are difficult to machine mechanically, such as hardened alloys, ceramics, and composites. Since laser machining is a thermal process, its effectiveness depends on the thermal rather than the mechanical properties of a material. This paper discusses a concept for performing three-dimensional (3-D) laser machining using two laser beams. This concept aims at improving the material removal rate and energy efficiency of laser machining. Furthermore, the kinematic aspects of 3-D laser machining are disucssed. Results for 3-D laser machining of met- als, ceramics and composites are presented and compared with conventional machining methods. 1991 SAE Transactions Section 5 910956. Chatter reduction in machine tools. B. P. Bandyopad- hyay, Mech. Engrg. Dept., University of North Dakota ; and R. K. Bhatacharya, Dept. of Civil Engrg. and Construction, Bradley Univ. In machining processes, self excited vibration or chatter is often a source of problems associated with poor surface finish and reduced tool life. Chatter has been recognized as the critical factor limiting productivity, since it prevents the full utilization of the installed power of the machine tool. The basic cause of chatter is the dynamic interaction of the cutting process and the machine tool structure. Chatter in the cutting process can be significantly reduced by altering the machine tool structure design and also by controlling the machining process. Two methods of reducing machine tool chatter will be addressed in this paper. First, the improvement in the design of the machine tool by selecting non- traditional structural material, and second, ways of improving the machining process will be discussed. 910957. An enhanced computer-based process simulation model for the cylinder boring process. S. G. Kapoor and R. E. DeVor, Dept. of Mech. and Industrial Engrg., University of Illinois at Urbana-Champa ; and Richard D. Skarvan, Ejector Systems, Inc. This paper discusses an advanced computer-based process simulation model to predict cutting forces and surface error (also referred to as the lack of cylindricity) for the cylinder boring pro- cess. The model takes into consideration several enhanced fea- tures including dual and multiple-cylinder boring, back-boring, boring in the presence of windows/cavities, etc. The model makes use of a finite element product model and the cutting force pro- cess model to generate a surface error profile at any axial level in the cylinder bore. A design of experiment approach is employed to study the influence of various process variables on bore surface error. The enhanced process simulation model may be used as a valuable tool in enhancing the simultaneous engineering of prod- ucts and manufacturing process. 910958. Improvement of roller bearing fatigue life by surface roughness modification. Yoshinobu Akamatsu, Noriyuki Tsu- shima, Toshihide Goto, Kenji Hibi, and Kunio Itoh, NTN Corp. In order to prolong rolling bearing fatigue life under mixed or boundary lubrication conditions, we have developed a specific smooth surface with small indentations by using the concept of micro EHL (elastohydrodynamic lubrication). These indenta- tions or pits act as a carrier of lubricant from the inlet to the inside of the contact area. Therefore, lubrication performance of this surface is better than that of a superfinished surface. We have already demonstrated the ability of forming an oil film using this proposed surface. However, reliability of fatigue life for this surface was not sufficiently investigated. Therefore, we have conducted several rolling bearing fatigue life tests with this surface as compared to a superfinished surface. Lambda val- ues of these tests were from 0.45 to 2.10. Results of these tests indicated that the life of the bearings containing rollers with this surface texture was between 2.0 to 13 times longer than that of normal bearings. 1991 SAE Transactions Section 2 910959. Contaminant sensitivity of hydraulic pumps - Development of the ISO/DIS 9632 test method. Alan Crook, BHR Group Ltd. The author presents the philosophies that led to the develop- ment of the test method that allows comparison of different fixed displacement pumps under 'normal' operating conditions and 'failure' conditions such as, the ingression or generation of large- sized contaminant. This proposed test method can be completed in one working day and represents the culmination of considerable international effort and co-operation. 1991 SAE Transactions Section 2 910960. Determining valve contaminant sensitivity effect using two contaminants. John G. Eleftherakis, Fluid Technologies, Inc. 125</page><page sequence="125">910960-910967 This paper reports on a study that investigated the effect of composite contaminants on the wear of ball type valves. The objective was to develop a contamination control theory for pre- dicting valve contaminant service life based on various mixture ratios of a silica test contaminant and a ferrous test contaminant. Filter specifications were determined which ensure valve con- taminant service life. Theoretical considerations drew on contamination control theory and new relationships are introduced which account for ball valve wear due to two contaminants. Experimental tests were conducted with the Zeta test machine to establish particle abra- sivity ratings and with the valve contaminant test stand to deter- mine valve pressure degradation to contamination. It was found that less abrasive particles result in less valve per- formance degradation. This result substantiated the theoretical expressions relating the valve wear composite contaminant sensi- tivity coefficients. 1991 SAE Transactions Section 2 910961. Contamination sensitivity of mobile hydraulic propor- tional valves. Thomas S. Wanke , Milwaukee School of Engrg., Fluid Power Institute. This paper describes a procedure for determining performance degradation of mobile hydraulic proportional valves when sub- jected to various particle size ranges and concentration levels of AC Fine and Coarse Test Dust. The procedure was applied to both poppet and sliding spool type valves used as both pilot and main stages. 910962. Biodegradable hydraulic lubricant an overview of cur- rent developments in central Europe. Hans F. Eichenberger, Cat- erpillar Overseas S.A. This paper discusses various aspects of: biodegradable hydrau- lic lubricants; the type of bio-oils (biodegradable) available; the approved test method of bio-oils; a label called blue angel used for the identification of environment friendly products; bio-oil applications; practical field test experience and economic impact. The paper provides a general overview of the current situation in Central Europe. Practical experience with environment-friendly oil and grease has been known for over 4,000 years. When the pyramids were built, animal and vegetable oil and grease was used to lubricate transport sledges. At that time, it was not an environmental pro- tection consideration. Today it is our challenge to protect people, plants and animals. Who would have thought that environmental protection would become such an important and inevitable issue? Five or ten years ago words like biodegradable, environment-friendly, environment-compatible were definitions hardly known to most people. Today, the situation has changed. Many local and federal government regulations have been introduced and initiatives have been taken by the industry and the private sector in order to reduce pollution and better protect our environment. Every part of our daily life is faced with the issue. This paper concen- trates on biodegradable hydraulic lubricants, which represents a small segment of the overall environment issue. 910963. Biodegradable fluids for axial piston pumps and motors - Application considerations. Stanley D. Scott , Rexroth Corp. The use of environmentally acceptable hydraulic fluids in mobile machines is becoming more prevalent worldwide, as a way to reduce the pollution of the environment. These fluids are biodegradable, and therefore do not damage the forests, soil, or ground water when accidentally leaked from hydraulic powered machinery. There are three types of environmentally acceptable hydraulic fluids currently available. These fluids are either vegetable oil based, synthetic polyglycol based, or synthetic ester based. Each of these fluids has characteristics that differ from conventional mineral oil. This paper discusses the characteristics of the various types of environmentally acceptable hydraulic fluids, and application considerations for their use with heavy duty axial piston pumps and motors. The selection of an environmentally acceptable fluid for new machine use, as well as for conversion of existing mineral oil equipped machines is discussed. 910964. Biodegradable and nontoxic hydraulic oils. V. M. Cheng, A. A. W es sol, P. Baudouin, M. T. BenKinney, and N. J. Novick, Mobil Oil Corp. In response to the growing industry interest in environmen- tally acceptable (EA) lubricants, a hydraulic oil development pro- gram was initiated with these express objectives: 1) define the environmental impact and performance expectations for a lubri- cant used in applications where inadvertent leakage to the envi- ronment may occur and 2) develop a new product which degrades rapidly and is nontoxic to fish while providing satisfactory field performance in severe applications. This paper will first review the current regulatory initiatives and proposed ecotox test requirements for this class of lubricant. In addition, ecotox data for the candidate fluids will be presented along with recommendations aimed at more clearly defining the test requirements and limits. Lubricant performance data, including laboratory evaluation and field experience, for a vegetable-based hydraulic fluid will be presented, identifying both performance strengths and weak- nesses. 910965. The development of environmentally acceptable hydraulic oil formulations. Jonathan M. Wain, Lubrizol Corp. In the automobile and earthmoving market place, consumer pressure is creating a demand for more environmentally consid- erate products. One aspect of this definition is biodegradability. In the forestry and farming industries where lubricant losses and spillages are recognised as a significant potential hazard, the use of these products is now widespread and in terms of environ- mental protection, the benefits are multiple. This paper discusses technical developments based on vegeta- ble oils, including an assessment of additive requirements to meet performance needs. It also reviews necessary work to define other aspects of performance. 910966. Shaft seals - Trends and developments for off high- way heavy equipment applications. Robert Bond, Ronald A. Jac- kowski, and James P. Morley, CR Industries. The paper will review existing seals used in off-highway heavy equipment, both radial lip seal applications and face type seal applications in general use on track vehicles. With the trend toward improved reliability and durability, together with the never ending quest for quality and product improvements, the paper will discuss a number of seal development programs which will result in products that meet the new and projected future requirements for seals from the off-highway heavy equipment manufacturers. 910967. FKM and HSN materials for diesel engine cylinder liner seals. Robert W. Keller and Bruce E. Gray, Wynn's - Precision, Inc. Diesel engine cylinder liner seals present an application envi- ronment difficult for many seal elastomers. These cylinder liner seals must resist high temperature oil from the crank case as well as water based coolants. High performance nitrile materials have found application in this area due to their resistance to oil and to water and steam. However, nitriles lack the long term heat resistance for long mileage applications in hotter running engines. Fluorocarbons generally have excellent resistance to oil and high 126</page><page sequence="126">910967-910996 temperatures but suffer from poor long term resistance to steam and water. This paper discusses fluorocarbons recently developed with greatly improved steam resistance along with compression set resistant highly saturated nitriles for these cylinder liner seal applications. Accelerated testing in application environments as well as methods for selecting the best material for the cylinder liner seal application will be discussed. 910968. Nonlinear finite element analysis in the closed loop seal design cycle. Vinay Nilkanth, R&amp;D Parker Seals; and Alan Campbell , Packing Div.y Parker Seals. Both static and dynamic seals have been designed in the past, primarily on the basis of prior experience, part prototyping, and extensive experimental testing. But, with the advent of nonlinear finite element analysis (FEA), the seal design process is changing from "black magic" to a more fundamental and scientific approach. The overall design cycle is shortened and testing parameters are explored and evaluated utilizing FEA. Correlation between FEA predictions and test results lead to a more optimal interconnection of material and design for sealing applications. This paper discusses two specific applications of nonlinear FEA involving an O-ring and a U-cup seal design. The evaluation of appropriate material constants for two elastomeric compounds and their direct applications in FEA models are discussed here with an experimental correlation. This study concludes that the nonlinear FEA method can be utilized for performance evaluation of a seal design before actual fabrication and lend guidance to testing parameter selection and interpretations. 910969. Effective noise control using fibrous glass for insula- tion and interior trim panels. Timothy R. Nemeth and W. Kirk- land Cunningham, PresGlas Corp. Control of sound levels in vehicles is becoming an integral part of the design criteria used by vehicle and equipment design- ers. Standards are in place which require noise control and the consumers are demanding the control for the safety and produc- tivity of their workers. Molded fiber glass offers solutions to the noise control prob- lems as well as providing many other product benefits. The fiber glass can be easily molded into parts of various shapes and densi- ties that provide both acoustical and thermal control for the ser- vice life of the system. The fiber glass parts offer consistent performance with mini- mum variation from part to part. This effective and consistent performance allows a designer to be more confident that a given design will perform as intended. 910990. A computational model for the analysis of finite wings in potential flow. Roberto Rosati and Michael Papadakis, Wichita State JJniv. A non-planar vortex lattice method (VLM) has been com- bined with a two-dimensional surface panel method for comput- ing the aerodynamic characteritics of finite wings in incompress- ible inviscid flow. This numerical model can be applied to wings with thickness and arbitrary planform, and requires very little computing time when compared to three-dimensional surface panel methods currently in use. The formulation of the present method is described in detail, and results from its application to three wing configurations are presented. The results obtained using the present method are compared with results obtained using the VSAERO code and with experimental data. Good cor- relation is demonstrated in all cases. 910991. A vortex lattice model for delta wings with bursting. Barnes W. McCormick, Pennsylvania State Univ. The problem considered here is that of predicting the nonlin- ear behavior of delta wings at moderately high angles of attack and low speeds. In this operating regime, vortex lift and vortex bursting are important in determining the aerodynamic forces on the wing. The analysis begins with a vortex-lattice model to deter- mine the circulatory lift and the leading-edge suction force. The vortex lift is then calculated from the suction force assuming that the leading edge vortices have not burst. The circulatory and vor- tex lift are then corrected for vortex bursting and flow separation using a semi-empirical approach to estimate the burst locations of the leading edge vortices. 1 991 SAE Transactions Section 1 910992. TVD formulations of the 2D Navier-Stokes equations for airfoil analysis. S. Reddy, S. Klausmeyer, X. Liu, and Michael Papadakis, Wichita State Univ. The application of total variation diminishing (TVD) implicit and explicit schemes to transonic flow around airfoils is pres- ented. Several upwind and symmetric TVD flux limiters from the non-MUSCL family are examined and compared with Jameson's nonlinear artificial dissipation model. Inviscid results indicate that TVD schemes reduce shock smearing while practically elimi- nating numerical oscillations. Analytical results are presented for a NACA 0012 airfoil for various transonic flow conditions using TVD formulations of the 2D Navier-Stokes equations. Compari- sons of computed results with experimental data show good agreement. 910994. The evolution of an airline - Piedmont Airlines 1948 - 1989. R. S. Macklin, Piedmont Airlines - Retired ; and H.

Application of computational aeroacoustic methodolo- gies to advanced propeller configurations - A review. Kenneth D. Korkan, Lisa A. Eagleson, and Robert C. Griffiths, Texas A&amp;M Univ. A number of theoretical investigations have been conducted in the development of the design and analysis of advanced pro- peller configurations. Lock and Theodorsen as described by Davidson have been utilized to study counterrotating propeller systems. A different numerical method known as "SSTAGE", which is an Euler solver for the unducted fan (UDF) concept, was used to predict the acoustic near field that compared well with experimental data. The NASPROP-E numerical analysis also consisting of an Euler solver has been used to theoretically study the near acoustic fields for the SR series propfan configurations. A counterrotating propeller test rig (CRPTR) was designed and built to obtain an experimental performance/acoustic data base for various propeller configurations for means of comparison with theoretical predictions. 1991 SAE Transactions Section 1 127</page><page sequence="127">910997-911004 910997.

The paper will review operating experience of the present day composite bladed propellers which have been in service for over 10 years. Topics will include how the composite blade has coped with the commuter environment, how effective is electronic con- trol and how service life is being developed. Prospects for future developments are addressed as the com- muter market moves forward to the high speed turboprop and is challenged by the Regional Jet. 910998. Experimental results of a propeller/wing interaction study. Robert T. Johnston , School of Aeronautics and Astronau- tics , Purdue Univ.; David P. Witkowski , Boeing Commercial Air- craft Co.; and John P. Sullivan , School of Aeronautics and Astronautics , Purdue Univ. The aerodynamic interaction between a propeller and a wing is a source of noise and cyclic loading. Swirl and increased axial velocity in a propeller slipstream can lead to improvement in wing performance, conversely wing performance can be degraded by flow separations caused by the propeller slipstream. Steady state measurements were done on a propeller and a wing in a tractor configuration, to investigate the consequences of mutual interference on overall performance. These measure- ments revealed that for certain geometries wing lift is enhanced, and wing drag is decreased. A straight forward physical explana- tion for this wing behaviour is offered. The unsteady nature of the propeller-wing aerodynamic inter- action has been studied using flow visualization. Studying the motion of the propeller tip vortex across the wing revealed that: the tip vortex was servered at the wing leading edge, the severed tip vortex filaments shear in a spanwise direction relative to one another, and these displaced filaments deform to reconnect at the trailing edge. Not only is this information of vortex motion over a wing of interest from a basic hydrodynamic view, but will aid in the interpretation of future unsteady pressure measurements. 1991 SAE Transactions Section 1 910999. The modernization of military piston engine aviation 011 specifications. John T. S him ski, Naval Air Propulsion Center; and Douglas F. Mearns , Naval Air Systems Command. In the early 1960,s the U.S. Military began to gradually phase- out piston engined aircraft from its inventory in favor of gas tur- bine powered aircraft. The emphasis of the aviation industry on the development of the new gas turbine engines and their atten- dant new synthetic lubricants resulted in the rapid decline of new oil development for aviation piston engines. As a result of this change in focus by the military and commercial engine builders, the maintenance of the MIL-L-6082 and MIL-L-22851 specifica- tions also diminished. After years of decline, commercial interest in these specification products again developed. This paper is an attempt to document the rational used in modernizing these two specifications. 911000. New 150-hour test for SAE and MIL specification approval of aircraft piston-engine lubricants. Charles F. Ziegler, Jr., University of Illinois, Institute of Aviation. Aviation piston engine lubricating oils undergo extensive test- ing prior to their approval for use. During the revision of MIL-L- 22851/J-1966 specifications, it was determined that a standard- ized engine test would be utilized. A Textron-Lycoming TIO-540- J2BD engine was selected as the engine for the 150-hour endur- ance test. Federal Aviation Regulation Part 33 served as the guideline for development of a standardized test specifically aimed at lubricating oil evaluation. This paper discusses this new 150-hour endurance test for pis- ton engine lubricants used to gain SAE and MIL approval. This new test was conducted at the University of Illinois-Institute of Aviation during 1990. 911001. ASTM activities related to future fuels for general avi- ation. Cesar Gonzalez, Cessna Aircraft Co. It is considered a matter of vital international interest to assure the survival of general aviation and to consolidate its important role in the overall transportation picture around the globe. However, in spite of plentiful supplies of crude, the general aviation industry has suffered severe set-backs in recent years due in part to increased costs and decreasing availability of aviation gasolines. The vulnerability of these fuel supplies is now well sub- stantiated and a concerted effort involving fuel producers, gen- eral aviation manufacturers, specifications and standards writers such as The American Society for Testing and Materials (ASTM) and The Society of Automotive Engineers (SAE), and the user groups is required to establish long-range strategies in this area. Since 1981, Cessna Aircraft has performed extensive studies and related supportive research activities on current typical gen- eral aviation intermittent combustion powerplants, and power- plants envisioned for development within a time frame of 20 years. This paper reflects on generalized results of these efforts and the results of a close surveillance of similar related efforts in the United States and abroad. The potential impact of various avia- tion and currently non-aviation fuels on said future powerplant development activities are covered. Further, the continuing need for assuring acceptable fuel characteristics at the point of aircraft refueling is the key to the safety and success of future activities. ASTM activities related to the development of new specifica- tions or revisions or both to existing specifications, considered indispensable to support general aviation fuel requirements envi- sioned for the future, are defined with justifications for those activities. 911003. Development and certification flight test on the Piag- gio P.180 "Avanit" aircraft: A general overview. S. Martini and P. Cinquetti, Flight Test Dept., I.A.M.R. Piaggio S. p. A.; and R. de'Pompeis, Flight Test Dept., I.M.A.R. Piaggio S.p.A. The aim of this paper is to present the program worked-out for the certification flight test of the Piaggio P.180 "Avanti" aircraft and the results obtained, with particular care to the test items devoted to the peculiar characteristics of the airplane (three lift- ing surfaces, rearback main wing, pushing propellers, high aero- dynamics efficiency) and requiring a specific project manage- ment. During the whole flight test program such extensive investiga- tions looked at: 1) high angle of attack stability and control; 2) longitudinal control during changes of lifting configurations; 3) propeller stress; 4) in-flight loads; 5) artificial and natural icing tests; 6) taxing and running on wet runway (splash tests); and 7) natural laminar flow tests. Focusing these fundamental areas the present paper gives in the meantime a general overview of the development flight tests performed on the aircraft that achieved more than 2000 flight hours reaching the initial RAI (Italian) certification and FAA cer- tification on spring 1990. 911004. Artificial and natural icing conditions flight tests on the Piaggio P.180 "Avanti" aircraft. S. Martini and P. Cinquetti, Flight Test Dept., I.A.M.R. Piaggio S.p.A.; and R. de*Pompeis, Flight Test Dept., I.M.A.R. Piaggio S.p.A. The icing tests carried out on the Piaggio P.180 "Avanti" air- craft throughout development and certification program are herein described from preliminary evaluation in wind-tunnel tests to real flight in artificial icing conditions realized behind U.S. Air Force air tanker NKC-135 and, finally, to natural ice tests performed in a wide range of atmospheric environments comprehensive of a wide range of average liquid water contents, cloud droplets median volume diameter and static temperature obtained in significant icing conditions. Slight discrepancies 128</page><page sequence="128">911004-911021 between data in artificial and natural tests have been discovered and herein discussed. 911006. In-flight off-surface flow visualization using infrared imaging. Gregory S . Manuel Kamran Daryabeigl David W. Al de rf er y and Clifford J. Obara, NASA Langley Research Center. A flight test investigation was conducted to evaluate an infra- red (IR) imaging technique to visualize off-surface flow phenom- ena. A single-engine, general-aviation airplane was equipped with an IR imaging system that viewed the region around the left wing- tip. Vortical flow at the wingtip was seeded with sulfur hexafluo- ride, a gas with strong infrared absorbing and emitting character- istics. Different terrain and sky back-grounds were evaluated for their effect on IR images of vortical flow. The best IR images were obtained with a clear sky background. The results of the investi- gation indicate that IR flow visualization compliments existing smoke generator methods for off-surface flow visualization. 1991 SAE Transactions Section 1 911008. Automatic flight control system Honeywell SPZ-7600 (AFCS) for search and rescue helicopters. Brett Eddy, Honeywell Inc. During a search and rescue (SAR) mission, the helicopter pilot is often faced with difficult and adverse conditions that increase his workload to the point of affecting his capability to safely con- duct the mission. Since these are often the same conditions that initiate the rescue mission, it is imperative that the pilot be given additional tools and assistance necessary to safely continue the flight. One way to greatly reduce pilot workload is to provide an automatic flight control system (AFCS). Of particular importance is an AFCS that can automatically guide the aircraft through vari- ous SAR approach, hover, and climb maneuvers, allowing the pilot to simply monitor the aircraft systems. An SAR mode recently developed by Honeywell, Mark-on-Target, will be dis- cussed here. 911011. Garrett TPF351-20 engine flight test and ground test performance. R. Dee Miller, Garrett Engine Div., Allied-Signal Aerospace Co. The Garrett TPF351-20 engine design program was initated in October of 1989. The engine was selected by Embraer to power the CBA123 "vector", a high-speed commuter "pusher" aircraft. The first engine test was successfully completed on May 19, 1989, nineteen months after design initiation. Subsequent testing has been done on indoor and outdoor propeller test stands at Garrett test facilities. Additionally, testing was successfully completed on Garrett's Boeing 720 flying test bed in July of 1990. An aggressive aircraft test program on the first prototype CBA123 aircraft in Sao Jose dos Campos, Brazil, also began in July of 1990. This was soon followed by a flight of the aircraft to the Farnborough Air Show in September of the same year. This paper describes this test program and some unique features used to expedite the program. 911012. LF500 engines and the regional airline market .Alfred A. Boutin, Textron-Ly coming Div. This discussion outlines some of the major issues that deter- mine the success of a gas turbine engine in the demanding regional airline market. It focuses on the "lessons learned" in the nearly 10 years of operating ALF502 engines in extensive corpo- rate and regional airline operations. Insight is provided on how these "lessons learned" are applied to improve current products and future derivative growth power LF500 series of engines. 911015. Composite prototype aircraft development a method for design, fabrication and test training. George Bennett, John C. McWhorter, Glenn Bryant, Harold Koelling, and G iff or d Bull, Raspet Flight Research Lab., Dept. of Aerospace Engrg., Missis- sippi State Uni. The faculty and staff of the Raspet Flight Research Laboratory (RFRL) have concluded a project with an industrial customer to lead a group of engineers and technicians in a study of the "art" of developing a prototype composite aircraft. The objective was to produce a turbine powered, composite, pressurized, single- engine aircraft, which would introduce the team to the many aspects of a complex aircraft in an environment. 911017. Turboshaft engine development for commercial tiltro- tor aircraft. Howard A. Chambers, Allison Gas Turbine Div., Gen- eral Motors Corp. The civil aircraft market frequently employs propulsion sys- tems originally developed and qualified for military aircraft applications. When this occurs, the civil sector benefits greatly from the lessons learned during the military engine development and qualification process. This paper presents the unique test experiences and lessons learned during development of the T406- AD-400 turboshaft engine that the GMA2100 turboprop, GMA3007 turbofan, and GM Al 107 turboshaft engines will profit from for years to come. Some of these valuable T406 test experiences include: 1) development of engine attitude capabilities, 2) integration with a fly -by-wire control system, 3) incorporation of flight test experi- ence into the engine design, and 4) utilization of unique test facili- ties. 1991 SAE Transactions Section 1 911018. Full authority digital electronic control of Pratt and Whitney 305 turbofan engine. A. Solomon, Pratt and Whitney Canada Inc. In the present competitive aerospace industry, there is an increased demand on the performance and safe operation of the propulsion system in particular for commuter and business air- crafts. Pratt and Whitney Canada has developed the PW305 tur- bofan engine equipped with a full authority digital electronic con- trol (FAD EC) to meet these demands. The control system is designed to provide optimum engine operation within safe limits, reduced pilot workload and high reliability over the whole flight envelope. This paper gives a general overview of the require- ments, development, operability and performance of the PW305 propulsion system. 1 991 SAE Transactions Section 1 911019. Aerodynamic performance of wing-body configura- tions and the flying wing. E. Torenbeek, Dept. of Aerospace Engrg., Delft University of Technology. An elementary analysis has been made of generic wing-body configurations with variable volume allotment in wing and body, for constant total useful volume, including the all-wing configura- tion. These aircraft were compared on the basis of the lift-to-drag (L/D) ratio, for specified flight conditions. In addition the param- eter ML/D for constant correlated thrust has been optimized, resulting in certain combinations of altitude and speed for maxi- mum specific range (if corrected TSFC = constant). Finally, the effect of volume allotment on L/D for given engine size was stud- ied. It has been found that in many cases optimum volume allot- ments indicate that wing-body combinations are to be favored. Only in the case of relatively low Mach numbers and high- altitude flight the flying wing outperforms conventional aircraft, but it will generally require larger engines. 1991 SAE Transactions Section 1 911021. Conceptual design of a starcar. Steven C. Crow, Dept. of Aerospace and Mech. Engrg., University of Arizona. This is the second report about a new program on personal aviation at the University of Arizona. The motive for the pro- gram is a belief that advanced information technologies like the Global Positioning System (GPS) have made possible a personal aviation system on a scale last imagined fifty years ago. Research 129</page><page sequence="129">911021-911041 on differential GPS for precision navigation is described briefly, but the report is mainly about design concepts for a Starcar, a transformer vehicle that functions as an automobile or airplane. A Starcar is a composition of three components: passenger mod- ule, road module, and sky module. The passenger and road mod- ule together make an automobile, and the passenger and sky module are an airplane. Because the road module does not fly, a Starcar in flight provides to be nearly as efficient as the best of modern kit airplanes. 1991 SAE Transactions Section 1 911022. Design developments for advanced general aviation aircraft. Jan Roskam and Charles Gomer ; Aerospace Engrg. Dept., University of Kansas. The preliminary design studies are presented for an advanced general aviation aircraft. Advanced guidance and display con- cepts, laminar flow, smart structures, fuselage and wing structural design and manufacturing, and preliminary configuration design are topics to be discussed. This project was conducted as a gradu- ate level design class under the auspices of the KU/NASA/USRA advanced design program in aeronautics. This paper will present the results obtained during the fall semester of 1990. The project will be continued into the spring semester of 1991. 1991 SAE Transactions Section 1 911023. On the feasibility of small, transcontinental commuter aircraft. Jan Roskam and Kyle Wetzel, Aerospace Engrg. Dept., University of Kansas. Air travelers between medium sized coastal cities in the USA are faced with a major inconvenience: they are forced by existing airline schedules to make at least one stop in a major hub with a change of airplane and, sometimes even a change in air carrier. This inconvenience translates into lost time, missing of a connec- tion due to delays and possible loss of luggage. These inconve- niences could be alleviated if non-stop, coast-to-coast small jet commuters could be designed such they can compete with the existing transcontinental transports on a DOC per passenger seat- mile basis. It is shown that significant advances in aerodynamic and propulsion design technology will be needed to enable the profitable development of such airplanes. 1991 SAE Transactions Section 1 911026. Aerodynamic impact of deicing/anti-icing fluids on commuter aircraft. Edward Lim, Norman D. Ellis, Piers J. Teel- ing, and Shangxiang Zhu, de Havilland Div., Aerodynamics Technology Boeing Canada. To understand the aerodynamic impact of the ground deicing/ anti-icing fluids on commuter aircraft, a wind tunnel test simulat- ing takeoffs of a typical commuter aircraft was conducted at NASA LeRC IRT during early 1990. The results of the tests indi- cate that the fluids remain on the aerodynamic surfaces until well after the simulated takeoffs. Significant degradation on the maxi- mum lift and climb gradient at climb out conditions were observed. The degradation in aerodynamic performance, espe- cially at low temperature, indicates that many of the fluids tested were considered unacceptable relative to flight safety. However, increasing the time to rotation resulted in a substantial improve- ment in the aerodynamic performance to the extent that those fluids became acceptable. 911027. Aerodynamic noise of ground vehicles. Albert R. George and John R. Callister, Sibley School of Mech. and Aero- space Engrg., Cornell Univ. As engine, tire, and other automobile noise is reduced and as driving speeds increase, aerodynamic noise sources on ground vehicles are becoming relatively more important. They often dominate at cruise speeds of 65 mph. Aspiration and leak noise are strong sources but generally can be controlled by known methods. Turbulent pressure fluctuations due to separated and vortical flows are also strong sources. Much interior noise is caused by transmission of these external pressure fluctuations through windows and other surfaces. The paper presents the vari- ety of aeroacoustic sources on automobiles and reviews the state of experimental data, of analysis methods, and noise reduction principles. A new correlation method for predicting external fluc- tuating pressures in separated regions is presented. 911028. EICAS as a modularized aircraft system. Steven M. Kennell, Collins General Aviation, Rockwell International. Today's EICAS is required to functionally integrate a wide variety of systems and information and intelligently utilize this to enhance crew operations, maintenance operations, and aircraft availability. This is accomplished through a modular system architecture and LRU design which supports flexibility, growth, and uniqueness, and also recognizes the need to minimize the development costs during the design cycle of a new aircraft or major aircraft update. 911029. Multi-process multi-material case study. Christopher L. Clark, G E Plastics. When GE Plastics entered the multi-process multi-material arena with the construction and installation of Alpha I in its Pitts- field, MA headquarters, it recognized that if plastics are to con- tinue to provide revolutionary products, the industry must expand its thinking beyond current single process applications. Multi-process parts must be developed to demonstrate to the automotive industry a new generation of applications. The purpose of this paper is twofold: to explain the value of multi-process multi-material technology and to present an engi- neering analysis of the system which addresses design and pro- cessing questions. 911030. Pusher turboprop installation technology for the Embraer CBA-123 vector. R. S. Reuland, Garrett Engine Div., Allied-Signal Aerospace Inc. In late 1987, the Garrett Engine Division of the Allied-Signal Aerospace Company contracted with Embraer of Sao Jose, Brazil to build a modern free-turbine turboprop to power the new 19- passenger CBA-123 commuter aircraft. Designated the TPF351-20, this 2100 thermodynamic shp turboprop was devel- oped using proven components from other new engine designs. It was the first Garrett turboprop to incorporate full authority digital electronic control (FADEC) and provide advanced com- ponent technologies to yield optimum powerplant efficiencies. A great deal of effort was expended on maintainability features including individual mechanical component accessibility and FADEC diagnostic capabilities. Since each new aircraft power- plant installation requires special consideration of overall aircraft design goals and specific physical limitations, this paper discusses both the CBA-123 powerplant installation development as it relates to the pusher engine configuration and the engineering studies involved in meeting the basic design goals of the aircraft. 1991 SAE Transactions Section 1 911041. (P-244) A simulation method of rear axle gear noise. Naoto Hirasaka, Hiroshi Sugita, and M akoto Asai, Toyota Motor Corp. A new experimental method, that enables to estimate the body and driveline sensitivity to unit transmitting error of a hypoid gear for automotive rear axle gear noise, has been developed. Measurements were made by exciting the tooth of the drive- pinion gear and that of the ring gear separately using the special devices designed with regard to simulation of acceleration and deceleration. The characteristic of this method is to estimate the forces at the contact point of the gears. Estimation of these forces is carried out under the condition that the higher stiffness is pro- vided by the tooth of the drive-pinion gear and that of the ring gear, compared with the stiffness of the driveshafts and that of the propeller shaft etc., and relative angular displacement of the tor- 130</page><page sequence="130">911041-911049 sional vibration between the teeth of the drive-pinion gear and those of the ring gear is constant. This method is effective to ana- lyze a driveline system which transforms relative angular dis- placement between the drive-pinion gear and the ring gear into the forces at the contact point of the gears, and provides an insight into how each component should be designed to obtain further reduction of rear axle gear noise. Practical applications are also discussed. 1991 SAE Transactions Section 6 911042. (P-244) New approach to low-noise air intake system development. Yoshitaka Nishio and Tokio Kohama, Mippondenso Co., Ltd.; and Osamu Kuroda, Toyota Motor Corp. Recently, the quietness of the passenger compartment has become an important quality for a vehicle, and as a result, vari- ous improvements have been made to reduce the passenger com- partment noise level. Particularly engine noise, a major source of interior noise, has been studied for many years and has recently been reduced to an acceptable level. As a result, air intake noise, which was a relatively minor noise source in the past, has rapidly become a noticeable noise source. This paper describes a newly developed air intake system test- ing apparatus, which enables us to evaluate intake noise at an early stage of engine development and also describes how the new apparatus and approach was used to develop a low-noise air intake system. This apparatus, called the Pulsation Simulator, reproduces intake pulsations in the actual engine using its cylinder head and reproduces intake air flow precisely. Generally, in the past, intake system development was conducted by giving priority to engine volumetric efficiency. By the use of the apparatus, however, study for intake noise reduction can be started at an early stage of engine development and in parallel with the study of volumet- ric efficiency. Thus, the apparatus enables us to establish intake system designs which satisfy both the volumetric efficiency and intake noise requirements at an earlier stage than ever before. 1991 SAE Transactions Section 6 911043. (P-244) Suspension related low frequency rear drum brake noise. Paul D. Halloran and Patricia L. Hetherington, Cur- rent Product Engrg., General Motors Corp. The combination of vibrational analysis, empirical testing, and consistent test methodology led to the understanding and elimination of low frequency drum brake noise. Each of the above items served an important role in elimination of the noise. The following report explains each role and how together they led to a solution. 1991 SAE Transactions Section 6 911044. (P-244) Reduction of idling rattle noise in trucks. Yasushi Chikatani and Akio Suehiro, Mitsubishi Motors Corp. Optimization of the clutch torsional characteristics is one of the effective methods to reduce the idling rattle noise. Many researches on this problem have been reported, but only few of them give sufficient consideration to the drag torque applied to the clutch disc during engine idling. This paper pays attention to the drag torque and discusses the mechanism of idling rattle noise by using vehicle testing, bench test with rotating torsional exciter and computer simulation. 911045. (P-244) Development of a prototype active muffler for the Detroit Diesel 6V-92 TA industrial engine. E verett Arnold and Warner Frazer, Detroit Diesel Corp.; and W. J. J. Höge, Noise Cancellation Technologies, Inc. This paper describes the successful development of an active muffler system for the Detroit Diesel 6V-92TA industrial diesel engine used in a generator set application. The active muffler analyzes the structure of the exhaust sound and generates 'anti-noise' through loudspeakers. The 'anti-noise' is equal in magnitude and 180 degrees out of phase with the exhaust sound. The exhaust sound and 'anti-noise' cancel each other at the exhaust outlet. Adaptive filter techniques are used to update the 'anti-noise' signal in response to changes in engine operating conditions. This technique is effective at frequencies less than 500 Hz, where a significant portion of the exhaust sound is concentrated. Combined with a low flow restriction passive silencer to attenu- ate primarily high frequency sound, exhaust noise is reduced well below levels emitted by conventional passive mufflers. The final prototype active muffler system included a three driver loudspeaker active element and low flow restriction pas- sive element. This design produced exhaust sound levels 6 dB to 13 dB quieter than levels emitted by the best conventional pas- sive muffler tested. The combined active and passive element system substantially reduced exhaust restriction, improving aver- age fuel economy almost 2%. The active muffler system also occupied 24% less space than the best conventional passive muf- fler. 911046. (P-244) Active control of simulated road noise. W. Brent Ferren and Robert J. Bernhard, Ray W. Herrick Labs., School of Mech. Engrg., Purdue Univ. Active noise control is a potential method for controlling trou- blesome low frequency road noise in the passenger cabin of auto- mobiles. In this investigation, the control of simulated road noise in a four door automobile is studied. Active control of road noise requires that the inputs to the controller sense a signficant part of the energy causing the noise. Only the coherent energy between the input sensors and the performance microphone is controlla- ble. An investigation is conducted of the control achievable using accelerometers mounted at various positions near the rear wheel of the vehicle as inputs to the controller. The best input sensor location was used with a commercial active noise controller to reduce simulated road noise near the driver's head location. The measured reduction is compared with the results predicted using the coherence. Additional controller simulations were developed to predict and better understand the performance of various con- troller types in this automobile. 1991 SAE Transactions Section 6 911048. (P-244) Standardization of a test track surface for use during vehicle noise testing. Ulf Sandberg, Swedish Road and Traffic Research Institute. A group within the International Organization for Standard- ization has worked out a standard for a road surface intended to be used during vehicle noise measurements according to the ISO 362 and 7188 procedures. The surface should be equally suited for use in similar measuring procedures where full-throttle opera- tion of vehicles is needed and where the influence of the surface on noise emission and propagation must be kept at a minimum. Several test tracks have been laid according to the proposed specifications. A round robin test has been conducted in which five cars and one truck were run on a number of test tracks in Europe and Japan. The results show that the surface meets the basic requirements of giving low tire/road noise while still having negligible sound absorption characteristics. Also, the site-to-site variability is low. In this paper, the convener of the working group presents the work and a preliminary proposal. The final proposal is scheduled to be presented in the summer of 1991. 1 991 SAE Transactions Section 6 911049. (P-244) Improved noise and vibration development by employing computer aided testing (CAT). Klaus Rachow and Klaus Hieronimus, General Motors Europe. With the project presented here GME/OPELwas not only able to increase its noise and vibration test capacity but to rearrange the way tests are prepared, performed, and finally utilized. 131</page><page sequence="131">911049-911058 The major objective was to improve the value of test results for project work by employing a completely integrated test acqui- sition/storage/retrieval system. Four aspects were mainly considered: first, standardization of tests with fixed parameter settings of test and measurement equipment. Second, detailed test description of the test object. Third, a common data base for all valid test data. This implied a common data format regardless of type and origin of data. Fourth, a powerful test retrieval and analysis system. With the new acoustic data information system of networked data acquisition, analysis workstations, and a data bank server the engineer will be able to acquire, store, retrieve and process the test data in a completely new way. 911051. (P-244) Combining accelerated laboratory durability with squeak and rattle evaluation. Aaron Hurd, EG&amp;G Structural Kinematics. The laboratory test method described in this paper combines a standard squeak and rattle evaluation technique with acceler- ated durability cycling. The paper discusses the test setup and control method, the choice of measurement location, and the technique enabling an equivalent customer usage life of durabil- ity cycling to be compressed into weeks rather than months or years. In addition, the industry has already developed tempera- ture and humidity profiles for instrument panel testing and the paper suggests how these can be added to the durability cycling and squeak and rattle evaluation to produce a more complete test. 911052. (P-244) Determination of structural damping using the impulse response function. Svend G ade and Henrik Herlufsen, Briiel &amp; Kjšaer. This paper shows how the impulse response of each individual resonance in a frequency response function is calculated via a series of weighting functions and then used for damping calcula- tions. The technique is not new but previously it has been indicated that when using pseudo-random excitation, T&gt; 2.5t must be ful- filled in order to make accurate damping measurements, where T is the fast fourier transform record length and t is the decay constant of the damping. It is shown that tolerable damping estimates can be made even if the record length T is as small as 0.05 t. This is because the short record length produces an aliasing phenomena on the amplitude of the impulse response function only - not on the slope of the decay. 1991 SAE Transactions Section 6 911053. (P-244) Noise and vibration control measures in the powertrain of passenger cars. Peter Schwibinger, David Hendrick, Wei Wu, and Yasuhiro Imanishi, Freu den berg- NOK. The paper describes a theoretical and experimental approach to solve vibration and noise problems in the powertrain with vibration control products on an elastomer basis. Crankshaft dampers can reduce the torsional, and, if properly tuned and designed - also the bending vibrations. The paper compares the crankshaft vibrations for different damper designs which shows the potential for further vibration and noise reduc- tions. Shafts in the drivetrain are excited to torsional and bending vibrations by the inertia and gas forces of the engine, cardan joints and gear mesh. For the following two problems vibrations and noise are investigated: 1) a torsional resonance of a driveshaft; and 2) a bending resonance of a halfshaft. Measurements show that noise and vibrations from the dri- vetrain can also be reduced significantly with tuned elastomer dampers. 911054. (P-244) Some results concerning the effect of stochas- tic parameters on engine mount system behavior. W. F. Resh, Chrysler Motors Corp. Vehicle noise, vibration, and harshness (NVH) development typically assumes that the vehicles behave deterministically, both individually and among vehicles of the same model line and equipment level. While the deterministic assumption is true in neither case, for NVH development on an individual vehicle, the vehicle can be considered as a deterministic system responding to stochastic inputs. However, even among nominally identical vehicles, the allowable assembly and parameter tolerances result in some variability in vehicle characteristics and responses. Char- acterizing the expected variability would provide a number of benefits, such as helping to identify system parameters that NVH behavior is sensitive to, determining how well a NVH vehicle sys- tem model should be expected to correlate with test, and provid- ing guides to determine when vehicle NVH behavior is signifi- cantly abnormal enough to merit a diagnostic investigation. This work investigates one aspect of vehicle system variabil- ity, the dynamic characteristics of the engine mount system due to stochastic mount stiffnesses. Both closed form analytical meth- ods and numerical simulations are addressed as evaluation meth- ods. Results are presented for a number of mount system configu- rations and illustrate the range of variability of mount system natural frequencies. 1991 SAE Transactions Section 6 911055. (P-244) Optimum design method for hydraulic engine mounts. Kazuto Seto and Katsumi Sawatari, National Defense Academy; Akio Nagamatsu, Tokyo Institute of Technology ; and Masao Ishihama and Kazuhiro Doi, Nissan Motor Co., Ltd. Hydraulic engine mounts (HEM) are replacing conventional rubber mounts to provide better ride quality and to reduce noise. However, detailed analysis of the HEM is needed to predict ideal performance conditions. In this study, the optimum design of a HEM is modelled using design optimization theory for a dynamic absorber. After determining ideal behavior by simulation, an experimental mounts is designed and tested to verify the model. 1991 SAE Transactions Section 6 911057.

The paper quantifies the vibrational acceleration of the main bearings and engine noise of an 8.2 litre, six-cylinder, turbochar- ged diesel engine before and after the removal of the crankshaft balance weights and reviews their properties in both time and fre- quency domains. The change in the axial vibration of the middle bearing and the corresponding change in the emitted engine noise measured at the RHS (right hand side) of the engine are corre- lated. A similar correlation is observed between the change in the axial vibration of the frontal bearing and the corresponding change in the emitted engine noise measured at the engine front. It is shown that the removal of the balance weights has not resulted any consistent increase of the emitted noise level, in fact at some running conditions the noise level is lower. The removal of the balance weights tends to reduce the mid and high frequency level of axial vibration. The increase in amplitude of the second harmonic of the bear- ing loads at the higher engine speeds could give rise to a deteriora- tion in fatigue life of the crankshaft and bearings. 132</page><page sequence="132">911059-911065 911059. (P-244) Consideration of a new type two-mass fly- wheel. Ken-ishi Yamamoto, Mitsuhiro Umeyama, Hiroyuki Ishikawa, and Toshihiro Otake, Toyota Motor Corp.; and Kiyon- ori Kobayashi, Aisin Seiki Co., Ltd. Recently two-mass flywheels have adopted in various types of engines to decrease torsional engine vibrations. A two-mass fly- wheel has a resonance frequency below the idle speed. Thus, it must be provided with an energy dissipating mechanism to avoid a resonance problem. Consequently, flywheel's damping effec- tiveness at practical engine speeds is decreased because the energy dissipating mechanism restricts relative displacement of the two- mass flywheel. In this work, a new prototype two-mass flywheel was evaluated and found to be effective in improving two impor- tant qualities of such devices: 1) its ability to decrease torsional vibrations and 2) its ability to avoid resonance problems during engine startup. 1991 SAE Transactions Section 6 911060. (P-244) Vibration due to piston slap and combustion in gasoline and diesel engines. K. C. Vora andB. Ghosh, Automo- tive Research Association of India. The paper describes investigations on the vibration character- istics of a gasoline engine due to piston slap and a diesel engine due to combustion. Engine parameters and vibration data were recorded and time series signals were obtained. The effect of speed, load and other engine parameters on vibration is investi- gated. Vibration due to piston slap is analysed with reference to major-minor thrust relationship, cylinder to cylinder variation, piston-slap force diagram and vibration-frequency curves. The experimental results suggest that all reciprocating engines would exhibit a complex vibration pattern due to piston slap at har- monic series of discrete frequencies, and the reason for this is analysed. The vibration transmitted by engine structure in response to the in-cylinder pressure development is termed here as Vibration due to combustion' and is assessed from the spectrum of the com- bustion pressure curves and their derivatives in terms of time. It is found that for an engine under the same running conditions, cases with higher values of pressure derivatives result in higher engine vibration level. 911061. (P-244) Improvement of DOHC valve train noise by analysis of valve and tappet movement. Eiichi Kamiyama and Shigeki Yasuhara, Toyota Motor Corp. The noise generation mechanism of a direct-acting valve train such as used in sporty and luxury cars was determined for both mechanical and hydraulic tappets through measurements of sound pressure levels and vibrations and the use of computer graphics to observe actual valve and tappet movement. Two phenomena were clarified: chatter at low engine speeds and a mechanical noise at high engine speeds. Further experi- ments established that the noise of a mechanical tappet can be greatly reduced and its tonal quality improved by optimizing the cam profile and by increasing the acoustic damping ratio of the tappet. 1991 SAE Transactions Section 6 911062. (P-244) Investigations on valve train noise in multi- valve engines. H. J. Kaiser ; R. Deges, D. Schwarz, and J. Meyer, Forward Engine Engrg., Ford Werke AG. Due to the high amount of valve train noise in multi-valve engines measures were developed to reduce this noise. These measures are dynamically optimized profiles and cam phasing (small angular shift between neighbored cams). Both measures show a drastic reduction in valve train noise and also overall engine noise but do not have any negative effects on perfor- mance, economy and costs. Not only overall noise is improved but also sound quality especially impulsiveness characterized by the Kurtosis factor. To assess these design changes with respect to radiated noise in the early design stage an estimation method was used. The estimation method is based on the calculated force and velocity time histories and shows good correlation with the measured data. 1991 SAE Transactions Section 6 911063. (P-244) Vibration analysis of engine timing chain drives with camshaft torsional excitations. K. W. Wang, Mech. Engrg. Dept., Pennsylvania State Univ. A recent experimental observation has shown that torsional oscillations of engine camshafts induced by valve train loads can cause significant tension fluctuation in the timing chain and mag- nifies the chain transverse vibrations. This will result in an increase of the undesirable impact noise from the chain/sprocket meshing process, and the knocking noise from the interaction between the vibrating chain and the guides. Although many studies have been done on chain drives, the analysis to-date are not able to address these phenomena due to the assumptions made in the modelling process. This paper presents a generic model of an engine timing chain drive system which couples the sprocket motion with the vibrations of the chain spans. The effects of the cam torsional loads upon the total system are inves- tigated based on this model. It is shown that the cam shaft oscilla- tions will cause longitudinal vibrations in the chains and induce significant tension changes. This periodic tension variation could destablize the system and cause large transverse vibration of the chain spans. Parametric resonances are identified and the insta- bility zones are derived through perturbation analysis using the multiple scale method. It is concluded that both the subharmonic type and the summation type parametric resonance exist. The contributions of various system parameters to the chain response and stability are quantified. Since the chain transverse vibration is a critical factor in determining the noise characteristic of chain drives, this analysis is an important step toward designing a quiet timing chain system. 911064. (P-244) Use of a new formula in the analysis of tor- sional harmonic excitations for IC engines. Jun-Yao Yu, Dept. of Mech. Engrg., Jiao Tong Univ. This paper gives a new theoretical formula which relates tor- sional harmonic coefficients due to gas pressure and mean indi- cated pressure (MIP) in a cylinder for a four-cycle internal- combustion engine. A practical example in a diesel engine has been illustrated to verify its accuracy and utility. Based on the dis- covered formula, some characteristics of harmonic excitations and their relations with MIP are discussed. It is shown that the formula can be used to analyze the relationships between all har- monic coefficients and MIP, and to determine their values in the analysis of torsional vibrations. 911065. (P-244) A new method for engine design using dynamic optimization and substructure synthesis method. Masanori Ishikawa, Isuzu Motors Ltd.; Mitsuo Iwahara, Isuzu Advanced Engineering Center, Ltd.; and Akio Nagamatsu , Tokyo Institute of Technology. This paper describes a new method for engine design using dynamic optimization and substructure synthesis method. A very important theme in engine design is how to shift the peak of the natural frequency of the vibration mode that causes some noise and vibration problems. This must be resolved by effective modification of structural design. In order to carry out effectively vibration analysis of a large scaled structure like engine assembly and conduct dynamic optimization with many iterative calculations, we have used sub- structure synthesis method that devides a whole structure into a number of substructures and solves each substructure. Vibration analysis of engine assembly (cylinder block, crank- shaft, bearing caps and flywheel systems) was carried out by using this substructure synthesis method. And, on the basis of the sensi- 133</page><page sequence="133">911065-911072 tivity of eigenvalue of the residual structure that is to be modified (cylinder block and bearing caps this time), the optimization pro- gram using pseudo least square method has been successfully applied to shift the peak of a given natural frequency to a desig- nated frequency range. 911066. (P-244) Dynamic analysis of rib patterns. Yikang Zhang, Ken Phaneuf, and William Hill, Tenneco Automotive. Optimal design of rib patterns is necessary to minimize the noise radiated from the shells of exhaust system components. Dynamic analyses of rib patterns were conducted using the finite element method and a closed-form solution. Five parameters were used to specify a rib pattern. The parametric study shows that the natural frequency is most sensitive to changes in rib height and orientation. A closed-form solution was developed to predict the dynamic characteristics of a rectangular plate with ribs. 911067. (P-244) Simultaneous optimum design method for multiple dynamic absorbers to control multiple resonance peaks. Kazuto Seto and Shigeo Yamashita, National Defense Academy ; and Masaaki Okuma and Akio Nagamatsu , Tokyo Institute of Technology. Three kinds of new simultaneous optimum design methods of plural dynamic absorbers are proposed. These methods allow the optimum tuning in many natural modes of multiple degrees of freedom structures or a continuous bodies simultaneously to effectively suppress vibration. Changes of natural modes and nat- ural frequencies of the main structure due to added mass effect of dynamic absorbers can be taken into account in the design. Validity and usefulness of the proposed methods are verified by both a computer simulation and by experiments. 1991 SAE Transactions Section 6 911068.

Bretl, ESTECH Corp.; Teruhiko I shigaki, Chas- sis Design Dept., Nissan Motor Co. Ltd.; and Ryugo Takgi, Vehi- cle Research Lab., Central Engrg. Labs., Nissan Motor Co. Ltd. The vibration characteristics of the shock absorber/strut is one of the key factors for vehicle NVH. In order to build a model of the strut, excitation tests were conducted on the struts alone to examine the mechanism causing the "cocking phenomenon" of struts at high frequencies and the "stick-slip phenomenon" at low frequencies. As a result, strut models that accurately reproduce these phenomena were constructed using the NASTRAN code and the ADAMS program, respectively. 911069. (P-244) Experimental analysis of power plant vibra- tions by shaker test. Yoshitsugu Goto and Kazuo Yoshikawa, Toyota Central Research and Development Labs., Inc.; and Osamu Kuroda, Toyota Motor Corp. The purpose of this study is to develop a shaker test method for analyzing and evaluating the dynamic characteristics of the total power plant vibration system more rapidly and precisely than the conventional engine running test. A power plant is excited at the connecting rods of both end cyl- inders, lubricating crank journals and crankpins. The shaker test was proved effective by comparing it with the engine running test. The results of both tests are equivalent in resonant fre- quency, mode shape, and vibration control effect. Furthermore, the multiple input burst random excitation was put into practical use for improving the reciprocity and coher- ence, and for reducing the measurement time. Based on this study, we have developed a power plant system with greatly reduced vibration amplitude. 1991 SAE Transactions Section 6 911070. (P-244) Design strategies for low noise engine con- cepts. F. K. Brandi, P. Wünsche, and E. Gschweitl, AVL List GmbH. Todays legislative requirements - particularly in Europe and Japan - already demand low noise vehicle powertrains. For engine designs now on the market which do not meet the required noise levels, vehicle manufacturers have to rely mainly on addi- tional shielding to meet these demands. To achieve even lower legislated noise levels, as in force in certain European countries, these vehicles are now equipped with almost full engine enclo- sures. Shielding and enclosures have been proven to be effective for vehicle noise control but are regarded by vehicle manufacturers as additional parts with disadvantages in terms of cost and acces- sability for maintenance. In relation to the most stringent vehicle noise legislation in Europe, there is little further potential for acoustic improvement of the vehicles when they are equipped with enclosures and most current types of engine. Therefore, to meet more stringent noise requirements, new engines entering the market will have to incorporate all feasible noise reduction techniques in their design. In this paper, features necessary for the design of low noise engine concepts, will be discussed. It will also be shown that the required noise targets can be achieved when considering engine performance, reliability, cost and future emission regulations. 1991 SAE Transactions Section 6 911071. (P-244) Investigations on influence of engine block design features on noise and vibration. G. Busch, R. Maurell, and J. Meyer, Forward Engine Engrg., Ford Werke AG; and C. Vor- werk, LAT, Aachen Technical Univ. The engine is the most important source of noise and vibra- tion in a passenger car. Together with the oil pan the engine block in general radiates more than 50% of the total engine noise. Addi- tionally structure-borne noise is transferred from the block through the engine mounts into the car body. All design features, which influence the structural integrity of the engine block, will therefore, have an impact on the customer perceived noise and vibration behaviour of the vehicle. In order to develop an engine block toward a good noise and vibration performance, the first design decisions at the beginning of a new engine program should support this goal. This will facili- tate the further development later on. This paper outlines some possibilities of computation and a testing method applicable in an advanced phase to evaluate dif- ferent engine block design features without having either the complete engine or even the final design of the engine block. Results indicating the influence of an open top deck as well as several designs of main bearing supports - cross-bolting and bridging of main bearing caps and a combination of both - are presented. 1991 SAE Transactions Section 6 911072. (P-244) On combustion noise and working stability of 6130Q diesel engine. Zhang Limei, Huang YiLiang, ChengYong, and Wu Bo, Shandong Polytechnic Univ.; and QiaoXinqi, Shan- dong Light Industry Univ. In this paper, the authors analyse the effect of combustion pro- cess upon the combustion noise and working stability of 6130Q D.I. diesel engine, and point out that the higher combustion noise is caused by excessive premixed combustion. In order to improve engine noise it is needed to decrease the injection quantity in delay period. The fluctuation of working cycles is mainly effected by the injection pump rack shaking and auto-advancer oscillating. By improving the matching of spring rigidity and mass the working stability can be improved. 134</page><page sequence="134">911073-911080 911073. (P-244) Noise and vibration refinement of the Ford 3.8 liter powertrain. A//c/iße/ F. Albright, Anatrol Corp.; and Douglas F. Staff eld, Ford Motor Co. Continuous improvement of the NVH performance of current production powertrains is a necessary goal of domestic auto mak- ers. In order to maintain a competitive product, it is necessary to re-evaluate proven hardware against demanding NVH perfor- mance targets established by the competition. This paper describes an NVH investigation of component modifications to the Ford 3.8 liter powertrain. The hardware investigated includes: ribbed and isolated rocker covers, drop-in roller ful- crums, forged steel and cast iron crankshafts, crankshaft bending damper, full skirt girdle, one piece bearing cap (bearing beam), reduced weight pistons and rods, ribbed sump, and alternate crank pulleys and water pump. At the conclusion of these investi- gations, a complete powertrain was assembled based on the rec- ommendations generated in this project. The NVH features included in this "quiet" 3.8 liter engine and the rationale behind the decisions are described. NVH improvements include sound power reductions of 4.9 dBA at 1000 RPM in neutral, 3.8 dBA at 3000 RPM under a drive load, and significantly improved vibration characteristics. As a result, the NVH performance criteria established by this "quiet" 3.8 liter engine can serve as realistically attainable targets for further production level design refinement. 911074.

Nagamatsu, Tokyo Institute of Technology; and Mitsuo Iwahara, Isuzu Advanced Engineering Center, Ltd. The object of this study is to present a newly developed optim- ization method for car body design. In the case of designing car body without roof, lowering of the bending and torsional rigidi- ties which lead to a lowering of resonant frequencies should be considered. In order to overcome these problems, a new optim- ization method has been developed and applied successfully. This method is based on the pseudo least square method and all the sheet elements in the finite element method are treated as design variables. 911075. (P-244) Acoustic analysis of truck cab. Tornio Kat- suta, Atsuhiro Matsuda, and Seiichi H amada, Mitsubishi Motors Corp. This paper presents the results of acoustic analyses of light duty truck cabs by actual vehicle testing and by numerical analy- sis utilizing the boundary element method (BEM). In the resonance mode analysis using BEM, by taking into account the vibration characteristics of cab panels, the presence of the modes other than the purely acoustic cavity resonance modes were confirmed. The contribution of the panel vibrations to booming noise that occurs in actual light duty trucks was analyzed. BEM analysis showed that some of the panel vibration had a negative contribu- tion to booming noise. In other words, decreasing vibration in such a section was shown to increase sound pressure. The results of the BEM analysis match well with actual test results. It has thus been demonstrated that BEM is an effective method for analyzing truck interior noise reduction. 911076. (P-244) Frequency optimization technique based on the anti-resonance sensitivity method. Chung M. Suh, Isuzu Ceramics Research Institute; Mitsuo Iwahara, Isuzu Advanced Engineering Center, Ltd.; and Akio Nagamatsu , Tokyo Institute of Technology. There are two analytical methods for otpimizing automotive structural dynamic characteristics to improve vehicle ride quality and minimize structural mass for improved fuel economy. The first method, the traditional approach, is to move the undesired structural resonant frequencies out of the range of the forcing functions by modifying the mass and stiffness parameters appro- priately. However, in some cases the resonant frequencies are insensitive to parameters; these cases normally are difficult to improve. Fortunately, there is a second method, based on the natural phenomena that an anti-resonance exists for each resonant fre- quency. Furthermore, the sensitivity of these anti-resonance nodes to the structural parameters of mass, stiffness and damping are uniquely different. It is the difference in sensitivity that per- mits cases to be solved, which resist solution by the traditional first method. This alternative method, based on merging the reso- nant and anti-resonant peaks, results in a mutual coincident which minimizes and/or eliminates the unwanted response, rather than moving it out of the range of operation. This method is described and application examples are given in this paper. 911077. (P-244) The application of noise simulation tech- niques to conceptual automotive powertrain design. D.

Noise and vibration simulation techniques are becoming increasingly important as refinement continues to be one of the major issues in passenger vehicle design.

Katsuji Takanami, Mitsuo Iwahara, Haruki Saito, and Masamitsu Sakata, Isuzu Advanced Engineering Center, Ltd. The interior noise produced in a car while accelerating was studied from the aspect of sound quality. The quality of interior noise produced in various types of cars was first assessed subjec- tively by Semantic Differential method. These data were then compared with the data obtained by objective assessment. Two types of cars having two types of sound quality were then pro- duced by making necessary modifications on the basis of the comparison. The new information gained on sound improving technology which is very effective in setting up pleasant sound environment, has been discussed in this paper. 911079. (P-244) A development process to improve vehicle sound quality. Robert S. Thomas, Paul J. Stanecki, and H. Peter Creutz, Ford Motor Co. Vehicle sound quality has become an important basic perfor- mance requirement. Traditionally, automobile noise studies were focused on quietness. It is now necessary for the automobile to be more than quiet. The sound must be pleasing. This paper describes a development process to improve both vehicle noise level and sound quality. Formal experimental design techniques were utilized to quantify various hardware effects. A-weighted sound pressure level, speech intelligibility, and composite rating of preference were the three descriptors used to characterize the vehicle's sound quality. Engineering knowledge augmented with graphical and statistical techniques were utilized during data analysis. The individual component contributions to each of the sound quality descriptors were also quantified in this study. This paper discusses the importance of measurement studies to ensure desired experimental precision, the use of regression analysis to overcome the effect of engine rpm during experimentation, and normal probability plots as an initial empirical model building technique. 911080.

The object of this paper is to describe a statistical approach to objectively evaluate the subjective perception of the annoyance caused by engine noises using multiple regression analysis based on subjective data and given physical parameters. About 300 test persons were involved in rating the annoyance of engine noises. 60 representative engine noises, each of them characterized by 48 physical parameters, were studied. This study selects an optimal set of parameters, estimates the regression coefficients so as to minimize the deviation between calculated annoyance scores and real ratings, given by test persons and thus reproduces subjective annoyance scores by means of selection and combination of objective physical parameters. 1991 SAE Transactions Section 6 911081. (P-244) Development and application of an evaluation technique to assess the subjective character of engine noise. Herbert Schiffbänker ; Acoustic Research and Development , AVL List GmbH; and F. K. Brandl and G. E. Thien, AVL List GmbH. This paper describes the development of a software based technique to obtain by measurement objective parameters to define the annoyance of engine noise. This task requires the application of advanced digital binaural measurement tech- niques. On the basis of noise data recorded via an artificial head system, fully digital data processing techniques and statistical evaluation methods for the subjective ranking procedures were developed and verified with numerous test personnel. This method lead to the ultimate development goal of being able to describe and assess engine noise character by a combination of objective parameters. Using such an assessment procedure for subjective noise char- acter, the necessary improvements can be made to achieve given target values. This is demonstrated by examples of application of the technique for the improvement of the noise character of power trains and vehicles. 1991 SAE Transactions Section 6 911082. (P-244) Diagnosis and objective evaluation of gear rat- tle. Oliver Johnson , Ricardo Consulting Engineers Ltd.; and Naotaka H irami, Powertrain Engrg. Dept., Mazda Motor Corp. The objectives of this work were to establish a method to diag- nose the source of gear rattle and to evaluate the rattle objec- tively. The methods are described in detail, applied to two pas- senger cars as an example. Investigations were conducted into transmission rattle under transient conditions. By analysing the transmission casing vibra- tion with respect to the engine flywheel angle, and presenting the data in the form of contour maps, it was shown that the two vehi- cles had different characteristics of gear impacts. Further mea- surements of the angular motion of each gear revealed the impact conditions at the input mesh in the transmission largely con- trolled the character of the rattle and were fundamentally differ- ent between the two vehicles. A rattle index was developed, based on the casing vibration under transient driving conditions. Multi-dimensional scaling was used to 'extract* the principal dimensions from the subjective responses and two physical parameters were used to formulate the index. From this research it was concluded that detailed analysis of the gear motion and casing vibration is an effective tool to diag- nose gear rattle and identify the cause of the rattle. A rattle index generated from two physical parameters correlated well with the results from subjective tests. 1991 SAE Transactions Section 6 911083. (P-244) The development of vibration damping steel sheets for inner panels of automotive vehicles. Hiroyuki Nagai, Toshiaki Shiota, Takao Taka, and Kiyoyuki Fukui, Sumitomo Metal Industries, Ltd. Vibration damping steel sheets (VDSS), which have sandwich structures with intermediate layers of resin, have been studied. The most important characteristics of VDSS for inner panels of automotive vehicles are the vibration damping properties, press formability and spot weldability. Vibration damping properties, which are quantified by loss factor v, were influenced by both tanS, which indicates damping capacity of resins, and elastic modulus of core resin. From a view point of vibration damping properties, resins with larger tanS and relatively lower elastic modulus were favorable. Because these mechanical characteristics vary considerably with temperature, it is important to select the most suitable resin for the service temperature range. The relationship between noise reduction effect and loss factor of VDSS were also studied. It was experimentally confirmed that noise reduction effect of VDSS is proportional to the logarithm of their loss factor. Press formability of VDSS is strongly influenced by adhesive strength of the core resin, thus higher adhesive strength gives bet- ter press formability. It is important and difficult to achieve good balance of damping properties and press formability of VDSS, particularly in order to develop VDSS which are used at room temperature. It is also required that VDSS for inner parts of automotive vehicles can be directly spot welded as well as ordinary steel sheets. In this study it was found that spot weldability of VDSS depends upon the amount and the size of the metal powder in the resin layer and that spot weldability doesn't depend upon the kind of the metal. As the result of above studies, VDSS for inner panels of auto- motive vehicles was developed, which showed excellent balance between vibration damping properties and press formability and also showed spot weldability similar to ordinary steel sheets. 911084. (P-244) The effects of dynamic strain amplitude and static prestrain on the properties of viscoelastic materials. Thomas M. Lewis, Anatrol Corp. The dynamic material properties of viscoelastic materials are known to be sensitive to a variety of environmental factors. A great deal of attention has been given to characterization of the effects of temperature and frequency. However, for thorough design of some noise control schemes, such as isolation systems and tuned damper devices, it is often necessary to characterize the properties of viscoelastic materials as a function of dynamic strain amplitude and static prestrain, as well as temperature and frequency. Included is a description of test techniques utilized to characterize these properties, presentation of sample properties, and discussion of the applicability of the data to the design of noise control systems. 911085.

The basic theory is reviewed including the use of fre- quency response function measurements instead of direct mea- surement of input power and mean square response. The funda- mental errors are presented. Practical considerations for reliable results are discussed and examplified. Examples of loss factor measurements on trimmed automotive panels are included. 1991 SAE Transactions Section 6 911086. (P-244) Panel vibration control for booming noise reduction. Yoshio Oka, Hiroyuki Ono, and Naoki Hirako, Mitsu- bishi Motors Corp. For the booming noise reduction by vibration mode control, structural and acoustic analyses or optimization procedure have been studied. For obtaining know-how to reduce booming noise, 136</page><page sequence="136">911086-911105 it is necessary to understand the mechanism of vibration phe- nomenon, and then to simplify the phenomenon. In this paper, it is presented that the booming noise should be reduced by using the simplification of panel vibration mode of vehicle body. Simplification is obtained by considering that panels are forced and vibrated by the body frame of the vehicle, and that panel vibration is decided by frame movement and stiffness and mass distribution in the panel. The simplification about panel vibration control by the appropriate mass and stiffness distribu- tion is confirmed by using floor vibration. By appropriately con- trolling the stiffness distribution in the dash panel, booming noise caused by the dash panel vibration was reduced. 911087. (P-244) Design optimisation of MDI-based polyu re- thane foam backed automotive carpet systems. N. C. Hilyard, Div. of Applied Physics, Materials Research Institute, Sheffield City Polytec ; and A. Cunningham, ICI Polyurethanes Group. This paper describes procedures being used to rank the acous- tic performance of all-MDI (diphenylmethane di-isocyanate) foam backed automotive carpet systems. The procedures are based on the airborne noise insertion loss of the carpet composite measured under laboratory conditions and well established criteria used to assess human response to noisy environments, such as annoyance and speech perception. Data are presented which demonstrate how the interior noise spectrum might be influenced by the unit mass of the heavy layer, and the thickness of the foam backing layer. It is shown that although low modulus isolating systems are predicted to give superior articulation index performance other criteria indicate that for incident airborne noise the best overall performance should be achieved with a sys- tem having a resonance frequency within the V3 octave bands centred at 260Hz and 315Hz. The influence of system design parameters and foam properties on the resonance frequency is discussed. 911088. (P-244) Investigating calculated loudness ISO 532 for evaluating impulsive sounds. Richard J. Fridrich, CPC Body Development, Test, and Vibration, General Motors Corp. Because of the multitude of impulsive sounds that can occur in automobiles it would be valuable to have a method for evaluat- ing these sounds that relates well to customer response. Loudness calculation based on ISO 532 method B (Zwicker's method) was investigated for its potential as such a method. Problems occurred in obtaining valid V3 octave band spectra from conven- tional real time analyzers for the input to the calculation routine. A conflict arises between the short averaging times needed to track the impulse and the uncertainty principle (BT product rule) for the lower frequency bands. Since Zwicker's method is based on critical bands, a four-pass analysis procedure was devised using an external filter set for the width of a critical band. The cal- culation routine was modified to directly accept critical band data. Example plots of calculated loudness versus time are pres- ented showing the affects of selecting long averaging times, of not obeying the uncertainty principle, and of using the four-pass anal- ysis method with an averaging time of Vó4th of a second. It is con- cluded that to properly use Zwicker's calculated loudness method for impulsive sounds will require an analyzer based on critical bands rather than the standard V3 octave bands. 911090. (P-244) Measuring the loudness of door slams. Klaus H0jbjerg, Briiel and Kjaer. The measurement of sound has a long tradition. The original goal was to find out how human beings evaluated the loudness of a sound. The first indicating instruments were, therefore, humans. This requires skilled listeners and is quite time consum- ing but, worse, it is neither very accurate nor repeatable because humans are involved. The problems are training the listeners and keeping their concentration on the given task. With the introduc- tion of electronics and the measurement microphone, the next step was the creation of the sound level meter. It was recognized, however, that the sound pressure level did not correlate very well with the perceived loudness. The standardization work with the sound level meter was made a two step procedure. The first step was the introduction of the A, B and C-weighting curves in the frequency domain and the fast and slow responses in the time domain. The second step was the introduction of loudness esti- mation based on octave or V3-octave measurements of stationary signals. This is described in ISO 532 A and B. This paper will dis- cuss the difference between sound pressure level and loudness estimation and illustrate this with a practical application. 911091. (P-244) A new two-microphone impedance tube with improved microphone design for materials testing. Klaus H0jbjerg, Briiel and Kjaer. A significant amount of materials testing is traditionally based on measurements using Kundťs tube. This method has been lim- ited to work with pure tones and normal incidence only, and it is quite time consuming. It is of interest to measure at all frequen- cies and to increase the speed of the test. To do this, a two-microphone method is used. The measure- ments are still made in a tube; hence, it is still for normal inci- dence. The two-microphone method is based on a measurement of the transfer function between the two microphones. The method was first introduced by Seybert and then further devel- oped by Chung and Blazer. When measuring the transfer function with two microphones, no special test signal is required. By using random or pseudo random noise, all frequencies will be mea- sured simultaneously, resulting in a tremendous reduction in testing time. From the measurement of the transfer function, various parameters can be calculated, such as the reflection coefficient, impedance and absorption. Whenever new test methods are pro- posed, interest is concentrated on the limitations, the valid fre- quency range and the influence of resultant phase-match between the two channels. This paper discusses the limitations of the test method, and presents a new microphone design with improved high frequency performance. 911092. (P-244) Study on test and product variations of noise reduction capabilities of headliners. Pranab Saha, Kolana and Saha Engineers, Inc.; and Tushar Patel, United Technologies Automotive. This paper discusses the importance of studying different variabilities (test and product variations) that may affect the noise reduction capabilities of automotive headliners, con- structed from different materials. For this purpose, interior noise measurements were made at a position approximating the opera- tor ear level, with different headliner materials under various operating conditions. For better understanding of the effect of dif- ferent variabilities on acoustical performance, various single number values were computed from the measured data reduced in V3 octave band frequencies. Statistical data analyses show that the acoustical performance evaluation of headliners is affected by the product variation from one headliner to another, as well as experimental variation due to vehicle performance and test vari- ation. 911105. GN&amp;C for the Pegasus® air-launched space booster: Design and first flight results. Daniel Rovner, Orbital Sciences Corp. Pegasus is a newly-developed small payload launch vehicle. While the Pegasus design relies heavily on proven technology, the overall concept breaks new ground in several respects. Most nota- bly, Pegasus is launched from a large transport-class carrier air- craft at high altitude. This launch mode confers a number of sig- nificant advantages, both for operations and performance. In par- ticular, air-launched performance benefits from the use of aero- 137</page><page sequence="137">911105-911111 dynamic lift to reduce gravity losses. Pegasus is unique among launch vehicles in its employment of a wing to fly a lifting ascent trajectory. As a consequence, the Pegasus control system includes features common to both aircraft and conventional launch vehi- cles. The stage 1 flight envelope encompasses conditions ranging from a subsonic glide immediately after launch to hypersonic flight under 8 g's of acceleration near the end of the burn. All aerodynamic data used for trajectory and control system design was obtained from analysis. No wind tunnel testing was per- formed, despite the fact that in contrast to conventional boosters, aerodynamic forces have a major impact on both the perfor- mance and stability of Pegasus. Vacuum attitude control was performed using cold-gas thrust- ers during coasting periods and a gimbaled nozzle during pow- ered flight. The vacuum portion of the Pegasus trajectory was determined by a closed-loop guidance system. The powered explicit guidance algorithm originally designed for the space shuttle was adapted for use on Pegasus. Significant modifications were made to han- dle the limitations imposed by an all solid-propellant propulsion system. The first flight of the Pegasus vehicle took place on April 5, 1990. Two satellites were successfully placed in orbit. The combi- nation of accurate aerodynamic analysis and robust controller design resulted in a stable autopilot, despite the lack of wind tun- nel data. The guidance algorithm also performed well. Vehicle velocity after the first two solid rocket burns was more than 300 ft/sec (90 m/sec) below pre-flight predictions. This deficit was 50% larger than the performance reserve that had been allocated prior to flight. To compensate, the guidance algorithm re-targeted in real time for a lower orbital altitude. A combination of a slightly over- performing stage 3 motor, and more significantly an algorithmic error in the vendor-supplied inertial navigation system, caused the achieved orbit to be slightly elliptical. Nevertheless all pay- load requirements were satisfied. 1991 SAE Transactions Section 1 911107. Testing the V-22 flight control system. Walter L. Ball - auer , John R. Leet, James Mitchell and David R. Eck , Boeing Helicopters. The V-22 fly-by-wire digital flight control system is arguably the most complex yet attempted. In addition to providing control of the aircraft in its multiple flight modes, (helicopter- conversion-airplane) the V-22 FCS is also required to provide an integrated thrust/power management, aircraft maneuver limiting and navigation coupling. The V-22 flight control system is also unique in its use of dedi- cated digital data busses as an integral part of the system architec- ture, and in its use of inertial reference systems as prime stability augmentation sensors. The FCS also incorporates a 5000 psi hydraulic system. Accordingly, the testing of such a system becomes a very chal- lenging task, especially given the schedule constraints of the V-22 program. This paper will address the means by which the V-22 flight control system was tested prior to first flight, with prime focus being the software verification, hardware-software integration and system validation testing. In addition, a discussion of the regression testing required to revalidate the flight critical system as changes are made during the flight test development program will be addressed. 1991 SAE Transactions Section 1 911108. Ceramic composites for rocket engine turbines. Thomas P. Herbell and Andrew J. Eckel, NASA Lewis Research Center. Use of ceramic materials in the hot section of the fuel tur- bopump of advanced reusable rocket engines promises increased performance and payload capability, improved component life and economics, and greater design flexibility. Severe thermal transients present during operation of the Space Shuttle main engine (SSME) push metallic components to the limit of their capabilities. Future engine requirements may be even more severe. In phase I of this two phase program, performance bene- fits have been quantified and continuous fiber reinforced ceramic matrix composite (FRCMC) components have demonstrated a potential to survive the hostile environment of an advanced rocket engine turbopump. 1991 SAE Transactions Section 1 911109. Probabilistic load modeling for rocket turbomachin- ery components./. F. Newell and H. Ho, Rocketdyne Div., Rock- well International Corp. This paper summarizes the development of the probabilistic load modeling for the turbomachinery of space propulsion sys- tems at Rocketdyne. The demand for rocket engine turbomachin- ery with high performance and light weight has presented a unique set of problems; e.g., the high-energy density in design and analysis of the turbomachinery loads. A heuristic approach to the simulation of probabilistic loads is employed to provide a uni- form framework on which the subsystem component loads are evaluated. Turbomachinery loads can be classified into three categories: 1) loads internal to the turbopumps, 2) loads that result from the turbopump operation, and 3) loads transmitted from other driv- ing sources. The modeling techniques employed for the turbo- machinery loads are the influence model method, the marginal distribution method, the scaling method, the normalized power spectral density (PSD) model, and improved scaling for vibration etc. Examples of the probabilistic load models for each category are presented to illustrate the modeling methodology. 911110. Probabilistic methods for rotordynamics analysis. Y. T. Wu, T. Y. Torng, H. R. Millwater, and A. F. Fossum, South- west Research Institute ; and M. H. Rheinfurth, NASA Marshall Space Flight Center. This paper summarizes the development of the methods and a computer program to compute the probability of instability of dynamic systems that can be represented by a system of second- order ordinary linear differential equations. Two instability criteria based upon the eigenvalues or Routh-Hurwitz test func- tions are investigated. Computational methods based on a fast probability integration concept and an efficient adaptive impor- tance sampling method are proposed to perform efficient proba- bilistic analysis. A numerical example is provided to demonstrate the methods. 1991 SAE Transactions Section 1 911111. Elastic response of (001) - oriented PWA 1480 single crystal - the influence of secondary orientation. Sreeramesh Kal - Iuri and Ali Abdul-Aziz, Sverdrup Technology, Inc., NASA Lewis Research Center ; and Michael A. McGaw, NASA Lewis Research Center. The influence of secondary orientation on the elastic response of a (OOl)-oriented nickel-base single-crystal superalloy, PWA 1480, was investigated under mechanical, thermal, and com- bined thermal and mechanical loading conditions by applying finite element techniques. Elastic stress analyses were performed with a commercially available finite element code. Secondary ori- entation of the single-crystal superalloy was offset with respect to the global coordinate system in increments from 0° to 90° and stresses developed within the single crystal were determined for each loading condition. The results indicated that the stresses were strongly influenced by the angular offset between the sec- ondary crystal orientation and the global coordinate system. The degree of influence was found to vary with the type of loading 138</page><page sequence="138">911111-911120 condition (mechanical, thermal, or combined) imposed on the single-crystal superalloy. 1991 SAE Transactions Section 1 911112. Flight control actuation system for the B-2 advanced technology bomber. W. S. Schaefer , Moog, Inc.; and L. J. Inderhees and J. F. Moynes, Northrop Corp. The B-2 advanced technology bomber has a very unconven- tional shape and unique requirements to fulfill its mission. In order to satisfy the demanding requirements for the B-2's excel- lent handling qualities, a flight control system was developed with unrivaled performance and sophistication. A key subsystem of the flight control system is the flight control actuation system (FCAS). The FCAS is a self-contained quadraplex system that includes hydraulic actuators with direct drive servovalves for all surfaces, electronic actuator loop closures, and redundancy man- agement. 1991 SAE Transactions Section 1 911113. Rapid prototyping in an integrated product develop- ment environment. James W. Poindexter, U.S. Air Force Wright Lab., Wright-Patterson Air Force Base. Integrated product development, (IPD), is a methodology to allow designers and manufacturing engineers to communicate early in the design phase of a product. One critical new tool to facilitate this early communication of ideas is rapid prototyping. Rapid prototyping techniques range from soft prototypes, ie. computer models of product/process design, to actual 3D physi- cal engineering prototypes developed from CAD model data by a variety of techniques. Current "hard" rapid prototyping tech- niques include stereolithography, selective laser sintering, lami- nate object manufacturing, and fused deposition modeling. The Air Force is interested in these techniques as a method of risk reduction allowing new product concepts to be investigated ear- lier in their design phase by all members of an integrated product development team. 911114. A sprayed steel tool for permanent mold casting of aluminum. P. S. Fussell and E. P. Patrick, Alcoa Labs., Aluminum Company of Am enea; F. B. Prinz, L. Schultz, D. G. Thuel, and L.E. Weiss, Robotics Institute, Carnegie Mellon Univ.; and H. O. Kirchner, Institut de Sciences des Matériaux, Université Paris- Sud. A new application of steel sprayed tooling for the manufacture of prototype permanent molds for aluminum casting is discussed in this paper. The prototype tooling is quickly made by spraying onto substrates that define the tooling shell shape. The shell material, structure, and geometry are adequate to withstand, for a limited number of pours, the demands placed on an aluminum permanent mold. An initial demonstration shows the promise of this method. 911115. Tool-less rapid prototyping technologies - An over- view. Allan J. Lightman, Rapid Prototype Development Lab., Uni- versity of Dayton. The advent of three-dimensional computer aided design (3D CAD) significantly enhanced the productivity and efficiency of engineers and designers. The ability to view a graphic presenta- tion of the design, surfaced to resemble the actual final object, greatly aids validation of the accuracy of translation from concept to design. Sophisticated computer CAD combined with modern graphics allows the designer to rotate the object and visualize it from any desired perspective. At all times, this data presentation is a two-dimensional view of the object. To complete complex designs, the designer requires fabrication of the actual part. Holding and viewing the object, and inserting the part into the assembly it was designed for, pro- vide tangible feedback on the design that is not achievable from viewing the computer screen. This paper will describe a variety of machines currently available or soon to be released that fabri- cate prototypes directly from CAD files. 1991 SAE Transactions Section 1 911117. Studies of photopolymerization for stereolithography using optical diagnostics. Allan J. Lightman and Ronald E. Anderson, Rapid Prototype Development Lab., University of Day- ton. To meet the challenges of foreign manufacturers in the coming decade, American industry needs to increase its productivity markedly. A major obstacle to marketing new products is the time involved in producing the prototype parts required to visu- alize and test new designs. In many industries prototyping con- sumes a substantial segment of the development cycle. Several devices introduced recently produce prototypes rapidly, directly from computer files generated by CAD. The most mature rapid prototyping device is stereolithogra- phy, which produces a prototype from polymeric materials by photopolymerization using a material additive technique. The prototype is fabricated in a layering fashion, starting from the bottom layer and going to the top layer. The layers are con- structed, one at a time, writing the layer description, point by point, by scanning a UV laser over the surface of a liquid photo- monomer and curing it to form polymer at each location where the laser meets the liquid. When a layer is formed, the built struc- ture is lowered into the vat of liquid photomonomer a distance of one layer thickness, and fresh liquid is flowed over the top. The next layer is then formed. The laser depth penetration is adjusted to ensure adhesion to the prior layers. Understanding the physi- cal processes involved in the formation process is essential to overcoming some of the physical limitations encountered. Opti- cal diagnostic systems have been designed and used to measure time-dependent thermal profiles and fraction of conversion con- tours during the polymerization. 1991 SAE Transactions Section 1 911118. Rapid prototyping at AT&amp;T. D. M. Shupe, J. H. Choi, and H. W. Stubbs, AT&amp;T Consumer Products Labs. The Technology Advancement Center at AT&amp;T in Indianapo- lis provides many technical and engineering services to both the Consumer Product development organizations at Indianapolis and AT&amp;Ts world wide manufacturing locations. This paper will describe the status of rapid prototyping at Indianapolis. 911119. Investigation of the mechanical behavior of high per- formance ceramics for automotive applications. Norman L. Hecht, Leon Chuck, Steve M. Goodrich, and Dale E. McCullum, University of Dayton Research Institute. The University of Dayton is investigating the effects of envi- ronment on the mechanical behavior of commercially available structural ceramics being considered for automotive engine applications. In phase III of this investigation, six SÍ3N4 and three SiC materials were evaluated from 20°C to 1400°C in air. Flexural strength and flexural dynamic fatigue behavior were determined for all materials studied. Tensile strength and static, dynamic, and cyclic tensile fatigue behavior were determined for two SÍ3N4 and one SiC. In addition, chemistry, microstructure, and other physical properties were investigated. 1991 SAE Transactions Section 1 911120. Automotive/aerospace synergism in computer-aided composite processing. Johnny R. Gentry, Advanced Composites Engrg., GM Delco Products Div. In-mold dielectric cure monitoring techniques pioneered by the aerospace industry were applied to the manufacturing process of Liteflex® springs. Real-time data was collected in-situ and used to interpret the progression of cure in an epoxy/fiberglass composite. This information was used to trigger mold pressuriza- tion in an attempt to lower void content and improve part appearance. 139</page><page sequence="139">911120-911135 A microdielectric sensor placed on the mold surface collected temperature and conductivity data that was converted to a cure percentage scale (cure index). The optimum pressurization point for the epoxy system was at approximately 40% conversion. Although results varied somewhat depending on spring geome- try, void contents were reduced to less than 1%. Composite shear strength increased 10-15%. Surface appearance was also signifi- cantly improved. 1991 SAE Transactions Section 1 911121. Automobile/aerospace synergy in engineering analy- sis. Nigel Rock, H. W. Structures, Hawtral Whiting Group. This paper discusses the transfer of engineering analytical technology between the automobile and aerospace industries. The role of predictive analysis within both industries is addressed, with a particular emphasis on secondary safety. The use of nonlinear computer analysis techniques is discussed with particular reference to an accident involving a Boeing 737-400 in the UK in 1989. The accident resulted in the author's organisa- tion performing correlated injury studies by occupant kinematic analysis, which are described in outline. 1991 SAE Transactions Section 1 911122. Automotive/aerospace synergism through optimum selection/use of ground support equipment (GSE). Paul D. Tuck, Independent Consultant. This paper demonstrates and sheds light on the fact that opti- mum selection and use of a judicious mix of ground-support equipment (GSE), rather than use of a single piece of equipment (like a super loader) has a synergistic effect on overall efficiency and productivity. The paper also deals with a conceptual aircraft cargo loader "that can do everything" commonly referred to as the super loader. The super loader is intended for use at air termi- nals to transport various unit load devices (ULDs) such as loaded cargo pallets, stuffed containers, airdrop platforms, shelters, and wheeled vehicles from the storage docks to military and civil air- craft, and vice versa. The loader may be described as a self- propelled air transportable (in a C-141, C-17, or C-5) 60,000 lb. lifting capacity, adjustable-height vehicle that can on/off-load all transport aircraft from a C-130, whose cargo deck is only 3 feet, 3 inches high to a B-747 whose main deck upper limit is about 18 feet high. 911123. Advanced techniques, data acquisition, and control systems for ground testing of hydrogen oxygen space vehicles. Lee D. Kostusak, Aerojet Propulsion Div. Advanced methods of data acquisition and control provide rocket test facilities with higher resolution data, faster quick look data reduction, and better engine control. This system hardware and software architecture provides higher sample rate data with 12 bit resolution, more precise engine control, faster test turn- around and setup, enhanced graphic displays, and on the spot reduced "quick look" data within a few minutes of the actual rocket engine test firing. The result is a significant savings in time and dollars. 911124. SSME testing technology at the John C. Stennis Space Center. Mike Ky nard and Glenn Dill, NASA Stennis Space Center. John C. Stennis Space Center (SSC) has developed a very effective capability for testing the space shuttle main engine (SSME). To meet special SSME test requirements, the SSC test complex utilizes a number of sophisticated test stands (posi- tions), test support facilities, and control centers to conduct development testing and flight acceptance testing at both nomi- nal and off-nominal conditions. SSC tests evaluate and character- ize SSME performance to certify flight acceptance and to provide data for use during flight operations. SSC's advanced facilities and procedures have future application for testing of new launch vehicle and orbiter vehicle engine designs. 911125. Alternate test methods for high pressure engine com- ponent testing. A. W. Mayne, E. J. Connor, and R. Scrip, Wyle Labs. This paper presents an analysis of potential methods for the testing of space shuttle main engine turbopump assemblies in a modified component test facility at Stennis Space Center. In par- ticular, the test methods will support long-duration (approxi- mately 250 seconds) green run (acceptance) tests. Six potential test methods were considered, including the traditional, fully pressure-fed test method, some test methods involving engine systems, and some test methods involving recirculation of the pump outlet flow, or "bootstrapping." Two of these methods were investigated in sufficient detail to provide ROM cost esti- mates: the fully pressure-fed method, and one of the bootstrap methods. 1991 SAE Transactions Section 1 911126. A subscale facility for liquid rocket propulsion diag- nostics at Stennis Space Center. N. G. Raines and F. E. Bircher, Sverdrup Technology, Inc.; and D. J. Chenevert, NASA Stennis Space Center. The diagnostics testbed facility (DTF) at NASA's John C. Stennis Space Center (SSC) in Mississippi was designed to pro- vide a testbed for development of rocket engine exhaust plume diagnostics instrumentation. A 1200-lb thrust liquid oxygen (LOX)/gaseous hydrogen (GH2) thruster is used as the plume source for experimentation and instrument development. Theo- retical comparative studies have been performed with aerother- modynamic codes to ensure that the DTF thruster (DTFT) has been optimized to produce a plume with pressure and tempera- ture conditions as much like the plume of the space shuttle main engine (SSME) as possible. Operation of the DTFT is controlled by an icon-driven software program using a series of soft switches. Data acquisition is performed using the same software program. A number of plume diagnostics experiments have uti- lized the unique capabilities of the DTF. The ability of the DTF to provide efficient test operations with quick turnaround times and on-line data analysis makes it uniquely suited for these and other proposed plume diagnostics experiments. 1991 SAE Transactions Section 1 911134. Structural verification of an aged composite reflector. Michael C. Lou and Walter S. Tsuha, Jet Propulsion Lab., Cali- fornia Institute of Technology. A structural verification program applied to qualifying two heritage composite antenna reflectors for flight on the Topex sat- ellite is outlined. The verification requirements and an integrated analyses/test approach employed to meet these requirements are described. Structural analysis results and qualification vibration test data are presented and discussed. It was determined that deg- radation of the composite and bonding materials caused by long- term exposure to an un-controlled environment had not severely impaired the integrity of the reflector structures. The reflectors were assessed to be structurally adequate for the intended Topex application. 911135. Adhesive bonded fasteners: The "no holes" solution to composite fastening problems. Alexander B. Carter, Click Bond, Inc. The structural integrity of advanced composite materials can be compromised by the metallic fasteners commonly associated with the traditional methods of fastening. Riveted nutplates, bolts, and potted fasteners, require that holes first be drilled into the composite material before fastener attachment can be made. The latest generation of adhesives has provided the means for eliminating these holes. A comparison of penetrating versus non- penetrating methods of fastening, demonstrates that adhesive bonded fasteners eliminate composite damaging holes and yet provide traditional threaded attachment points. 140</page><page sequence="140">911136-911146 911136. Improved optical interlayer systems show bond stabil- ity at high temperatures, high humidity. Kent Larson , Dow Cor- ning Corp. Tempered glass, once the optimum material for aircraft vision systems, is now being replaced by high-strength, lightweight plas- tics. Specially designed acrylic, glass, and polycarbonate lami- nates offer weight savings that give them a distinct advantage in weight-critical aerospace applications. Like tempered glass, lami- nates must withstand the impact of low-altitude debris and bird- strike as well as the shock of rapid temperature, humidity, and pressure changes. The laminating adhesive must be strong enough to withstand impact and must provide stress relief for the different substrates, which often have very different thermal coef- ficients of expansion. Liquid and sheet silicone interlayer adhesives have been developed that provide the clarity, adhesion, and performance characteristics required by aircraft windshield and canopy designs. These adhesives have hydrolytic bond stability and high- temperature adhesion that are substantially greater than those of nonsilicone adhesives. This means that windshield replacement due to delamination is less frequent, significantly decreasing the costs of grounded craft and the maintenance required. This paper gives new data on the high-temperature adhesion and hydrolytic bond stability of sheet silicone interlayer adhe- sives. Adhesion to acrylic was tested from -50°C to 125°C; adhe- sion to polycarbonate was tested from -50°C to 150°C; adhesion to glass was tested from -50°C to 250°C. Hydrolytic bond stability was tested at 100% relative humidity at various temperatures and compared to results with polyvinylbutyral and polyurethane adhesives. 911138. Process modeling- Its history, current status, and future. Russell E. Duttweiler, Universal Technology Corp.; Walter M. Griffith , USAF Manufacturing Technology Directorate ; and Sulekh C. Jain, G E Aircraft Engines. The past decade has witnessed the development and initial introduction of various process models through computer simu- lation. Led by programs sponsored by the USAF, WRDC, Manu- facturing Technology Directorate, the first achievement of this effort was the development of the ALPID software and its subse- quent application to the extrusion and isothermal forging of superalloy turbine disks for jet aircraft engines. The reliability and accuracy of the evolved models have resulted in more rapid technical response from forging suppliers, improved quality and consistency in the forged product, and lower costs. Forging models have since been applied to any number of more conventional forging alloys and processes. But, perhaps of more importance to the industry as a whole, these process description and control concepts and disciplines now have also been extended to a wide variety of other material and process applications. When a process model is coupled with computer process control the two synergistically provide a powerful process monitor and a most significant quality control tool. This paper will review the developmental history of process models for current and proposed applications as well as show how typical variables interrelate with specific process elements and the capability and payoff of process modeling for these same applications. At the close of the paper, an attempt is made to fore- cast the direction and scope of future process modeling initia- tives. 1991 SAE Transactions Section 1 911140. Laser processing for gas turbines. Edy Laraque, Pratt and Whitney. Laser processing is currently employed in the manufacture of gas turbine engines in a variety of ways. These primarily include drilling, welding and cutting. An overview of these processes, as they are currently employed in production, to improve produc- tivity and quality will be presented. Additional productivity improvements can be achieved by automating and integrating the processes as well as by improving the operational capability of the laser itself. The results of recent efforts directed in both these areas will be presented. 911141. Manufacturing of effusion cooled combustors. Frank R. Moskal, Garrett Engine Div., Allied-Signal Aerospace Co. Effusion cooled combustor designs for gas turbine engines offer improvements over traditional cooling approaches. The effusion technique, also known as transpiration, or multi-hole, employs minute cooling passages through the wall to be cooled. Effusion cooling provides increased cooling effectiveness, enabling higher performance. Additionally, effusion cooling offers manufacturing benefits, due to its simplicity of design, which result in decreased cost. The design also provides many challenges due to the enormous number of cooling holes required in an effusion cooled component. Candidates for hole drilling, laser and electron beam drilling, are compared with respect to methodology, equipment, hole characteristics, and economics. 1991 SAE Transactions Section 1 911144. Sunrunner: An overview. Gene Smith and Justin Beres, University of Michigan. Applying solar energy to automobile propulsion has caused designers of solar-powered vehicles to address issues of vehicle system efficiency, requiring research and use of advanced mate- rial, battery, and motor technologies. This paper describes the University of Michigan's Sunrunner, the first-place finisher of the GM Sunrayce USA. 911146. Integration of mobile satellite service with advanced traffic management systems. Christopher L. Davis, Mobile Satel- lite Communications, Hughes Aircraft Co. In the truck load (TL) segment of the trucking industry, suc- cessful fleet management is essential to survival. Principles of fleet management include establishing effective financial con- trols, developing integrated operating system, developing and enhancing real-time communications systems, and managing and motivating human resources. Well-designed, reliable com- munications systems tie all dimensions of fleet management together. Several companies have entered the mobile satellite system industry. Typically, these systems consist of mobile satellite ter- minals installed in each truck, space segment and central hub facilities, hub-to-dispatch office software, and communication links. The services offered by each system may vary, depending on the implementation of these components. Most mobile satellite systems provide position determination and two-way messaging between dispatchers and their fleets. Together with computerized routing and vehicle tracking soft- ware, these systems provide both quantitative and qualitative benefits. Quantitative benefits inlcude higher equipment utiliza- tion, reduced empty and out-of-route miles, and elimination of check calls. Quantitative benefits include improved customer service, increased driver job satisfaction, and better emergency response. The success of mobile satellite systems depends upon success- ful integration of logistics systems and use of electronic data interchange (EDI). There are four levels of integration, with each higher level moving toward a greater merging of carriers planning and operations with those of the shippers and receivers of goods. This discussion paper describes mobile satellite communica- tions systems and suggests how the intelligent vehicle highway system (IVHS) work can benefit from truckers' extensive use of positioning and communications systems. In closing, the discus- sion highlights the challenge of integrating individually devel- oped IVHS products. 1991 SAE Transactions Section 1 141</page><page sequence="141">911148-911167 911148. Fuzzy logic: Principles, applications and perspectives. Can Isik, Electrical and Computer Engrg ., Syracuse Univ. Fuzzy logic offers solutions to problems where concepts are subjective, quantities are known only imprecisely and system models are descriptive rather than analytic.

Finally, a fuzzy logic system that adapts to environmental variations is introduced. 1991 SAE Transactions Section 1 911150. A computer program to perform flow and thermal analysis during pressurization of the space shuttle solid rocket motor field joint. /. Louie Clayton , George C. Marshall Space Flight Center ; and R. F. Colbert, B. G ha ff arian, and A lok Majum- dar, Sverdrup Technology, Inc. This paper describes a computational technique for prediction of the flow and thermal environment in the space shuttle solid rocket motor field joint cavities. The SRM field joint hardware has been tested with a defect in the insulation. Due to this defect, the O-ring gland cavities are pressurized during the early part of the ignition. A computer model has been developed to predict the flow and thermal environment through the simulated flaw, dur- ing the pressurization of the field joint. The transient mass, momentum, and energy conservation equations in the flow pas- sage in conjunction with the thermodynamic equation of state are solved by a fully implicit iterative numerical procedure. Since this is a conjugate flow and heat transfer problem, wall tempera- tures are calculated by solving the one-dimensional transient heat conduction equation in the solid along with the other governing equations. The pressure and temperature predictions have been compared with the test data. 911152. Predicting X-rays for dynamic flaw detection in solid rockets. R. A. Frederick, Jr., B. M. Williams, and S. B. Bean, Sver- drup Technology, Inc., AEDC Group. The principal objective of this study was to evaluate the poten- tial of real-time radiography as a diagnostic tool for measuring propellant crack propagation speed. The scope addressed either a nonpropagating or a propagating axial bore crack in a 6 in.-diam solid-propellant motor. Simulations of X-ray emissions from a low-energy source, a model of propellant burn recession, and analysis of the simulated images provided the basis of the results. The complete simulation was performed on an IBM RISC-based workstation and the resulting images were evaluated using an image processor. The results show that the transmitted X-ray intensity profiles can be analyzed to determine the velocity of the crack tip during motor operation. A crack that was modeled to propagate at 5.0 in./sec was "measured" to within ± l.Oin./sec using the simulated data. The simulation included the effects of finite pixel resolution and finite (8-bit) intensity digitization. 1991 SAE Transactions Section 1 911157. Polymer batteries. Binod Kumar, University of Day- ton Research Institute; and Richard A. Marsh, Wright Labs., Wright-Patterson Air Force Base. This paper presents a state-of-the-art report on polymer bat- tery development. The research and development activities related to materials of construction for battery components, i.e., anode, electrolyte, and cathode are reviewed. Major achieve- ments have been accomplished in the last decade and the progress is very encouraging. Some potential problems have been identi- fied and these problems may require significant development efforts before polymer batteries become a commercial reality. 1991 SAE Transactions Section 1 911159. Battery standardization. William Johnson, Vaidevutis Alminauskas, and Alan Goodman, Electrochemical Power Sources Div., Naval Weapons Support Center. Battery standardization is critical in reducing the cost of air- craft batteries. Past and present methods of battery procurement result in many different batteries that are either to expensive, unreliable or require extensive maintenance. Standardization reduces cost by replacing small numbers of expensive batteries with large volumes of a standard battery. Battery quality and reli- ability is also improved. The inclusion of new advances in battery technology is also simplified. The use of new battery technology has improved battery per- formance and increased reliability. Advances such as sealed lead acid batteries and improved separator material have reduced the cost of batteries and increased service life. 911160. Multiple cell CPV nickel hydrogen battery. Jeffrey P. Zagrodnik, Johnson Controls, Ine ; and Kenneth R. Jones, John- son Controls, Inc. Johnson Controls, Inc. has developed a multiple cell CPV nickel hydrogen battery that offers significant weight, volume and cost advantages for aerospace applications. The baseline design was successfully demonstrated through the testing of a 26- cell prototype, which completed over 7,000 44% depth-of- discharge LEO cycles at COMSAT laboratories. Prototype designs using both nominal 5' and 10' diameter vessels are cur- rently being developed for a variety of space and aircraft applica- tions. Nickel hydrogen batteries are well established as an energy storage subsystem for commercial communication satellites. The standard design has been the individual pressure vessel (IPV), which provides an independent vessel for each cell of the battery. The comparative advantages of a common pressure vessel (CPV) design configuration, in which many series connected cells are contained in a single vessel, are widely recognized. These include higher specific energy, higher system energy density, simplified interfacing, and reduced cost as compared to the IPV. However, historical concerns related to electrolyte and thermal manage- ment had previously prevented the introduction of a reliable CPV design. 911161. Life of the airframe maintenance free battery. Richard Flake, Wright Lab., Wright-Patterson Air Force Base. This paper presents an overview on an Air Force initiative aimed at increasing the performance and reliability of aircraft batteries. A major thrust of the initiative is the elimination of flight line battery maintenance shops. Cost savings, increased mission capability and battle readiness are the pay-offs that will be realized from this effort. Current maintenance requirements for vented nickel-cadmium (Ni-Cd) batteries used in most U.S. military aircraft are unacceptable. This paper addresses other available technology options, decisions made to date and benefits that will result from this effort to increase the performance and reliability of aircraft batteries. 1991 SAE Transactions Section 1 911166. Computer controls broaden shot peening design con- siderations. Daniel E. Johnson, Metal Improvement Co., Inc., Subsidiary of Curtiss- Wright Corp. Advances in computer controlled shot peening equipment allow design and materials engineers to use the beneficial effects of shot peening in fundamental design consideration. Modern equipment monitors critical process functions, including air pres- sure, shot flow, nozzle and workpiece location and translation. This level of process control broadens component design consid- erations, advances useful applications, heightens quality expecta- tions and can provide gains in process productivity. 911167. Case studies: keys to success in laser processing air- craft and turbine engine parts. Terry L. VanderWert, Laserdyne, Lu m on ics Corp. 142</page><page sequence="142">911167-911176 Multi-axis laser machining systems are having a significant impact on the way formed sheet metal parts are being cut, drilled and welded. For example, in replacing conventional machining, laser cutting has replaced milling for trimming deep drawn gas turbine engine part and increased throughput from 18 pieces per day to 18 pieces in 30 minutes. Reduced trimming and tooling expense, faster turnaround and more consistent parts are benefits frequently associated with laser processing of formed parts. With laser machining, setup involves mounting a minimal amount of fixturing required to hold the workpiece in position during machining. Once this is done, the NC program describing the machining parameters (laser process- ing conditions) and motion path is loaded into the CNC, a pro- cess taking minutes rather than the hours required for setup of hard tooling. The objective of this paper is to present examples of current industrial applications of multiaxis laser systems and to identify keys to successful application of these for processing formed parts. These examples illustrate important features of laser pro- cessing equipment. They also show how users of laser machining systems have justified purchase of these and how they have inte- grated laser processing into the design and manufacturing func- tions to maximize their benefits. 911170. NASP: a national utility review. Terry D. Kasten, National Aero-Space Plane Joint Program Office. Numerous articles have described the goals, management structure, and technical accomplishments of the National Aero- Space Plane (NASP) program. This paper describes how the tech- nology from NASP may enable new operational vehicle concepts; presents the impact of hydrogen fuel on hypersonic transport designs; and for the space transportation role, describes a first generation hydrogen fueled operational vehicle. A national space launch architecture is presented which reflects the requirements of military, civil, and commercial users. The ability of existing and planned systems to satisfy space launch requirements are compared with architectures involving NASP derived vehicles (NDVs). Unique operational capabilities are explained, and the ability of NDV's to "normalize" space access is also presented. The operations, support, and launch infrastructure necessary to support such a vehicle is described. Details of a notional "space base" including cryogenic facilities and personnel requirements is provided. The objective of this paper is to describe space launch architecture options in support of existing and growth space transportation requirements. 911171. The development and progress of enhanced fighter maneuverability on the X-31. G. J. Hoerter, S. A. Powers, and M. R. Robinson, Rockwell International Corp. This paper discusses the X-31A enhanced fighter maneuver- ability (EFM) aircraft and program. This program is unique in that its eventual purpose is the demonstration of the tactical util- ity of enhanced fighter maneuverability after initial generation of in-flight technical data. The genesis of the program is outlined and the design criteria for the aircraft are presented. The impacts of the low cost require- ment are described, and the current status of the flight test pro- gram is presented. The program is a unique form of collaboration between the U.S. and German governments, Rockwell International Corpora- tion and Messerschmitt-Bolkow-Blohm (MBB). This successful arrangement could form the basis for future international collab- orations. 1991 SAE Transactions Section 1 911172. Advanced propulsion technology influence on multi- role fighter system requirements. Keith L. Irwin, Phillip R. Viars, and Don W. Elliott, G E Aircraft Engines. The next major aircraft program currently entering the study phase is to be a multi-mission fighter which would compliment the ATF and replace the F-16. The initial operational capability (IOC) of this aircraft will enable it to benefit from the propulsion technology advances of the integrated high performance engine technology (IHPTET) initiative. Past studies have shown that in order to achieve the optimum performance from these new advanced cores the engine cycle (specifically the fan pressure ratio) must be tailored to the aircraft mission and performance requirements. The missions and requirements to define this advanced fighter are currently in the embryonic stage. Even though the require- ments are undefined, the engine company can evaluate a matrix of engine cycles in a notional airframe over a range of mission and performance levels. This effort can provide insight into the range of advanced engine cycles that might be required to opti- mize the future weapon system. This assessment can also provide a database to aid future aircraft designers, engine designers, and survivability analysts in their studies to recommend more spe- cific requirements for this advanced multi-mission fighter. The focus of this paper is twofold. First, to present an approach which is used to generate a database of engine cycle/size as functions of mission definition and performance require- ments. And second, to demonstrate how the aircraft mission and performance requirements impact the engine cycle and size. Spe- cifically, a series of IHPTET class, phase II, preliminary study engine cycles at four different fan pressure ratio (FPR) will be assessed in a notional advanced fighter performing four missions and at varied levels of performance requirements. 911173. Use of thrust vectoring and reversing on the S/MTD. J. A. Laughrey, Wright Lab. A main objective of the STOL and maneuver technology dem- onstrator, (S/MTD) program was to evaluate the operability and performance of its unique engine/nozzle configuration which can deliver thrust in three different modes; conventional, vectored and through variable vanes which give the option of going from forward to reverse thrust. The two-dimensional nozzle and the modified engine were extensively tested during sea level and alti- tude testing to satisfy all flight clearance requirements. This paper concentrates on the flight test results of the various modes of vec- toring and reversing ending with a compilation of the actual usage of the propulsive controls that could be used by designers of similar advanced propulsion systems. 1991 SAE Transactions Section 1 911174. Numerical simulation of propulsion-induced aerody- namic characteristics on a wing-afterbody configuration with thrust vectoring. Steven E. Krist, NASA Langley Research Center ; and Jack B. Tseng and C. Edward Lan, University of Kansas. Aerodynamic effects induced from vectoring an exhaust jet are investigated using a well established thin-layer Reynolds average Navier-Stokes code. This multiple block code has been modified to allow for the specification of jet properties at a block face. The applicability of the resulting code for thrust vectoring applications is verfied by comparing numerically and experimen- tally determined pressure coefficient distributions for a jet-wing afterbody configuration with a thrust-vectoring 2-D nozzle. Induced effects on the body and nearby wing from thrust vector- ing are graphically illustrated. 1991 SAE Transactions Section 1 911176. Using prototypes and flight validation in teaching aerospace systems design. Stephen M. Botili , Aerospace and Mech. Engrg., University of Notre Dame. This paper details the approach taken in a course entitled "Aerospace Systems Design" presented at the University of Notre Dame. It describes the course which is intended to intro- duce undergraduate students to the aircraft design process and to present them with a realistic design challenge. This course not 143</page><page sequence="143">911176-911188 only includes the introduction to techniques associated with con- ceptual design but requires the validation of the concept through fabrication and flight testing of a technology demonstrator. The design course has focused on a special class of aircraft, unmanned flight vehicles or RPV's (remotely piloted vehicles). An overview of the organization of the course and the methods used to develop the designs are presented. Examples of design studies, prototype aircraft and flight test results are also included. 1991 SAE Transactions Section 1 911178. The role of design in aerospace engineering education. Karl H. Ber gey, University of Oklahoma ; and Alfred G. Striz, Univeristy of Oklahoma. There is a crisis in undergraduate aerospace design education. Industry perceives it as lack of integrative design experience in the curriculum. Faculty members are concerned with the aca- demic disincentives that apply to teachers of engineering design. This paper discusses the role of design in aerospace education and the qualifications for design instructors. It also proposes a means for addressing the design crisis in a way that is consistent with the current academic hiring and reward system. 911179. Paradigms lost, paradigms regained: paradigm shifts in engineering education. John H. M cM asters, Aerodynamics Engrg ., Boeing Commercial Airplane Group. In a recent paper, the author and a colleague discussed the need for enhanced design education in the engineering curricula in this country, and an appropriate role for industry in an improved partnership with our universities and the government aimed at enhancing engineering education in general. Based on feedback from several presentations and a publication of this basic material, it becomes clear that enhancing design education is only part of a needed major paradigm shift in the way we view engineering and the appropriate education of engineers. The pur- pose of this paper is to outline and provide a rationale for such a paradigm shift; and suggest the major role industry must play in this endeavor if we are to remain competitive into the next cen- tury. 1991 SAE Transactions Section 1 911180. Design-integration decision making: What should be taught. Jan Roskam , Aerospace Engrg. Dept., University of Kan- sas. The paper demonstrates the importance of design and design- integration teaching at the university level. Specific topics which should be taught to equip aerospace engineering students with essential design integration skills are presented. The motivation behind this paper is threefold: 1) the large amount of costly design mistakes made during the last two decades; 2) the strong trend in the aerospace industry toward "total engineering"; and 3) the poor quality and quantity of design education in universities. 1991 SAE Transactions Section 1 911182. Propulsion systems with air precooling for aerospace plane. A. S. Rudakov and V. V. Balepin, CIAM. Using LH2 heat sink capacity for air precooling in turbojets allows to increase specific impulse and in many cases to reduce specific mass (mass-to-sea level thrust ratio). A number of precooled turbojet schemes are considered. Clas- sification of turbojet according to the cooled air amount and depth of cooling is proposed. ATR with extended precooling (Tout=100K) is examined in more detail. For propulsion systems including different types of engines, running simultaneously the concept of LH2 heat sink capacity concentration for turbojet air precooling is proposed. 911183. Cryogenic heat exchangers - Key technology for pre- cooled turbojet engines. V. V. Balepin, E. A. Folomeev, S. M. Galkin, and E. A. Svetlakov, CIAM. Hydrogen-air heat exchanger (HEX) and condensor in the engines with air precooling amount to, by various estimations (in different schemes) 20-40% of total engine mass. The influence of some heat transfer increase methods on cooler mass and size is discussed. Atmospheric air cooling may result in frost formation on cooled surfaces and heat exchanger characteristics deterioration. The location of probable frost formation zones in different condi- tions may be determined by using two-dimensional mathemati- cal model of heat exchanger. The model experimental study of frost formation was carried out. The quantitative parameters of this process are discussed. It was found that both reduction and increase of heat transfer may be obtained according to flow regime. Significant instability of flow with air condensation accompa- nied by large pressure pulsations was obtained. Methods to pre- vent the phenomenon are under study. The influence of two- phase flow structure on heat transfer characteristics is discussed. 911184. Two stage fully reusable space launch vehicle configu- ration and performance trades. Valentine Dahlem, Peter R. Gord, and Kevin J. Langan, Wright Lab., Wright-Patterson Air Force Base. There is a need for a space launch system that can provide ready, reliable, unencumbered access to space. The need exists for a highly reliable launch system that can operate from numerous available sites, that can provide all azimuth launch capability, that is fully reusable, and that can carry significant payloads into low earth orbit. A vehicle concept was developed to demonstrate the ability of near term aeromechanics and propulsion technol- ogy to support such a system. The vehicle was composed of two stages. The system takes off horizontally and both stages return to a horizontal landing. Turbojet, ramjet, and rocket propulsion is used. The sensitivity of the system to thrust, drag, weight, and staging Mach number was examined. The two stage system is able to accommodate a range of performance variations yet still retain significant mission potential. 1991 SAE Transactions Section 1 911187. Heat pipe response to pulse forward and reverse heat load. H. X. Nguyen, Mech. Engrg. Dept., University of Kentucky; P. K. Kreitz, Mech. Engrg. Dept., Univeristy of Kentucky; O. J. Hahn and L. C. Chow, Mech. Engrg. Dept., University of Ken- tucky; and M. J. Morgan, Wright Lab. This paper describes the results of an experimental investiga- tion of the response of liquid metal heat pipe to pulse heat load at the condenser section. A 0.457 m (18") long, screen wick, sodium heat pipe with 0.0127 m (0.5") outer diameter was tested in the sodium loop facility. Both forward and reverse mode were studied; each with different heat loading conditions. Major find- ing was that the heat pipe did indeed reverse under a pulsed heat load applied at the condenser. The time of reversal was approxi- mately 15 to 25 seconds. The startup of heat pipe from frozen state was also studied using sodium loop facility. It was found that during startup process, at least part of the heat pipe was active. The active region extended gradually down to the end of the condenser until all working fluid in the heat pipe was molten. 911188. Thermal power loops. Joseph M. Gottschlich, Wright Lab., Wright Patterson Air Force Base; and Robert Richter, Jet Propulsion Lab. The concept of a thermal power loop (TPL) for the transport of thermal power over relatively large distances is presented as an alternative to heat pipes and their derivatives. While retaining the passive nature of heat pipes, the TPL has demonstrated many performance advantages. In this paper, the TPL is compared to heat pipes, and capillary pumped loops with respect to weight, size, conservation of ther- mal potential, 1-g testing capability and start-up. This analysis 144</page><page sequence="144">911188-911196 illustrates that the development of specific thermal power loops will be highly cost effective and will result in substantial weight and cost savings for many spacecraft. Additionally, test results from a proof of feasibility demonstrator at the NASA Jet Propul- sion Laboratory are presented. 911189. Adaptive jet engine starting strategies made possible by digital engine control systems. Robert L. Mayer , GEAE Con- trols Engrg. Operation ; and Robert C. Wibbelsman, GEAE Pee- bles Test Operation. Automatic and adaptive aircraft engine starting strategy is a complicated subject involving many sets of conflicting require- ments both from the standpoint of the engine health situation as well as the engine environmental situation. In previous practice, basically involving the application of hydromechanical control technology, design compromises had to be made which often resulted in a limiting of the ability of the engine to achieve total starting success. This was because the control had limited ability to allow for variations in engine health and operating conditions. The computing power of digital electronic controls has made pos- sible a major step forward in the ability of the control system to cope with the multiple situations facing the designer of the engine starting system. Many different automatic engine starting strategies could be employed. This paper presents the strategy that has been used in the GE and CFMI family of large, high bypass turbofan engines. Full authority digital electronic control (FADEC) systems are coming into wide use in the large commercial aircraft engine industry and are starting to appear in the military engine market. Some of these engines employ automatic start sequence features which simply automate the conventional hydromechanical con- trol concept, while others take full advantage of the computing and logical power of the digital technology and incorporate adap- tive "expert system" features. The GE and CFMI large commer- cial turbofan engines fall into this latter category. This approach is largely being driven by economic consider- ations. The automated systems minimize engine over-stress, and consequent maintenance actions, that can result from stall and over temperature events in the start region. These systems allow for reduced cockpit workload. In addition, aircraft using these engines often land in relatively unsupported airports. Under these circumstances, if an engine cannot be started and the air- craft dispatched, passengers must be accommodated while a replacement or aircraft is ferried in. The airline can incur consid- erable economic penalty and customer dissatisfaction the proper sequencing of starter, ignition, and fuel is provided by the FADEC logic. This paper concentrates on the unique features related to start- ing engines under the environmental and engine health condi- tions which previously had presented difficult design conflicts or tradeoffs when dealing with conventional hydromechanical con- trol systems. 911190. Enhancing fighter engine airstarting capability. S. J. Khalid and R. T. Legore, Pratt and Whitney. In addition to designing fighter engines for stall-free idle to maximum power operation and stall recoverability, it is impor- tant to give proper emphasis to sub-idle operation for successful starting. This permits the pilot to confidently bring the engine on- line following an inadvertent flameout caused by either the air- plane departing the flight envelope or by a fuel interrupt due to a malfunction. Thus reliable and fast airstart capability enhances flight safety especially of single engine airplanes. Flight testing, therefore, is substantially devoted to airstart evaluation. The paper first explains the influence of engine design features on air- starting, particularly the advantages of the low bypass ratio cycle F100-PW-229 (PW220) engine, which is an increased thrust derivative (IPE) of the highly successful F100-PW-220 engine. Enhancing airstarting capability of the PW229 using variable geometry features and digital control flexibility is discussed. The use of an empirical start model in predicting the improvements is illustrated. Also, flight test data of the F16/PW229 airstart characteristics are presented. 911192. Stennis Sapce Center's approach to liquid rocket engine health monitoring using exhaust plume diagnostics. D. G. Gardner , G. D. Tejwani, F. E. Bircher ; J. A. Loboda, and D. B. Van Dyke, Sverdrup Technology, Inc.; and D.J. Chenevert, NASA S tennis Space Center. Emission spectroscopy is a powerful non-intrusive research tool for investigating combustion processes. This technology is being researched and transitioned into rocket engine ground test operations at Stennis Space Center (SSC). Much has been achieved with commercially available emission spectrometers and much more is expected from the next generation equipment, such as the optical plume anomaly detector (OPAD) emission spectrometer designed specifically for this purpose. Some basic issues are being researched at SSC to make exhaust plume diag- nostics a fully operational tool for propulsion system ground test operations. Knowledge gained during the development of this technology for ground test is critical to the development of flight- rated sensors and for vehicle health management system(s) (VHMS) for future vehicles, such as the new launch system (NLS), national aerospace plane (NASP), and those developed for the space exploration initiative (SEI). 1991 SAE Transactions Section 1 911195. Development and applications of a mini-computer based vibration analysis system. William L. Trevillion, Andrew B. Weaver ; and Patrick F. Carle, Radian Corp. The machinery interactive display and analysis system (GR-MIDAS7") developed by Radian Corporation and GenRad Corporation, acquires and displays dynamic test data for vibra- tion and acoustic analysis of rotating equipment and structures. Using user-defined parameters, the system acquires and displays data in formats defined by the user to be most useful for analysis. The system can be used at test sites, or recorded data can be pro- cessed at a laboratory or central engineering facility. The system is composed of a popular minicomputer linked to data acquisi- tion hardware via a parallel interface. Custom software performs data acquisition control, data storage, interactive display, and batch mode plotting. The system has been used to analyse noise and vibration problems in the electric utility, chemical process- ing, paper, and automotive industries. This paper describes the history and development of the GR-MIDAS system. The system, as illustrated in the examples, has proven efficient and economi- cal in acquiring and displaying large quantities of test data. 911196. An advanced condition monitoring system for tur- bopumps. George S. Cross and Sarkis Barkhoudarian, Rocket- dyne Div., Rockwell International. Significant improvements in turbopump and rotating machinery reliability, life, and safety, with associated reductions in life-cycle cost and maintenance turnaround time, can be real- ized through the implementation of advanced condition montor- ing (ACM) methods and technologies. The strategy of ACM sys- tems is to utilize novel technologies to continuously monitor crit- ical system components during operation to provide in situ, non- contacting measurements of component degradation. When utilized in conjunction with proper electronics and computer- based health monitoring expert systems, diagnosis of component failure modes and prognosis of remaining useful life can be auto- matically provided without the requirement for time-consuming disassembly and manual inspection. Such a system can keep users informed of upcoming maintenance requirements and sys- tem availability. The need for scheduled maintenance of moni- tored components is eliminated while component maintenance, well in advance of problems affecting safety or performance, is 145</page><page sequence="145">911196-911208 ensured. This paper provides an overview of ACM technologies developed for in situ turbomachinery applications. 1991 SAE Transactions Section 1 911197. Flight deck automation: strategies for use now and in the future. William W. Wilson and Delmar M. Fadden, Boeing Commercial Airplane Group. The pilot is in charge of the aircraft. Flight deck equipment is intended to assist him in carrying out his responsibilities with safety. The pilot has the final authority over a broad array of equipment including many automated functions. The paper dis- cusses the benefits and cost of automation. A method is proposed whereupon the pilot is viewed as the foundation of a hierarchy of increasingly automated systems. The hierarchy approach pro- vides both the aircrew and the design engineer with a useful meta- phor which encompasses automation in present day aircraft and future aircraft. The paper suggests that, in the future, automation and upcoming technologies be thought of as tools for adotping the machine to compliment human performance in routine as well as emergency conditions. 1991 SAE Transactions Section 1 911198. Analytical studies of the space shuttle orbiter nose- gear tire. Ahmed K. Noor, University of Virginia; John A. Tanner , NASA Langley Research Center; Jeanne M. Peters , University of Virginia; and Martha P. Robinson , NASA Langley Research Cen- ter. A computation procedure is presented for evaluating the ana- lytical sensitivity derivatives of the tire response with respect to material and geometrical properties of the tire. The tire is mod- eled by using a two-dimensional laminated anisotropic shell the- ory with the effects of variation in material and geometric param- eters included. The computational procedure is applied to the case of space shuttle orbiter nose-gear tire subjected to uniform inflation pressure. Numerical results are presented which show the sensitivity of the different tire response quantities to varia- tions in the material characteristics of both the cord and rubber. 1991 SAE Transactions Section 1 911199. Landing gear design requirements for bomb-damaged runway operations. Henry M. Pollack and Ralph E. Urch , U.S. Air Force , Wright-Patterson Air Force Base. There exists a need to closely examine scenarios involving bomb damage of runways: 1) what kind of damage can be expected; 2) what kind of rapid repair can be achieved; and 3) what aircraft capability can be provided? Not all of these ques- tions may be answerable to the degree needed to determine valid aircraft and landing gear system design requirements. However, current landing gear technology has demonstrated that a certain degree of rough field capability is available without penalizing aircraft flight performance. For future aircraft to take advantage of these capabilities, aircraft and landing gear specifications must require the ability to traverse severe bumps. 911200. Electric brake system modeling and simulation. James F. Tarter , Aircraft Braking Systems Corp. Extensive system modeling has been completed for develop- ment of the next generation full scale electric brake. All current models have focused on analysis and simulation using a proto- type electromechanical actuator. An efficiency model has been developed which isolates coulomb and viscous losses using regression analysis of test data. A control system model has been developed which provides a dynamic simulation of the brake. Real time antiskid simulation with the prototype hardware has been completed, to evaluate landing gear compatibility. Each of these analysis areas focuses on reducing risk for development of the next generation electric brake. 1991 SAE Transactions Section 1 911201. Handling qualities results of an initial geared flap tilt wing piloted simulation. Lourdes M. Guerrero and Lloyd D. Cor- liss, NASA Ames Research Center. An exploratory simulation study of a novel approach to pitch control for a tilt wing aircraft was conducted in 1990 on the NASA Ames Vertical Motion Simulator. The purpose of the study was to evaluate and compare the handling qualities of both a conventional and a geared flap tilt wing control configuration. The geared flap is an innovative control concept which has the potential for reducing or eliminating the horizontal pitch control tail rotor or reaction jets required by prior tilt wing designs. The handling qualities results of the geared flap control configuration are presented in this paper and compared to the conventional (programmed flap) tilt wing control configuration. This paper also describes the geared flap concept, the tilt wing aircraft, the simulation model, the simulation facility and experiment setup, and the pilot evaluation tasks and procedures. 1991 SAE Transactions Section 1 911204. The reuse of technology as an aid to problem solving in the automotive industry. F. Timothy Janis and Richard A. Johnson, ARAC-NASA Industrial Applications Center, Operated by Indiana Univ. A system has existed since the early 1960's to provide U.S. industry access to NASA's reservoir of technology. This paper describes the process used by the NASA sponsored Aerospace Research Applications Center (ARAC) to implement technology transfer. Five years worth of surveys conducted for clients from the automotive industry are reviewed. Both ARAC and client assessments are analyzed to determine the effectiveness of the process. Client surveys are divided into nine categories, the most frequent being technology assessment. Utilization of NASA's 1) RECON database, 2) technology, and 3) counselors is identified. The highest client-rated projects are reviewed. Specific cases are discussed; they illustrate that technology transfer goes beyond simple literature searches. 1991 SAE Transactions Section 1 911205. EMTEC experiences in technology transfer. Ernest F. Moore, Edison Materials Technology Center. The Edison Materials Technology Center (EMTEC), a not-for- profit consortium of industry, academic, and federal partners, has a mission to identify, develop, and transfer materials and pro- cesses (M&amp;P) technologies from all sources to the private sector, with the goal of increasing the global competitiveness and market share of its industry members. This paper addresses specific examples of successful technol- ogy transfer. The examples include short-term transfer which has saved jobs and contracts and solved immediate M&amp;P problems. In the longer term, specific examples of generic technology devel- opment and transfer are described. Finally, a summary of impor- tant lessons learned in technology transfer is given. 1991 SAE Transactions Section 1 911207. (SP-871) The impact of advanced materials on small turbine engines. John L. Mason, Allided-Signal Aerospace Co. This lecture assesses the impact of anticipated new turbine materials and processes on the small gas turbine of the late 20th and early 21st century. Cold-end and hot-end materials are reviewed. The materials are evaluated in terms of improvement potential, likelihood of successful introduction, and barriers thereto. 911208. Methods for evaluating weight perfection index for aircraft. V. V. Lazarev and Yu M. Nikitchenko, Central Aerohy- drodynamics Institute (Ts AG I). Such notions as weight perfection index (WPI) and weight per- fection level (WPL) of a product are introduced and discussed. The latter is defined as a relative characteristic based on the com- parison of a reduced WPI value for the estimated product with 146</page><page sequence="146">911208-911324 the reference value of WPI. A description of a procedure for reduced WPI estimation is presented along with a discussion of some features of a method for weight prediction. Discussed are examples of calculating the WPLs for undercarriage structure and passenger airplane. 911215. On-board diagnostics for emission control systems. Joseph M. Kotzan, Powertrain Control Div., General Motors Corp. The introduction of electronic controls on engines in the late 1970's brought about many changes in the auto industry. One major change was the inclusion of a sophisticated diagnostic sys- tem, resident in the controller that allowed it to monitor iteself and the system it controls. General Motors introduced on-board diagnostics on all of its closed-loop fuel control systems in 1980 and has continued to enhance and refine the diagnostic system each succeeding year. This paper presents a brief history of on- board diagnostics, the strategy behind the diagnostics and the benefits of diagnostics to maintaining control of vehicle emis- sions and aiding in the service process. 911216. Preliminary free-motion headform testing of vehicle upper interior surfaces. N. N. Ramanajam, Roger P. Daniel, and Robert W. Hultman , Ford Motor Co. The NHTSA issued an Advanced Notice of Proposed Rule Making (ANPRM) during the third quarter of 1988. Research tests on a mid-size car and a light truck upper interior surfaces were conducted using a NHTSA research test procedure to help assess the variables associated with this procedure. As a result of these tests, the authors recommended a revised test using a spher- ical headform with normal-to-surface impacts. This revised pro- cedure was used in a second test series on a similar mid-size sedan. The results of these tests are shown. 1 991 SAE Transactions Section 6 911320. A generic trade study methodology for the system analysis of regenerative life support systems. Vincent J. Bilardo, Jr., NASA Ames Research Center. A generic engineering trade study methodology has been developed to provide an effective framework for the system anal- ysis of regenerative live support systems. The performance of engineering tradeoffs is a key technique in a rigorous system engi- neering process that is being used to develop advanced regenera- tive life support technology at NASA Ames Research Center. The trade study methodology consists of the following steps: 1) deriv- ing relevant life support system functional requirements from a given space exploration mission scenario of interest; 2) develop- ing a tradeoff decision methodology consisting of a set of evalua- tion criteria and corresponding weighting functions grouped into a relational hierarchy; 3) synthesizing a set of design options to be evaluated during the study; 4) modeling and analyzing each design option to generate data to input to a quantitative scoring scheme; and 5) evaluating each design option using the informa- tion developed in the preceding steps. These steps are repeated as necessary to optimize the design using an iterative cycle. This paper describes the trade study methodology in detail, using examples relevant to life support technology. The use of decision analysis techniques in the trade study method is empha- sized. The role of a robust suite of mathematical modeling and analysis tools is described. Finally, expected enhancements to the methodology are outlined. 911321. The life support database system. William C. Likens, NASA Ames Research Center. In 1989 NASA Ames Research Center (ARC) began develop- ment of the life support database system. This work has prog- ressed through initial requirements analysis, data relationships modeling, and documentation of a detailed conceptual design during the first nine months of the project, followed by a year of database development activity. A beta-test version of the system has just completed testing by a number of users at NASA ARC, Jet Propulsion Laboratory, Johnson Space Center, and Marshall Space Flight Center. Formal release of the operational system is planned for May 1991. This paper describes the design and implementation of the database system, provides an overview of its operation from a typical user's perspective, and cites examples of data currently accessible in the Build 1 version. Plans for future enhancement of the database architecture, operation, and content to increase its utility to the life support community are summarized. 1991 SAE Transactions Section 1 911322. Human life support during interplanetary travel and domicile- Part II: generic modular flow schematic modeling. Joseph F. Ferrali, P. K. Seshan, and Naresh K. Rohatgi, Jet Pro- pulsion Lab., California Institute of Technology. This paper describes the generic modular flow schematic (GMFS) architecture capable of encompassing all functional ele- ments of a physical/chemical life support system (LSS). The GMFS can be implemented to synthesize, model, analyze, and quantitatively compare many configurations of LSSs, from a sim- ple, completely open-loop to a very complex closed-loop. The GMFS model is coded in ASPEN, a state-of-the-art chemical pro- cess simulation program, to accurately compute the material, heat, and power flow quantities for every stream in each of the subsystem functional elements (SFEs) in the chosen configura- tion of a life support system. The GMFS approach integrates the various SFEs and subsystems in a hierarchical and modular fash- ion facilitating rapid substitutions and reconfiguration of a life support system. The comprehensive ASPEN material and energy balance output is transferred to a systems and technology assess- ment spreadsheet for rigorous system analysis and trade studies. 1991 SAE Transactions Section 1 911323. Human life support during interplanetary travel and domicile- Part III: Mars expedition system trade study. P. K. Seshan, Joseph F. Ferrali, and Naresh K. Rohatgi, Jet Propulsion Lab., California Institute of Technology. A model is being developed to quantitatively compare and select systems and technology options for defined missions envi- sioned in the National Aeronautics and Space Administration's (NASA's) space exploration initiative. This model consists of a modular, top-down hierarchical break-down of the life support system (LSS) into subsystems, and further breakdown of sub- systems into functional elements representing individual pro- cessing technologies. A series of papers titled Human Life Sup- port During Interplanetary Travel and Domicile has been planned to describe the technique and results. Part I, presented at the 19th ICES Conference, described the system approach. Part II, presented at this conference, describes the modeling tech- nique. Part III, this paper, describes the results of a system trade study for a Mars expedition mission comparing open and closed loop systems. Part IV, also presented at this conference, describes results of trading processing technologies in a closed loop config- uration for the Mars expedition mission. In this paper, the results of configuring a LSS in different ways (totally open loop, carbon dioxide removal only, partially closed loop and totally closed loop) are discussed in terms of weight, vol- ume, and power using a baseline technology set. The results dem- onstrate the weight verse power trades of the open loop, closed loop and carbon dioxide removal systems. After a detailed pre- sentation of the system trades, preferred choices of an LSS config- uration for the Mars expedition mission are identified. 911324.

Conceptual designs for lunar base life support sys- tems. Liese D all- Bauman , Mariann F. Brown , and Marybeth A. E de en, NASA Johnson Space Center. Conceptual designs for initial, intermediate, and advanced lunar base life support systems (LSS) are under development at JSC. The initial air revitalization, water recovery, and waste management subsystems are based on space station technologies. The intermediate system expands on the initial capabilities; for example, the initial waste management subsystem allows only for compacting and storing solid waste, while the intermediate waste management subsystem includes measures for recovering useful substances from the waste. The advanced system includes biolog- ical waste treatment and higher plants to be used for air revital- ization and water processing. This paper describes the three systems and discusses the basis for selecting individual processes. System-level mass balances are used to illustrate the interaction of the air, water, and waste loops. The effect of introducing different waste treatment processes into the initial LSS is examined. The impact of biological waste treat- ment and higher plants on the air revitalization subsystem is also discussed. 1991 SAE Transactions Section 1 911326. Preliminary assessment of biologically-reclaimed water. Daniel S. Janik , Cetus Research; J. DeMarco and S. Krish- nan, Pyraponics Industries , Inc. II; and Brian L. Benson, Univer- sity of Alabama in Huntsville. Organic, inorganic and physical water quality data are reported for water transpired by several species of higher plants using an engineering and scientific testbed for high-fidelity, bio- logical water reclamation and recycling. Biologically-reclaimed water met NASA shuttle potable and space station/manned systems integration hygiene standards with regard to parameters tested without post-treatment. Water reclaimed from 10% urine showed a 100-fold reduction in organics and inorganics, demonstrating the efficiency of bio- logical water reclamation and the usefulness of this testbed for scientific and engineering studies. 911328. Biosphere 2: design approaches to redundancy and back-up. William F. Dempster, Space Biospheres Venture. Biosphere 2 is a large closed ecological system nearing comple- tion in Arizona. Various subsystems are critical to the operation and the approach to redundancy and back-up systems for syner- gistic advantages is described in several instances. 911329. U.S. Navy submarine life support systems. Tracy Shadle, Naval Sea Systems Command, Submarine Ventilation and Life Support Branch; and Thomas Daley, Naval Ship Systems Engrg. Station, Submarine Life Support and Cryogenics Sect. Within the total submarine system, the life support system assumes a position which is equal in importance to the propul- sion, weapons, and navigation systems. Without an efficient and reliable life support system, the other ship systems and the per- sonnel who operate and maintain them cannot function to their full capabilities during extended periods of submergence. As a result of new requirements, new technology, and poor fleet performance, the Naval Sea Systems Command (NAVSEA) has developed new life support equipment that improves reliabil- ity, safety, operability, and capability. NAVSEA has developed, prototyped, successfully tested, and placed into production a new atmosphere analyzer and a new oxygen generator. This paper will address the US Navy's life support system design parameters, an overview of existing life support system, reasons for change, concept development and testing of new equipment, transition to production, and production and fleet implementation. 911330. A submarine advanced integrated life support system. H. A. Carlson and R. N. Sexauer, Hamilton Standard. The generation of submarines beyond Seawolf will require more sophisticated ship systems as the quest for absolute quiet, total reliability and unattended operation continues. The Subma- rine advanced integrated life support system (SAILS) is the result of analyses which first define, and then implement, technology development. SAILS is organized around the projected capability of and SPE® electrochemical cell which simultaneously coverts carbon dioxide to liquid organics and water to pure oxygen with- out the presence of gaseous hydrogen. Other technologies employed in the SAILS system include an SPE electrochemical absorbent regeneration/C02 compression subsystem, a liquid CO2 absorber, an organic water separator and a catalytic contam- inant removal system. The paper presents an overview of the existing submarine life support equipment and describes the pay- offs offered to a submarine by implementing SAILS technologies into a next generation life support system. 911331. The effect of reduced cabin pressure on the crew and the life support system. Kristin B. McCarthy and James A. Green, Rockwell International Corp. The impacts of reduced atmospheric pressures on crew health, safety, and operations have been evaluated. There are no known long-term physiological or psychological impediments to living at low pressure. Cabin pressures less than 8 psi (55.16 kPa) permit the use of low pressure suits without pre-breathing, which enhances extra-vehicular activity (EVA) and contingency response. Fire hazards at reduced pressures are not as severe as once feared due to the reduced thermal capacity of the gases, lack of convection, and the tendency of the flame to "cocoon" around the "fuel". These factors tend to make the fire self extinguishing. Cold plating may be necessary for thermal control of compo- nents. Analysis of gas volume, leakage, and EVA show a significant resupply cost savings and EVA operations simplification. Addi- tional studies are required to establish the optimum cabin pres- sure. 1991 SAE Transactions Section 1 911333. Determining the IV fluids required for a ten day medi- cal emergency on space station freedom (comparison of packaged versus on-orbit produced solutions). Charles W. Lloyd, NASA Johnson Space Center; and Gerald J. Creager, KRUG Life Sci- ences. 148</page><page sequence="148">911333-911340 To aid planning for the storage of supplies onboard space sta- tion freedom, an estimate was made of the amount of intrave- nous (IV) fluids required to support a patient who has suffered a medical emergency for a period of up to 10 days. Six different medical scenarios were evaluated, and the volume of IV fluids required for each scenario was estimated. Up to 220 liters of fluid would be required to support a patient for all of the scenarios. When optimizing the volumes to support any single scenario, a total of 123 liters is required. Use of a water polishing system to produce sterile water for injection from potable supplies and on- station formulation of IV fluids results in a smaller mass and vol- ume requirement for the fluid therapy subsystem than carrying prepackaged bags of fluid. 1991 SAE Transactions Section 1 911334. Shuttle sleep shift operations support program. Karen L. Mathes and JoAnna Wood, KRUG Life Sciences. Shuttle crewmembers must frequently alter sleep/wake sched- ules to accommodate launch and mission timelines. These "alter- ations" tend to maximize sleep disruption and fatigue leading to a decreased operational "safety margin" during inflight opera- tions. Changes in normal sleep/wake cycles have been shown to dis- rupt physiological circadian rhythm causing fatigue, decreased alertness, increased irritability, altered judgement, and increased vulnerability to performance decrements. To minimize the impact of schedule shifts, and maximize sleep and physiological adaptation, the NASA operational envi- ronment has implemented a program to address these complex issues. The program plan "operationalizes" the experimental pro- tocol used by Czeisler et al. (1990), which involves timed expo- sure to bright light during the targeted activity period and com- plete darkness during the targeted sleep period to rapidly shift crewmembers. Preliminary results of this intervention demonstrate that exposure to bright light at the appropriate time in the circadian schedule resulted in excellent sleep and physiological adaptation of flight crewmembers. Results of this operational intervention and implications for future mission support are presented and discussed. 911336. Laser medicine and surgery in microgravity. Michael Colvard, Periodontal Surgery &amp; Oral Medicine Association; Rich- ard Caleel, Chicago School of Medicine; Paul Kuo, Loyola School of Medicine; and Colette Cozean, Pfizer Laser Systems. Human activity in microgravity environments place flight crews at risk to injury that may require surgical triage and care. Current protocols developed to handle surgical care in micro- gravity are derived from earth based wound care techniques. Fluid and debris containment, spacecraft environmental contam- ination and expediency of wound care in microgravity remain as significant obstacles. For space based surgery, lasers may allow procedures for rapid stabilization of emergency or traumatic inju- ries, surgical fluid control, hemostasis and reduce contamination of the aircraft environment. The purpose of this paper is to out- line the basic concept of laser surgery in an aviation and micro- gravity environment using carbon dioxide, neodymium yttrium aluminum garnet (ND:YAG), KTP and excimer laser incisions within high altitude, military, aviation and microgravity aviation environments. 911337. GTR (guided tissue regeneration) incorporating a modified microgravity surgical chamber and Kavo-3-mini unit for the treatment of advanced periodontal disease encountered in extended space missions. Bernard Unrau, Mount Royal College. What do you think is the most common fatal diesel in the world? On earth cardiovascular diesease is the most common fatal disease. What do you think is the most common non-fatal disease in the world? What may surprise some of you is that peri- odontal disease (P.D.) or the condition of the deterioration of the bone supporting and tissues surrounding your teeth is the most common. Up to 3 out of 4 of the earth's population may be afflicted with some form of periodontal disease. In space due to lack of gravity accelerated bone loss will be encountered on lon- ger missions. A rapid deterioration to an advanced form of P.D. may result. A less severe form of P.D. is gingivitis, an inflamma- tory lesion of the periodontal tissues caused primarily by plaque. The subsequent progression from incipient gingivitis to advanced periodontal disease or pyorrhea can be divided into 4 stages: initial stage; early stage; established stage; and advanced stage. 911338. (SP-875) Integrated energy balance analysis for space station freedom. John J. Tandler, Grumman Space Station Engrg. and Integration Contractor. An integrated simulation model is described which character- izes the dynamic interaction of the energy transport subsystems of space station freedom for given orbital conditions and for a given set of power and thermal loads. Subsystems included in the model are the electric power system (EPS), the internal thermal control system (ITCS), the external thermal control system (ETCS), and the cabin temperature and humidity control system (THC) (which includes the avionics air cooling, cabin air cooling, and inter-module ventilation systems). Models of the subsystems were developed in a number of system-specific modeling tools and validated. The subsystem models are then combined into integrated models to address a number of integrated performance issues involving the ability of the integrated energy transport sys- tem of space station freedom to provide power, controlled cabin temperature and humidity, and equipment thermal control to support operations. 911339. (SP-875) Space station freedom module to truss sys- tem thermal/structural analysis. Andrew H. Warren, Grumman Space Systems Div.; and Joseph E. Arelt, Grumman Space Station Program Support Div. A thermal/structural analysis of the module to truss system (MTS) of the space station freedom (SSF) was performed. Its objective was to find the temperature distributions and tempera- ture gradients in the structure in order to evaluate thermal stresses and deflections in the truss members caused by solar loads and by shadowing of the truss members by other segments of the space station, as it moves around the orbit. Temperatures in the truss components depend on the position and orientation of the space station in the orbit with respect to the sun and earth. Because of the large number of surfaces, thermal-structural analysis of a truss structure typically requires a large amount of effort and computer resources. In order to reduce this, a tech- nique of thermal/structural analysis was developed and applied. A SINDA thermal finite difference model and a TRASYS radia- tion interchange model of the truss were generated automatically from a NASTRAN finite element structural model. The entire process of model development, analysis and thermal/structural data transfer was automated, minimizing analysis time as well as possibility of errors. The primary purpose of the MTS analysis was to develop and demonstrate this technique. The thermal analysis was performed for two extreme scenar- ios, corresponding to two values of solar beta angle. The tempera- ture distribution at one orbital point was chosen to perform the NASTRAN structural finite element analysis and to illustrate how to determine the thermal stresses and deflections. 911340. (SP-875) High conductance thermal interface concept for space applications. Elizabeth C. Poulin, Foster-Miller, Inc.; and D. Clay Horan, NASA Marshall Space Flight Center. An interface concept has been developed which produces high conductance at a thermal/mechanical joint without resorting to high clamping forces or potentially contaminating fillers such as 149</page><page sequence="149">911340-911346 thermal grease. This paper discusses the characteristics of several variations of the high conductance interface concept and com- pares them to those of existing interface concepts proposed for several space station applications. The application of the high conductance concept to thermal joints such as internal coldplate interfaces and external equipment module to heat acquisition plate interfaces would reduce the weight and complexity and increase the efficiency of the space station thermal management system. 911341. (SP-875) Development of a nonazeotropic heat pump for crew hygiene water heating. David H. Walker and Glenn I. Denting , Foster-Miller , Inc. Foster-Miller, Inc., is currently developing a heat pump sys- tem to produce hot water for crew hygiene on future manned space missions. The heat pump utilizes waste heat sources and a nonazeotropic working fluid in a highly efficient cycle. The potential benefits include a reduction in peak power draw from 2 to 5 kW for electric cartridge heaters, to just over 100W for the heat pump. As part of the heat pump development program, a unique high efficiency compressor was developed to maintain lubrication in a zero-gravity environment. Initial testing has resulted in measured COPs of 8.5. 911342. (SP-875) Heat pump evaluation for space station ATCS evolution. Brian E. Ames , Lockheed Engrg. and Sciences Co.; and Patricia A. Petete, NASA Johnson Space Center. The "restructured" baseline has eliminated many options for active thermal control system (ATCS) growth for space station freedom (SSF). Modular addition of baseline technology to increase heat rejection will be extremely difficult. The system design and the available real estate no longer accommodate this type of growth. As the station matures during its thirty years of operation, a demand of up to 165 kW of heat rejection can be expected. The baseline configuration will be able to provide 82.5 kW at eight manned crew capability (EMCC). A promising technology that could increase heat rejection by the necessary 82.5 kW is the heat pump. This paper provides a preliminary feasibility assessment of the application of a vapor compression heat pump to the ATCS. 1991 SA E Transactions Section 1 911343. (SP-875) Recommended space station radiator orien- tation profile. James J. Kantara, Crew and Thermal Systems Dept., Lockheed Engrg. and Sciences Co. The study investigates a space station freedom (SSF) central thermal bus (CTB) radiator array orientation profile that will meet the SSF 82.5 kW heat rejection requirement while maintain- ing radiator angular velocities under 45 deg/minute. The radiator orientation along with the amount of environmental absorbed heat and heat rejection capabilities without any consideration for the radiators exceeding the recommended maximum angular velocities were intially determined. The environments investi- gated were the minimum environment, alternate minimum envi- ronment, maximum environment, and a -80°F (-62.20°C) sink temperature environment. The collective data from the above environments were then used in order to recommend a radiator orientation profile that, under transient conditions, would meet the heat rejection requirements while maintaining the radiator angular velocities under 45 deg/minute, and prevent the ammo- nia in the panels from freezing. The worst sink temperatures were found for ß = 52°, and were in the -62.50°F (-52.50°C) and -73.60°F (-58.67°C) range. The radiator angular velocities obtained in the recommended profile never exceeded 12 deg/minute for all the considered ß angles, and the maximum angular acceleration obtained was equal to 0.00444 deg/sec2. 1991 SA E Transactions Section 1 911344. (SP-872) Comparison of metal oxide absorbents for regenerative carbon dioxide and water vapor removal for advanced portable life support systems. Joan M. Hart, AiRes - e arch Los Angeles Div., Allied-Signal Aerospace Co.; Robert J. Cusick, NASA Johnson Space Center; Greg T. Stonesifer, Lock- heed Engrg. and Sciences Co.; and Craig H . Chang, Allied-Signal Research and Technology. Recent NASA-funded studies of Allied-Signal metal-oxide- based absorbents demonstrated that these absorbents offer a unique capability to remove both metabolic carbon dioxide (CO2) and water (H2O) vapor from breathing air; previously, metal oxides were considered only for the removal of CO2. The concurrent removal of CO2 and H2O vapor can simplify the astronaut portable life support system (PLSS) by combining the CO2 and humidity control functions into one component. A fur- ther benefit is that the removal processes are reversible, permit- ting a regenerative component. Thus, a metal oxide absorbent offers many advantages over the current system, which is nonre- generative and uses separate processes for CO2 and H2O vapor removal. These advantages include lower complexity, lower maintenance, and longer life. The use of metal oxide absorbents for removal of both CO2 and H2O vapor in the PLSS is the focus of an ongoing NASA pro- gram. Recently, two metal oxide formulations previously shown to have promising CO2 and H2O vapor uptake characteristics, durability, and long-term regenerative performance were evalu- ated in a subscale unit operationally representative of full scale. A mixed metal oxide formulation was found to be superior to sil- ver oxide and was selected for further evaluation in a full-scale closed-loop testing scheduled to begin in August 1991. This paper presents the test results that provide the design basis for a full- scale preprototype unit. This metal oxide system effectively per- forms the functions of both CO2 and H2O vapor removal and will significantly reduce the complexity and maintainability of a PLSS while allowing long-term reuse. 1991 SAE Transactions Section 1 911345. (SP-872) Fusible heat sink materials: an identification of alternate candidates. Curtis Lomax, NASA Ames Research Center; and Guna Selvaduray, Dept. of Materials Engrg., San Jose State Univ. Fusible heat sinks are a possible source for thermal regulation of space suited astronauts. Historically, water has been the mate- rial of choice. Identification of alternative materials with greater thermal storage capability could enable both an extension of time between recharging, as well as a reduction in size. An extensive database search was undertaken to identify candidate materials with liquid solid transformations over the temperature range of -18°C (0°F) to 5°C (40°F); and 1215 candidates were identified. Based on available data, 59 candidate materials with thermal storage capability, AH values higher than that of water were iden- tified. This paper presents the methodology utilized in the study, including the decision process used for materials selection. Future work will concentrate on measurement of thermodynamic data of the most promising materials so that the reliability of the data can be improved. 1991 SAE Transactions Section 1 911346. (SP-872) Neutral buoyancy portable life support sys- tem performance study. Chi-Ming Chang, NASA Johnson Space Center; Bruce C. Conger, Lockheed Engrg. and Science Co.; and John V. Iovine, Lockheed Engrg. and Sciences Co. A system performance study on a portable life support system being developed for use in the weightless environment training facility (WETF) and the neutral buoyancy laboratory (NBL) has been completed. The neutral buoyancy portable life support sys- tem (NBPLSS) will provide life support to suited astronauts training for extravehicular activity (EVA) under water without the use of umbilicais. The basic configuration is characterized by the use of medium pressure (200 -300 psi) cryogen (liquid nitro- 150</page><page sequence="150">911346-911351 gen/oxygen mixture) which provides cooling within the extrave- hicular mobility unit (EMU), the momentum which enables flow in the vent loop, and oxygen for breathing. NBPLSS performance was analyzed by using a modified meta- bolic man program to compare competing configurations. Maxi- mum sustainable steady state metabolic rates and transient per- formance based on a typical WETF metabolic rate profile were determined and compared. The systems improved numerical dif- ferencing analyzer-1985 (SINDA'85)/fluid integrator (FLUINT) program was used to model the liquid cooling garment (LCG) vaporizer and the cryogen storage and supply tank. A northern research program was used to optimize pool heat exchanger designs. The system, as modeled, was able to sustain a maximum steady state metabolic rate of 1400 Btu/hr and maintain crew comfort. The success of the NBPLSS is dependent on the devel- opment of new designs to be used for the cryogen supply tank and the LCG vaporizer. 911347. (SP-872) A transient thermal model of a neutral buoy- ancy cryogenic fluid delivery system. Grant C. Bue, Lockheed Engrg. and Sciences Co.; and Bruce C. Conger, Lockheed Engrg. and Science Co. A thermal model has been developed to evaluate, from a ther- mal and performance standpoint, a preliminary design of a neu- tral buoyancy cryogenic fluid delivery system (NBCS). The NBCS is an important component of a neutral buoyancy portable life support system (NBPLSS) to be used by suited astronauts in underwater training for extravehicular activity (EVA) at Johnson Space Center, Houston, Texas. The systems improved numerical differencing analyzer-1985 fluid integrator (SINDA'85/FLUINT) program is used to model the NBCS. The modeling decisions are described, based on details of tank construction and material selection, and include the breakdown of the model components into nodes and conduc- tors. The modeling of positional transients which result from moving internal components are presented, including the control of cycling artifacts. The convection and boiling considerations of three tank fluids (cryogenic fluid, 250 psi N2/O2 gas, and water) are presented. Two piston designs are assessed according to per- formance criteria, with the presentation of temperature and heat transfer rate profiles. Suggestions for subsequent analysis and design modifications are offered. 911348. (SP-872) EMU processing - A myth dispelled. Paul R. Peacock and Richard C. Wilde, Hamilton Standard Div., United Technologies Corp.; Glenn C. Lutz, NASA Johnson Space Center; and Michael A. Melgares, Boeing Aerospace Operations. EMU hardware processing, the refurbishment and checkout subset of EMU ground turn-around activities between shuttle flights, is significantly lower today than it was when EMUs began regular service aboard shuttle. Despite a significant increase in safety checkout steps resulting from the Challenger accident, hands-on processing time has dropped from approximately 4,000 manhours per EMU to approximately 1,050 manhours now. The following aspects of hardware maturity contribute to this reduc- tion: 1) EMU hardware problems have been identified and fixed; 2) flight hardware and ground test rigs were designed or modified to simplify testing, and test procedures were standardized and streamlined; and 3) increased confidence in the hardware allows extension of inspection, service and test intervals. The hardware processing sequence has recently been simpli- fied and implementation is expected to reduce EMU hardware processing time to approximately 600 manhours/EMU in the near future. 911349. (SP-872) Evolution of the extravehicular mobility unit for future missions. Bradford R. Prouty, Richard C. Wilde, and Michael Gan, Hamilton Standard Div., United Technologies Corp. The various configurations being considered for space station freedom have resulted in a moving target for tomorrow's demand for EVA and the requirements that will be imposed on the extra- vehicular mobility unit (EMU). The shuttle EMU is baselined to perform the assembly and operational activities of station and is currently undergoing the necessary incremental re-certification. This paper presents the evolution of an EMU from two per- spectives. First, evolution is discussed within the context of con- tinuously improving the life support system and the space suit assembly from the Mercury Program to NASA's current flight EMU. This includes a status of the on-going enhancements and a discussion on the merits of additional improvements. The sec- ond perspective describes evolution for future programs involv- ing significant differences in mission requirements and environ- ments. 911350. Limits in predicting the eleven-year solar cycle modu- lation of radiation hazards to exploration space missions in the next century. Gary Heckman, Space Environmental Lab., NOAH. The 11-year solar cycle modulates radiation hazards through- out interplanetary space. The galactic cosmic ray (GCR) back- ground varies approximately inversely with the 11-year cycle, as defined by the traditional Wolf sunspot number, by nearly 30 per- cent over the course of the cycle; the background reaches mini- mum around the time of sunspot maximum and maintains a broad maximum around the time of sunspot minimum. Solar particle events (SPEs) are short, intense events that typically last a few days but produce particle fluxes much larger than the GCR background for brief periods of time. SPEs may occur at any time in the 11 -year solar cycle, but historically have been more fre- quent during the years around sunspot maximum. Protection against radiation exposure during future exploration-class space missions depends on knowledge of the form and length of the solar cycle, both of which are extremely variable. Limitations in our ability to predict these quantities over long time scales may increase the complexity of radiation protection problems for exploration missions. This paper reviews the current limitations in predicting the solar cycle and the associated levels of SPE and GCR fluxes. 1991 SAE Transactions Section 1 911351. Solar flare protection for manned lunar missions: analysis of the October 1989 proton flare event. Lisa C. Simonsen and John E. Nealy, NASA Langley Research Center; Herbert H. Sauer, NOAA Space Environmental Lab.; and Lawrence W. Townsend, NASA Langley Research Center. Several large solar proton events occurred in the latter half of 1989. For a moderately shielded spacecraft in free space, the potential exposure would have been greatest for the flare which occurred between October 19 to 27, 1989. This flare was compa- rable to the large flare event of August 1972. The temporal varia- tions of the proton energy spectra at approximately 1 AU were monitored by the GOES-7 satellite. These data, recorded and pro- cessed at the NOAA-Boulder Space Environment Laboratory, provide the opportunity to analyze dose rates and cumulative doses which might be incurred by astronauts in transit to, or on, the moon. Of particular importance in such an event is the time development of exposure in the early phases of the flare, for which dose rates may range over many orders of magnitude in the first few hours. Consequently, special attention is given to the early time variation of the dose rate. The cumulative dose as a function of time for the entire event is also predicted. In addition to basic shield calculations, dose rate contours are constructed for flare shelters in free-space and on the lunar surface. For longer duration lunar missions, the impact of such a flare exposure is 151</page><page sequence="151">911351-911357 assessed in relation to the predicted steady dose rate of the galac- tic cosmic rays. 1991 SAE Transactions Section 1 911352. Radiation exposure and risk assessment for critical female body organs. William Atwell, Space Transportation Sys- tems Div., Rockwell International; Mark D. Wey land, Rockwell International ; and Alva C. Hardy, NASA Johnson Space Center . Space radiation exposure limits for astronauts are based on recommendations of the National Council on Radiation Protec- tion and Measurements. These limits now include the age at exposure and sex of the astronaut. A recently-developed comput- erized anatomical female (CAF) model is discussed in detail. Computer-generated, cross-sectional data are presented to illus- trate the completeness of the CAF model. By applying ray-tracing techniques, shield distribution functions have been computed to calculate absorbed dose and dose equivalent values for a variety of critical body organs (e.g., breasts, lungs, thyroid gland, etc) and mission scenarios. Specific risk assessments, i.e., cancer induc- tion and mortality, are reviewed. 1991 SAE Transactions Section 1 911353. Computer aided radiation analysis for manned space- craft. Matthew H. Appleby, Brand N. Griffin, and Ernest R. Tan- ner, Advanced Civil Space Systems Group, Boeing Co.; William R. Pogue, CAMJJS, Inc.; and Michael J. Golightly, NASA Johnson Space Center. An innovative radiation assessment system combining com- puter aided design (CAD) capabilities with established NASA transport codes has been developed, permitting fast, accurate analysis capable of supporting preliminary design programs. Fol- lowed by brief discussions of the primary natural particle radia- tion sources and the operational sensitivities imposed by them on crew and spacecraft, the analytical system and methods are described. The use of this automated analytical tool called Brem (Boeing radiation exposure model), is then addressed regarding spacecraft design and the optimization of radiation shielding. 911354. A study of lens opacification fora Mars mission. Judy L. Shinn and John W. Wilson, NASA Langley Research Center; A. B. Cox, Radiation Science Div., USAF School of Aerospace Medicine; and J. T. Lett, Dept. of Radiological Health Sciences, Colorado State Univ. Risk assessment in an environment of mixed radiation quality has been addressed in the past by use of the experimental parame- ter "relative biological effectiveness" (RBE) or the related "qual- ity factor" (Q), which is defined for purposes of radiation protec- tion. Herein, an alternative method, which is based on risk- related cross sections, is used to estimate risks of "stationary" cat- aracts caused by radiation exposures during extended missions in deep space. Estimates of the even more important risk of late degenerative cataractogenesis are made on the basis of the limited data available. Data on lenticular opacification in the New Zea- land white rabbit, an animal model from which such results can be extrapolated to humans, are analyzed by the Langley cosmic ray shielding code (HZETRN) to generate estimates of stationary cataract formation resulting from a Mars mission. The effects of the composition of shielding material and the relationship between risk and linear energy transfer (LET) are given, and the effects of target fragmentation on the risk coefficients are evalu- ated explicitly. The needs for further experimental lens opacifica- tion studies are discussed. 1991 SAE Transactions Section 1 911355. Let analyses of biological damage during solar parti- cle events. Francis A. Cucinotta, John W. Wilson, Lawrence W. Townsend, and Judy L. Shinn, NASA Langley Research Center; and Robert Katz, University of Nebraska. Solar particle events (SPE) are typically dominated by high- energy, low-linear energy transfer (LET) protons. Biological dam- age to astronauts during an SPE is expected to include a large con- tribution from high LET target fragments produced in nuclear reactions in tissue. We study the effects of nuclear reactions on integral LET spectra, behind typical levels of spacecraft and body shielding, for the historically largest flares using the high-energy transport code, BRYNTRN in conjunction with several biologi- cal damage models. The cellular track model of Katz provides an accurate description of cellular damage from heavy ion exposure. The track model is applied with BRYNTRN to provide an LET decomposition of survival and transformation rates for solar pro- ton events. In addition, a fluence-based risk coefficient formal- ism is used to estimate Harderian gland tumor induction in rodents and cataractogenesis in rabbits from solar flares, and a LET analysis is used to assess the relative contribution from tar- get fragments on these biological endpoints. 1991 SAE Transactions Section 1 911356. Real-time in situ sensors and control integration for life support systems. Gerald E. Voecks, Jep Propulsion Lab., Cali- fornia Institute of Technology ; and P. K. Seshan, Jet Propulsion Lab., California Institute of Technology. Successful operation of life support systems for human explo- ration of space will depend largely on in situ sensors and integra- tion of these sensors to an autonomous control architecture. The complexity of a life support system demands that these sensors be uniquely qualified for a number of specific applications. Such applications may require multifunctional monitoring of the sen- sor environment and intelligent interaction with other sensors and control elements. In situ sensors found in the chemical pro- cessing industry are largely not multifunctional and not necessar- ily selected for minimal weight, volume and power demand. Therefore, the state-of-the-art for in situ sensors found in the chemical processing industries is not directly transferrable to life support applications. Highly autonomous life support systems require reliable chemical, physical and biosensors requiring little maintenance and which are highly fault-tolerant. These sensors will operate in a hierarchical network involving distributed data- bases, prediction models, rule-based reasoning modules for hypothesis generation and verification, controllers and final con- trol elements. This paper discusses the limitations of the state-of- the-art for in situ sensors and argues in favor of a program of adaptation and enhancement of off-the-shelf sensor technologies and of research and innovation to develop more appropriate sen- sor technologies for life support systems. This paper also dis- cusses briefly the desirable characteristics of smart sensors for life support applications and presents some preliminary concepts for hierarchical integration of in situ sensors and control elements. 911357. Process control integtration requirements for advanced life support systems applicable to manned space mis- sions. Paul A. Spurlock and Jack M. Spurlock, S&amp;A Automated Systems; and Peggy L. Evan ich, NASA Headquarters. Applications of life support systems for space missions to date have been limited to the use of relatively simple processes and, consequently, there has been minimal utilization of process con- trol within those systems. Furthermore, the maturation of the sensor technology required for these applications has not tracked that of other system components. Future integrated life support systems for long duration missions should be expected to have a substantially higher level of complexity, with operational demands similar to those of advanced chemical plants and atten- dant requirements for sophisticated process-control and sensor technologies to achieve safety and reliability objectives. Early integration of state-of-the-art control systems and related compo- nents into the methodology is necessary for optimum interfacing effectiveness during design and development of these new sys- tems, and to ensure parallel growth during operational life cycles. 152</page><page sequence="152">911357-911364 This paper provides an overview of recent developments in process-control technology which might have applications in future advanced life support systems for long duration space operations and describes some of the design criteria that should be considered. These criteria relate to control system selection and optimization, and process-control interfacing methodology. 911358. ECLSS instrumentation technology development for the space exploration initiative. Jinjun Bao , McDonnell Douglas Space Systems Co.; Paul Wieland and William R. Humphries , NASA Marshall Space Flight Center ; and Bryce L. Diamant , McDonnell Douglas Space Systems Co. The availability of real time, automated, and reliable atmo- sphere and water monitoring instrumentation within the time- frame of future manned lunar and Mars missions is vital to the success of the space exploration initiative (SEI). For these mis- sions, with durations measured in years, the environmental con- trol and life support system (ECLSS) must be properly instru- mented to assure the crew that the physical, chemical, and biolog- ical properties of the atmosphere and water are within ranges that are healthy and safe. The technology for measuring some proper- ties, such as temperature and pressure, is currently available for most applications; however, there are a number of instrumenta- tion functions required for future long duration missions that cannot be performed by current technology. Defining the areas where current instrumentation technology falls short of satisfying potential SEI requirements is a task of immediate importance. Many of these issues involve the automa- tion of measurement processes that currently require crew involvement, and/or the reduction of cycle times to achieve real time measurements. In addition to defining broad concerns, spe- cific technologies must be identified to satisfy future require- ments. The process of identifying instrumentation shortcomings and concentrating efforts on the development of technologies which can best eliminate these shortcomings will help ensure that instrumentation needed for SEI missions will be available before planned mission start dates. To lay the groundwork for this definition phase, ECLSS instrumentation is discussed by outlining the types of sensors used on past space flights and indicating where improvements, innovation, and new developments may be required. Factors addressed include cycle time, automation, reliability, and resup- ply, all of which determined to what degree equipment operation is transparent to the crew. Based on the current knowledge base, emerging new technologies in sensor design are discussed. Instru- mentation technologies recommended for future development are identified and prioritized according to the need for particular monitoring functions and the current maturity of applicable tech- nologies. 1991 SAE Transactions Section 1 911359. ECLSS computer aided testing using knowledge based systems. Bob M. Thornton and James B. Schultz , Micro Craft, Inc.; and Edson A. Worden, Boeing Aerospace and Elec- tronics. Design and implementation of a computer aided test and a knowledge base/object oriented database for space station free- dom is discussed. Described within the paper is the design and development of "C'VSQL language software and programmable logic needed to acquire data and provide system control functions. Creation of a user interface for an intelligent report generator, a database of test anomalies with interactive alarming and an expert system for system trouble-shooting is outlined. 911360. Chemical sensors for CELSS application. Mary Beth Tabacco and Quan Zhou, Geo-Centers, Inc. Fiber optic chemical sensors are being developed for on-line monitoring of gases and liquids. The sensors utilize novel porous polymer or glass optical fibers in which selective chemical reagents have been immobilized. These reagents react with the analyte of interest resulting in a change in the optical properties of the sensor. These sensors (or optrodes) are particularly suited to insitu monitoring of atmospheric trace contaminants and nutrient solution parameters as required in life support systems or flight experiments. Sensors have been demonstrated for detec- tion of ammonia, ethylene, carbon monoxide, pH and humidity. 1991 SAE Transactions Section 1 911361. On-line monitoring of water quality and plant nutri- ents in space applications based on photodiode array spectrome- try. Kenneth J. Schlager, Biotronics Technologies, Ine . Significant needs exist for on-line real-time monitoring of water quality and hydroponie plant nutrients in regenerative life support systems. Toxic metals and organic pollutants in recir- culated water are more effectively controlled by on-line monitor- ing. Biomass production of various crops may be enhanced by optimal control of plant nutrients. A new on-line fiber optic spec- trometer is in development that uses a combination of ultravio- let-visible absorption measurements in combination with liquid atomic emission spectra to assay a wide variety of chemical com- pounds and ions in solution. Problems created by interfering, overlapping spectra are solved through the use of pattern recogni- tion methods for multicomponent chemical analysis. This ana- lytical instrument has been successfully applied to the analysis of 15-component plant nutrient solutions. 1991 SAE Transactions Section 1 911363. Development of an expert system for analysis of shut- tle atmospheric revi ta liza ti on and pressure control subsystem anomalies. Sharon A. Lafuse, NASA Johnson Space Center. A pre-prototype expert system called SLMES (shuttle leak management expert system) has been developed that enables an ECLSS (environmental control and life support system) sub- system manager to analyze subsystem anomalies and formulate flight procedures based on Eight data. SLMES combines rule- based expert system technology with traditional FORTRAN- based software into an integrated system. SLMES uses rules to ask the user for configuration information and to prompt for flight data. SLMES analyzes the data using rules and when it detects a problem that requires a simulation it sets up the input for the FORTRAN-based simulation program ARPCS2AT2. This program predicts the cabin total pressure and composition as a function of time. The program simulates the pressure control system, crew 02 masks, airlock repress/depress valves, and leak- age, etc. When the simulation has completed, other SLMES rules are triggered to examine the results for simulation contrary to flight data. For example, the simulation may calculate that more nitrogen is needed than what is available. If SLMES detects such a condition it will suggest methods to try to correct the problem and allow the user to re-run the simulation. Results are presented to the user in graphical and tabular form. This paper describes the expert system and how it can be used. The paper also describes how expert system technology can be applied to other areas. 911364. Absorbent testing and mathematical modeling of a solid amine regenerative CO2 and H2O removal system. Fran k F. J en g and Robert G . Williamson, Lockheed Engrg. and Science Co.; and Fred A. Ouellette, Marybeth A. Edeen, and C. H. Lin, NASA Johnson Space Center. A solid amine based regenerative CO2 removal system (RCRS) has been selected by NASA/JSC for extended orbiter missions. To better understand the performance of solid amine, a bench scale solid amine test stand was built at JSC. The core of the test stand is a 1" diameter by 3" long adsorption bed, which was packed with solid amine adsorbent along with a heat transfer material, Duocel. The test bed was designed for evaluating mass and heat transfer performance of solid amine system under vari- ous operating conditions. The paper will discuss the design and 153</page><page sequence="153">911364-911371 construction details of the test bed, as well as test results, includ- ing adsorption breakthrough, adsorption and desorption of CO2 and H2O vapor. A model for predicting the performance of regenerative CO2 and H2O vapor adsorption of the solid amine system under vari- ous operating conditions has been developed in parallel with the testing of the solid amine test stand. The coefficient for mass transfer, calculated from test results was used in the model. The mathematical model of the adsorption and desorption sections of the system will be discussed. Comparison between test data and the simulation results will be presented. 1991 SAE Transactions Section 1 911365. Long-life heat transport loop material test .Heather E. Holmes , Peter P. Perkins , Jerome D. Varsik, and Arthur K. Col- ling, Hamilton Standard Div., United Technologies Corp. In 1979, a test was initiated to evaluate the use of dissimilar metals in close conjunction with each other, including alumi- num, stainless steel and an Al-Ti-Al laminate heat exchanger, in a closed deoxygenated water coolant loop over an extended vehi- cle life. The closed, sealed loop contained distilled, deoxygenated water initially supplied at &lt;0.3ppm by weight dissolved oxygen. The system involved a variety of dissimilar metals, including 300 series CRES, 6061 aluminum alloy, gold-nickel braze alloy and thermometer bi-metallics. Coatings were also used to provide added protection to the aluminum. A stainless steel to aluminum transition tube was sandblasted, passivated, alodined and coated with P.D. George epoxy coating No. 923. The heat exchanger was of plate fine construction with parting sheets made of an Al-Ti-Al laminate designed to prevent through wall pitting in case corro- sion attack initiated. The test plan originally called for water sam- ples to be collected periodically over three years at which time the test apparatus was to be dissassembled for inspection. Favorable analysis of water samples and no evidence of filter obstruction from corrosion by-products delayed disassembly and prompted continuation of the test. The system experienced a total of approximately 10 years of operation. The system was then dis- sassembled and visually/metallographically inspected. This paper presents a detailed description of the test system, test pro- cedures and test results. 1991 SAE Transactions Section 1 911366. Shuttle orbiter active thermal control subsystem design and flight experience. Timothy A. Bond, NASA Johnson Space Center; Jordan L. Metcalf, Lockheed Engrg. and Sciences Co.; and Carmelo Ascuncion, Rockwell International. The space shuttle orbiter active thermal control subsystem (ATCS) is designed to provide vehicle and payload cooling dur- ing all phases of a mission and during ground turnaround opera- tions. The system consists of dual Freon coolant loops (FCLs) that transport heat from the various heat sources to four major heat rejection devices. The waste heat from these sources is trans- ferred to the FCLs by coldplates and heat exchangers and is then rejected by one of the four heat sinks, depending on mission phase. During the first 39 flights of the shuttle program, the ATCS has demonstrated excellent operational performance, although several flight anomalies and maintenance problems have been experienced. This paper describes the operation of the shuttle ATCS and some of the problems encountered, their causes and resolutions. Principal emphasis is given to the major problems that have been encountered with the degradation of Freon flow rate on the orbiter Columbia; the flash evaporator subsystem (FES) mission anomalies which occurred on STS-26 and STS-34, and opera- tional experience; and problems encountered with the ammonia boiler subsystem (ABS). 1991 SAE Transactions Section 1 911367. Flight test of an improved solid waste collection sys- tem. W. Thornton and Hubert J. Brasseaux, Jr., NASA Johnson Space Center; and H. Whitmore, Whitmore Enterprises. An improved human waste collection system was developed in 1985 using a piston and cylinder which collects, compacts, and stores in replaceable volumes human waste including cleaning material. Disposable pads on the piston face seal and clean the cylinder and occlusive air valves. Airflow provides waste entrain- ment and temporary retention. A series of prototypes including an automatic one-button operation unit was built and ground tested. A manually operated prototype with a number of test fea- tures including variable airflow was flown and evaluated on shut- tle flight STS-35. Performance was nominal. An airflow of 45 CFM (1.27 m3 min -1) was found to be adequate. Mean stowage volume of waste and hygienic material per use was 18.7 in3 (306 cm3). It now appears that such a unit can provide adequate collec- tion of human waste and all associated hygienic material with minimum overhead of machine size, complexity, and power, and minimum logistical support including maintenance, cleaning, operating materials, and storage space for shuttle or space station. 911369. Preliminary design of health care systems for space exploration. Karen L. Mathes, KRUG Life Sciences ; and Scott C. Simmons and Bruce A. McKinley, Krug Life Sciences. Health of space explorers is a requisite for success of human exploration missions and, potentially, for return of explorers to Earth. Continuous, long term existence and complex, potentially hazardous tasks in space environments will challenge health of explorers. Immediate return to Earth will not be possible. Health care systems are being designed to address these concerns, start- ing from the requirement to maintain health of crew members throughout all mission phases, and the assumption that clinical (medical), preventive, and occupational health care will be neces- sary in space as on Earth. Systems for medical care, health moni- toring and countermeasures, and environmental monitoring and countermeasures are being design. Basic system definition con- cepts include an individual crew member, a crew surgeon, remote consultation, equipment, and work area or volume within space habitats that is dedicated for health care. Protocols developed for and adapted from Earth based operations offer specific space operations designs, and may offer a practical alternative to design of unique, highly automated devices for space systems. Guide- lines for analog health care facilities on Earth are being used to provide work volume (area) estimates for preliminary space sys- tem designs. Dedicated work volume is seen to represent the intersection of system and operations design. For exploration missions, on site expertise and capability, augmented by proto- cols, computer-based decision support and remote communica- tion, are needed. 911371. The NASA radiation health program. Walter Schim- merling, Jet Propuslion Lab., California Institute of Technology. Protection from the hazards of ionizing radiation in the space envionment has been identified as critical to human exploration, and is of the utmost importance both for journeying to and living on other planetary bodies. The major radiation hazards for explo- ration class missions outside of the earth's magnetosphere are due to protons from solar particle events and to the highly charged, energetic (HZE) particles constituting galactic cosmic rays. The mean free path for nuclear interactions of HZE particles is comparable to shielding and tissue thicknesses present in human interplanetary exploration, resulting in a signficant frac- tion of nuclear reaction products at depth. The energy deposition of HZE particles, on the microscopic scale of cells, is extremely non-uniform. Since the physics and biology of HZE particles have been studied for a much shorter time than that of other types of radiation, current knowledge about the biological effects of space radiation cannot predict astronaut health hazards with acceptable precision. Such predictions are required in order to 154</page><page sequence="154">911371-911378 define acceptable risk levels for space exploration and specify shielding for the lunar base, lunar vehicles, and Mars spacecraft. Attempts to deal with present uncertainties by making worst case assumptions may overestimate the required shielding thickness by as much as a factor of 10 and lead to inordinate vehicle masses. Major sources of these uncertainties will be illustrated. The NASA Life Sciences program to resolve the critical problems posed by ionizing radiation in interplanetary space, which con- sists of an expanded ground-based research effort and space- based validation using the LifeSat satellite, will be described. 911373. The role of human factors in missions of exploration. Mary M. Connors, NASA Ames Research Center. Human factors addresses humans in their active and interac- tive capacities. The importance of human factors has risen sharply with the increased activity and responsibility of space crews and will culminate with missions of exploration. Human factors requirements are highly dependent on the characteristics and conditions of the mission, and an explication of human fac- tors requirements must begin with detailed mission analysis. A framework in which human factors issues could be considered is outlined, and candidate areas for early investigation are pro- posed. Approaches needed to transition research results to mis- sion planners and implemented are discussed. 911374. Antarctic planetary analog. Thomas E. Styczyński, Lockheed Missiles and Space Co., Inc. The space exploration initiative will contain many avenues for both space and terrestrial technology development and applica- tions. In addition, the development of architecture independent technology will provide the first meaningful milestones as the overall program matures. A factor in SEI technology will be the utilization of various earth based analogs as functional testbeds for hardware, software and operations development and verification. The most interest- ing of these proposed analogs involves the antartic programs managed by the National Science Foundation (NSF). The driver for antarctic planetary analog is an increased awareness of potential impacts from the continued science and exploration operations to this unique environment. NSF is look- ing to the insertion of space technology to provide alternate sources for electrical power to reduce their dependency on fossil fuels; closed environmental support systems and habitats to improve the efficiency of the working staff and reduce heating energy requirements; and the approaches to improving science thru modularity, system standardization and remote system operations. The antarctic analog provides a means of developing systems and system technology in a real operational environment with direct application to SEI requirements. This test bed will also pro- vide a link between space system developments and terrestrial requirements for addressing present and future environmental issues. 911375. (SP-875) Phase III integrated water recovery testing at MSFC: partially closed hygiene loop and open potable loop results and lessons learned. R. M. Bagdigian and Mary S. Traweek, NASA Marshall Space Flight Center ; and G. K. Griffith and M. R. Griffin, Sverdrup Technology, Inc. A series of tests has been conducted at the NASA Marshall Space Flight Center (MSFC) to evaluate the performance of a pre- development water recovery system. Potable, hygiene, and urine reclamation subsystems were integrated with end-use equipment items and successfully operated in open and partially closed-loop modes, with man-in-the-loop, for a total of 28 days. Several sig- nificant subsystem physical anomalies were encountered during testing. Reclaimed potable and hygiene water generally met the current space station freedom (SSF) water quality specifications for inorganic and microbiological constituents, but exceeded the maximum allowable concentrations for total organic carbon (TOC). This paper summarizes the test objectives, system design, test activities/protocols, significant results/anomalies, and major lessons learned. 1991 SAE Transactions Section 1 911376. (SP-875) The characterization of organic contami- nants during the development of the space station water reclama- tion and management system. Harold Cole, M. Habercom, M. Crenshaw, and S. Johnson, Missiles and Space Div., Boeing Co.; S. Manuel, Missiles and Space Div., Beoing Co.; W. Martindale and G. Whitman, Missiles and Space Div., Boeing Co.; and Mary S. Traweek, NASA Marshall Space Flight Center. Chemical analyses of water samples from space station envi- ronmental control and life support system (ECLSS) testing have resulted in the detection of many different organic compounds. The complexity of the ECLSS sample matrices requires multiple analytical schemes for sample preparation/cleanup and instru- mental analyses to enhance characterization. Examples of the application of a variety of techniques for characterizing samples for fatty acids, alcohols, detergents, and volatile/semivolatile basic, neutral, and phenolic acid contaminants are presented. Data, applications, and interpretations are illustrated for a vari- ety of techniques including sample preparation/cleanup tech- niques, ion chromatography, high performance liquid chroma- tography, electron impact/chemical ionization mass spectrome- try, and gas chromatography with a variety of detectors. Summa- ries of the major organic contaminants contributing to the total organic carbon content are presented. 1991 SAE Transactions Section 1 911377. (SP-875) Microbial distribution in the environmental control and life support system water recovery test conducted at NASA, MSFC. M. C. Roman, NASA Marshall Space Flight Cen- ter; M. E. Wilson, Milliles and Space Div., Boeing Co.; N. E. Jack- son, Missiles and Space Div., Boeing Co.; J. J. Gauthier, Univer- sity of Alabama; and B. A. Kilgore, T. L. Huff, D. C. Obenhuber, and D. W. Terrell, Sverdrup Technology ; Inc. NASA/MSFC is developing a physical/chemical treatment system to reclaim wastewater for reuse on space station freedom (SSF). Integrated testing of hygiene and potable water subsystems assessed the capability to reclaim water to SSF specifications. The test was conducted from May through July 1990 with a total of 47 days of system test operation. Water samples were analyzed using standard cultural methods employing membrane filtration and spread plate techniques and epifluorescence microscopy. Fatty acid methyl ester (FAME) and biochemical profiles were used for microbial identification. Analysis of waste and product water produced by the subsystems demonstrated the effective reduction of viable microbial populations greater than 8.0E+06 colony forming units (CFU) per 100 mL to an average of 5 CFU/ 100 mL prior to distribution into storage tanks. Predominant microbial species isolated from product water included hete- rotrophs commonly isolated from water and soil and normal flora from the human body. 1991 SAE Transactions Section 1 911378. (SP-875) Microbial biofilm studies of the environmen- tal control and life support system water recovery test for space station freedom. D. C. Obenhuber, Sverdrup Technology, Inc.; E. B. Rodgers, NASA Marshal Space Flight Center; and T. L. Huff, Sverdrup Technology, Inc. NASA is developing a water recovery system (WRS) for space station freedom to reclain human waste water for reuse by astro- nauts as hygiene or potable water. A water recovery test (WRT) currently in progress investigates the performance of a prototype of the WRS. Analysis of biofilm accumulation, the potential for microbially influenced corrosion (MIC) in the WRT, and studies of iodine disinfection of biofilm are reported. 155</page><page sequence="155">911378-911384 Analysis of WRT components indicated the presence of organic deposits and biofilms in selected tubing. Water samples from the WRT contained acid-producing and sulfate-reducing organisms implicated in corrosion processes. Corrosion of an alu- minum alloy was accelerated in the presence of these water sam- ples; however, stainless steel corrosion rates were not accelerated. Biofilm iodine sensitivity tests using an experimental labora- tory-scale recycled water system containing a microbial check valve (MCV) demonstrated that an iodine concentration of 1-2 mg/1 was ineffective at eliminating microbial biofilm. For com- plete disinfection an initial concentration of 16 mg/1 was required which was gradually reduced by the MCV over 4-8 hours to 1-2 mg/1. This treatment may be useful in controlling biofilm forma- tion. 1991 SAE Transactions Section 1 911379. (SP-875) Space station freedom environmental data- base system (FEDS) for MSFC testing. Gail S. Story , Sverdrup Technology Inc.; Wendy Williams , NASA Marshall Space Flight Center; and Charles Chiù , ION Systems, Inc. The water recovery test (WRT) at Marshall Space Flight Cen- ter (MSFC) is the first demonstration of integrated water recov- ery systems for potable and hygiene water reuse as envisioned for space station freedom (SSF). In order to satisfy the safety and health requirements placed on the SSF program and facilitate test data assessment, an extensive laboratory analysis database was established to provide a central archive and data retrieval func- tion. The database is required to store analysis results for physi- cal, chemical, and microbial parameters measured from water, air and surface samples collected at various locations throughout the test facility. The oracle relational database management sys- tem (RDBMS) was utilized to implement a secured on-line infor- mation system with the ECLSS WRT program as the foundation for this system. The database is supported on a VAX/VMS 8810 series mainframe and is accessible from the Marshall Informa- tion Network System (MINS). This paper summarizes the data- base requirements, system design, interfaces, and future enhance- ments. 1991 SAE Transactions Section 1 911380. (SP-875) Space station freedom water recovery test total organic carbon accountability. Mike S. Davidson, ION Sys- tems; Laurence E. Slivon, Battelle Memorial Institute ; Linda Sheldon, Research Triangle Institute; and Mary S. Traweek, NASA Marshall Space Flight Center. Marshall Space Flight Center's (MSFC) water recovery test (WRT) addresses the concept of integrated hygiene and potable reuse water recovery systems baselined for space station freedom (SSF). To assess the adequacy of water recovery system designs and conformance of reclaimed water quality to established speci- fications, MSFC has initiated an extensive water characterization program. MSFC's goal is to quantitatively account for a large per- centage of organic compounds present in waste and reclaimed hygiene and potable waters from the WRT and in humidity con- densate from spacelab missions. The program is coordinated into Phase A and B. Phase A's focus is qualitative and semi- quantitative. Precise quantitative analyses are not emphasized. Phase B's focus centers on a near complete quantitative charac- terization of all water types. Technical approaches along with Phase A and partial Phase B investigations on the compositional analysis of total organic carbon (TOC) accountability are pres- ented. 1991 SAE Transactions Section 1 911381. (SP-875) System sterilization for space station envi- ronmental control and life support system, water recovery test. Ray Parham and Tony R. Tipps, Micro Craft, Inc. This paper addresses the methods, procedures, and results of the system sterilization associated with the environmental con- trol and life support system phase III, water recovery test, stages 1 A/2 A/3 A, which took place at the Marshall Space Flight Center, Huntsville, Alabama. Sterilization was required for several pur- poses in this test: to provide a microbially free baseline in the test bed for evaluation of the environmental control and life support system water recovery design, to recover any portion of the sys- tem in the event of a microbial upset, and to provide a source of facility water to be used by test subjects for showers and hand- washes. Typical components in the system include, tubing, water storage tanks, pumps, valves, instrumentation, heat exchangers, and sample ports. 911382. (SP-872) MR imaging of hand microcirculation as a potential tool for space glove testing and design. Trista A. Nie- mann, Steve W. Peterson, and Alvin M. Strauss, Mech. Engrg. Dept., Vanderbilt JJniv.; and Christine H. Lorenz, Dept. of Radiol- ogy and Radiological Sciences, Vanderbilt Univ. The task of evaluating and designing space gloves requires accurate biomechanical characterization of the hand. The avail- ability of magnetic resonance (MR) imaging has created new opportunities for in vivo analysis of physiological phenomena such as the relationship between circulation and fatigue. An MR imaging technique originally proposed to quantita- tively evaluate cerebal perfusion has been modified to evaluate the capillary microcirculation in hand muscles. An experimental protocol was developed to acquire perfusion-weighted images in the hand before and after various levels of exercise. Preliminary results on the feasibility of applying the MR imaging technique to the study of microcirculation and fatigue in the hand are pres- ented. The potential of this method for space glove testing and design is also discussed. 1991 SAE Transactions Section 1 911383. (SP-872) Spacesuit glove thermal micrometeoroid gar- ment protection versus human factors design parameters. Jeff Chodak, ILC Dover Inc.; and Philip M. Spampinato, ILC Dover, Inc. The outer cover layer of the spacesuit (the thermal micromete- oroid garment or TMG) is designed to protect the inner layers and the astronaut from the hazards of the space environment. Providing this protection in the gloves becomes a human factors and materials design challenge. The gloves require more protec- tion from hazards such as abrasion, puncture, and thermal con- duction than the other parts of the suit due to the hand/tool inter- face as the astronaut works in space. At the same time, the TMG designer must also try to meet demanding human factors goals, such as minimizing fatigue, and maximizing tactility and grip- ping ability. This paper provides a general review of the glove TMG, including definitions of the glove and its functions, and details of the parameters that are considered when designing for protec- tion and performance. Results of glove testing to determine the impact of the TMG on glove performance will be reported. Finally, some consideration of future requirements for space sta- tion and beyond will be discussed, including some lessons learned that should be applied to new designs. 911384. (SP-872) A prototype power assist EVA glove. John A. Main, Vanderbilt Univ.; and Alvin M. Strauss and Steve W. Peterson, Mech. Engrg. Dept., Vanderbilt Univ. The most recent generation of space suit EVA gloves has addressed the problem of loose fit and stiffness in the fingers, but it remains difficult to build a glove assembly with low metacar- pophalangeal joint stiffness. Fatigue due to constantly displacing the glove from a neutral position has been reported as the limiting factor in some EVA activities. This paper outlines an actuation system that uses gas filled bladders attached to the back of the EVA glove to provide the necessary force to bend the glove at the metacarpal joint, thus providing greater endurance during finger grasping tasks. A sim- 156</page><page sequence="156">911384-911390 ple on-off controller senses hand movement through small pres- sure sensors between the finger and the glove restraint. The con- troller then fills or exhausts the bladders on the back of the glove to effectively move the neutral position of the glove as the hand inside moves. 911385. (SP-872) Analysis of space suit mobility bearings using the finite element method. Joseph V. Welch , ILC Dover, Ine . During the redesign of the shuttle space suit waist bearing, ILC Dover investigated using the finite element method as a means to evaluate a bearings' deflection characteristics. The minimiza- tion of bearing torque to reduce crew member fatigue is one of the design goals for the bearings' use in the space suit. A structural analysis method was developed that predicts relative radial deflections, ball loads, and contact angle, some of the determi- nants of bearing torque. This technique offers deflection and ball load information to the design engineer that have previously not been available until after prototype construction and testing. Having the finite element analysis capability for space suit bear- ings played an important role in the design of a zero prebreathe suit development bearing. 1991 SAE Transactions Section 1 911386. (SP-872) Casting technology as applied to advanced space suit concepts. Ralph A. Toscano, Jr., Air-Lock, Inc. Since its inception, the space program has relied heavily upon stitched and cemented fabric goods in fabricating its space suits, and these items have performed satisfactorily. However, with the requirements for future extravehicular activity, (EVA), missions, and the planning of activities such as the construction of space station, lunar and martian exploratory missions, it has become apparent through papers given on future space suit design, that some of the fabric portions of space suits may well be replaced with hard goods. This being the case, NASA and other aerospace organizations, have been giving serious thought to designs that utilize either limited hard goods or entire hard suits. Several engineering and manufacturing technologies, (e.g., CAD/CAM, finite element analysis, soft-tooling and computer- ized numerical control), have been drawn upon to demonstrate the feasibility of investment cast hard space suit elements, as well as the practical application of this well established technology. In the course of developing several prototypes, it became apparent that machined investment castings are a reliable, accurate and economical means of supplying quality EVA space suit hard goods. The collective experience drawn from producing these prototypes strongly suggests that this methodology could easily be performed on a production basis. It is the intent of this paper to present a case for machined investment castings as an alternate means of providing hard elements for future space suits. 911387. (SP-872) Development of a portable contamination detector for use during EVA .James R. Valentine, Peter E. Glaser, Gary C. Koger, and Dale N. Larson, Arthur D. Little, Inc.; and Joseph H. Brooks, Albert C. Cope land, and Robert L. Frost, Lock- heed Missiles and Space Co., Inc. Initial efforts in the development of an EVA portable contami- nation detector (EVA PCD) for use by the EVA crew have resulted in the selection and preliminary testing of a concept based upon time-of-flight (TOF) mass spectrometry. The EVA PCD will be a compact, man-portable device intended for use in the ambient vacuum outside the space station. It will be used to monitor the surfaces of the EVA suits and mobility units for the presence of potentially toxic contaminants, such as hydrazine propellants and oxidizers, which might otherwise be inadver- tently carried into the interior of the station. The EVA PCD will also be used to locate small leaks of heat exchange fluids in the outer surface of the station. This paper describes some key performance needs for the EVA PCD system, approaches taken to interpreting those needs, and some of the results of tradeoff analyses which led to the selection of the TOF concept. Some results from initial experimental tests of a TOF unit are presented. 1991 SAE Transactions Section 1 911388.

Trevino, NASA Johnson Space Cen- ter; and James E. Anderson, NASA Stennis Space Center. Manned tests in chamber B at NASA JSC were conducted in May and June of 1990 to better quantify the space shuttle extra- vehicular mobility unit's (EMU) thermal performance in the cold environmental extremes of space. Use of an infrared imaging camera with real-time video monitoring of the output signifi- cantly added to the scope, quality and interpretation of the test conduct and data acquisition. Results of this test program have been effective in the thermal certification of a new insulation configuration and the "5000 series" glove. In addition, the acceptable thermal performance of flight garments with visually deteriorated insulation was success- fully demonstrated, thereby saving significant inspection and gar- ment replacment cost. This test program also established a new method for collecting data vital to improving crew thermal com- fort in a cold environment. 1 991 SAE Transactions Section 1 911389. Visual factors affecting human operator performance with a helmet-mounted display. Andrew Liu, Gregory Tharp, and Michitaka Hirose, University of California, Berkeley ; and Law- rence Stark, School of Optometry and School of Engrg., University of California, Berkeley. We discuss three factors that could alter human operators' per- ception of a remote worksite and adversely affect their task per- formance. First, we discuss the effect of image degradation on task performance. Our experimental results are similar to corre- sponding visual psychophysical experimental results, suggesting that the psychophysical results might be helpful for predicting the performance under other viewing conditions. The second factor is the control the different viewing parameters. Dynamic control could be disorienting, but if the parameters are fixed, the operator might not feel telepresent. The interface through which the parameters are controlled also requires careful consideration and we discuss the advantages of using a helmet-mounted display. The third factor, the display update rate, can be affected by hard- ware limitations, transmission delays, or long rendering times. By understanding the effects of these factors, interfaces that effi- ciently convey information about the remote environment to the operator can be built. 1991 SAE Transactions Section 1 911390. Three-dimensional tracking with misalignment between display and control axes. Stephen R. Ellis, NASA Ames Research Center ; and Mitchell Tyler, Won S. Kim, and Lawrence Stark, School of Optometry and School of Engrg., University of California, Berkeley. Two experiments were conducted examining three- dimensional pursuit tracking when operators of teleoperation simulations are faced with misalignment between the display and control frames of reference. Targets on the experimental displays moved irregularly in three dimensions and were tracked by subjects using either two 2-axis joysticks and a panel-mounted perspective display or, in a separate experiment, a hand-mounted, 6 degree-of-freedom electromagnetic sensor and a head-mounted, virtual image, ste- reoscopic display. 157</page><page sequence="157">911390-911397 Analysis of the components of the tracking errors in the per- spective display experiment showed that components of the error due to misalignment of the perspective projection may be linearly separated from those associated with the mismatch between dis- play and control coordinate systems. We observed evidence from both experimental conditions that the tracking improved with several hours practice. Differ- ences between our results and previous results may be due to dynamical differences in the characteristics of the target and cur- sor and differences in tracking paradigm. The cause of the increased tracking error may be the users' processing time lags introduced by attempts to correct for the display-control mis- alignments. 1991 SAE Transactions Section 1 911391. Effects of teleoperator-system displays on human ocu- lomotor systems. Sheldon M. Ebenholtz ; Schnurmacher Institute for Vision Research , SU NV/ College of Optometry. Four parameters of the visual system, i.e., far point, resting vergence, resting focus, and near point are described along with a variety of adaptable oculomotor systems. The conditions productive of adaptation of the vestibulo- ocular response (VOR), optokinetic response (OKR), accommo- dation, vergence, and other systems are discussed in relation to certain characteristics of teleoperator displays. Since adaptation shares a common set of antecedents with asthenopia (eye strain) and motion sickness, the possibility of illness, including ataxia, from exposure to teleoperator displays also will be discussed. It is likely that visual effort or stress is related to the degree to which the oculomotor control system departs from its resting level in order to maintain clear, single and stable vision. How- ever, since resting levels, the rate of adaptation, and the very abil- ity to adapt are controlled by parameters that vary widely among individuals, preventive measures require highly specific knowl- edge of these visual system characteristics of individual human operators. 911392. Image cyclorotation, cyclovergence and perceived slant. Ian P. Howard , York Univ. Any stereoscopic imagery system must maintain the images in horizontal, vertical and torsional alignment. Humans maintain torsional alignment by rotating the eyes around the visual axes - a response known as cyclovergence. We have produced the first measurements of the dynamics of human cyclovergence and have shown that cyclovergence compensates well for low amplitude, low frequency torsional misalignments of binocular images. We have also shown that cyclovergence is driven more by cyclorotations of horizontal lines than of vertical lines. Teleop- erated systems should emulate this strategy because vertical dis- parities code slant in depth and should therefore by retained, whereas horizontal disparities arise only from misalignment of images and should therefore by nulled. We have found that objective measurements of cyclovergence compare well with those obtained by a psychophysical nonius procedure. We have revealed conditions under which torsional misalignment of binocular images gives rise to illusory slant and propose a procedure for eliminating illusory slant. 1991 SA E Transactions Section 1 911393. Advanced teleoperation: progress and problems. Antal K. Bejczy , Jet Propulsion Lab., California Institute of Technology. A dual-arm advanced teleoperation system (ATOPS) was developed at JPL to demonstrate and evaluate performance capa- bilities of computer and sensing aided teleoperation. This paper gives a brief overview of the system and briefly describes some of the generic and application oriented performance experiments together with the major results. A major conclusion is that the new advanced technical features of the system should be properly integrated with or interfaced to the natural features of human operators in order to produce an improved overall system and task performance capability. 911395. Analysis of an initial lunar outpost life support system preliminary design. Mark G. Ballin, NASA Ames Research Cen- ter; Yat Sun Ng, Sterling Federal Systems, Inc.; and CoryK. Finn, William C. Likens, and Vincent J. Bilardo, Jr., NASA Ames Research Center. A preliminary design of a life support system (LSS) has been developed as part of an ongoing comprehensive trade study of advanced processor technologies and system architectures for an initial lunar outpost. The design is based on a mission scenario requiring intermittent occupation of a lunar surface habitat by a crew of four. It incorporates physiochemical process technologies that were considered for space station freedom. A system-level simulation model of the design was developed to obtain steady- state material balances for each LSS processor. The mass flow rate predictions were used to obtain estimates of the LSS mass, volume, and power consumption by means of processor sizing correlations that were extrapolated from space station freedom processor designs. The results were used to analyze the impacts of varying crew size, mission duration, processor operation strat- egy, and crew cabin loads on the LSS mass, average power con- sumption, volume, periodic resupply mass, and waste accumula- tion rates. The merits of the design were quantified relative to an open-loop LSS, and the implications of this assessment for future LSS research and technology development were identified. Finally, enhancements to the current analysis and questions to investigate during the next phase of the study were identified. 1991 SAE Transactions Section 1 911396. Hardware scaleup procedures for P/C life support systems. Joseph F. Ferrali, Jet Propulsion Lab., California Insti- tute of Technology; Mark G. Ballin, NASA Ames Research Center; Naresh K. Rohatgi, Jet Propulsion Lab., California Institute of Technology; Vincent J. Bilardo, Jr., NASA Ames Research Center; and P. K. Seshan, Jet Propulsion Lab., California Institute of Technology. This paper compares scaleup correlations developed at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL) and at the Langley Research Center (LaRC) for various life support hardware to estimate mass, vol- ume, and power consumption values as a function of feed or product mass flow rates. The scaleup correlations are provided for a few selected advanced life support technologies developed for the space station freedom (SSF). In addition, correlation validity limits and sources of data on various life support hard- ware are also discussed. 1991 SAE Transactions Section 1 911397. Using simulation modeling for comparing the perfor- mance of alternative gas separator-freeCELSS designs and crop regimens. Melvin N. Cobb and Steven H. Schwartzkopf Lockheed Missiles and Space Co., Inc. A successful CELSS (controlled ecological life support system) design must accommodate the potential mismatch between the crew's relatively constant CO2 production and the widely varying crop CO2 consumption over the plant growth cycle. Any addi- tional changes in material flows, processor characteristics or other system characteristics may have deleterious effects which propagate throughout the CELSS. Important transient conditions which the system design and planting regimen must allow for are described, including: crop startup; crop failures; and changes in number of humans supported. A general-purpose life support system simulator was used to evaluate several CELSS design and operation approaches. The simulator was used to investigate CO2 generation and removal interactions occurring between the CELSS food production sub- system and the rest of the system. These interactions were selected because they are major drivers of the system design and operation. 158</page><page sequence="158">911398-911402 911398« Prioritizing automation and robotics applications in life support system design. Steven H. Schwartzkopf, Lockheed Missiles and Space Co., Inc. It is extremely likely that the amount of crew time available to operate, service, and maintain life support systems for advanced space missions will be limited. Using published data from the Soviet Bios experiments, this paper provides descrip- tions of operational, servicing, and maintenance tasks antici- pated for a controlled ecological life support system (CELSS) which includes both higher plants and algal reactors. This data shows that the Bios higher plant culture system operations required about 6.2 crew-hours per day, the algal culture system operations required approximately 7.5 crew-hours per day, and miscellaneous domestic operations required about 7.5 crew- hours per day, and miscellaneous domestic operations required about 7.5 crew-hours per day. By integrating Bios task descrip- tions with typical laboratory procedures, detailed descriptions of nominal operations and maintenance activities were constructed. Crew time requirements were then derived for each of the activi- ties identified. From the estimated time requirements, an analy- sis was conducted to determine which activities could be best accomplished by the application of automation and/or robotics. Finally, specific, prioritized applications of automation and robo- tics to the design and implementation of this type of hybrid life support system are proposed. 911399. Preliminary analysis of life support resources and wastes as radiation shielding. Matthew H. Appleby, Advanced Civil Space Systems Group, Boeing Co.; and Susan C. Doll, Advanced Civil Space Systems, Boeing Defense and Space Group. Life support and radiation shielding are two critical technolo- gies for manned exploration missions. For long duration mis- sions, life support resources, such as water and food, must be pro- vided to keep the crew alive and shelter must be provided to pro- tect the crew from radiation. The large amounts of food and water required for long duration missions have been the major reason for developing closed loop life support systems. However, pre- liminary findings indicate that food and water can be effective as radiation shielding and may result in significant mass savings over dedicated shielding. This dual use of life support resources reduces overall system mass as well as the mass penalty associ- ated with open loop life support. 911400. (SP-874) Water quality program elements for space station freedom. Richard L. Sauer, NASA Johnson Space Center ; and Raghupathy Ramanathan, John E. Straub, and John R. Schultz, KRUG Life Sciences, Inc. Space station freedom (SSF) will be operational for up to 30 years with missions lasting up to 180 days. Because of the need for large amounts of potable and hygiene water for the crews, it will not be practical to supply water from the ground (as was done for Skylab) or to generate water from fuel cells (as is done for the Shuttle). Hence, waste and metabolic waters will be reclaimed and recycled in SSF. Because of the unique nature of the water sources and the closed loop recycling processes, providing safe water will be a challenging task. Developing a program for the verification of SSF water quality to ensure crew health is the responsibility of NASA's Medical Sciences Division at the John- son Space Center (JSC). This program is being implemented through the environmental health system (EHS). This paper will describe the strategy for the development of water quality criteria and standards, and the associated monitoring requirements. The paper will also describe the selected monitoring strategy for both in-flight and ground-based analyses of water quality, and the in- flight monitoring equipment being developed. 1991 SAE Transactions Section 1 911401. (SP-874) Thyroid effects of iodine and iodide in pota- ble water. Richard J. Bull, Karla D. Thrall, and Todd T. Sherer, Washington State Univ. Concerns have been expressed over the use of iodine for disin- fecting drinking water on space station freedom. Most of these fears revolve around effects of iodide on thyroid function. How- ever, little attention has been paid to how the chemical form of iodine influences its toxicology. In particular, iodine (I2) is the form used in drinking water disinfection. Previous evaluations have not taken the differing reactivity of iodine into account. The present paper summarizes the results of experiments designed to determine whether iodine ingestion can be considered toxicologi- cally equivalent to identical doses of iodide. Studies ranging from a single dose to repeated doses of iodine and iodide given to sprague-dawley rats for as long as 100 days have shown that these two forms of iodine have opposite effects on the concentrations of thyroid hormones in blood. As predicted from the literature, iodide tended to decrease (difference was not statistically significant at P=0.05 by ANOVA) circulating levels of thyroxine (T4) and increased the size of the thyroid gland. Con- versely, iodine significantly increased the concentrations of T4, tended to decrease triiodothyronine (T3) levels and did not increase the weight of the thyroid gland. The most consistent observation with iodine was a significant increase in the T4/T3 ratio. Subsequent experiments have shown that this effect comes about by reaction of iodine with metabolities of thyroid hormone in the intestine. This conclusion is supported by the following observations: 1) within 2 hours after administration of increasing doses of iodine by gavage, there is a dose-related increase in plasma concentrations of T4 that is mirrored by a decrease in plasma concentrations of T3; 2) Iodine reacts with monoio- dothyronine, diiodothryonine and T3 to form T4 in vitro; 3) Iodine reacts with substances present in a wash of the upper seg- ment of the rat small intestine to form T4. These effects are not produced by equivalent doses of iodide. 1991 SAE Transactions Section 1 911402. (SP-874) Disinfection susceptibility of waterborne pseudomonads and legionellae under simulated space vehicle con- ditions. Gordon A. McFeters, Barry H. Pyle, Shelly K. Waiters, Kari L. Cargill, and F eipeng P. Yu, Microbiology Dept., Montana State Univ. Experiments were done to examine the sensitivity of various waterborne bacteria from iodinated systems to iodine, and their subsequent recovery and growth, because this halogen is used as a disinfectant in potable water systems on US manned space vehicles. A Pseudomonas aeruginosa isolated from a commercial iodine product was least sensitive when grown in reagent-grade water or phosphate buffered water (PBW) and most sensitive when cultivated on mineral salts medium supplemented with low levels of glucose and glutamate or brain heart infusion (BHI) broth. However, a P. cepacia strain was most sensitive when grown on BHI broth. Isolates from an iodinated potable water system were less sensitive to iodine than Ps-4 while a clinical iso- late exhibited intermediate sensitivity. Bacteria including Ps-4 generally recovered and grew in PBW at greater rates than uni- odinated controls. Following repeated iodination, PBW-grown pseudomonads became progressively less susceptible to iodine disinfection. Long-term cultivation in PBW led to a progressive loss of susceptibility to nalidixic acid. The sensitivity of pseudo- monads to iodine was also examined following biofilm formation on stainless steel coupons. These experiments revealed that intact biofilms and cells removed from the coupons had significantly higher resistance to iodine than planktonie cultures. The disinfec- tion efficiency of both iodine and chlorine were also studied using the waterborne respiratory pathogen, Legionella pneumophila. This bacterium was much more resistant when grown under low nutirent conditions and attached to stainless steel surfaces. Therefore, the susceptibility of waterborne bacteria to antibac- terial agents including iodine and nalidixic acid is highly variable and dependant upon the organism, antecedent growth conditions and biofilm formation. Disinfection of low nutrient water may 159</page><page sequence="159">911402-911409 lead to the establishment of resistant bacteria within treated sys- tems. Therefore, the design of disinfection studies should take into account antecedent growth conditions, ambient selective pressures, nutrient limitation and biofilm formation. 911403. (SP-874) Biofilm formation and control in a simulated spacecraft water system: two-year results. John R. Schultz, KRUG Life Sciences Inc.; Robert D. Taylor, M. Helen Hüls, Rebekah J. Bruce, and Judy V. Svoboda, KRUG Life Sciences ; Inc.; Richard L. Sauer, NASA Johnson Sapce Center; Duane L. Pierson , NASA Johnson Space Center; and Sandra E. Carr, and David T. Flanagan, KRUG Life Sciences, Inc. The ability of iodine to maintain microbial water quality in a simulated spacecraft water system is being studied. An iodine level of about 2.0 mg/L is maintained by passing ultrapure influ- ent water through an iodinated ion exchange resin. Six liters are withdrawn daily and the chemical and microbial quality of the water is monitored regularly. Stainless steel coupons used to monitor biofilm formation are being analyzed by culture meth- ods, epifluorescence microscopy, and scanning electron micros- copy. Results from the first two years of operation show a single episode of high bacterial colony counts in the iodinated system. This growth was apparently controlled by replacing the iodinated ion exchange resin. Scanning electron microscopy indicates that the iodine has limited but not completely eliminated the forma- tion of biofilm during the first two years of operation. Significant microbial contamination has been present continuously in a par- allel noniodinated system since the third week of operation. 1991 SAE Transactions Section 1 911404. (SP-874) Development and (evidence for) destruction of biofilm with Pseudomonas aeruginosa as architect. Valerie N. Uzcategui, John J. Donadeo, and Daniel R. Lomabardi, Dept. of Chemistry, State University of New York ; Richard L. Sauer, NASA Johnson Sapce Center ; and Michael J. Costello, Dept. of Chemistry, State University of New York. Disinfection and maintenance of an acceptable level of asepsis in spacecraft potable water delivery systems is a formidable task. The major area of research for this project has been to monitor the formation and growth of biofilm, and biofilm attached micro- organisms, on stainless steel surfaces (specifically coupons), and the use of ozone for the elimination of these species in a closed loop system. A number of different techniques have been utilized during the course of a typical run. Scaping and sonication of coupon sur- faces with subsequent plating as well as epifluorescence micros- copy have been utilized to enumerate biofilm protected Pseudo- monas aeruginosa. In addition, scanning electron microscopy is the method of choice to examine the integrity of the biofilm. For ozone determinations, the indigo decolorization spectrophoto- metry method seems most reliable. Both high-and low-nutrient cultured P. aeruginosa organisms were the target species for the ozone disinfection experiments. 1991 SAE Transactions Section 1 911405. (SP-874) Bioburden control for space station free- dom's ultrapure water system. Donald W. Snodgrass, Teledyne Brown Engineering ; Elizabeth B. Rodger s, NASA Marshall Space FLight Center; Don Obenhuber, Sverdup technology, Inc.; and T. L. Huff, Sverdrup Technology, Inc. Bioburden control is one of the challenges for the ultrapure water system on space station freedom. Bioburden control must enable the system to deliver water with a low bacterial count (&lt; 1 CFU/100 ml), as well as maintain biological contamination at a manageable level, to permit continued production of quality water. Ozone has been chosen as the primary means of bioburden control. Planned tests to determine the effectiveness of ozone on free-floating microbes and biofilms are described. 911406. (SP-874) Regenerable biocide delivery unit. Gerald V. Colombo and Clifford D. Jolly, Umpqua Research Co.; and Rich- ard L. Sauer, NASA Johnson Space Center. The microbial check valve (MCV) is used on the space shuttle to impart an iodine residual to the drinking water to maintain microbial control. Approximately twenty MCV locations have been idientified in the space station freedom design, each with a 90 day life. This translates to 2400 replacement units in 30 years of operation. An in situ regeneration concept has been demonstrated that will reduce this replacement requirement to less than 300 units based on data to date and potentially fewer as further regenera- tions are accomplished. A totally automated system will result in significant savings in crew time, resupply requirements and replacement costs. An additional feature of the device is the ability to provide a concentrated biocide source (200 mg/liter of I2) that can be used to superiodinate systems routinely or after a microbial upset. This program was accomplished under NASA Contract Num- ber NAS9-18113. 911407. SAX: a thermal control design for a scientific satellite. Gaetano Poidomani and Gianfranco Bonino, Alenia Spazio S. p. A. SAX (satellite astronomia raggi-X) is the Italian satellite devoted to study in the X-ray wavelengths. X-rays in the range 300 keV to 0.1 keV will be observed over a wide field by means of 8 scientific instruments. The SAX orbit is circular with an alti- tude of 600 km and a maximum inclination of 5°. A life of 26 months is foreseen. The thermal control design, which will make use of passive thermal control elements (heaters, MLI, paints), shall guarantee the best thermal environment for the scientific instruments. This includes not only control of the temperature level, but also of the magnitude of temperature gradients between different sides of the same instrument. Naturally, the thermal control features must not obstruct the instrument field of view (FoV). The TCS shall also control the temperature of all the other sat- ellite equipment such as the battery, propulsion (hydrazine) ele- ments (tank, thrusters and lines), and AOCS sensors. The atomic oxygen degradation typcial in low earth orbit (LEO) makes mate- rial selection more difficult. The TCS performance will be veri- fied by thermal analysis using ESATAN TMM's and by thermal testing. A development test has already been carried out to evalu- ate the thermal performance of the most critical thermal design components. A complete thermal balance test will be performed on a representative thermal model and the flight model will undergo a combined thermal balance/thermal vacuum test. Each test will be followed by a correlation analysis campaign in order to validate the relevant TMM's and evaluate the adequacy of the adopted thermal design. 911409. A feed-back thermal regulation system for the Colum- bus free flyer battery section. Alain Lanieri and C. W. B. Potts, Aerospatiale ; and Peter Moeller, J. Held, and H. Kreeb, Dornier GmbH. The BSTCA (battery section thermal control assembly) is a module of the Columbus MTFF (man tended free flyer). Electri- cal power required during eclipse periods, is made available from six nickel hydrogen batteries. A sophisticated multi-radiator con- figuration, with a hybrid heat pipe network, has evolved. Autono- mous control of the assembly heat rejection capability has been achieved by an integrated network of LTHP's (liquid trap heat pipes) and CCHP's (constant conductance heat pipes) under the control of a conventional HCU (heater control unit). The process of design selection and verification is discussed, for the BSTCA, with a detailed LTHP component presentation. 1991 SAE Transactions Section 1 160</page><page sequence="160">911410-911417 911410.

Flight firing operations on the Italsat Fl R-4D-11 thruster. Mauro Balduccini, Marco Giommi, and Guido Morelli, Alenia Spazio. This paper summarizes the main results of the firing opera- tions performed by the Liquid Apogee Engine (LAE) of Italsat Fl spacecraft that has been launched January 15, 1991. This evaluation represents the final check step of the thermal design activities on the LAE and Thermal Shield Assembly and of the firing control strategy definition presented on the paper: "Thermal design, testing and firing control strategy of the liquid apogee engine and thermal shield assembly for the Italsat pro- gram" included in the SAE's 20th ICES conference (1990). The Italsat mission has been characterized by two LAE firing operations to place the spacecraft in the final geosynchronous orbit; each firing duration being about 37 minutes. The firing operations were controlled by means of a dedicated procedure which includes a combination of continuous monitor- ing of the LAE temperatures, verifications with respect to defined redline limits and projections of the steady state temperature levels for both the LAE flange (primary sensor) and fuel valve (re- dundant). The paper constitutes a summary of the obtained flight data and of the technical considerations coming from the comparison of such data with the pre-flight estimate. The refined firing control criterion is also presented pointing out the differences with respect to the previous paper and adding the relevant rationale. 911414. (SP-875) Space station freedom ECLSS design config- uration: a post restructure update. Allen S. Bacskay, Environmen- tal Control and Life Support Branch, NASA Marshall Space Flight Cen ; and Robert C. DaLee, McDonnell Douglas Space Sys- tems Co. The space station freedom program (SSFP) has undergone major design changes within the last year due to reduced budget appropriations imposed by Congress. This paper outlines the impacts of the design changes on the environmental control and life support system (ECLSS), with emphasis on the system aspects of the ECLSS. Brief descriptions of design impacts to all six ECLSS subsystems are provided in addition to interactions with other distributed systems such as data management, electri- cal power, and man systems. The assembly sequence for SSF is addressed with emphasis on key flights with respect to the ECLSS. 1991 SAE Transactions Section 1 911415.

In support of space station freedom phase C/D environmental control and life support systems (ECLSS) regenerative systems development, comparative testing was performed on predevelop- ment hardware of competing technologies for each regenerative function. This testing was conducted by the Boeing Aerospace and Electronics Company (BAE) at Marshall Space Flight Center (MSFC) from late 1989 through early 1990. The purpose of the test program was to collect data on latest generation hardware in order to make final technology selections for each subsassembly in the oxygen recovery and water reclamation strings. This paper discusses the testing performed, test results, and evaluation of these results relative to subsystem selections for CO2 reduction, O2 generation, potable water processing, hygiene water process- ing, and urine processing. 1991 SAE Transactions Section 1 911416. (SP-875) Waste water processing technology for space station freedom: comparative test data analysis. Burt H. Shah, Huntsville Div., Boeing Aerospace and Electronics ; Cindy F.

Comparative tests were performed by Boeing, Marshall Space Flight Center (MSFC) or Boeing subcontractors to select the opti- mum technology for waste water processing on space station free- dom (SSF). A thermoelectric integrated membrane evaporation subsystem (TIMES) and a vapor compression distillation sub- system (VCDS) were built and tested to compare urine processing capability. A portion of the distillate recovered from pretreated urine; ie, the water which originates in the resupply food, is the basis for closed loop life support on SSF. Several other waste water "challenge solutions", representing laboratory experiment waste water, were also comparatively processed with these two technologies. Performance, water quality and specific energy were compared for conceptual design intended to function as part of the water recovery and management (WRM) system. The VCDS was chosen as the optimum technological design for the environmental control and life support system (ECLSS) urine processor (UP) by Boeing Aerospace and Electronics which is under contract to NASA to build work package 01 (WP01) for SSF. 1991 SAE Transactions Section 1 911417.

(SP-875) Developing real-time control software for space station freedom carbon dioxide removal. Stephen A. Rowe, AiResearch Los Angele Div., Allied-Signal Aerospace Co.; Jim Johnson, Boeing Defense and Space Group; and Alexander R. Morando, AiResearch Los Angeles Div., Allied-Signal Aerospace Co. Embedded control system design requires a cross-disciplinary development effort involving design, software, and test engineer- ing staffs. Conventional embedded control system development involves the use of various tools, each of which is applicable only to a portion of the development life cycle. Cross-disciplinary development using various design tools is expensive and a dis- proportionate amount of effort is required to translate control law algorithms into executable code. A toolset to increase produc- tivity and reduce life cycle cost by providing an integrated devel- opment environment, including automated generation of high- level code from control law block diagrams, is needed. This paper presents AiResearch experience to date in using the NASA/Boeing Application Generator (AG) to develop real-time control systems for the carbon dioxide removal assembly (CDRA) in work package 01. The AG provides an integrated design and development tool encompassing: system analysis, modeling, control law design, simulation, code generation, real- time hardware-in-the-loop simulation and operation, and docu- mentation. This allows rapid interactive prototyping of real-time control systems in a single, integrated, environment. Advantages and disadvantages of using the AG for real-time control system development will be addressed, with the CDRA specification to delivery cycle serving as a basis for discussion. Suggestions for improving the AG are offered and observations on its potential as a top-level system specification tool are made. 1991 SAE Transactions Section 1 911420. (SP-873) Bioregenerative life support: the initial CELSS reference configuration. Mel Averner and John D. Rum- mel, Life Sciences Div., NASA Headquarters. As extended manned space missions and permanent bases become integral components of future space exploration, a con- trolled ecological life support system (CELSS) could provide numerous advantages, including reduced launch mass over the life of a long-term mission, fewer and less time-critical logistic revisits, and a better crew environment (e.g., cleaner air, water, and fresh food). Because of the enabling nature of this technology it is important that it be proven and available to mission planners as soon as practicable, consistent with the requirements of the overall exploration strategy. The next major step in developing an operational CELSS is the development of a human-rated CELSS ground-based demonstrator that will supply the proof-of- concept for the use of a CELSS on a mission. To guide the devel- opment of a ground-based demonstrator and address the funda- mental problems involved in operating a CELSS, a reference con- figuration for such a system has been derived for use in the NASA CELSS program. This configuration will provide a common ref- erence to investigators, allowing sub-process results to be more readily compared and system-level research and modeling efforts to be focused toward advancing knowledge on, or in comparison to, a common system. This paper presents the details of the initial reference system, one that is sure to be modified in subsequent work done within the program. 911422. (SP-873) Evolutionary development of a lunar CELSS. Steven H. Schwartzkopf, Lockheed Missiles and Space Co., Inc.; and Mariann F. Brown, NASA Johnson Space Center. This paper describes an evolutionary method of technology integration for the development of a lunar base life support sys- tem. The baseline is a partially-closed regenerative life support system (RLSS) based upon space station freedom physicochemi- cal technology. The paper describes the stepwise evolution of this baseline system into a closed-loop, lunar base controlled ecologi- cal life support system (CELSS), a hybrid design which incorpo- rates both physicochemical and bioregenerative technologies. The steps taken in the evolutionary process are derived from a rationale which addresses: 1) the incorporation of specific biore- generative functions into the life support system; 2) the supple- mentation of specific physicochemical functions with bioregen- erative systems; 3) the replacement of initial physicochemical technologies with more advanced technologies, and 4) the addi- tion of new physicochemical technologies. The rationale for loca- tion of the stages in the evolutionary development sequence is based upon considerations of mass requirements for human life support, on crew nutritional requirements, and on functional characteristics of the life support technologies. 1991 SAE Transactions Section 1 911423. (SP-873) Options for transpiration water removal in a crop growth system under zero gravity conditions. C. C. Black- well and M. J. Kliss, NASA Ames Research Center; B. Borchers, Bionetics Corp.; and Boris S. Yendler, NASA Ames Research Cen- ter. The operation of a crop growth system in microgravity is an important part of the National Aeronautics and Space Adminis- tration's closed ecological life support system development pro- gram. Maintaining densely arrayed plants in a closed environ- ment imposed to induce high growth rates must be expected to result in substantial levels of water transpiration rate. Since the environmental air is recirculated, the transpiration water must be removed. In an operating CELSS, it is expected that this water will provide potable water for use of the crew. There is already considerable knowledge about water removal from crew environ- mental air during orbital and transfer activities, and the differ- ence between the conditions of the described requirement and the conditions for which experience has been gained is the quantities involved and the reliability implications due to the required peri- ods of operation. A simplified statement of this specific problem is: "Given a flow-stream of air containing water vapor in a zero gravity field, what system can this flow-stream be passed through to produce only an air flow-stream which contains a prescribed lesser water vapor content and confined liquid water having no gas/vapor spaces?" In this paper, we describe some of the avail- able processes which can accomplish the steps required to achieve the objective, and look at some of the energy consider- ations. 911424. (SP-873) Diet expert subsystem for CELSS. Boris S. Yendler, NASA Ames Research Center; and Thoi K. Nguyen and A. Waleh, Applied Sciences Consultants, Inc. A major problem of control in a controlled ecological life sup- port system (CELSS) is to maintain and manage a stable diet for its human crew. In this paper, the development and mathemati- cal basis of a "diet" control subsystem, functioning as a well char- acterized expert program, is described. The general formulation of the expert program, which is named Ceres, is presented. The method can provide both steady-state and dynamic solutions for the problem of diet in a CELSS. The distinction between Ceres and the nutritional modeling methods is demonstrated for the case of a three-component, potato-wheat-soybean food system. The significance of food processing in providing added flexibility in the management and planning of diet is discussed. It is shown that diet solutions, obtained by simple optimizations, are not 162</page><page sequence="162">911424-911429 necessarily best suitable for the optimum operation of the CELSS. It is further shown that an expert system can find near optimal solutions that may better satisfy the requirements of a CELSS. 1991 SAE Transactions Section 1 911425. (SP-873) Regenerative life support systems (RLSS) test bed development at NASA Johnson Space Center. Sandra L. Foerg and Michael K. Ewert, NASA Johnson Space Center ; Melissa K. McKinley , Lockheed Engrg. and Sciences Co.; and Mariann F. Brown and Terry O. Tri, NASA Johnson Space Cen- ter. Future manned habitats for a lunar outpost or martian base will require increased levels of self-sufficiency over space station freedom to reduce the high costs and complexities of resupplying expendables, such as food for the crew. By growing food at these remote sites, not only will self-sufficiency be greatly increased, but significant benefits for crew life support will also be realized. Higher plants, such as those grown typically for food, are capable of consuming carbon dioxide (CO2), producing oxygen (O2), and reclaiming water (H2O) via transpiration. At NASA's Johnson Space Center (JSC) in Houston, Texas, the regenerative life support systems (RLSS) test bed project will use higher plants grown in a closed, controlled environment in conjunction with physicochemically-based life support systems to create an integrated biological/physicochemical RLSS. Addi- tionally, a human metabolic simulator will be integrated into the RLSS and will supply variable metabolic loads to the system to simulate the presence of a crew. The integrated RLSS will be fully automated to grow crops from seed to harvest without the need for human intervention. One of the test bed's two growth cham- bers, the variable pressure growth chamber (VPGC), will be oper- able both at ambient atmospheric pressures and at reduced pres- sures to more closely duplicate candidate lunar or martian habi- tat environments. Major objectives of the test bed include quanti- fication of life support capabilities of higher plants, determination of interactions between the biological and physi- cochemical life support system components, and definition of integrated control system approaches for providing variable life support capabilities on-demand. Data from the RLSS test bed will be used to define requirements for a future human-rated RLSS test facility to be developed by NASA. This paper describes the first phase of the RLSS test bed proj- ect development and buildup, including development of an over- all systems design for the test bed, outfitting of the VPGC with plant growth systems, outfitting of a centralized control room for the test bed, and development of an initial supporting research laboratory. 911426. (SP-873) Regenerative life support systems (RLSS) test bed performance: characterization of plant performance in a controlled atmosphere. Donald Henninger and Marybeth A. Edeen, NASA Johnson Space Center. Future manned habitats such as a lunar or martian outpost will require a high degree of self-sufficiency to minimize cost and dependency on resupply from Earth. Food and other life support expendables are major resupply items required for long-term hab- itation of planetary surfaces. By growing higher plants for food, resupply can be reduced and self-sufficiency increased. Addition- ally, higher plants provide carbon dioxide (CO2) removal and reduction, oxygen (O2) production, and water reclamation for human life support. Plants have been grown in the controlled environment of the regenerative life support systems (RLSS) test bed at Johnson Space Center. The systems performance in terms of supporting human life was determined for plant CO2 assimilation, O2 gener- ation, and évapotranspiration rates, trace contaminant genera- tion, and biomass production. In addition, test conditions and anomalies are described. 1991 SAE Transactions Section 1 911427. (SP-873) Microbiological characterization of the bio- mass production chamber during hydroponie growth of crops at the controlled ecological life support system (CELSS) breadboard facility. Richard S tray er, Bionetics Corp. The initial goal of the controlled ecological life support system (CELSS) breadboard project is to develop and evaluate a ground- based bioregenerative system scaled to support the equivalent of one crew member. The biomass production chamber (BPC) is the plant growing module of this project. We describe here the char- acterization of the microbial consistuents of the BPC during pro- duction tests of hydroponically-grown crops of wheat and soy- beans. Bacterial and fungal viable counts were determined for the hydroponie solution, dehumidifier condensate water, and atmo- sphere. Bacterial communities were characterized by taxonomie identification (Vitek automicrobic system) of randomly selected isolates. For all crop tests, bacteria dominated the microflora of both the hydroponie solution (range-104 to 106 colony forming units [cfu] per mL) and dehumidifier condensate (103 to 106 cfu^). Occasional checks for total and fecal coliforms, staphylo- coccus, streptococcus, and legionella have consistently proven negative. Bacterial community composition studies have focused primarily on the root surface because over 95% of the BPC micro- bial load occurred in this habitat. The number of root surface iso- lates identified and predominant bacterial genera were: Wheat- 540 isolates, Pseudomonas: soybean-1080 isolates, achromobac- ter. The condensate isolates identified were similar for both crops-650 isolates, with Pseudomonas pickettii predominant. In- line filtration of the BPC atmosphere has resulted in very low microbial counts (ca 3.3 to 330 cfu/m3). 1991 SAE Transactions Section 1 911428. Small life support system for free flyer. Toshiyuoshi Kimura, Haruchi Shimizu, Yoshihito Nisio, and Masahiro Takayanagi, Fujitsu, Ltd.; Masamichi Yamashita and Akemi Izumi-Kurotani, Institute of Space and Astronautical Science; and Naoto Kawase, Fujitsu, Ltd. With astronauts and cosmonauts spending longer periods in space, we must understand and anticipate the effects of the envi- ronment on those who live and work in space and on their prog- eny. Since current launch vehicles restrict payload to low vol- umes and low masses, we must work within these design restric- tions. Two biological experiments, one involving female newts and the other involving the eggs of a small fresh-water fish called revulines, are to be carried aboard the Japanese space flyer unit (SFU) in 1994. The experiment system, named BIO, is imple- mented on special payload unit (SPLU) of SFU. Experiment are conducted with a service provided for SPLU. BIO consists of two experiment units, a controller, and a power supply. Each experi- ments, contains an aqua chamber to hold the live specimens. The temperature and gas in the chamber are maintained by a thermo exchanger and gas exchanger. The behavior of the specimens and development of the fertilized eggs are monitored by a CCD cam- era. The experiment is managed by a microcontroller which col- lects image and environment data and communicates with the SFU's main control and data management system (CDMS) through the central experiment controller (CEC). The BIO design maximizes performance while using minimal resources. The experiment controller and power supply, which interfaced via the SFU bus, are shared by the two experiment units. Development of the BIO engineering model is completed, and is on the way to manufacturing proto flight model (PFM) for the SUF's first flight in 1994 when it will be launched from Tane- gashima by the H-II launcher. 1991 SAE Transactions Section 1 911429. Study of oxygen generation system for space applica- tion. H. Ishida, Kawasaki Heavy Industries, Ltd.; Y. Kitazawa, Chlorine Engineers Corp., Ltd.; and T. Shoji, Kawasaki Heavy Industries, Ltd. 163</page><page sequence="163">911429-911435 Non-regenerative carbon dioxide (C02) removal system, oxy- gen (02) gas storage system, and other consumables have been utilized for the past short-term environmental control system on orbit because of the advantages of system weight, electric power consumption, system reliability, and so forth. However, to sus- tain long-term manned activity, regenerative resource recycle systems should be essential to reduce the quantity and frequency of resupply from the Earth. 02 generation system (OGS) is indispensable to this resource recycle systems and water electrolysis technology is considered to be suitable for near future space applications. The authors have been studying OGS since 1985 concerning a new solid polymer electrolyte (SPE) and simplified cell structure. This paper describes OGS development status and results of preliminary experiments. 1991 SAE Transactions Section 1 911430. Conceptual design of automated snail breeder aboard space vehicle. A. Ohira, Institute of Highland Agriculture ; Y. Midorikawa, JGC Corp.; Keiji Nitta , National Aerospace Lab.; and T. Fujii, JGC Corp. In the closed ecological life support system (CELSS) concepts which have been proposed up to now, most of the foods to be pro- vided to the crew have been based on plant and vegetable pro- duce. In this paper, a snail breeding module which will serve, as a subsystem of CELSS, to provide the space crew with animal nutrients has been studied. As a source of nutrition for the crew, snails have various advantages over other animal species. Snails can normally be bred in a limited space and they are insensitive to the lack of oxygen and feed. In this breeding module, a species of snail (Helix pomatia) will grow, mature, mate and reproduce. In order to minimize the crew's work, automated operations for feeding, cleaning wastes, handling snails and their spawn, as well as for the maintenance of the module, will be applied. A sub- module which processes snails for food production is also stud- ied. In addition to automation, other features taken into account are economy from the view point of utilities consumed, and the desirability of a lightweight, compact module. Further, to prevent possible biocontamination, which may originate from lifeforms inside the module, diffusing to pressurized quarters of the space vehicles, a high level of inter-module sealing will be achieved. As a biological study of snails in space, an experiment using snails' spawn in earth orbit is being planned by authors. 1991 SAE Transactions Section 1 911431. Life support concept in lunar base. Hisao Habuka, Institute for Future Technology; and Keiji Nitta, National Aero- space Lab. Lunar bas construction study has been conducted under the sponsorship of many Japanese industries to amend the man tended lunar outpost study carried by NASDA. Permanent lunar base construction is to be constrained by the ability of the usable transportation system carrying the basic modules composing lunar base itself. Based upon the experiences of antarctic research expedition and of designing International Space Station now going on it was assumed the initial permanent lunar base has to be composed of two habitats and one power module for letting possible to alive 8 crew, and has to be expanded by adding three of four modules in every year for improving the easiness of living- ness. In early stage of construction, crew members have to live and work using only two habitat modules with getting the electric power from power module, therefore the minimum self support functions except the food and oxygen supplying have to be attached to the habitat modules. One or two years later from beginning the construction the plantation modules have to be added one by one for implementing the food and oxygen supply- ing functions to whole lunar base. Based upon the consideration above, life support subsystems to be installed in the habitat and plantation modules and the method for integrating all subsystems to accomplish the required life support functions have been dis- cussed. 1991 SAE Transactions Section 1 911432. (SP-874) Development of the process control water quality monitor for space station freedom. Eiden L. Jeffers, Astro International Corp.; and Clifford D. Jolly, Umpqua Research Co. On-line monitoring of the effluent from the space station free- dom (SSF) water reclamation process determines acceptable quality for delivery to tanks supplying the crew's potable and hygiene water needs. TOC, pH, conductivity and iodine (biocide) are continuously monitored by the integrated, computer- controlled process control water quality monitor (PCWQM). This paper describes the development of the system with empha- sis on membrane gas-liquid separation and reagentless oxidation necessary to adapt standard TOC analysis to the unique require- ments of the space environment. 1991 SAE Transactions Section 1 911434. (SP-874) Total organic carbon analyzer. Richard Godec, Sievers Research Inc.; Johanna Vincze Webb, McDonnell Douglas Space System Co.; Richard L. Sauer, NASA Johnson Space Center; Brian D. Smith, Sievers Research, Inc.; and Paul P. Kosenka and Richard S. Hutte, Sievers Research Inc. Development and testing of a high sensitivity monitor for the measurement of total organic carbon (TOC) in water without gravity-dependent components and using minimal chemical reagents has been performed. A breadboard instrument was con- structed and tested for linearity, selectivity, and day-to-day repro- ducibility. The instrument has a linear response for a wide range of organic compounds over a range from 20 ppb C to 50 ppm C, with excellent day-to-day reproducibility. The upper level can be extended to - 100 ppm C by changing the operating conditions of the analyzer. The selectivity of the instrument has been deter- mined and no interference is observed except for high concentra- tions (&gt; 10 ppm) of iodine, hypochlorous acid, sodium nitrite and sodium sulfide. Research into the development of a "reagentless" oxidation reactor based on a combination of electrolysis and UV photolysis has shown that high conversion efficiencies for the oxidation of methanol can be obtained at concentrations as great as 40 ppm C, and with further development, this technology should provide an attractive alternative to systems employing chemical oxidiz- ing agents. 1991 SAE Transactions Section 1 911435. (SP-874) The development of a volatile organics con- centrator for use in monitoring space station water quality. Daniel J. Ehntholt, Arthur D. Little Inc.; Thomas J. Stołki, Arthur D . Lit- tle, Inc.; Richard L. Sauer, NASA Johnson Sapce Center; Johanna Vincze Webb, McDonnell Douglas Space System Co.; Rudy Tra- banino, McDonnell Douglas Space Systems Co.; and Itamar Bodek and James R. Valentine, Arthur D. Little, Inc. An approach to the isolation and concentration of volatile organic compounds from a water sample prior to chemical analy- sis in a microgravity environment has been previously described. The volatile organics concentrator (VOC) system was designed for attachment to a gas chromatograph/mass spectrometer (GC/MS) for analysis of the volatile organics in water on space station freedom. The VOC concept utilizes a primary solid sor- bent for collection and concentration of the organics from water, with subsequent transfer using nitrogen gas through a permeation dryer tube to a secondary solid sorbent tube. The secondary solid sorbent is thermally desorbed to a gas Chromatograph for separa- tion of the volatiles which are detected using a mass spectrome- ter. This paper describes the fabrication of a breadboard VOC and preliminary testing of its components with various chemicals of interest in order to optimize its performance and to compare its operation to standard methods in use on earth for water quality 164</page><page sequence="164">911435-911442 analysis. Preliminary results suggest that the breadboard VOC will meet or exceed goals set for the program. Additionally, the VOC has been shown to function for a broader suite of analytes (e.g. iodinated compounds) than those currently analyzed by EPA method 624 for volatile organics. The VOC also has the potential for improved detection limits over the method currently used on earth which utilizes purging of the water sample. 911436. (SP-874) Ultrapure water total organic carbon analyzer- Advanced component development. Clifford D. Jolly, Umpqua Research Co.; and Eiden L. Jeffers, Astro International Corp. Development of components to optimize on-line, gravity- independent measurement of total organic carbon (TOC) in water to low ppb levels are being investigated for incorporation into water quality monitor hardware. A simple, flow-through device termed a reagentless separator has been designed for zero gravity operation that removes inorganic carbon from solution without using corrosive liquid acids. Flow-through, solid-phase TOC and total inorganic carbon (TIC) functional check modules are being developed for replacement of liquid reagent calibration standards. Standard modules that impart 10 mg/1 TOC to prod- uct water have been demonstrated. Preliminary results indicate that expendable liquid reagents can be eliminated from the pro- cess water quality monitor (PCWQM) resulting in enhanced sim- plicity, safety, reliability, and significantly reduced hardware vol- ume. Components and system operating parameters are described. 1991 SAE Transactions Section 1 911437. (SP-874) Selected topics in water quality analysis: mercury and polar organics monitoring. David E. Burchfield and Leigh Evans, Perkin-Elmer Applied Science Operation; Daniel J. Ehntholt, Arthur D. Little, Inc.; William Niu, Perkin-Elmer Applied Science Operation; and Itamar Bodek, Arthur D. Little, Inc. Space station freedom presents challenges in water contami- nation and in the preconcentration of trace contaminants for sub- sequent analysis. Terrestrial methodologies for the trace level determination of mercury, alcohols, and phenols have been eval- uated against levels of detection, complexity, and phase separa- tion requirements. Microgravity compatible modifications of standard methods have been developed and tested. A total mer- cury sensor, employing solid phase sorption of mercury metal from the analyte followed by determination at a gold film elec- trode, has been breadboarded and shows a minimum level of detection of less than 0.5ppb. The system uses sodium borohy- dride as a reagent to facilitate mercury reduction and the decom- position of organomercury compounds. Phenols are determined using a modification of the VOC methodology previously described followed by GC/MS analysis; detection levels below lppb have been achieved. Short chain aliphatic alcohols are determined using GC/MS on 2jxl samples injected directly on a DB624 column, with detection levels below 500 ppb. 1991 SAE Transactions Section 1 911438. (SP-874) Technical review: comparison oflC and CE for monitoring ionic water contaminants on SSF. Randolph W. Schweickart, McDonnell Douglas Space Systems Co.; Sandra E. Carr, KRUG Life Sciences, Inc.; and Paul D. Mudgett, KRUG International. The measurement of ionic contaminants in samples from the potable water system on space station freedom is one of the basic functions of the crew health care system (CHeCS). The U.S. Envi- ronmental Protection Agency has identified ion chromatography as the analytical method of choice for measurement of anions and cations in water as described in USEPA method numbers 300.0 and 300.7, respectively. For this reason, ion chromatography was the technology initially identified to perform the ion contaminant monitoring function in the CHeCS water quality subsystem. Sub- sequently, mass, size, and maintenance restrictions have led to a réévaluation of method options. Capillary electrophoresis (CE) has emerged as one of the more promising alternatives. CE is inherently microgravity compatible and uses an order of magni- tude less reagent volume than ion chromatography. The major drawback to CE is its present state of development. To date only anion analysis has been commercially developed as a standard method using CE technology. The selection of CE for ion contam- inant monitoring on SSF will be largely depedent upon the devel- opment of standard methods for cation and transition metal anal- yses. 1 991 SAE Transactions Section 1 91 1439. Evolutionary upgrade and applications of the C-130H simple-cycle refrigeration system. Randy Finstad and Dan Matulich, AiResearch Los Angeles Div., Allied-Signal Aerospace Co. This paper addresses evolutionary improvements that have been made to aircraft environmental control system (ECS) equip- ment, using the C-130 ECS as an example. The paper traces the history of the C-130 aircraft and its variations and describes changes made to the ECS equipment to keep up with increased cooling demand. In particular, the paper discusses improvements to the C-130 simple-cycle refrigeration unit and, to a lesser extent, to the ECS as a whole. These improvements integrate technology advances from government-, prime contractor-, and AiResearch- funded programs on various military aircraft. These advances have been applied to requirements for upgrading both the basic C-130H airplane and the special operations configuration. The ECS improvements involve cooling performance, structural integrity, and reliability/maintainability enhancements. 1991 SAE Transactions Section 1 911441. Numerical analyses of airflow in aircraft cabins. Fred Aboosaidi and Matthew J. Warfield, Boeing Co.; and Dipankar Choudhury, Creare.X. Two three-dmensional cabin airflow configurations have been the subject of experimental and analytical testing to establish the validity and role of computational fluid dynamics (CFD) tools in the design of cabin airflow distribution systems. The CFD tools considered here are two separate Navier-Stokes computer codes which have been used for a number of applications, including those in the present study. A correlative study of a detailed air supply nozzle configuration has been examined to further under- stand its flow characteristics and to establish a procedure for examining cases with large size scale differences. The comparison of experimental results with the numerical simulations in the two cases is generally quite good, leading to an increased confidence in the application of CFD methods within the cabin airflow dis- tribution system design arena. 1991 SAE Transactions Section 1 911442. The impact of advanced garments on pilot comfort. Gary T. Runge, McDonnell Aircraft Co. Some of the new garments being developed for advanced fighter pilot's personal equipment will increasingly insulate the pilot, adding to the potential for discomfort and thermal stress. Two of these garments, 1) a counter pressure vest, and 2) a chemi- cal and biological warfare suit, were investigated to determine their effect on pilot comfort. Both garments increase the number of layers of clothing worn by the pilot. This inhibits the transfer of heat, as well as the passage of water vapor, which reduces the cooling effect of perspiring. A combined physiological and cockpit model was used to determine pilot temperatures and perspiration rates. Flow veloci- ties at the pilot were also considered in evaluating pilot comfort. In addition to traditional methods of air cooling the pilot, an advanced personal equipment cooling concept was investigated. The results show that the new garments insulate the pilot to such an extent that traditional air cooling is not adequate to maintain 165</page><page sequence="165">911442-911448 pilot comfort. However, the advanced personal equipment cool- ing concept is shown to provide adequate cooling without extremely high velocity air impinging on the pilot. 1991 SAE Transactions Section 1 911443. Thermal management of hypersonic aircraft using noncryogenic fuels. Douglas E. Wiese, McDonnell Aircraft Co. A study has been conducted to establish the Mach number limits of noncryogenic fuels used for manned hypersonic cruise missions. This paper specifically presents results for hydrocarbon fuels similar to JP-7. Both heat sink capacity and propulsive energy properties of the fuels are considered. The analysis approach uses an aircraft sizing program to predict aircraft per- formance and dynamic thermal models of the aircraft and ther- mal management systems (TMS) to determine the fuel's ability to meet requirements over the mission profile. Crew station, avi- onics, secondary power, engine, and aerodynamic heat loads are accounted for in the analysis. The maximum Mach number capa- bility for conventional JP-7 is determined. Thermal properties needed for advanced JP fuels to attain higher Mach numbers are also presented. 1991 SAE Transactions Section 1 911444. Columbus ECS and recent developments in the inter- national in-orbit infrastructure. Ruggero Veneri, Alenia Spazio S.p.A .; K. O. Hienerwadel, Dornier GmbH; H. P. Leiseifer, Euro- pean Space Research and Technology Center; Silvio Dolce, Alenia Spazio; and G. S arri, European Space Research and Technology Center. The environmental control system (ECS) of two of the three configurations of the Columbus program, namely the Columbus attached laboratory (APM) and the free flying laboratory (MTFF) provides a micro environment in space to support safe and com- fortable working conditions for the crew and necessary resources to perform experimental activities. Recent developments in the international in-orbit infrastruc- ture, i.e. the space station freedom (SSF) with the APM as Euro- pean contribution and the European elements MTFF with Her- mes and the Ariane-5 launcher are rapidly converging toward matured engineering and programmatic goals. The restructuring activities (SSF), detalied reconsideration of key requirements (MTFF) and cost saving options task force (APM) are examples which have already, or will considerably impact the ECS of the involved Columbus flight configurations. Key issues, which to one extent have already been successfully finalised or are in elaborate development phase, are "rack inter- changeability", "reduction of EVA", "non-serviceable resource module for MTFF", "APM in man-tended mode", "reduced APM length", "optimisation of resource utilisation management in view of (initial) reduced resources", to name only a few. 1991 SAE Transactions Section 1 911445. The Columbus free flyer thermal control and life sup- port. Ulrich Laux, B. Behrens, H. P. Haßemeyer, and B. Miedza, MBB/ERNO GmbH. The paper describes the thermal control and life support design and related system aspects of the Columbus free-flyer. The specific requirements for the free-flyer thermal control and environmental control and life support are mainly driven 1) by the particular performance to be provided in single mission phases; 2) by the overall operational life requirement of 30 years for the whole free-flyer flight configuration and the possibility for repair and maintenance in orbit; 3) by the different operating modes of the resource module as autonomous or composite con- figuration; and 4) by the complex and partically different inter- faces with Hermes and the space station freedom. During the resource module exchange at the space station free- dom the pressurized module is deactivated and thermally con- trolled by a heater system supplied with power by the space sta- tion. After attachment of the new resource module the internal servicing will be performed. During this phase the entire heat load of the pressurized module is transferred to the space station. During Hermes servicing and all free-flying phases the free- flyer thermal control is fully autonomous. The free-flyer environmental control and life support system (ECLSS) is also strongly affected by the interfaces to the space sta- tion freedom and Hermes. Reductions in complexity, cost, mass and power have been achieved by centralizing particular ECLSS functions, during the servicing phases. 911446. Thermal control design aspects of Columbus pressur- ized modules. S. Dolce, Massimo Antonacci, and Michele Trichilo, Alenia Spazio. Columbus pressurised modules (APM permanently attached to space station freedom and MTFF free flyer) will support the scientific experiments and commercial space exploitation requir- ing manned interaction and intervention (APM) or infrequent servicing/resupply by flight crew (MTFF) in a low gravity envi- ronment. This paper is based on the activities performed during the early stages of Columbus phase C/D and presents: the active ther- mal control design solutions including the architecture of the fluid loops, the fluid loops monitoring and control philosophy and the fluid loops components and design features; and the pas- sive thermal control design solutions including MLI, anticonden- sation, heaters concept and thermo-optical properties selection. 911447. Conceptual design of the Columbus free flying labora- tory resource module thermal control subsystem. Jost Munder, Manfred Bader, and Peter Moeller, Dornier GmbH. The thermal control subsystem of the Columbus resource module has to cope with an unusual variety of orbit attitudes, mission modes and configurations. A short overview over the past RM thermal concepts is given and the present thermal design is described in detail. A passive concept with extensie use of heatpipes configured as network is baselined. The low available heater power in conjunc- tion with the significant dissipation variations of the NÌH2 batter- ies require there a very effective heat rejection control concept. A new regulation concept has been selected which allows to switch off up to 75% of the battery radiator area by use of liquid trap heatpipes. The verification concept which does not use system level test- ing is briefly described. 911448. The thermal control of the European retrievable car- rier, an example of flexible thermal control system. Giuseppe D. Racca, European Space Agency ; and Wolfgang Hahn, MBB Duetsche Aerospace, ERNO. The intensive endeavor of the human, to do research work and to test in the low earth orbit, results in complex orbital platforms. These space based platforms are either permanent or retrievable. This is the case of the European retrievable carrier (EURECA), a free-flying reusable platform that is launched and retrieved by the NSTS orbiter. The first Eureca mission will be primarily a microgravity mission specifically for material processing and life science payloads. The thermal control system of Eureca has to ensure the correct environment for the carrier and the payload, throughout all mis- sion phases, by means of passive and active means. The passive means consist of various multi-layer insulations, surface finish- ing, conducting straps. Electrical heaters work, in conjunction with the active cooling loop, to keep the spacecraft temperature at adequate level. The cooling loop consists of a single phase freon 1 14 pumped loop, with two tradiators in parallel. The possi- bility to accomodate different payload heat dissipations is ensured also by the capability of the system to bypass one of the two radiators. 166</page><page sequence="166">911448-911453 The degree of on-board autonomy required for Eureca, mainly due to the very short ground contact periods, necessitates a sophisticated control of the thermal functions performed by a dedicated on-board computer. The thermal control of Eureca is believed to be a good exam- ple of the system thermal control of today, which means a maxi- mum of flexibility in the development, manufacturing and opera- tion. This is required for the high density, complex structure, dif- ferent mission profiles, considerations of retrieval capability adaptation of future payloads and take over of non-thermal related tasks of today's spacecraft's. This paper deals both with the development and verification of the thermal control system design and with its operational aspects. In addition examples are given to show how the model devel- opment, the implementation of the different requirements and the design solutions are made, in case of problems not solvable by the affected subsystems alone, namely: 1) missing power inter- face for a payload in some mission cases; 2) electronic design problem of the 20 N thruster chamber temperature monitoring; 3) high temperature of the battery due to specification problems; and 4) power shortage during operational phase. The paper is completed by a critical review (lesson learned) of the performed system thermal work, in which the authors give also some suggestions for improvements. 1991 SAE Transactions Section 1 911449. Hermes thermal control design and architecture. Claudio Ferro , Massimilano Bottacini, and Antonio Moscatelli , Alenia Spazio. The aim of this paper is to present the Hermes thermal control concept which constitutes the reference baseline for the phase 2 of the Hermes program. The technical solutions based on active and passive means, are dictated by a variety of requirements including temperature and heat flux limits, mass and power minimization, availability of space for accommodation of TCS devices. Furthermore the complex mission profile (including atmo- spheric flight and several modes of operation on-orbit) and the configuration of the space-vehicle, require the adoption of a par- ticularly flexible thermal control. The ATCS (active thermal control section) is based on a dual loop concept, using both water and Freon RI 14 cooling loops for heat collection from the various sources, heat transportation and heat rejection through dedicated devices. The main heat sources to be considered are those extracted from the cabin air loop, the electronics, the power generation items (fuel cells and lithium batteries) and the environmental loads during ascent and re-entry. The major heat rejection devices are the ground support equipment heat exchangers (on ground, before launch and after landing), the ammonia boilers during ascent or re-entry (low alti- tude), the Hermes radiators on orbit, the water evaporators dur- ing ascent and re-entry (high altitudes) and to complement the radiator rejection capability. The PTCS (passive thermal control section) relies on different concepts of insulations together with a system of temperature sensors and heaters, to control the thermal excursions of the space-plane components and structural parts, within the specified limits. Thermal insulation blankets (foams, thermal control coatings, multi layer insulations) involve an extensive material research and testing activity, since they are subjected to quite different conditions: vacuum, atmospheric, internal, external and very dif- ferent level of temperatures depending on the location. The present design of the thermal control subsystem is ori- ented to the minimization of mass and power budgets and to respect the quantitative and qualitative safety and reliability requirements. 1991 SAE Transactions Section 1 911450. Columbus water pump package overview. R. Orlando , P. Osella , and M. Ferrara , Microtecnica S.p.A. This paper provides a comprehensive description of the pres- ent status of the water pump subassembly (WPSA) that will be part of the active thermal control system of the pressurized mod- ules of Columbus, the attached laboratory (PM4) and the PM2 of the man tended free flyer. Description of major components of the subassembly are pres- ented along with the results of trade-offs performed and rationals for concept selection. 911451. (SP-875) Optimization of the Bosch CO2 reduction process. Robert B. Boyda , Charles T. Bunnell , and M. Gene Lee , Life Systems , Inc. Extensive development testing to support the design of the space station freedom (SSF) carbon dioxide (CO2) reduction assembly (CReA) has been conducted. Both dual and single reac- tor eight-person capacity systems, supported by experimental test setups, have been used to broaden the design data base. Multiple catalysts were evaluated. Of significant importance was data that showed that operation of the Bosch reaction at elevated pressure 150-205 kPa (7-15 psig) provides significant increases in process efficiency. These improvements significantly reduce the recycle gas rate necessary to achieve a 99%łC02 reduction efficiency. Data presents illustrates the improvements realized and defines the benefits that the new technology offers in terms of savings in power, wieght and volume as illustrated by the SSF CReA. 911452. (SP-875) A gaseous trace contaminant control system for the space station freedom environmental control and life sup- port system. D. E. Link , Jr., Boeing Missiles and Space Div., Boe- ing Defense and Space Group ; and J. W. Angeli, Lockheed Mis- siles and Space Co., Inc. Gaseous contaminants will be generated at trace levels in the space station freedom pressurized modules from a variety of sources. The environmental control and life support system (ECLSS) aboard the station will control these contaminants to within acceptable limits in order to protect the station crew from potential toxic hazards. The trace contaminant control subassem- bly (TCCS), a portion of the ECLSS atmosphere revitalization (AR) subsystem, removes potentially hazardous and unpleasant contaminants from the station respirable atmosphere through use of specific sorbent materials and catalytic oxidation. The focus of this paper is the design, integration, and predicted performance of the trace contaminant control subassembly being developed as a part of the ECLSS atmosphere revitalization subsystem. 911453. (SP-875) SPE® water electrolyzers for closed environ- ment life support. James F. McElroy, Trent M. Moller, and R. J. Roy, Hamilton Standard Div., United Technologies Corp. In the late 1960's, the SPE water electrolyzer project was spun off from the SPE fuel cell project when the first chemically stable, long life, perfluorocarbon ion exchange membranes became available. Since that time a variety of SPE water electrolyzer products have been developed and put into production. One of these products was developed for the production of life support oxygen in nuclear submarines. Over 30 systems containing SPE water electrolyzers have been delivered to the U.K. Royal Navy. Successful U.S. Navy sea trials have recently been completed on the SPE water electrolyzer system and that system is about to go into production for the U.S. Navy nuclear submarine fleet. Over- views of these two program will be provided. The identical cell structure used in the nuclear submarine SPE water electrolyzer programs has recently been incorporated into a life support water electrolyzer for the space station freedom microgravity application for the Boeing Aerospace and Electron- ics Company. This system design features microgravity liquid/ gas static phase separators and the use of processed hygiene water as the feedstock. A top level system schematic will be provided 167</page><page sequence="167">911453-911460 along with details of the static phase separators and a summary of overall electrolyzer performance. 911454. (SP-875) An assessment of the readiness of vapor compression distillation for spacecraft wastewater processing. Larry Noble, RexE. Graves, and Franz H. Schubert, Life Systems, Inc.; and Janie H. Miernik, Huntsville Div., Boeing Aerospace and Electronics. Exhaustive testing and analysis of vapor compression distilla- tion technology has proven its overall readiness as a wastewater processor for the recovery of water in orbiting and interplanetary spacecraft. In conjunction with Boeing Aerospace and Electronics and the National Aeronautics and Space Administration, Life Systems' technical team has been focusing on verifying and improving performance characteristics, microgravity compatibil- ity, reliability and maintainability aspects of the vapor compres- sion distillation design. Amassing thousands of hours of testing and recent breakthroughs in the area of peristaltic pump design, product water conductivity sensing and gas/liquid separation concepts have substantially increased the engineering and scien- tific database that has been accumulating over the past 29 years. Boeing Aerospace and Electronics recently selected the vapor compression distillation concept as baseline for water reclama- tion via urine processing for the space station freedom, indicating that vapor compression distillation will be a key to providing wastewater regeneration essential for long-term human survival in space. 911455. (SP-875) Shower water recovery by UF/RO. Doug Snowdon, Hamilton Standard Div., United Technologies Corp. Actual shower water was processed through a preliminary ultrafiltration/reverse osmosis membrane water purification sys- tem. Shower water was generated using anticipated low water use showers (8 lbs of water/shower) and NASA's 6503.454 soap (3.4 gms/shower). This paper describes the performance of the mem- branes during this test period. 911456. (SP-875) Leak detection of the space station freedom U.S. lab vacuum system using reverse flow leak detection method- ology. Jeffrey D. Moore, Darrell E. Masden, and James E. Shep- herd, Teledyne Brown Engineering. A vacuum system leak detection technique (reverse flow leak detection) underdevelopment at Teledyne Brown Engineering in Huntsville, AL for use aboard space station freedom is presented. The technique will be applied to the vacuum system (VS) and waste gas management subsystem (WGMS) of the U.S. lab mod- ule. These two systems contain over 45.7 m. of distributed vac- uum tubing located in remote utility runs. Fluid flow calculations which utilize known system geometry and measured steady state pressure measurements from the VS and WGMS can be used to identify leak sites within ±38 cm. Exact leak position can then be pinpointed by conventional tracer gas leak detection in the iden- tified region. Tests have been performed using a simple, unre- stricted 12.8 m length of vacuum tubing with a calibrated air leak attached. The 12.8 m tube is alternately evacuated by cryopumps on either end. Steadystate pressure measurements taken before and after flow reversal in the system have been used to locate leaks accurately. 911457. Locomotor exercise in weightlessness. William Thornton, NASA Johnson Space Center; and H. Whitmore, Whit- more Enterprises. Human locomotion is an essential capability for normal activ- ity on Earth. It requires the largest muscle and bone mass in the body and this muscle activity normally determines cardiorespira- tory capacity. Active individuals, including the astronaut popula- tion, usually take &gt; 104 steps day 1 at rates of 1-3 steps sec1 with foot ground forces of 1-1.4 body weight (B.W.) walking and 2-3 + B.W. running, producing up to 300W equivalent work. Forces and energy levels are a function of mode (walk or run), B.W., velocity, and surface grade and consistency. Overground and treadmill (T.M.) locomotion are equivalent on Earth. In weightlessness, locomotion is impossible and, without exer- cise, there will be a rapid loss of muscle, bone, and cardiorespira- tory capacity such that, after several months' spaceflight without exercise, most individuals will be unable to walk from strength loss, currently, the only exerciser capable of providing locomotor activity in flight is a treadmill which must also provide a constant axial truncal force equivalent to B.W€ subject-driven treadmills can operate at a variety of controlled speeds but only at some minimum equivalent grade, and a motor-driven unit can be designed to operate over all practical speeds and equivalent grades. Both US and USSR programs have simple flight T.M.s. US T.M.s and instrumentation have been designed and proto- types demonstrated that provide performance equivalent to Earth units. Such designs, if properly utilized, should maintain locomotor and cardiorespiratory capacity during long flight at a level consistent with required postflight activities. 1991 SAE Transactions Section 1 911458. Exercise training: blood pressure response in ambula- tory subjects. Peter B. Raven, Dept. of Physiology, Texas College of Osteopathid Medicine. The physiologic mechanisms involved in the human's adapta- tion to endurance exercise training result in the endurance exer- cise trained individual having high maximal oxygen uptakes (V02max) and being more susceptible to orthostatic intolerance. In an attempt to delineate the primary blood pressure regulatory mechanisms affected by endurance exercise training, we com- pared high fit (HF), average fit (AF) and low fit (LF) subjects' reflex responses emanating from the low and high pressure baro- receptor baroreflexes during lower body negative pressure (LBNP) and selective stimulation of the carotid sinus barorecep- tor using neck pressure (NP) and neck suction (NS). The data from these experiments indicate a reduction in the responsive- ness of the high pressure baroreceptor reflex of the endurance trained individual and an altered interaction between the high pressure and low pressure baroreceptor reflexes. These alter- ations are detrimental during orthostatic stress. 1991 SAE Transactions Section 1 911459. Exercise training: blood pressure responses in sub- jects adapted to microgravity. Victor A. Convertino, NASA Ken- nedy Space Center. Conventional endurance exercise training that involves daily workouts of 1-2 hr duration during exposure to microgravity has not proven completely effective in ameliorating post-exposure orthostatic hypotension. Single bouts of intense exercise have been shown to increase plasma volume and baroreflex sensitivity in ambulatory subjects through 24 hr post-exercise and to reverse decrements in maximal oxygen uptake and syncopal episodes fol- lowing exposure to simulated microgravity. These physiological adaptations to acute intense exercise were opposite to those observed following exposure to microgravity. These results sug- gest that the 'exercise training' stimulus used to prevent orthosta- tic hypotension induced by microgravity may be specific and should be redefined to include single bouts of maximal exercise which may provide an acute effective countermeasure against postflight hypotension. 1991 SAE Transactions Section 1 911460. Exercise thermoregulation: possible effects of space- flight. Suzanne M. Fortney, NASA Johnson Space Center. Changes in thermoregulation during spaceflight could result in an inability to tolerate ambient conditions or exercise tasks read- ily tolerated preflight. Weightlessness may alter heat production by changing metabolic rate, circadian rhythms of heat produc- tion, or work efficiency. It may impair heat loss by reducing con- vective and evaporative heat exchange. In addition, crewmem- 168</page><page sequence="168">911460-911466 bers may become less fit, less heat acclimated, hypohydrated, or have altered thermal sensitivity. Three scenarios are described: exercise conditioning in the mid deck, EVA, and emergency egress. Each scenario is discussed in terms of potential thermal challenges and possible consequences on crew performance. 1991 SAE Transactions Section 1 911461. Upper body exercise: physiology and training applica- tion for human presence in space. Michael N. Sawka and Kent B. Pandolf U.S. Army Research Institute of Environmental Medi- cine. Space physiologists have an interest in upper body exercise since in the weightless state astronauts do a substantial amount of work with their arms and hands. Upper body exercise elicits a peak oxygen uptake approximately 70% of that obtained during lower body exercise; in addition, upper body exercise requires a greater oxygen uptake at a given power output than lower body exercise. Therefore, when performing exercise at a given power , output, both the absolute and relative (% of peak VO2) exercise intensity is greater during upper body exercise. Although cardiac output responses for a given oxygen uptake are similar, the heart rate, blood pressure and total peripheral resistance responses are greater, and the stroke volume responses are lower at a given oxy- gen uptake during upper than lower body exercise. Body tempera- ture responses to both exercise types are similar, but the tempera- tures are achieved by different heat exchange mechanisms. Dur- ing upper body exercise, there is a greater reliance on torso dry heat loss for temperature regulation. Exercise training programs can improve aerobic exercise capabilities for the upper body, but there are minimal cross-training benefits between the arms and legs. Space physiologists and engineers in the manned space pro- gram should consider the unique physiology associated with upper body exercise for: a) assuring that astronauts are prepared to perform mission related tasks; b) developing effective exercise countermeasures programs; and c) engineering of adequate life support systems. 1991 SAE Transactions Section 1 911462. Skeletal muscle responses to unweighting in humans. Gary A. Dudley, NASA Kennedy Space Center. The limited data suggest that exposure to microgravity decreases muscle strength in humans and muscle mass in lower mammals. Whether these adaptations are a result of the lack of gravity per se and/or of the associated unweighting of the neuro- muscular system is not clear. Several earth based models have been used to address the effect of unweighting. Bedrest eliminates body weight bearing of both lower limbs. Unilateral lower limb suspension (ULLS), where all ambulatory activity is performed on crutches with an elevated sole on the shoe of one foot, has recently been used to unweight one lower limb. The results from studies using these two models support their efficacy. The decrease in strength of the knee extensors (KE), for example, after four to six weeks of bedrest, ULLS or space flight is 20 to 25%. The results from the earth based studies show that this response can be attributed inpart to a decrease in cross-sectional area of the KE which reflects muscle fiber atrophy. The results from the ground based studies also support the limited flight data, and show that reductions in strength are larger in lower than upper limb and in extensor than flexor muscle groups. They also raise issue with the generally held concept that postural muscle is most effected by unweighting. Slow-twitch fibers in lower limb muscles of mixed fiber type composition and muscle composed mainly of slow-twitch fibers do not preferentially atrophy after bedrest or ULLS. Taken together, the data suggest that unweighting causes remarkable adaptations in the neuromuscular system of humans. It should be appreciated, however, that this area of research is in its infancy. Because of the limited access of biological research to long term space flight, it is critical that future studies using these models be conducted in an effort to plan the most effective flight research. 911463. Astronaut adaptation to 1G following long duration space flight. William G. Squires, Dept. of Biology, Texas Lutheran College; John Walker, Dept. of Exercise Science, Uni- versity of Houston ; Michael C. Greenisen, NASA Johnson Space Center ; and Lynda L. Cowell, Dept. of Physiology, Texas College of Osteopathic Medicine. The physiological effects of microgravity have come under intense study since the first space flight programs were initiated. With the possibility of manned space stations on the horizon and long-term space flight the need for effective countermeasures upon re-entry to the Earth's atmosphere become even more important. This review describes the changes observed in several physiological systems concentrating primarily on the adaptations of skeletal muscle as well as the effect of various training proto- cols and countermeasures used to attenuate the physiological problems microgravity presents following return to the earth. 1991 SAE Transactions Section 1 911464. ECLSS contamination monitoring strategies and technologies. S. Klingele, Dornier GmbH; and G. B. Tan, ESA/ ESTEC. Studying extended space missions confirmed the need of in- depth investigations of spacecraft internal atmosphere trace gas contamination, which bears toxic hazard and crew comfort reduction. A mobile trace gas monitoring system, consisting of a com- bined gas chromatograph/mass spectrometer, using air as carrier gas, was modified and tested. This paper reports on the perfor- mance test results, acquired in ECLSS testbed trials and acquired during a 4 weeks isolation experiment of a 6 men crew in a test chamber (ISEMS1). Besides the development effort on the trace gas monitoring device, a material life test on solid amine is one the way since two years now. The offgassing products released by this weak basic ion exchange resin, which is used in a regenerable carbon dioxide concentrator, are analyzed in this test. The paper describes the methods and findings of these offgassing tests. Finally, intermediate results of a trace gas monitoring study, initiated in December 1990, will be presented, in which various monitoring strategies and suitable "state-of-the-art" technologies are investigated on their applicability for near term and long term manned space missions (Columbus, Hermes, EMSI). The work has been performed under contract of the European Space Agency. 911465. A gas chromatographic separator for Columbus trace gas contamination monitoring assembly. G. Baykut and H. P. Vet- ters, Br uker-F ranzen Analytik GmbH; H. Abele, Dornier GmbH; and J. Franzen, Bruker-Franzen Analytik GmbH. A development model gas chromatographic separator is being designed and built for the trace gas contamination monitoring assembly of Columbus man tended free flyer MTFF. The analysis of atmospheric contaminations in the space module will be per- formed by a separator/analyzer system of a gas Chromatograph/ mass spectrometer (GCMS). The gas Chromatograph (GC) being developed at this stage is compact, lightweight, ruggedized and lower power consuming. Furthermore, it operates fast, and the cool-down period (preparation for the next operation) is very short. The Columbus GC can also easily be connected to the mass spectrometer (MS), and its separation performance is very good for the GCMS analysis. 911466. Columbus cabin ventilation concept- First test results. Karl Otto Hienerwadel, Dornier GmbH. For the ventilation of a volume with a rectangular cross sec- tion of 2.2 m X 2.2 m and a length of 4.24 m two ventilation con- cepts have been tested. The first one uses only the velocity of the air blown through the air inlet diffusers into the volume, whereas for the second one additional fans are installed within the vol- ume. They are used to accelerate the air contained in the volume. 169</page><page sequence="169">911466-911472 None of the two investigated solutions fulfills the stringent air velocity requirements (0.08 m/s ^ W ^ 0.2 m/s) throughout the whole volume completely. 911467. Membrane separation principle used for gas drying processes in fuel cells and life support systems.//. A. Nigsch and W. U . Fleck, Dornier GmbH. Separators for gas drying are used for fuel cell power plants (FCPP) and for environmental control and life support systems (ECLS). A new separator type is the membrane separator (MS), which enables smaller weight and geometries and needs less energy than conventional known mechanical separator tech- niques for space applications. This paper describes different membrane separation princi- ples in accordance to their application on FCPP and ECLS. The development and test of a MS module with inorganic porous membranes for the Hermes FCPP are described in detail. The successful results of the tests are illustrated. Further activ- ities like module optimization and investigations about ECLS application are presented. 1991 SAE Transactions Section 1 911468. Control system for artificial ecosystems - Application to Melissa. Ch. Lasseur and Roger A. Binot, ESA/ESTEC. Every ecosystem, whether natural or man-made, has a natural tendency to increase its organisational level inducing a maximal utilisation of its resources and consequently, minimising the net output from the system. In order to obtain useful net output from an ecosystem, therefore, it is necessary to stop and to stabilise the evolution at an intermediate organisational level by proper con- trol. "Ecological" life support systems for manned space missions will be required to maximise productivity and safety whilst at the same time respecting tight size constraints, which implies power- ful control and regulation systems. However, the behaviour of complex ecosystems is relatively poorly understood, their stabili- ty/evolution is greatly influenced by intrinsic internal controls and classical control theories cannot be easily applied. The Euro- pean Space Agency has therefore, been investigating the design of highly compartmentalized man-made model ecosystems together with associated mathematical modeling and control functions. This paper discusses, from the particular point of view of the control system. The advantages of compartmentalized artificial ecosystems. Control requirements are formulated and an attempt is made to translate these requirements into a preliminary design concept for Melissa (micro-ecological life support system alterna- tive). 911469. (SP-875) Development of a G189A model of the space station freedom atmosphere./?. S. Barker and R. G. VonJouanne, Boeing Defense and Space. An advanced ECLSS model has been developed using the G189A environmental/thermal control and life support systems computer program for simulating the atmospheric conditions on board space station freedom. The model is similar in intent to that presented at the 1989 ICES Conference (SAE 891499). How- ever, significant changes have been applied to the previous model which allow for refined atmospheric simulation, while retaining the overall objective of avoiding rigorous models of individual components. The highlights of the advanced atmospheric model center around the inter-module linkage and ventilation, and the atmo- sphere revitalization system (ARS). Progressive techniques employed in the present model include the following: 1) segrega- tion of the open cabin air from the air volume within racks and standoffs, with an approximate air exchange rate between the two volumes (in each freedom element); 2) refinement of the four bed molecular sieve (4BMS) modeling technique, such that the effects upon the freedom atmosphere are essentially identical to those experienced with an actual cycling 4BMS (while still retaining a simple steady-state black box for modeling 4BMS operations); and 3) the tracking of the cumulative CO2 exposure to which every individual crewmember is subjected during every mission day, as dictated by that person's work schedule and location within the freedom elements (including the international ele- ments). 911470. (SP-875) Mathematical modelling of a four-bed molecular sieve with CO2 and H2O collection. M. R. Russell, L. R. Whitmer, and R. S. Barker, Boeing Aerospace and Electronics. This paper describes on analytical model of the four-bed molecular sieve (4BMS) proposed for the space station freedom. The model was developed using modified components of the G189A computer program. Requirements and inlet conditions are specified for normal (four-man) and emergency (eight-man) operation. The G189A generalized ECLSS simulation routines for adsorption/desorption in a molecular sieve bed and for a vac- uum pump have been modified to add new capabilities. The mass transfer and thermal differential equations, which are solved through numerical difference equations for the nodal networks for mass and thermal transfer within the beds, are presented. The bed adsorption/desorption routine has been modified to allow coadsorption of oxygen, nitrogen, carbon dioxide and water using ideal solution theory to adjust the pure constitutent isotherms to account for coadsorption. The vacuum pump routine has been modified to allow modeling of a multiple stage positive displace- ment pump with intercooling. The numerical routine used to solve for sorbent loadings has been changed from explicit to implicit. The addition of oxygen and nitrogen coadsorption to the model requires an implicit numerical solution to allow a suffi- ciently large time step. Representative plotted transient perfor- mance data for the baseline 4BMS are presented. The revised G 189 A program subroutines along with the other subroutines used in modeling the 4BMS (as listed below) can be used in the G 189 A program for several purposes. Examples are: 1) for a given 4BMS design, determine CO2 levels in a cabin (or module), or several interconnected modules, as functions of such parameters as CO2 generation rates, cabin pressure, dew point, and cabin temperature; 2) for a given set of space vehicle atmo- sphere parameters and CO2 generation rates determine detailed 4BMS performance parameters for variatios in such hardware parameters as adsorption bed geometry, adsorbent material, heater design details, vacuum pump design details, cycle times, and bed thermal design details. 911471. (SP-875) Simplified model of a closed oxygen loop life support system using the space station application generator. Duncan P. K. Gardner, Boeing Aerospace and Electronics Co. The application generator (AG) is an integrated hardware/ software platform being used to develop process control software and algorithms for the space station freedom. One of the major strengths of the AG is its ability to simulate real-time plant mod- els, the method used to test control software prototypes. This paper gives a brief overview of the AG, describes the detailed plant model of an oxygen generator/carbon dioxide reduction closed oxygen loop ECLSS, and provides a discussion of the results produced from various oxygen consumption and carbon dioxide production load models. Also included is a discussion of assumptions regarding metabolic loads, effects of CO2 reduction efficiencies, and crew activities. 911472. (SP-875) Hydraulic model of the proposed water recovery and management system for space station freedom. Charles E. Martin, McDonnell Douglas Space Systems Co.; and Allen Bacskay, NASA Marshall Space Flight Center. The water recovery and management (WRM) system on space station freedom (SSF) is modeled using SINDA '85/FLUINT to determine its hydraulic operation characteristics, and to verify 170</page><page sequence="170">911472-911478 the design flow and pressure drop parameters. The WRM system consists of the potable use water, waste water, and fuel cell loops, as well as the fluid management system and experiments, which are not included in this model. This system will be the first closed loop water regeneration system used in space flight. The water is driven in each loop by storage tanks pressurized with cabin air, and is routed through the system to the desired destination. The model considers the flow of water from the storage tanks to the use points and back, as determined by each individual flow dia- gram for the permanently manned configuration (PMC) phase of SSF. The WRM system is linked to other environmental control and life support systems (ECLSS) such as atmosphere revitaliza- tion (AR), temperature and humidity control (THC), and waste management (WM). The complexity of this system dictates that a hydraulic simulation should be performed to determine the flow characteristics of the system. The FLUINT analysis package is used in the model to determine the flow and pressure character- istics when each of the different loop components are operational and contributing to the overall flow pattern. 911473. (SP-875) Preliminary analysis of the CO2 fire sup- pressant distribution system for space station freedom. Jeffrey P. Gedcke, McDonnell Douglas Space Systems Co.; Melissa Y. Gard, NASA Marshall Space Flight Center ; and Habib Mohamadine- jad, McDonnell Douglas Space Systems Co. To date, the fire suppression capabilities resident on United States spacecraft have been somewhat limited and highly crew dependent. The spectrum of previous suppression systems extends from the food rehydration water on Mercury and Gemini to the Halon distribution system and portable extinguishers flown on the Orbiter and Spacelab. The challenge presented by space station freedom of assuring crew safety while maintaining a permanent manned presence in space has led to the design of a more extensive fire suppression distribution system. This is the first time that carbon dioxide will be used as the suppressant. This choice partially overcomes present problems of post-fire toxic substance cleanup and monitoring of two phase Halon quantities in microgravity. During the development and testing activities surrounding this system, analyses have been performed to predict system conditions such as suppressant discharge flow rates, suppressant state, and dilution times. These preliminary results can provide a basis for estimating the capability of the baseline design to meet the WP01 derived system requirements. 911475. Concepts of bioisolation for life sciences research on space station freedom. Glenn A. Funk and Catherine C. Johnson, NASA Ames Research Center. The biological flight research laboratory (BFRL) includes a large (approximately 2.5 meter) diameter centrifuge, biospecimen habitats, a microgravity habitat holding unit, a glovebox, a unit for the routine servicing of biospecimen chambers, and generic laboratory equipment. It is being designed to support non-human life sciences research on space station freedom. To assure the health and welfare of biospecimens and flight crew, the BFRL must provide containment of particulate, microbial and poten- tially hazardous chemical substances as well as isolation of the inhabitant biospecimens from the cabin environment. There are currently no clear definitions within NASA of what constitutes a biological hazard or how such material should be contained and handled. This paper defines many of the risk concepts of concern to NASA and recommends requirements for the design and oper- ation of life sciences spaceflight hardware and experiments. It concludes with a discussion of how these proposed requirements are being applied to the BFRL. 1991 SA E Transactions Section 1 911476. Airborne particulate matter and spacecraft internal environments. K. L. Rubow, B. Y. H. Liu, and P. H. McMurry, Dept. of Mech. Engrg., University of Minnesota ; D. Russo, NASA Johnson Space Center ; and T. J. Kotz, Dept. of Mech. Engrg., Uni- versity of Minnesota. Instrumentation, consisting of a shuttle particle sampler (SPS) and a shuttle particle monitor (SPM), has been developed to char- acterize the airborne particulate matter in the space shuttle cabin during orbital flight. The SPS size selectively collects particles in four size fractions (0-2.5, 2.5-10, 10-100, and &gt;100 p.m) which are analyzed postflight for mass concentration and size distribution, for elemental composition, and for morphology. The SPM pro- vides a continuous record of particle concentration through pho- tometric light scattering. Measurements were performed onboard Columbia, OV-102, during the flight of STS-32 in Januray 1990. No significant changes were observed in the particle mass concentration, size distribution or chemical composition in samples collected during flightday 2 and flightday 7. The total mass concentration was 56 lig/m3 with approximately half of the particles larger than 100 |im. Elemental analysis showed that roughly 70% of the particles larger than 2.5 ^m were conbonaceous with small amounts of other elements present. The SPM showed no temporal or spatial variation in particle mass concentration during the mission. 1991 SAE Transactions Section 1 911477. Development of a sensitive monitor for hydrazine. Gary A. E icem an, New Mexico State Univ.; and Thomas F. Limero and John T. James, NASA Johnson Space Center. Hydrazine (N2H4) and monomethylhydrazine (MMH) are used as propellants in several spacebased applications, in which exposure limits as low as 2 ppb have been proposed. This paper reviews the development of hand-held, ambient-temperature instruments that use ion mobility spectrometry (IMS) in the detection of hydrazine and MMH. An intrument, based on early designs, detected hydrazine and MMH. An instrument, based on early designs, detected hydrazine at 6 ppb with no interference from vapors except for ammonia, but exhibited slow response and recovery times. Performance of a hand-held IMS instrument that used water-reagent ion chemistry was unacceptable. An alter- native, using acetone as the dopant reagent, also proved unac- ceptable, because ammonia-acetone clusters produced substan- tial interference in the detection of MMH. The goal of the present development effort was to eliminate ammonia interference through altering the ionization chemistry. This was achieved using ion chemistry based on adding 5-nonanone as dopant in the ionization region of the IMS. This modification gave product ion drift times for MMH and ammonia of 12 and 14 ms, respectively, with a linear range from 10 to 600 ppb. Slow response and recov- ery was found to be improved by elevating the membrane and inlet temperatures. Calibration of this instrument performed before and after space shuttle mission STS-37 revealed no more than 5% difference between calibration curves, with no notable loss of equipment function. 1991 SAE Transactions Section 1 911478. Using VAPEPS for noise control on space station freedom. G. Badilla, T. Bergen, and T. Scharton, Jet Propulsion Lab., California Institute of Technology. Noise environmental control is an important design consider- ation for space station freedom (SSF), both for crew safety and productivity. Acoustic noise requirements are established to eliminate fatigue and potential hearing loss by crew members from long term exposure and to facilitate speech communication. VAPEPS (vibroacoustic payload environment prediction system) is currently being applied to SSF for prediction of the on-orbit noise and vibration environments induced in the 50 to 10,000 Hz frequency range. Various sources such as fans, pumps, centri- fuges, exercise equipment, and other mechanical devices are used in the analysis. The predictions will be used in design tradeoff studies and to provide confidence that requirements will be met. Preliminary predictions show that the required levels will be exceeded unless substantial noise control measures are incorpo- 171</page><page sequence="171">911478-911483 rated in the SSF design. Predicted levels for a SSF design without acoustic control treatments exceed requirements by 25 dB in some one-third octave frequency bands. 911479. A combustion products analyzer for contingency use during thermodegradation events in spacecraft. Steven Beck , John T. James, and Thomas F. Limero, NASA Johnson Space Center ; and Raymond Cromer, Exidyne Instrumentation Technologies. As mission length and the number and complexity of payload experiments increase, so does the probability of thermodegrada- tion contingencies (e.g. fire, chemical release and/or smoke from overheated components or burning materials), which could affect mission success. When a thermodegradation event occurs on board a spacecraft, potentially hazardous levels of toxic gases could be released into the internal atmosphere. Experiences on board the space shuttle have clearly demonstrated the possibility of small thermodegradation events occurring during even rela- tively short missions. This paper will describe the combustion products analyzer (CPA), which is being developed under the direction of the toxi- cology laboatory at Johnson Space Center to provide necessary data on air quality in the shuttle following a thermodegradation incident. Using separate electrochemical sensors, the CPA moni- tors four gases (hydrogen fluoride/carbonyl fluoride, hydrogen chloride, hydrogen cyanide, and carbon monoxide), which were selected as the most hazardous compounds likely to be released during thermodegradation of synthetic materials. Electrochemi- cal sensors have been available for several years; the CPA sen- sors, which are unique because of their small size and zero- gravity compatibility, will be described in detail. 1991 SAE Transactions Section 1 911480. Detection and chemical analysis of high purity water. Anita K. Highsmith, Centers for Disease Control; Matthew J. Clarke, Water Quality Lab., Scientific Resources Program, Cen- ters for Disease Control; Carol J. Reed, Water Quality Lab., Sci- entific Resources Program, Centers for Diesease Contro; and Bill M. Kaylor and Edwin W. Ades, Water Quality Lab., Scientific Resources Program, Centers for Disease Control. To establish a database to determine whether selected chemi- cals, not included in the NCCLS standards, could be detected in point-of-use water treatment systems (POUs), we analyzed water samples collected from 50 POUs following service maintenance. These samples were first analyzed for compliance with NCCLS standards for reagent grade water. A spectrophotometer was then used to analyze product water samples for detectable levels of free and total CI, CIO2, Cr, Cu, Fe, Mn, NO3, SO4, and Si. The follow- ing percentages of water systems had detectable levels chemicals (according to water type). For type I water, free CI was found in 89%; total CI, 50%; CIO2, 11%; Cr, 28%; Cu, 78%; Fe, 33; Mn, 22%; NO3, 89%, Si, 83%; and SO4, 17%. For Type II water, free CI was found in 71%, total CI, 50%; CIO2, 21%; Cr, 29%; Cu, 63%; Fe, 25%; Mn, 4%; NO3, 54%; and Si, 75%. For Type III water; 63% of the product water samples analyzed had detectable levels of both free and total CI; 88% Cr and Si; 38% Cu and NO3; and 13%, Fe. These findings illustrate that in many cases selected chemicals are not completely retained during the purification process and that a portion may pass from source water to product water. 911481. Development and testing of a high performance qua- dro-groove heat pipe. C. Pietsch and J. Hauser, Dornier GmbH. This paper describes the development, manufacturing and testing of an advanced heat pipe profile possessing separated arteries and small radial grooves for condensate transportation. The objective of the development was to design a heat pipe with improved heat transport capability limited by an outer cross-section of 15 mm square. The concept of the new heat pipe is based on an aluminium extrusion profile with rectangular outer shape. The central vapour core of 9.2 mm diameter is connected via small connection slots with four individual liquid channels located in the corner areas of the profile. So the liquid flow in the four channels is decoupled from vapour flow, both streaming in opposite directions. Decreasing of the pressure drop in the liquid channels and decreasing the entrainment of liquid flow to the vapour flow resulted in improved heat transport capability. The azimuthal liquid distribution can be performed either with small circumferential grooves or with wick systems pressed to the vapour core wall. A special machining technique has been developed to cut small circumferential grooves of approximately 0.15 mm width and 0.2 mm depth into the vapour core walls over the whole heat pipe length of approximately 2.5 m. Five different configurations of quadro-groove based high per- formance heat pipes have been built and tested. The test results obtained indicated an improved heat transport capability about three times higher compared to that of a common axial grooved heat pipe with rectangular grooves. 1991 SAE Transactions Section 1 911482. Heat pipes on INTELSAT V-FM 15 design, tests and in orbit performances after 6 months operation. B. Moschetti, Aerospatiale; and T. Maciaszek, CNES. This paper presents the benefit for receiver thermal perfor- mance of installing heat pipes on top of the INTELSAT V-FM 15 antenna panel. The FM 15 spacecraft launched in Januray 1989 is identical in all respects to the FM 13 spacecraft launched in May 1988, except for the addition of three interconnection heat pipes on the external surface of the antenna panel. So this flight experiment is unique, because it allows a direct in-flight comparison between two identical spacecraft, one with, and one without heat pipes. Detailed thermal mathematical models have been developed to correlate the anticipated results obtained from INTELSAT V-FM 13 and FM 15 with those obtained from flight telemetry and to verify the level of heat transfer coefficients of the heat pipes. This paper describes: the experiment; the tests performed on heat pipe either on heat pipe units or at assembly level during flight tests on FM 15; and the flight results obtained, on FM 13 and FM 15 during vernal equinox (March) and summer solstice (June) 1989 seasons. Recent data coming from INTELSAT show that heat pipe per- formances are excellent after two years operation in orbit. 911483. Theoretical and experimental study of a heat pipe in zero-G for electrochemical cell cooling. A Alexandre and A. Sulei- man, Laboratoire de Thermique, EN SM A; and J. L. Firmin, SAFT Aerospace Dept. A new thermal control system is being developed to support the development of a primary lithium/thionyl chloride (Li/ SOCL2) battery designed for future space applications. The aim of this study is to develop and to investigate a new thermal control concept to be used with LÌ/SOCL2 batteries. A thermal model of a grooved nickel (Fl 1) heat pipe under uniform heat input is developed, and an experimental assembly is made to simulate the operating conditions in zero-G. In the second part of this study we show how this new thermal concept can provide the following for electrochemical cell: ther- mal cooling by heat pipe, mechanical reinforcement, and current collection. Finally we compare the thermal behavior of a LÌ/SOCL2 cell under high rate discharge using this concept with that of a tradi- tional concept (aluminium corset around the cell which is fixed to a coldplate). We have established a thermal model using ESA- CAP software including about 100 nodes to represent the cell and the aluminum pipe or the heat pipe. We are especially interested in the internal thermal gradient inside the cell as a function of the weight of each concept. 172</page><page sequence="172">911483-911495 This paper is based upon work performed under the sponsor- ship of SAFT. 911484. Development of a capillary structure for the Hermes water evaporator assembly. Rüdiger Meyer and R. Mueller, ERNO Raumfahrttechnik GmbH. The development of a capillary structure for the Hermes water evaporator assembly (WEA) is described. The WEA is one of the heat sinks of the (active thermal control systems) water cooling loop. The capillary structure is needed to retain and distribute evaporating water on the internal surface of an aluminium cylin- der facing the cold two phase side of the heat exchanger. It consists of grooves which are very similar to the axial grooves of aluminum/ammonia heat pipes. The evaporative heat exchanger is described, the requirements to the capillary structure are reported, analysis and design of the capillaries are outlined and finally the description of the set-up and the results of a subscale test are presented. 1991 SAE Transactions Section 1 911485. ARIANE 5 upper stage thermal protection system. B. Schwarz, F. Menn, andK. Gutschmidt, ERNO Raumfahrttechnik GmbH. The new European ARIANE 5 launcher being designed to put a payload mass of 6.8 t into geostationary transfer orbit is sched- uled to be operational in 1995. It consists of a lower central stage with two solid propellant strap-on boosters and a single-engined storable propellant upper stage. The ARIANE 5 upper stage tank section has to be protected from the heat input of the hot engine nozzle during the 800 sec- ond firing period. Furthermore, the tank section and its compo- nents have to be thermally controlled for up to 3 hours after upper stage firing in order to maintain all equipment in an opera- tional condition for possible passivation of the stage or re- ignition of the engine. This paper describes the thermal protection system develop- ment program with emphasis on the heat shield. The optimiza- tion process is shown starting with material selection combined with analysis and is followed by test verification. The foreseen manufacturing and integration approach is outlined as well. 911488. (SP-873) Biogenerative components for a lunar CELSS: modeling and performance. Andrea M. Gardner and Adam M. Miller, McDonnell Douglas Space Systems Co. The use of bioregenerative components in a long-term mission closed ecological life support system (CELSS) will help lower mis- sion costs by reducing the need for expensive resupply for oxygen, water, and food. By growing plants on a lunar base, we may be able to provide signficant amounts of food and potable water while revitalizing the air supply. By processing solid wastes, we can supply growing plants with additional carbon dioxide and water. Recently, we added the capability of modeling plant growth and waste processing to the computer-aided system engi- neering and analysis (CASE/A) environmental control and life support system (ECLSS) modeling package. The objective of this study was to determine if a plant growth unit, embedded within a CELSS lunar base design, including a physical-chemical waste processing unit and crew, would be sufficient to handle system air revitalization requirements. The addition of a physical-chemical waste processing system to a lunar CELSS significantly increases the air revitalization requirements for a plant-growth unit. We have evaluated the performance of the plant growth and waste- processing units in simulations of CELSS lunar base operations. Results include specific system design recommendations based on air-revitalization requirements as a focus for CELSS compo- nent performance. 911490. (SP-873) Iodine microbial control of hydroponie nutri- ent solution. Timothy L. S troup and Steven H. Schwartzkopf Lockheed Missiles and Space Co., Inc.; and George L. Marchin, Div. of Biology, Kansas State Univ. The space transportation system uses a triiodide quaternary ammonium strong base resin to prevent microbial contamina- tion of the crew's drinking water. Current plans for space station freedom use the STS resin for microbial control in drinking water. Another use for this water is in the "salad machine" to grow vegetable plants hydroponically. Our experiments demon- strate that leaf lettuce (Lactuca sativa) grown in nutrient solution treated with the triiodide resin and its next higher homologue, pentaiodide, result in greatly reduced growth or death. The triio- dide and pentaiodide treatments reduced plant fresh weights to 0.2% and 0.04% of the controls respectively. Tissue analysis by neutron activation showed an iodine concentration of 0.47% to 0.6% in the experimental plants. Nutrient solution analysis showed an average residual concentration of 38 and 65 mg/1 iodine at the end of the 30 day experiments for triiodide and pen- taiodide treatments respectively. Consequently, these resins should not be used alone in conjunction with plant growth sys- tems. 911494. (SP-873) A canopy model for plant growth within a growth chamber: mass and radiation balance for the above ground portion. Robert L. Heath, Dept. of Botany and Plant Sciences, University of California. As humans move into outer space, need for air, clean water and food require that green plants be grown within all planetary colonies. The complexities of ecosystems require a sophisticated understanding of the interactions between the atmosphere, all nutrients, and life forms. While many experiments must be done to find the relationships between mass flows and chemical/energy transformations, it seems necessary to develop generalized mod- els to understand the limitations of plant growth. Therefore, it is critical to have a robust modelling capability to provide insight into potential problems as well as to direct efficient experimenta- tion. Last year we reported on a simple leaf model which focused upon the mass transfer of gases, radiation/heat balances, and the production of photosynthetically produced carbohydrate. That model indicated some of the plant processes which had to be understood in order to obtain parameters specific for each spe- cies. However, that model did not account for available carbohy- drate balance between storage, growth, and export to new tissues. The objective of this paper is to develop a generalized model which includes layers of leaves interacting with each other. This model differs from general canopy models of field growth since in growth chambers these leaf layers differentially absorb radia- tion, from a spatial fixed light source above the canopy, and gases, arriving from below the canopy and being forced to pass through it. The overall approach to the calculations remains largely the same as the leaf model. Energy balances are first used to calculate gases exchange patterns. Carbohydrate production is then calculated from the light intensity and CO2/O2 concentra- tions. The productivity is then divided into respiration loss, stor- age for maintenance, structural growth, and export to other grow- ing portions of the plant. 1991 SAE Transactions Section 1 911495. Recent technology products from space human factors research. James P. Jenkins, NASA Headquarters. The major goal of space human factors program is to provide the technology which will enable safe and productive human per- formance throughout and after long duration space flights and planetary/lunar missions. The human factors element has three major sub-goals: human performance models, data and tools, crew support and enhancements; and human-automation robotic systems. 173</page><page sequence="173">911496-911500 911496. Shiftwork in space: bright light as a chronobiologic countermeasure. Alexander Samel DLR Institute for Aerospace Medicine; and Philippa H. Gander, NASA Ames Research Center. Work-rest schedules during long duration space missions involve several factors which could disrupt sleep and circadian temporal organization: 1) substantial displacement of sleep with respect to mission control time, due to two-shift operations; 2) schedule changes, either planned or in response to unforeseen operational events; 3) social and light Zeitgebers substantially dif- ferent from those on earth; 4) pulses of hypergravity associated with launch and re-entry, and prolonged exposure to micro- gravity. Timed bright light exposures have recently received much attention as a possible countermeasure to accelerate adap- tation to schedule changes. Four male subjects were therefore exposed to two sessions of eleven days of simulated weightless- ness (6° head-down tilt bedrest) with six hour extensions of the scheduled waketime on days 3 and 4 (12 h phase delay). In a blind cross-over design, subjects were exposed to bright (&gt;3500 lux) light for five hours on each of the two shift days and the following day, at times expected to accelerate adaptation to the phase delay (experimental group) or have no phase shifting effect (control group). Sleep was recorded polygraphically and the circadian sys- tem monitored by recordings of heart rate and rectal temperature (2 min samples), and urinary excretion of hormones and electro- lytes (3 hourly samples during wake). Only the rhythms of 6-hy- droximelatoninsulphate and potassium excretion showed signifi- cantly accelerated adaptation in the experimental protocol. Dif- ferent rhythms adapted to the 12 h delay at different rates, com- parable to those observed in ambulatory subjects after time zone shifts. Sleep was shorter in simulated weightlessness than in nor- mal ambulatory age-matched controls, consistent with the shorter sleep durations characteristic of space flight. In summary, these results confirm the disruptive effects of wake/rest schedule shifts on sleep and circadian rhythms during simulated weight- lessness. Contrary to our initial hypothesis, five hour exposures to bright light finishing at the time of the circadian temperature minimum were no more effective at accelerating adaptation to a 12 h schedule delay than exposures coinciding with the tempera- ture maximum. We conclude that, while bright light may acceler- ate adaptation to work/rest schedule delays under simulated weightless conditions, any such effect seems to be largely inde- pendent of the timing of the light exposure. 1991 SAE Transactions Section 1 911497. Human factors in aerobrake design for EVA assembly and maintenance. Lisa M. Rockoff, David Elliott Anderson, and Lisa K. Evelsizer, McDonnell Douglas Space Systems Co. Human factors will have a profound impact on aerobrake designs of future space transfer vehicles to allow the vehicles to be assembled, maintained, and refurbished on orbit. Though déployable aerobrake designs are being considered, many extra- vehicular activity tasks will be a necessary part of assembly and refurbishment. Crew interfaces will need to be easily operated by a suited crewman during all phases of flight. While telerobotic and autonomous systems may be developed for portions of these tasks, extravehicular activity will always be required for contin- gency plans. This paper details some of the critical human factor issues that must be addressed in aerobrake design based on results from aerobrake neutral buoyancy test performed in Octo- ber 1990 under the McDonnell Douglas Space Systems Company Independent Research and Development program. This paper examines the need for crew restraint during assembly for torque reaction, familiar frame of reference, and speed of assembly. This paper also examines hardware interface requirements that allow for ease of operation, verification, maintenance, and inspection. While these insights are derived from an aerobrake testbed, they are applicable to other large space structures, such as space sta- tion freedom. 1991 SAE Transactions Section 1 911498. Arthitectural ideas relating to the question of human body motion in microgravity. Regis S. Fauquet, Design Models, Inc.; and Jun Okushi, Okushi Architects. The absence of gravity in space alters what we take for granted on Earth. In microgravity the human body experiences signifi- cant postural and perceptual changes. From an architectural per- spective these transformations have profound epistemic implica- tions on the man/environment relationship. Weightlessness exacerbates problems relating to orientation, mobility and environmental interface. In order to choreograph human/machine interface within physically and emotionally supportive body envelopes the characteristics of the interface morphology of human mobility in microgravity must be under- stood. If weightlessness can modify our bodily experiences, it will certainly lead our collective consciousness to new ways of know- ing. Thus, the physics of microgravity must be the primary guide- lines to designing crew accommodations for an orbital outpost. 911499. A database containing operational experience in spaceflight. Thomas F. Callaghan, Lockheed Engineering and Sciences Co.; Susan C. Adam, NASA Johnson Space Center ; and John W. Gosbee, Lockheed Engrg. and Sciences Co. Throughout the manned-space programs of the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA), significant data has been gathered regarding how humans live and work in the environment encountered in space. Recording operation experi- ence helps avoid duplication of errors, can improve the design of equipment and procedures, and can provide valuable insight into human-machine and human-environment interfaces. Several sources contain valuable information about living and working in space, but are in an uncoordinated paper format. A relational database, called the operational experience database, has been constructed to electronically store and organize human factors information from the Skylab and space shuttle missions. The tax- onomy used to organize this database builds on the one used for the skylab human-machine experiments. This information can be used by NASA engineers and operations personnel to remedy design problems, or expand on design successes. Work to improve and expand the database is underway. 1991 SAE Transactions Section 1 911500. (SP-873) Advanced regenerative life support for space exploration. H. T. Couch, J. W. Auman, Jr., and T. C. Falvey, Hamilton Standard Div., United Technologies Corp. Advanced regenerative environmental control and life sup- port system (ECLSS) technology was identified by NASA as enabling for space exploration. Low Earth orbit (LEO) mass sav- ings of over 700,000 pounds (320,000 kg) per year are expected for a lunar outpost crew of eight as compared with ECLSS sys- tems which are currently flying. This paper explores ECLSS tech- nologies which show promise for reducing LEO mass for long range exploration initiatives. The roles of in-situ resource utiliza- tion (ISRU) and a closed ecological life support system (CELSS) are discussed. Physical-chemical candidates for advanced tech- nological development are recommended based on combined expendable, consumable and installed subsystem LEO mass sav- ings for a number of advanced water processing and air revitaliza- tion approaches. These processes include: 1) higher efficiency urine processing with or without pretreatment, 2) a single water processor for potable and hygiene water, 3) obtaining potable water and oxygen from the electrolysis system, 4) chemical N2 storage, and 5) membrane gas separation processes. The benefits of these technologies for increasing loop closure on N2, O2, and H2O are discussed. 174</page><page sequence="174">911501-911505 911501. (SP-873) Advanced air revitalization for optimized crew and plant environments. David J. Grigger and M. Gene Lee , Life Systems, Inc.; and Mariann F. Brown, NASA Johnson Space Center. For long-duration space explorations such as the advanced manned missions to the moon and Mars, optimized environmen- tal conditions are essential. This approach will not only maxi- mize the efficiencies of the crew and other systems, but also mini- mize the requirements for power, weight, volume and expend- ables. Life Systems, working with NASA-JSC, has been investi- gating ways to apply various physical, chemical and electrochemical methods for this purpose. This paper presents a description of a closed ecosystem con- cept, called hybrid air revitalization system (HARS) that includes electrochemical CO2 and O2 separators and a mechanical mois- ture condenser/separator for maintaining CO2, O2 and humidity levels in the crew and plant habitats at their respective optimal conditions. This concept was developed as a part of the Advanced electrochemical CO2 removal process study program sponsored by NASA-JSC. The key processes of this concept are aqueous electrolyte-based electrochemical CO2 and O2 separa- tions. The principles and cell characteristics of these electrochem- ical gas separation processes are described in this paper. Also presented in this paper are the descriptions of test hardware and the test results of the electrochemical CO2 separator (ECS) and the electrochemical O2 separator (EOS). 1 991 SAE Transactions Section 1 911502. (SP-873) Water vapor recovery from plant growth chambers. R. J. Ray, D. D. Newbold, R. H. Colton, and S. B. McCray, Bend Research, Inc. NASA is investigating the use of plant growth chambers (PGCs) for space missions and for bases on the moon and Mars. Key to successful development of PGCs is a system to recover and reuse the water vapor that is transpired from the leaves of the plants. In this paper a design is presented for a simple, reliable, mem- brane-based system that allows the recovery, purification, and reuse of the transpired water vapor through control of tempera- ture and humidity levels in PGCs. The system is based on two membrane technologies: 1) dehumidification membrane mod- ules to remove water vapor from the air, and 2) membrane con- tactors to return water vapor to the PGC (and, in doing so, to con- trol the humidity and temperature within the PGC). The mem- brane-based system promises to provide an ideal, stable growth environment for a variety of plants, through a design that mini- mizes energy usage, volume, and mass, while maximizing sim- plicity and reliability. 1991 SAE Transactions Section 1 911503. (SP-873) Development of immobilized cell bioreactor technology for water reclamation in a regenerative life support system. Glenn E. Petrie, Allied-Signal Research and Technology ; and Maurena S. Nacheff-Benedict, AiResearch Los Angeles Div., Allied Signal Aerospace Co. Immobilized microbial cell bioreactor technology is being investigated under a company-funded program to evaluate its applicability as a primary water processor for treatment of waste- water streams in a regenerative life support system. Incorporating biological wastewater treatment methods, as either a primary processor or a trace contaminant polisher, may offer several advantages over use of physicochemical processing methods alone, for long-duration space missions. Most contaminants found in a life support wastewater stream can be biologically con- verted to simple molecules. This occurs at near ambient tempera- ture and pressure, requiring very little energy. In addition, bioreactor configurations are relatively simple, compared to physicochemical processes. One of the major benefits of using an immobilized cell bioreactor as a primary processor in a regenera- tive life support system is that such a unit could process several, and possibly all, of the wastewater streams. This would then require only trace contaminant polishing methods, depending on the end use of the water. The immobilized bioreactor technology described in this paper was initially developed and applied in treatment of com- plex industrial wastewater streams. Adapting this technology for use in a regenerative life support system involves selection of spe- cific microorganisms adapted to the expected waste streams. Development of process configurations which optimize volume, weight, power, and other consumables will also be required. Efforts to develop and test an immobilized cell bioreactor for use as a primary wastewater processor have been initiated, using a simulated feed containing contaminants found in several life support wastewater streams. A consortium of enriched aerobic microorganisms was immobilized onto various supports in packed bed reactor configurations; these reactors were then oper- ated in a continuous process mode. Bioreactor performance in preliminary bench-scale experiments, as a function of reactor geometry, support material, pH, and hydraulic retention time (HRT), is presented. 1991 SAE Transactions Section 1 911504. (SP-873) Using biological reactors to remove trace hydrocarbon contaminants from recycled water. Gary P. Miller, Ralph J. Porter, and David P. Dickey, Institute for Environmental Studies, Louisiana State Univ.; and Howard L. Sleeper, Research and Development Div., Lockheed Missiles and Space Co. A series of experiments was performed to test the viability of using immobilized-bed, biological reactors to remove trace organic contaminants from recycled water. Prototype reactors were designed and built to test this concept on three goups of tar- get organics, aliphatics, aromatics, and chlorinated aliphatics. Three experiments have been performed using phenol as the target compound. Phenol was fed to the reactor in a 100 parts per million (ppm) phenol in water feed and 10 ppm phenol feed. The 10 ppm feed experiments were run with the reactors oper- ating in recycle mode, which allows the reactor to operate as a continuously stirred tank reactor (CSTR), and in plug-flow mode. The 100 ppm experiments showed an average phenol removal efficiency of 99.98% over a seven day period, with an average retention time of 27.2 hours. The seven day 10 ppm experiment in recycle mode had a 97.08% removal efficiency with a retention time of 13.7 hours. The 10 ppm plug-flow experiments were able to remove 99.88% of the phenol with a retention time of 12.5 hours. The phenol levels in the reactor effluent averaged below 10 parts per billion over the seven days of the experiment. 911505. (SP-873) Advanced development of immobilized enzyme reactors. Leonard J. Schussel, Umpqua Research Co.; Layne Carter, NASA Marshall Space Flight Co.; and Clifford D. Jolly, Umpqua Research Co. Removal of low-molecular weight, polar, non-ionic contami- nants such as urea and alcohols from aqueous solution is being accomplished using immobilized enzyme technology. Immobi- lized urease is used to catalyze urea hydrolysis for subsequent removal as ammonia. An alcohol oxidase enzyme-based catalyst is used to catalyze oxidation of alcohols, aldehydes, and similar compounds to organic acids, which are removed by ion exchange. Fixed bed reactors were successfully developed and delivered to NASA-MSFC for a segment of the phase III core module inte- grated facility (CM IF) water recovery test. Wastewater generated in the end-use equipment facility (EEF) was purified using a com- bination of multifiltration unibeds and enzyme unibeds. The enzyme beds effectively removed the targeted organics to levels below detection limits (&lt;100/400 ppb). Also, based on the amount of TOC removed unidentified organic contaminants beyond those specifically targeted. Average effluent TOC concen- trations were 1 mg/L. 1991 SAE Transactions Section 1 175</page><page sequence="175">911506-911509 911506. Modeling of advanced ECLSS/ARS with Aspen.

In the past year, several atmospheric revitalization sub- system (ARS) were modeled at a relatively low level of detail (cal- led 'system level') using Aspen. These models included partial reduction of martian CO2 and a bioregenerative life support sub- system (BRLSS). The individual component and subsystem models were inte- grated into three different system-level ARS models: a baseline physico-chemical case, a case with a BRLSS, and a case using par- tial reduction of martian CO2. These Aspen models included the Fortran interfaces necessary for integration with another pro- gram, G189A, to perform "quasitransient" modeling (periodic pseudo-steady-state model passes with transient updating in between). Finally, detailed models were prepared for several ARS sub- systems. Detailed reactor models were prepared for the two CO2 reduction reactors (Bosch and advanced carbon formation), and for the low-temperature trace contaminant oxidation reactor. A detailed model will be prepared for the sabatier reactor. In addi- tion, the detailed EDC model of Lin &amp; Winnick was modified and integrated with Aspen. 911507. Computer simulation of water reclamation processors. John W. Fisher, T. Mark Hightower, and Michael T. Flynn, NASA Ames Research Center. A step in the development of advanced regenerative life sup- port systems is to produce simulation models to guide experi- mentation and hardware development. This paper discusses the development of detailed simulation models of water reclamation processors using the Aspen Plus ł" simulation program. Individ- ual models have been developed for vapor compression distilla- tion (VCD), vapor phase catalytic ammonia removal (VPCAR) and supercritical water oxidation (SCWO). This paper outlines the methodology which is used to complete this work and dis- cusses the insights which are gained by this type of model devel- opment. A discussion of how modeling predictions are used to direct future work in modeling and experimentation is also pres- ented. The initial set of modeled processors were VCD, VPCAR, and SCWO. Furture work will cover the modeling of other processors. These models will be linked to form subsystem level models, and evaluations will be performed on various configurations. A paral- lel path of hardware development will also be pursued. Innova- tive hardware design and development will be facilitated though the use of these advanced models. The subsystem level models will allow for the development of processors which operate in intimately integrated subsystems. 911508. Ion exchange - Simulation and experiment. Cal C. Herrmann , Bionetics Inc., NASA Ames Research Center ; and John E. Finn, NASA Ames Research Center. As the durations of manned space missions increase, so will the need for compact and reliable water recycling systems. Optimization of such water-recycling systems involves computer simulation of process elements and subsystems. The operations of water recycling systems are simulated at the Ames Research Center using commercial software called Aspen-Plus. Ion exchange is a part of the multifiltration subsystem, used for final polishing of recycled water and in some cases as a com- plete water treatment. Ion-exchange resins reomve hazardous ions from solution by exchanging them with innocuous ions according to selection parameters. The ion-exchange operation is not provided in the Aspen-Plus multiprocess simulator package, but Fortran-callable modules may be added. Therefore, we have adapted a Fortran program simulating multicomponent adsorp- tion by ion-exchange resins, for use both as an ASPEN-collable module and as a free-standing simulator of the ion-exchange bed. Our model determines equilibria using a pitzer model for activi- ties of liquid-phase ions and resin-phase activities calculated using Wilson binary-interaction parameters. Parameters required by the simulation program are provided by laboratory experiments. The laboratory investigation also sup- plies performance measurements of resin beds for trapping haz- ardous ions. 911509. A study of the effects of bioregenerative technology on a regenerative life support system. Stephen R. Gustavino, McDon- nell Douglas Space Systems Co. The objectives set forth by NASA's space exploration initia- tive (SEI) include the construction of a lunar base and the manned exploration of Mars early in the 21st century. However, current life support system technology is not capable of support- ing such missions and remains one of the most fundamental limi- tations of space exploration. To date, life support systems have consisted of exhaustible supplies that limit missions to relatively short durations. This method has sufficed so far; however, if humans are to truly break away from Earth, it will be necessary to reproduce the characteristics of the terrestrial biosphere in extraterrestrial locations. Bioregenerative technology incorporates plants and animals as processors in a regenerative life support system. Controlled ecological life support systems (CELSS) use bioregenerative tech- nology to recycle system consumables, therefore, increasing sys- tem self-sufficiency and breaking the limitations imposed by traaditional life support system designs. The study of this tech- nology is of great basic value not only for its applications in space but also for its benefits to life on Earth. The need for the reclama- tion and purification of water and the control of airborne contam- inants grows more evident as Earth's natural resources are either exhausted or sourced. The creation of waste-free industrial pro- duction is vital to the continuing development of our society. Although bioregenerative technology is not a new concept, rel- atively little hardware exists for space applications. As a result, little is understood concerning total system performance or the possible effects bioregenerative technology may have on other life support subsystems. Through the use of computer simulation, we have been able to address these issues. This paper discusses the results of computer simulations that have been used to model a functioning CELSS and examines what effects bioregenerative technology may have on an initial lunar outpost. Computer simulation technology can be used to provide a mathematical test-bed for life support system design concepts that could increase system closure for extended duration mis- sions. We have used a general understanding of human and plant physiology to develop mathematical relationships that describe the performance of these bioprocessors. We then used these sub- routines in the construction of computer models that represent advanced environmental control and life support system (ECLSS) configurations. Simulations were conducted to test sys- tem resupply characteristics and evaluate system performance. We are also working to validate the algorithms used in our simu- lations so that we may apply them with some degree of confi- dence. This is an important step because the information gained from any system simulation is only as good as the algorithms that represent the system components. Although computer simulation is a useful tool and a necessary first step, it cannot replace laboratory experimentation. In most of the governing equations used in our simulations, assumptions have been made to simplify system behavior. At this early stage of CELSS development, it would be inappropriate as well as impossible to capture all of the details necessary to model every aspect of system performance. This leaves any simulation incom- plete. However, with each study iteration, more detail is incorpo- rated into the computer models. Our intent is to use computer 176</page><page sequence="176">911509-911515 simulation as a compass that points us in the right direction and prepares us for the prototype phase of the system development. Once the direction is clear, laboratory experimentation will dic- tate the final configuration. 911510. Plant growth modeling and the design of experiments in the development of bioregenerative life support systems. Robert J. Sirko, McDonnell Douglas Space Systems Co. An approach to plant modeling that incorporates plant and environment interactions and that is driven by the requirements of designing and evaluating controlled ecological life support sys- tems (CELSS) has been developed. The objective of this model- ing approach is to permit the development of CELSS designs that optimize the performance of systems in which plant growth units are embedded. The approach described in this paper takes advantage of well- known analytical features of smoothly varying functions to con- struct an empirical model of the physiological response of plants to their environment. The model combines an emphasis on empirical data gathering to specify the plant response to nominal and near-nominal values of environmental control variables with general analytical relations that strictly hold for well-defined and behaved functions. Thus the same model is used for a variety of plant species and growing conditions, and numerical coefficients within the model define specific plant characteristics. The model development also suggests efficient experimental designs for collecting controlled environment plant response data. Examples of these experimental designs are also presented. 911511. Optimization of crop growing area in a controlled environmental life support system. Gary W. Glover, Laura E. Dyer, and James B. Blackmon, McDonnell Douglas Space Sys- tems Co. Optimization methodologies based on the Brigham Young University OPTDES code are used to determine the minimum per capita crop area required for controlled environmental life support systems (CELSS) needed for self-sustaining space colo- nies and long duration space flights. Various food crop productiv- ity values and nutritional requirements are integrated with numerical optimization algorithms to determine the types of crops which best meet nutritional needs, subject to various con- straints, and have minimum growing area. Eleven candidate crops, selected from NASA and other sources, are combined with a nutritional code and selected nutritional requirements. Soy- bean, tomato, potato, and peanut crops are found to be the best providers of energy nutrients (protein, carbohydrates, and fats), and other vegetable crops (e.g., carrot, chard, and lettuce) provide relatively higher amounts of certain nutrients, such as vitamin A and calcium in a smaller area and are therefore, beneficial under certain constraints. Mushrooms are also found to offer good nutritional value and high productivity, but the amounts that can be grown are limited by the available inedible and waste biomass. The OPTDES code, coupled with crop production data and nutri- tional requirements, was determined to be a rapid and effective means of assessing CELSS options and offers a promising approach for determining the optimum means of providing food for space colonies. The approach presented here may also be ben- eficial for analayzing terrestrial crop systems. 1991 SAE Transactions Section 1 911512. Microbial growth and physiology in space: a review. Louis A. Cioletti, KRUG Life Sciences; Duane L. Pierson, NASA Johnson Space Center ; and S. K. Mishra, KRUG Life Sciences. Weightlessness, cosmic radiation and other space flight related conditions may adversely impact the physiology and immune status of the crew. Since microorganisms will surely be present in space habitats, the effects of space on microbial metabolic and physiologic functions will depend upon environmental condi- tions, types of organisms, and the duration of the flight. Because humans will conduct long-duration space missions, space micro- biology must address the effect of alterations in microbial func- tion during space flight. Even innocuous microorganisms and endogenous flora may become etiologie agents for disease during long missions. The microbial population in the closed environ- ments of spacecraft may also become a source of toxic metaboli- ties or the biodégradation of materials. This paper reviews studies concerning microbial behavior in closed environments, simulated microgravity, and actual space flight. Growth, physiology, subcellular structure, and antibiotic sensitivity are described. Although the results of studies per- formed to date are occasionally contradictory, it is clear that the interaction of microorganisms with the space flight environment, including human, animal, and botanical inhabitants, must be investigated in order to ensure the safety of the crews and the integrity of the spacecraft environment. 1991 SAE Transactions Section 1 911513. Zoonoses and enclosed environments. Gary N. Joiner, Texas A&amp;M Univ. The linkelihood of transmission of potential disease agents between animals and man during spaceflight is a real concern. Development of disease exclusion lists for animals and refine- ment of animal containment units have been the principal means of providing protection to the crew members. Awareness of potential latent infections and a judicious use of the higher risk category of animals such as wild-caught nonhuman primates pro- vides another level of protection. Use of high efficiency filters, gasketing, and differential air pressures have all enabled increas- ing levels of safety through containment of potential aerosol escape from animal habitats. 1991 SAE Transactions Section 1 911514. Health risks from saprophytic bioaerosols on space station freedom. Harriet A. Bürge, University of Michigan. Fungi and bacteria are an essential part of the earth environ- ment. In man-made interiors, however, they cause inappropriate decay, and human diesease, which, on SSF, could be devastating. Three human diseases caused by environmental microorganisms are of particular concern. Legionnaires* disease is a serious pneu- monia, resistant to many antibiotics, and carrying a 15% fatality rate. The organism (Legionella pneumophila) inhabits hot water systems where biofilms have developed. Although normal healthy people are not generally at risk, any impairment of lung defenses allows a few hundred organisms per cubic meter of air to be dangerous. Continuous halogen treatment and maintenance of adequately evaluated temperatures combined with monitoring should be effective controls. Hypersensitivity pneumonitis (HP) is an acute pneumonitic response to inhaled antigens. There may be a synergistic effect between antigen and endotoxin, lowering necessary antigen dose, and increasing attack rates. Any small fungal spor or bacterial endospore, including those from common environmental fungi such as Pénicillium and Cladosporium and bacteria such as Bacil- lus and the thermophilic actinomycetes can probably cause HP. Human risk factors are unknown. Preventing condensation, halo- gen treatment of water reservoirs, and monitoring will contribute to control. Fungi produce the most potent known toxins, including car- cinogens, immunosuppressants, and central nervous system poi- sons. Effective doses for inhaled toxins are unkown, but are prob- ably low. Airborne spores are known to contain these toxins. Human risk factors do not apply - all are affected. Toxigenic fungi should not be allowed on SSF. Prevention of contamination and monitoring for these specific organisms is essential. 1991 SAE Transactions Section 1 911515. Effects of microgravity on the immune system. Gerald Soonenfeld, Dept. of Microbiology and Immunology, University of Louisville; and Gerald R. Taylor, NASA Johnson Space Center. 177</page><page sequence="177">911515-911520 Changes in resistance to bacterial and viral infections in Apollo crew members has stimulated interest in the study of immunity and space flight. Results of studies from several labora- tories in both humans and rodents have indicated alterations after space flight that include the following immunological parameters: thymus size, lymphocyte blastogenesis, interferon and interleukin production, natural killer cell activity, cytotoxic T-cell activity, leukocyte subset population distribution, response of bone marrow cells to colony stimulating factors, and delayed hypersensitivity skin test reactivity. The interactions of the immune system with other physiological systems, including muscle, bone, and the nervous system, may play a major role in the development of these immunological parameters during and after flight. There may also be direct effects of space flight on immune responses. 1991 SAE Transactions Section 1 911516. Disinfectants for spacecraft applications: an overview. David W. Koenig and Laura L. Mallary, KRUG Life Sciences ; and Duane L. Pierson , NASA Johnson Space Center. In-flight contamination control has been an important con- cern of NASA since the first manned missions. Previous experi- ence has shown that uncontrolled growth of bacteria and fungi can have a detrimental effect on both the health of the crew and the proper operation of flight hardware. It is, therefore, impera- tive to develop a safe, effective method of microbial control. Spacecraft application dictates a more stringent set of require- ments for biocide selection than is usually necessary for terrestrial situations. Toxicity of the biocide is the driving factor for disin- fectant choice in spacecraft. This concern greatly reduces the number and types of chemical agents that can be used as disinfec- tants. Currently, four biocide candidates (hydrogen peroxide, quaternary ammonium compounds, iodine, glutaraldehyde) are being evaluated as potential surface disinfectants for space sta- tion freedom. Details are given on the rationale for biocide selec- tion and the environmental and biological factors that influence biocide efficacy. Furthermore, the chemical and toxicological properties of these biocides and others are considered in relation to disinfection of spacecraft and allied hardware. 1991 SAE Transactions Section 1 911517. Rationale for common contamination control guide- lines for crew habitation and life sciences research. Teri Schnepp, Paul Ward-Dolkas , and Cynthia Havens, Lockheed Missiles and Space Co., Inc. The Augustine advisory committee on the future of the U.S. space program has recommended that "space station freedom be revamped to emphasize life sciences and human space opera- tions." An important component of life sciences research involves the housing, care and maintenance of research speci- mens. Microbial and odor contamination control measures are necessary to ensure that cross contamination between the crew and specimens is controlled and limited. The bioisolation requirements being applied to life sciences specimen handling facilities are more stringent than those applied in the past. This paper examines the designs and operational features which have been used during previous spaceflight missions to contain and control crew and research specimen wastes. Because crew wastes also require microbial and odor control, the same measures which are used to control crew wastes may be directly applied in a cost-effective, minimal-risk manner to controlling contamina- tion generated by research specimens. 911518. The application of sterile filtration technology in the environmental control and life support systems of space station freedom. Paul I. Keyser and Glenn A. Howard, Pall Corp. Environmental control and life support systems (ECLSS) of space station freedom are closed loop recirculating systems. Major subsystems of ECLSS (air, water, and temperature and humidity control) will require particulate and microbial control. Elimination or reduction of these contaminants can be achieved through the appropriate placement of microbially retentive fil- ters. Current technologies allow particulate removal from gases to 0.01 micron which eliminates all known viruses. Filtration of liquids can remove all particles to 0.04 micron which eliminates all known bacteria, fungi, and many viruses. In addition, steriliz- ing grade membrane filters can be periodically nondestrictively in-situ tested to monitor integrity during service. This paper reviews state of the art technologies of gas and liq- uid filtration utilized in the semiconductor, pharmaceutical, health care, and food/beverage industries and how similar advanced filtration technology can be adapted for space station freedom. 1991 SAE Transactions Section 1 911519. Corrosion consequences of microfouling in water rec- lamation systems, i?. Mitchell and Tim Ford, Div. of Applied Sci- ences, Harvard Univ. Microbial film formation throughout the water reclamation systems proposed for use in the NASA space station freedom poses serious corrosion risks. Choice of materials for construc- tion of these systems must include evaluation of the potential for microbially influenced corrosion. The development of an active and therefore potentially corro- sive microbial biofilm on metal surfaces is influenced by the nature of the metal substratum. This has been shown by scanning electron microscopy, isolation and identification of attached bac- teria and measurements of biomass and activity. However, these techniques do not allow direct 'real-time* measurement of bio- film formation and subsequent materials degradation. This is necessary to assess the efficacy of biocides and alternative reme- dial measures. This paper presents potential fouling and corro- sion problems associated with water reclamation system design for the NASA orbiting space station. Use of advanced metal sputtering techniques combined with image analysis and fourier transform infrared spectroscopy will be presented as real-time solutions for investigating biofilm for- mation and function on different materials. 1991 SAE Transactions Section 1 911520. European two-phase heat transport technology advanced test bed results. R. Siepmann, Dornier; and W. Supper, Thermal Control and Life Support Div., ESA/ESTEC. In the scope of the Columbus-preparatory support technology programme, funded and coordinated by the European Space Agency (ESA/ESTEC), critical components of a mechanically pumped two-phase heat transport system, i.e. evaporator cold plate, evaporative heat exchanger, vapour quality sensors, con- denser, accumulator, gas trap and control system, have been identified and developed by a number of European companies under Dornier-subcontract. A comprehensive test programme, focussed on the investiga- tion of critical components performance characteristics and lim- its, has generally demonstrated very satisfactory and partially even excellent results. However, experience gained during test performance as well as overall test evaluation have concluded in several recommen- dations for further analysis, improving modifications and a con- tinuation of testing aimed at an enhancement of European two- phase technology know-how. This paper details the modifications applied on the test bed loop and its support systems. In particular it discusses the prelim- inary results of the advanced test programme, which has recently been finished, including a detailed checkout of critical compo- nents, system operation during a simulation of an on-orbit sinus- oidal radiator temperature variation, capillary pumped mode operation, a simulation of system leakage, heat load sharing and performance tests of an adaptive-predictive control system. 178</page><page sequence="178">911521-911529 911521. TPX: two-phase experiment for get away special G-557. A. A. M. Delil and J. F. Heemskerk, National Aerospace Lab., NLR; and W. Supper, Thermal Control and Life Support Div., ESA/ESTEC. Mechanically and capillary pumped two-phase heat transport systems are currently developed to meet the high power and long transport distance requirements of thermal management systems for future spacecraft. As two-phase flow and heat transfer in a low-gravity environment is expected to (considerably) differ from terrestrial behaviour, the technology of two-phase heat transport systems and their components has to be demonstrated in orbit. Therefore, a Dutch-Belgian two-phase experiment (TPX) is being developed within the ESA in-orbit technology demonstration programme TDP1. TPX concerns a two-phase ammonia system in the (5ft3, gaseous nitrogen filled) get away special canister G-557. The system is a downscaled capillary pumped two-phase loop. It includes downscaled verions of mechanically pumped two-phase loop components: multichan- nel condensers and vapour quality sensors (plus a controllable 3-way valve for control exercises). The critical design review status of TPX is discussed. 911522. Thermal test of an ammonia two-phase loop results of condenser study. V. Berthon and S. Andre, Aerospatiale ; T. Lafon, CNE S ; and M. Lallemand, IN SA. Future large spacecraft will require thermal control systems capable of transporting large amount of heat over long distances. Two phase fluid loops are being developed in order to satisfy these requirements. A 600 W mechanically pumped two phase elementary loop, using ammonia as the working fluid, has been built and tested at Aerospatiale-Cannes. The general operating principles of the loop and the thermal performances of the horizontal smooth one-tube condenser, uniformly cooled by water have been studied. No starting difficulties, control problems or flow instabilities have occured, and the tests have demonstrated good operating conditions. Condensation average heat transfer coefficients of 5000 to 8000 W/m2.°C have been obtained. A condensation model, previously developed, has given the theoretical two phase flow patterns corresponding to the test cases, and the predicted thermal performances for stratified and annular flows. The experimental condensation lengths and average heat transfer coefficients have been compared with the predictions. The theoretical values have been found to be in good agreement (±10%) with test results for annular flow. For stratified flow, the comarison between experimental and calculated values have shown a systematic difference of about 30%. 911523. A space pump prototype designed for operation in thermal loops. E. Wunderlich, Consulting Engineer; and H. G. Wulz, Dornier GmbH. A pump concept was elaborated based on the Columbus requirements. Mainly the requirements for long life and low- noise operation were taken into consideration in this design. According to the pump concept a model pump for operation in a thermal loop was built and tested with existing industrial facili- ties. Tests revealed that this very compact and light pump fulfils already the hydraulic requirements completely and is near to the low-noise requirement. After a running time of 1000 hours with the fluids water and liquid ammonia the ceramic bearings show no wear at all. The results allow to expect that this pump concept will fulfill the stringent Columbus requirements. 1991 SAE Transactions Section 1 911524. High-efficient condenser with porous element. L. L. Vasiliev, D. K. Khrustalev, and A. G. Kulakov, Luikov Heat and Mass Transfer Institute. Consideration is given to a condenser with a porous element mounted on a capillary-grooved condensation surface. A liquid phase is removed from this surface and filtered via a porous plate assisted by an excess pressure in a vapor and capillary forces. Experimental data obtained, with acetone taken as a heat agent, testify to a high rate of heat transfer in such condenser. A devel- oped mathematical model is based on the conservation equations for energy, mass and momentum, traditional formulas for filtra- tion, a capillary pressure and the equation of state for a non- condensable gas. An influence of a porous plate permeability as well as geometric and other parameters on condenser characteris- tics is discussed. 911526. (SP-872) Information requirements for space station freedom EVA. Gail Goodman, Grumman. NASA has accumulated EVA experience from the Gemini, Apollo, Skylab, and NSTS orbiter missions. This experience is the basis for planning advanced EVA supporting assembly and maintainance of space station freedom (SSF), and support of future exploration initiatives with advanced EVA. This paper provides an analysis of software supported infor- mation requirements for advanced EVA. Briefly reviewed are: 1) historial EVA -types and purposes; 2) types of EVA missions planned for SSF; and 3) information requirements supporting EVA missions. 911527. (SP-872) Extravehicular activity (EVA) maintenance scenarios for external distributed utilities aboard space station freedom. Dawn M. Reinhard and Tammy F. Hinkle, Space Sta- tion Div., McDonnell Douglas Space Systems Co. Innovative on-orbit extravehicular activity (EVA) mainte- nance techniques are currently being developed to effectively maintain external fluid and electrical functions on board space station freedom. The fluid and electrical distribution system, spread over a distance never before experienced in a space envi- ronment, presents some unique challenges to the EVA crewmem- ber during routine and contingency maintenance operations. This paper describes EVA maintenance techniques for the utility distribution system (UDS) developed by flight crew sys- tems engineers in conjunction with system design engineers at McDonnell Douglas Space Systems Company. The paper includes photographs illustrating the highlights of suited-subject underwater testing at McDonnell Douglas' Huntington Beach facility, which demonstrated the feasibility of using cut and swage techniques for on-orbit fluid line repair. This paper briefly sum- marizes the status of man-working-in-space concepts as they apply to the UDS. 1991 SAE Transactions Section 1 911529. (SP-872) Design and testing of an electronic extrave- hicular mobility unit (EMU) cuff checklist. Charles H . Simonds and Chen-Hsiang Chen, Lockheed Engineering and Sciences Co., Inc. The electronic cuff checklist (EEC) is an electronic device to be strapped to the wrist of a space suit. The ECC consists of an electroluminescent flat panel display, control and data storage electronics, an RS232 serial data port and a battery. The device is an electronic replacement for the cuff checklist used during the Apollo, Skylab and shuttle extravehicular activities (EVA's). The original cuff checklist consists of up to 25 double sided 7.6 by 17.7 cm (3 inch by 5 inch) pages held open with a spring and mounted on the astronaut's wrist with a device similar to an expandable watch band. The principal advantages of the electronic device are: 1) it can store a larger amount of information than the man- ual checklist, up to 2000 pages of information with 1 megabyte of memory; and 2) the ECC can be reloaded with new informa- tion from an RS232 port on the ground before a shuttle launch or while on orbit such as for space station freedom (SSF) applica- tions. The ECC is located on the astronaut's wrist, which years of experience have demonstrated as an acceptable place to locate 179</page><page sequence="179">911529-911533 the astronaut's information source. The device is autonomous from the rest of the space suit and related life support equipment, thus it can be used by unsuited crew or by crew in a different type of space suit. The paper will present the results of the design and test of a breadboard version. The breadboard consists of: 1) a commer- cially available electroluminescent with an active area of 93.5 mm by 74.7 mm and a resolution of 320 pixels by 256 pixels (cherry electronics model EL1D-D000); 2) attached hardware driver on a surface mount circuit board sold with the display; 3) a wire wrap assembled data storage and memory module using an Intel 80C196 microcontroller; 4) an RS232 interface; 5) data handling software and hardware in a PC clone using an Intel 80386 processor; and 6) a laboratory 12 volt power supply. The breadboard was tested in the JSC Building 13 lighting laboratory equipped with a electric arc solar illumination simulator. Testing demonstrated that the display could be read in a wide range of illumination conditions including full sun. A volumetric mockup of the unit was fabricated from a block of plastic encased in a nylon packcloth and velcro simulation of a thermal cover. Test- ing in the John Space Center (JSC) weightless environment test- ing facilities water tank demonstrated that the cuff checklist could be designed which would not adversely affect the astronaut's reach and mobility. 1991 SAE Transactions Section 1 911530. (SP-872) Increasing EVA capability through telerobo- tics and free flyers. David E. Anderson , McDonnell Douglas Space Systems Company ; and Lisa K. Evelsizer and Lisa M. Rockoff, McDonnell Douglas Space Systems Co. As the US expands its presence in space, NASA/DOD require- ments to assemble, operate, and maintain facilities in the vacuum of space will grow. Space station freedom (SSF) studies have shown that projected requirements for extravehicular activity (EVA) are significantly greater than the capabilities presently planned. Although the SSF design is currently being restructured by NASA with the intent of relieving its requirements for EVA, the limited availability of EVA crew time is still a critical and lim- iting resource to future growth and expansion. This paper details approaches to advancing extravehicular capability through EVA tools such as telerobotics and free-flyers to ensure the feasibility of assembly and maintenance of large space structures. We detail these approaches through results from aerobrake and propellant tank farm neutral buoyancy testing undertaken by McDonnell Douglas Space Systems Company (MDSSC) Inde- pendent Research and Development (IRAD). The testing com- bined EVA and telerobotics in neutral buoyancy to best enhance EVA capability. The combination of EVA and telerobotics will have a signifi- cant impact on the completion of NASA on-orbit objectives. The propellant tank farm and aerobrake testbed used provide a unique environment for this combination, and test results have direct application to SSF, SSF evolution, and space exploration initiative mission development. 911531. Applied ethological study of astronaut behavior dur- ing EVA simulations with a wet suit prototype. C. Tafforin, UPS; and L. DeCramer, CNES. The French Space Agency (CNES) has developed a "wet" suit based on the Soviet flight suit. This concept, which requires a breathing system for underwater tests, has been fully validated by a replay of a real French-Soviet EVA space operation. The proto- type offers the main advantage of placing both the astronaut and the suit in neutral buoyancy during EVA training. The man-machine interfaces were checked during several donning-doffing operations in simulations of weightlessness both in water and in parabolic flights. These experiments were ana- lyzed from an ethological point of view to correlate the mechani- cal constraints of the suit with human motor performance. The ethological approach is characterized by the observation, description and quantification of the astronaut's behaviour when performing various tasks. Video recordings are made of his motor activity (orientation, movement and posture) in real or experimental situations such as water immersion or parabolic flights. The method consists of dividing the spontaneous body mobility into motor acts, listing them, and determining their occurrence frequency and sequential patterns. The following are examples of findings from our data. In para- bolic flights, the diversification of orientations, regularity of motor patterns, decreased number of motor acts and minimal use of spatial volume for the donning/doffing of the EVA suit could be taken as behavioral indicators of a high level of performance by the astronauts. In water immersion, for the same task, the ori- entations and movements were less varied, the motor activity was more stereotyped and the subject used the water resistance for better body stability. In such a way, applied ethology is an original tool for analyzing and quantifying human activities in space. 911532. Colours: from theory to actual selection an example of application to Columbus attached laboratory interior architec- tural design. Fabiana Bobba , David Antonelli , and Enrico Gaia , Alenia Spazio S. p. A. One of the issues that extended spaceflight raises is the provi- sion to the crew of a living environment not only safe but also comfortable and pleasant, two features which also enhance crew productivity. Interior design and decor are understood to gain more rele- vance as mission duration increases. This means that colour the- ory application to the actual space system configuration becomes a fundamental step. Obviously, two other relevant variables are the impact of the overall environment (e.g., illumination, structural design, other decorative techniques adopted) and the personal taste, mediated by his own experience, of the designer. The presented work started from a brief review of the general prinicples pertaining to colour theory, analyzing commonly accepted systems used to categorize and individualize colours with an unambiguous procedure, to exploit the theory as an exact, almost mathematical, tool. Then, the work deeply analyzed Columbus Attached Labora- tory configuration, scanning it on a topological basis, that is, con- sidering different features and functions of each element. All the elements were interrelated stating the existence of a relationship between each other from the colour viewpoint. When the relationship was found to exist, further analysis of reciprocal colour characteristics (e.g., hue, chroma) was per- formed. The result was applied to propose a palette of colours for inte- rior surfaces, mediating this process through the adoption of the general groundrules for selection of colours in space systems com- ing from previous studies. On this basis, the authors selected a list of seven colours and applied them to the Columbus APM habitability mock-up. The assessment of their validity, through objective and subjective evaluations on the mock-up, was the next step and the final result presented in this work is the approach utilized for these tests. 1991 SAE Transactions Section 1 911533. Effects on man of 46-day life in a confined space at normal pressure. E. Radziszewski, CERTSM-DCN. Six volunteers were selected and submitted at regular intervals throughout a 46-day control experiment in a climatic chamber to a large number of biological investigations (respiratory function, acid-base balance, circulatory function, biochemical determina- tions on blood and urine specimens) as well as psychomotor tests. The results obtained clearly indicate that two kinds of adapta- tion occur: the first occurring during the first 2-3 days of confine- ment essentially marked by a significant increase of urinary vol- 180</page><page sequence="180">911533-911540 ume and electrolyte output; and the second, throughout the experiment mainly consists of a slight and progressive decrease of red blood cell count and plasma potassium. Other parameter changes were well within range of the mea- suring techniques, accuracy and physiological background; except for urinary calcium output which still remained elevated. Finally, confinement failed to induce any significant degrada- tion in psychomotor performances in spite of a sensation of fatigue. Such a control experiment provides precise determination of the role played by confinement alone in the observed biological variations during submarine and space missions. 1991 SAE Transactions Section 1 911534. Simulation in a polar environment for a space station. Jean Louis Etienne, Océan Polaire ; Jacques Collet, European Space Agency; and H. Ursin, Physiological Psychology Dept., Uni- versity of Bergen. The long-duration space missions planned for the end of this century will involve both physiological and psychological prob- lems for the crew who will fly them. To increase expertise in these associated disciplines, we have proposed to study human behaviour in environments that are similar from a psychological viewpoint. In 1989-90, a planned crossing of the antarctic by a six-man international team therefore offered ESA a unique opportunity to observe the psychological problems that can occur during an international expedition involving prolonged isolation in a hostile environment. To develop such a program on a bigger scale, we propose to repeat, one century after this historical venture, the two years drift of F. Nansen on board the Fram among the pack-ice of the arctic. This venture will provide the ideal conditions to develop the concept of "testbed" for Mars missions. 911536. Review of french cosmonauts training aspects related to activities in mir station environment. Nadine Laval, ESA! CNES. This paper will introduce the aspects of French cosmonauts training related to crew operations and activities in the MIR sta- tion environment. It will describe the operations environment which had been experienced by the cosmonauts during the course of training and on-board activities. This paper reviews also to some extent training aspects of specific programmes like space shuttle/spacelab and compares relevant phases of their training requirements. 1991 SAE Transactions Section 1 911537. (SP-873) The use of membranes in life support sys- tems for long-duration space missions. S. B. McCray, R. J. Ray, and D. D. Newbold, Bend Research, Inc. For long-duration space missions, the mass of the initial stock of supplies (e.g., food, water, air, spare parts) must be limited and the number of items that require resupply during the mission must be minimized. Given these constraints, regenerative envi- ronmental control and life support systems (ECLSS) are a neces- sity. Membrane processes are ideal for regenerable ECLSS because membrane processes 1) operate reliably for long periods, 2) are simple to repair and maintain, and 3) do not require con- sumable or expendable materials. In this paper, the uses of membranes in a regenerable ECLSS are reviewed. System designs and experimental data are pres- ented on the use of membranes for the purification and recycling of water (e.g., the treatment of hygiene water, urine, humidity condensate and phase-change distillate) and for the treatment and purification of air (e.g., removal of water vapor and carbon dioxide). 911538. (SP-873) Development of a proton-exchange mem- brane electromechanical reclaimed water post-treatment system. Lamine Kaba and G. Duncan Hitchens, Texas A&amp;M Univ.; Oliver J. Murphy, Lynntech, Inc.; and C. Verostko, NASA Johnson Space Center. A single cell electrochemical reactor that utilizes a proton exchange membrane (PEM) as a solid electrolyte is being investi- gated and developed at Texas A&amp;M University for post- treatment of reclaimed waters with low or negligible electrolyte content. Post-treatment is a final polishing of reclaimed waste waters prior to reuse and constitutes removing organic impurities at levels as high as 100 ppm to &gt;500 ppb total organic carbon (TOC) content and provides disinfection. The system does not utilize or produce either expendable hardware components or chemicals and has no moving parts. This paper discusses a single cell reactor concept; test system design; the role of the proton exchange membrane; and the principle of organic impurity oxi- dation at PEM interfacial reaction zones. The fabrication perfor- mance evaluation; design and sizing of a prototype system are discussed. Test data and kinetic analysis are presented. The feasi- bility and application for water reclamation processes in con- trolled ecological environments (e.g., lunar/Mars habitats) are also presented. Test results show that the electrochemical single cell reactor provides effective post-treatment. 1991 SAE Transactions Section 1 911539. (SP-873) Catalytic oxidation for treatment of ECLSS and PMMS waste streams. James R. Akse and Clifford D. Jolly, Umpqua Research Co. The sorption and ion exchange water reclamation technolo- gies used to treat the waste streams in the environmental control and life support system (ECLSS) and process materials manage- ment system (PMMS) are ineffected for removal of low molecu- lar weight, polar organic contaminants which do not have ionized forms. These include likley waste stream constituents such as methanol, ethanol, isopropanol, and acetone. Catalytic oxidation of these compounds in oxygen saturated water at moderate tem- peratures (125 to 160 C) provides a reliable, simple, and inexpen- svie way to eliminate these contaminants. By the suitable choice of catalysts, these species can be converted to carbon dioxide and water or to species which can be removed effectively by sorbents and ion exchange resins. The operation requirements of the base- line system are oxygen and heat. Since much of the heat is recov- ered, the energy use of the technology is very low. In the current gravity independent configuration, membrane oxygen saturators and carbon dioxide degassing units deliver the oxygen and remove the reaction byproducts. This prototype system has the demonstrated capability to lower 50 ppm ethanol levels to the part per billion level after catalyst contact times of 1 to 3 minutes. In addition, at slightly longer contact times a solution containing alcohols and acetone can be oxidized lowering these trace con- taminants from 34 ppm to less than 500 ppb. Similar catalysts have also shown effectiveness at removing chlorinated organics such as chloroform and trichloroethylene from urine distillates pretreated with oxidizing compounds. 1991 SAE Transactions Section 1 911540. (SP-873) Airborne trace organic contaminant removal using thermally regenerable multi-media layered sorbents. James E. Atwater and John T. Holtsnider, Umpqua Research Co. A cyclic two-step process is described which forms the basis for a simple and highly efficient air purification technology. Low molecular weight organic vapors are removed from contami- nated airstreams by passage through an optimized sequence of sorbent media layers. The contaminant loaded sorbents are sub- sequently regenerated by thermal desorption into a low volume inert gas environment. A mixture of airborne organic contami- nants consisting of acetone, 2-butanone, ethyl acetate, Freon-113 and methyl chloroform has been quantitatively removed from breathing quality air using this technique. The airborne concen- trations of all contaminants have been reduced from initial space- craft maximum allowable concentration (SMAC) levels to below the analytical limits of detection. No change in sorption effi- 181</page><page sequence="181">911540-911546 ciency was observed through multiple cycles of contaminant loading and sorbent regeneration via thermal desorption. 1991 SAE Transactions Section 1 911541. (SP-873) Sabatier carbon dioxide reduction system for long-duration manned space application. Hal J. Strumpf and C. Y. Chin , AiResearch Los Angeles Div., Allied-Signal Aerospace Co.; and George R. Lester and Stephen T. Homeyer, Allied-Signal Research and Technology. A carbon dioxide reduction system is being developed for long-duration manned space missions. The system incorporates a Sabatier methanation reactor, utilizing previously developed catalyst materials, and a hollow fiber membrane unit to separate the products of reaction. Heat produced by the exothermic Saba- tier reaction is absorbed by an air stream, which also regulates the reactor temperature to maximize yield. This absorbed heat can be utilized elsewhere in the carbon dioxide management system to reduce power requirements. The Sabatier process combines carbon dioxide and hydrogen to form methane and water. In a manned space environment, the water is then either electrolyzed to form oxygen for breathing and hydrogen to drive the reaction, or recycled to the potable water system. A computer-based performance model using finite elements has been developed to evaluate reactor design and catalyst perfor- mance. Laboratory testing of the Sabatier reaction using various catalyst materials is ongoing, with preliminary results reported in this paper. 1 991 SAE Transactions Section 1 911542. Requirements for ECLSS simulation software. R. Schricke and R. Simon, Dornier GmbH; and M. Novara, ESA/ ESTEC. The environmental control and life support (ECLS) equip- ment is one of the most sensitive subsystems aboard a manned spacecraft and the ECLSS envisaged for oncoming European pro- grams such as Columbus or Hermes will be very complex in nature. Its development relies on the intense use of computer software during all phases of design and operations. A modern ECLS system consists of a variety of components and assemblies and contains a number of loop-type structures where components mutually influence each other. The computer software required to support the ECLSS engi- neer can be categorised in two groups: 'design software* is mainly employed on component and assembly level and aids the engi- neer in reaching the required design point; and 'simulation soft- ware* is rather employed on subsystem and system level and allows to analyse a given lay-out or design and to obtain perfor- mance data for a wide range of conditions. With respect to the second type of software one can think of a simulation tool with a broad range of application which could be used for such tasks as design verification, off design analysis, investigation of potential failure scenarios, parameter studies, etc. The usefulness of such simulation software will be measured by its ability to support engineers in their day-to-day work. This paper is an attempt to compile a set of requirements concerning the analytical and technical capabilities, user friendliness, flexi- bility, interfacing capability to other simulation software, graph- ics, and the pre-and postprocessing features. 1991 SAE Transactions Section 1 911543. ECOSIM - An environmental control simulation software. R. Pérez and V. Torroglosa, Empresarios Agrupados ; and A. Lebru and C. Donninger, ESA/ESTEC. This paper discusses the capabilities of the ECOSIM software which is currently under development for the European Space Agency. This software is primarily intended to simulate environ- mental control and life support (ECLS) systems. It may be also customised to the simulation of passive and active thermal con- trol systems, power systems, and more generally any system which can be described as a set of interconnected physical compo- nents. ECOSIM shall provide a powerful continuous simulation language, a graphical user interface and a library of ECLSS cus- tom-made components. After a brief overview of the major aims of the development, the software is discussed from its main aspects, the language and its mathematical formalism, the graphical user interface, and the ECLS systems customisation for representing the physical, chem- ical, and biological processes of interest. Examples are provided aiming at enhancing the understanding of the critical aspects of the language and the user interface. The overall architectural design of the software is also discussed. ECOSIM version 1 - to be released in 1992 - is described in depth: it will provide capabilities for simulating air management systems of the degree of complexity encountered in the Hermes and Columbus projects. 911545. FHTS - Active thermal control analyser, verification, validation and upgrade. C. J. Kirtley, GEC ALSTHOM ; Y. Boil- lot, European Space Agency; and A. Lebru, ESA/ESTEC. FHTS is a major extension to the existing ESATAN thermal analyser. It is capable of carrying out one dimensional steady state or transient analysis, solving for pressure, temperature and mass flow rate, for single or two phase loops. This paper begins by giving an overview of the capabilities of FHTS and outlines the stringent quality assurance standards adhered to during its development. The coding standards ensure software verification during its development via module testing and the development of a test suite. Further verification of both the single phase and two phase capability has already been carried out by comparison against Retran, a well established package used throughout the nuclear industry. An outline of the results from this work and conclusions drawn is given. Although limited in scope the work proved extremely valuable. A first step in validating FHTS has been carried out by ESA in 1990 for the single phase package by comparing experimental data against simulated results. To achieve this goal, the hybrid radiator under development in the frame of the Columbus pro- gram has been used. The experimental data was taken from the final thermal vacuum test which took place at Estec in March 1990. The validation work proved conclusive. An experimental two phase test loop has been developed and results from this are expected early 1991. Within a coming upgrade validation of the two phase routines is to be carried out using these results as a datum. Pressure from industry prompted a review of the numerical treatment of the algorithms within FHTS with a view of improv- ing the speed of the software. Excellent results from this first pass of efficiency improvements have been achieved and a resume of this is given. The first major upgrade of the software has just begun and this paper concludes by giving a detailed account of the improve- ments to be made and the new facilities to be provided. 911546. Modelling approach for the thermal/environmental system of the Columbus attached pressurised module. R. Veneri, Aeritalia Space Systems Group; and Vincenzo Pugliese, Eugenio Garioli, and Cesare Lobascio, Alenia Spazio S.p.A. The thermal/environmental control system (T/ECS) of the Columbus attached pressurised module (APM) requires exten- sive modelling to assess the overall system performance and interface compatibility, and to verify the design capability of the specific functions of the thermal control system (TCS) and envi- ronmental control and life support system (ECLSS). The thermal/environmental design of APM relies on TCS active (water loop) and passive thermal control functions, while ECLSS provides racks air cooling and cabin temperature and humidity control. 182</page><page sequence="182">911546-911553 The selected modelling approach uses an integrated overall thermal mathematical model together with a set of additional TMM's for detailed tasks. The overall TMM (up to 900 nodes, written in ESATAN to exploit its special modularity features) allows the element thermal balance verification and the provi- sion of the sink and interface temperatures for the equipment thermal design. Other available models are the simplified active TMM (up to 150 nodes, written in ESACAP and dedicated to parametric and trade-off analyses) and the local thermo- hydraulic models (up to 250 nodes each, written in ESATAN- FHTS and dedicated to hydraulic performance verification). Specific module enclosures, e.g. racks and subfloor, require dedicated modelling, for which the use of special-purpose ther- mofluid-dynamic software, like Phoenix, is foreseen. Moreover, each subsystem provides its own detailed thermal/hydraulic model. An overview of the Columbus APM thermal models is provided, discussing modelling and software characteristics. 911548. (SP-874) Performance characterization of activated carbon and oxidation catalyst for gaseous trace contaminant con- trol. M. I. Leban, E. H. Kawasaki, and G. P. Conine, Lockheed Missiles and Space Co., Inc. Performance characteristics of Engelhard 0.5% palladium on alumina catalyst for oxidizing ppm levels of methane in air were studied with catalyst bed temperatures ranging from 290 to 400°C. Methane oxidation efficiencies resulted in values from 40% to 99%. Barnebey-Sutcliffe type AC activated carbon, untreated and treated with ortho-phosphoric acid (up to 2 milli- moles per gram weight of carbon) were characterized by measur- ing its physical and chemical adsorption capacity for n-butane, m-xylene, dichlorodifluoromethane (freon 12), and ammonia in dry air (-69°C dew point). 911549. (SP-874) An analysis of urine pretreatment methods for use on space station freedom. Stanley G. Howard and Janie H. Miernik, Huntsville Div., Boeing Aerospace and Electronics. Water reclamation from human urine will be the basis of the closed loop water recovery management (WRM) system on space station freedom (SSF). Pretreatment is necessary to collect and process urine, fix and prevent ammonia formation, inhibit microbial growth and prevent solids precipitation. Pretreatment must be accomplished immediately upon collection to prevent damage to urine collection and handling equipment. Currently, a chemical injection scheme is an integral part of the SSF urinal design. The reagents used will be based on compatibility with uri- nal and urine processor components, performance of necessary pretreatment functions, quality of reclaimed water, resupply costs and development risks. These factors are compared for vari- ous pretreatment methods currently under consideration for use on SSF. 911550. (SP-874) Preliminary ECLSS waste water model. R. Glenn Shaw, John K. Hayase, and Kevin Alexander, Boeing Aero- space Co.; and Donald L. Carter, and Donald W. Holder, Jr., NASA Marshall Space Flight Center. A preliminary waste water model for input to the space station freedom (SSF) environmental control and life support system (ECLSS) water processor (WP) has been generated for design pur- poses. Data has been compiled from various ECLSS tests and flight sample analyses. A discussion of the characterization of the waste streams comprising the model is presented, along with a discussion of the waste water model and the rationale for the inclusion of contaminants in their respective concentrations. The major objective is to establish a methodology for the develop- ment of a waste water model and to present the current state of that model. 1991 SAE Transactions Section 1 911551. (SP-874) Functional description of the ion exchange and sorbent media used in the ECLSS water processor unibeds. Clarence D. Colley, Boeing Aerospace and Electronics. This paper reviews some of the historical data and background surrounding the evolution and development of the multifiltra- tion unibeds utilized in the ECLSS WRM water processors. Data will be presented illustrating some of the problem areas associ- ated with previous unibed designs and some of the progress being made toward development of flight hardware used in the treat- ment of water for crew use aboard space station freedom (SSF). The ECLSS water recovery management system (WRM) supplies water for the crew and for scientific experimentation. Specific problem areas will be discussed with recommendations that will avoid some of the pitfalls that may be encountered in design. 911552. (SP-874) Advanced design and testing of the ultrapure water system for space station freedom. Gregory F. Heck, D. Tim Lauderdale, R. Craig Seabrook, and Richard M. Hamner, Tele- dyne Brown Engrg. The technology available for the production of high purity water in a microgravity environment is applied to a water recla- mation and purification system for the laboratory module of space station freedom. The system is required to remove a wide range of contaminants from water, and therefore, a staged system, which uses a number of purification techniques in series, is neces- sary. The ultrapure water system (UPWS) design has been in development for over four years. Initial system concepts relied heavily on distillation, followed by ion exchange and adsorption. Recent efforts have focused on addressing the limitations of a dis- tillation-based system. Substituting a combination of chemical oxidation and continuous deionization for the distillation step appears to be viable. A development test program has been formulated which would prove system feasibility, refine the design concept, and provide data for system simulation. The test program proposes a "breadboard" pilot plant which would be comprised of compo- nents that are candidates for inclusion in the flight system. Other considerations, such as weight, power consumption, volume occupied, materials of construction, data channels required, methods of bioburden control, safety, and methods of handling generated waste are crucial to the development of the optimum design. These factors are balanced against the technol- ogy available which lends itself to the microgravity and resource constraints of space station freedom, and conclusions are drawn relative to the best combination of components to comprise an advanced flight system. 1991 SAE Transactions Section 1 911553. (SP-874) Space station hygiene water reclamation by multiflltration. David F. Putnam, Umpqua Research Co.; Terri Van Pelt, Hamilton Standard; and William F. Michalek, Ump- qua Research, Inc. The baseline hygiene water reclamation system for space sta- tion freedom has been changed from reverse osmosis with multi- filtration post-treatment to stand-alone multiflltration. The mul- tiflltration concept offers increased system reliability, a decrease in power consumption, and essentially 100% water recovery. Multiflltration is based on well documented sorption technol- ogy for removal of contaminant species. System complexity is minimal. Moving parts are limited to one pump and simple valv- ing. Reliable microbial control is obtained by heat sterilization and by the use of iodine as a bactericide. Iodine addition is accomplished in the unibeds with an iodinated resin which is also used in the microbial check valve (MCV). Microbial check valves have proven reliable and effective on board the space shuttle since the beginning of the shuttle program. Power consumption is primarily attributed to heat steriliza- tion. The energy required for the pump and controls is relatively low. 183</page><page sequence="183">911553-911559 This paper presents an overview of the multifiltration hygiene subsystem and its requirements, the waste water sources, and the multifiltration unibed technology. 911554. (SP-874) Thermal pretreatment of waste hygiene water. Frank C. Garmon and Robert K. Ames, Umpqua Research Co. The thermal pretreatment of waste hygiene water was investi- gated as an approach to reduce the amount of energy required to maintain overall system microbial control. The study was con- ducted in two phases. The laboratory phase was a series of experi- ments to quantify the degree of microbial population reduction obtained when hygiene waste water and humidity condensate are heated through various thermal cycles. The laboratory phase also included inoculation of the combined wastewater with a thermo- philic bacteria to provide a "worst-case" challenge of the thermal cycle being tested. The large scale system phase determined biofilm formation on the surfaces of a variety of materials with and without thermal cycling. Except for survival of the challenge thermophile and some naturally present thermophiles, thermal treatment above 85°C was successful in eradication of the microbial population in the combined hygiene wastewater and formed biofilms. It was also noted that some naturally occurring thermophiles multiplied at temperatures below 45°C. 911555. The behavior of cryogenic phase change materials used for 1R sensor thermal control in space. Fred Edelstein, Grumman Space Systems Div., Grumman Corp. A successful thermal storage system, useful in the 115 K to 120 K temperature range, has been designed and demonstrated in a typical IR sensor satelite environment. Because of its high heat of fusion, chemical stability, compatibility with aluminum, and its low room temperature vapor pressure, 2-methylpentane (2-MP) appeared to be the best phase change material (PCM) in this temperature range. The pure material, however, exhibited severe supercooling that depresses the temperature at which freezing occurs by as much as 30 K below its normal 119.3 K freeze point, thereby making it totally unsuitable. Other hydro- carbons tested exhibited the same behavior. An extensive investi- gation found that supercooling was significantly reduced with the addition of 3% acetone which acts as a nucleation catalyst that aids crystallization. Repeated freeze/thaw cycling during orbital simulation testing in a vacuum environment showed supercool- ing to be essentially eliminated resulting in stable, predictable operation. The work described here can be applied to thermal storage systems operating at lower temperatures where supercool- ing is likely to occur. 1991 SAE Transactions Section 1 911556. Microgravity two-phase flow experiment and test results. Wayne S. Hill, Foster-Miller, Inc.; and Frederick R. Best, Texas A&amp;M Univ. A two-phase flow system was tested in the NASA KC-135 reduced gravity test facility. Its innovative flow configuration results in an unusual ease of control and significantly reduced power and heat rejection requirements, while permitting flow regimes, pressure drops, and boiling and condensing heat transfer to be examined. Numerous desgin features were incorporated that minimize the impact of the KC-135 environment on system condition. Among other results, flight testing indicates no signifi- cant effect of gravity on pressure drop for the conditions exam- ined, and that many conditions can be examined definitively only in the long-term reduced gravity afforded by a space experi- ment. 911557. Advanced thermal control system for a programmable multizone crystal growth furnace. John Klein, Victor Curr eri, and Janine DuBois, Space and Electronics Div., Grumman Corp.; and Dave Larson, Grumman Corp. A programmable, 24 independent-zone, computer-controlled furnace and control system have been developed for control of the thermal environment and process during crystal growth. The furnace and control system were designed to achieve capabilities which are beyond the state-of-the-art for crystal growth furnaces and control systems. New control system hardware, software, and power conversion techniques were developed to provide precise, accurate thermal control. New user interface software was devel- oped to provide flexibility and ease of use for setting the crystal growth process steps and operating parameters and monitoring the crystal growth process progress. A data acquisition system was developed to provide in-depth evaluation of system perfor- mance during development and for use by crystal growth scien- tists developing new advanced crystal growth techniques. The system has demonstrated: extremely precise temperature control (±0.3°C) for all 24 zones during crystal growth at temperatures up to 1250°C; thermal reconfiguration and thermal profile move- ment in the furnace using control software; unique power condi- tioning and control system; and a capability for detailed flexible programming of process steps. The crystal growth furnace, con- trol system, user interface, and thermal performance are pres- ented herein. 911558. Development of a recirculation ejector for a cryogenic heat sink for ECLSS. James F. Fort and Michael J. Heldmann, Hamilton Standard Div., United Technologies Corp. In the development of advanced thermal control systems for use in hydrogen-powered space vehicles, utilization of the on- board hydrogen fuel as a heat sink for equipment cooling has many advantages. There are, however, significant challenges pre- venting the cryogenic temperatures of the stored fuel from caus- ing heat transport fluid freezing. A shell and tube heat exchanger was developed to transfer heat from an ECLSS thermal control coolant loop to the cryogenic hydrogen fuel. To mitigate the potential for coolant freezing, it was necessary to recycle hydro- gen from the heat exchanger outlet back to the inlet to moderate heat exchanger inlet temperatures. A recycle compressor could have been used with penalties in weight and reliability due to its complexity. A superior solution was to use an ejector which has no moving parts, and uses the pressure head of the incoming hydrogen to develop the necessary pumping head and transport the hydrogen through the heat exchanger. This paper will present the design, development and testing of a recirculating ejector for a cryogenic heat sink for ECLSS. 1991 SAE Transactions Section 1 911559. Coldplate temperature regulation using fuzzy logic control. Randall Ushiyama and Hallie Waiden, AiResearch Los Angeles Div., Allied-Signal Aerospace Co. An investigation of a fuzzy logic control application for cold plate regulation was initiated, and simulation results were gener- ated. A nonlinear, one-way, flow control valve was regulated using a fuzzy logic control methodology, and its performance was compared here to the more traditional proportional integral derivative (PID) control under a variety of different plant distur- bance conditions. Sensitivity to plant parameter variations was assessed. The fuzzy logic controller for the flow-control valve operates in a "bang-bang" mode. This implies simpler, lower-cost, and more reliable drives/electronics. Simulation results show that a fuzzy logic controller can achieve performance as good or better than that of traditional control systems. Temperature control systems for long-duration space mis- sions will require either improved robustness or system recon- figuration to prevent component degradation. Fuzzy logic con- 184</page><page sequence="184">911559-911570 trollers may provide this added measure of performance, while reducing crew workload. 1991 SAE Transactions Section 1 911561. Flight equipment supporting metabolic experiments on SLS-1. Carolyn S. Leach , NASA Johnson Space Center. Five experiments in different aspects of human metabolism will be performed on spacelab life sciences-1. Nine items of equipment from the Life Sciences Laboratory Equipment inven- tory will be used: the rack-mounted centrifuge, hematocrit centri- fuge, low-gravity centrifuge, body mass measurement device, urine monitoring system, Spacelab refrigerator/freezer, orbiter refrigerator, in-flight blood collection system, and pocket voice recorder. In addition, each experiment will require some special- ized equipment such as incubators and culture blocks for an immunology experiment and tracers for a fluid and electrolyte experiment and a hematology experiment. The equipment for these experiments has been developed over many years, in some cases since the skylab program in the early 1970s, and has been certified for use on the space shuttle. 1991 SAE Transactions Section 1 911562. A quantitative method for studying human arterial baroreflexes. Dwain L. Eckberg and Janice M. Fritsch, Medical College of Virginia; and Ross L. Goble , Engineering Development Lab., Inc. We describe a new system that delivers precise, stereotyped pressure changes to the human neck and elicits neurally- mediated heart rate changes. The centerpiece of this system is a silastic chamber that is strapped to the anterior neck. This chamber is connected to a stepping-motor controlled bellows assembly. A strain-gauge transducer measures the intensity of pressure changes. The entire system is controlled by microprocessors, and both stimuli and responses are displayed on a digital oscilloscope. The end-product of this system is a reproducible baroreceptor stimulus-cardiac response relation that can be recorded rapidly and safely in astronauts in space. 1991 SAE Transactions Section 1 911563. Cardiovascular adaptation to O-G (experiment 294): instrumentation for invasive and non-invasive studies. Jay C. Buckey and Lynda D. Lane, University of Texas Southwestern ; Donald E. Watenpaugh, NASA Ames Research Center; and Ben- jamin D. Levine, Willie E. Moore, F. Andrew Gaffney, and C. Gunnar Blomqvist, University of Texas Southwestern. Many astronauts returning from space have difficulties regu- lating blood pressure, some to the point of fainting during quiet standing. Experiment 294 was designed to study this and other cardiovascular effects of adaptation to microgravity and to understand the mechanisms behind it. To accomplish this several cardiovascular variables had to be measured accurately. Heart rate, blood pressure, cardiac output (blood pumped by the heart each minute), stroke volume (blood pumped by the heart with each beat), limb flow, limb compliance, heart size and central venous pressure all had to be recorded during various stresses to understand fully the adaptation to space and the readaptation to earth's gravity. Numerous pieces of equipment were used. Some were purpose-built for the spacelab mission and others were derived from commercial hardware. Developing spaceflight hardware is challenging and costly, but can lead to significant new information in the unique environment of space. 1991 SAE Transactions Section 1 911565. Testing pulmonary function in spacelab. Harold J. B. Guy, G. K. Prisk, and J. B. West, University of California San Diego. A study of lung function in microgravity, on the spacelab life sciences 1 mission will provide unique data. It should provide new insights into effects of normal gravitation on human lung function. It should also provide good information as to the effects of microgravity induced fluid shifts on the lung, and the extent of lung volume reduction that is predictable from the known effects of gravity on thoracic shape. The recent observation of reduced blood oxygen content in cosmonauts makes this new study especially timely. There is a constant risk of injury to the lung in space vehicles, from depressurization, and the inhalation of gases, vapors, and aerosols. Measurement of lung function in space crews has been delayed for decades. It is scheduled to occur, with increasing frequency, as plans for long duration missions advance. 911566. Spacelab neurovestibular hardware. Laurence R. Young, Charles M. Oman, and William F. Mayer, Massachusetts Institute of Technology. A set of devices for measurement of human balance orienta- tion and eye movements in weightlessness was developed for neurovestibular experiments on spacelab. The experiments involve astronaut motion, limb position changes, and moving visual fields. Measurements are made of eye movements, muscu- lar activity and orientation perception. 911567. Performance of the Research Animal Holding Facility (RAHF) and general purpose work station (GPWS) and other hardware in the microgravity environment. Robert P. Hogan and Bonnie P. Dalton, NASA Ames Research Center. This paper discusses the performance of the Reseach Animal Holding Facility (RAHF) and general purpose work station (GPWS) plus other associated hardware during the recent flight of spacelab life sciences 1 (SLS-1). The RAHF was developed to provide proper housing (food, water, temperature control, light and waste management) for up to 24 rodents during flights on the spacelab. The GPWS was designed to contain particulates and toxic chemicals generated during plant and animal handling and dissection/fixation activities during space flights. A history of the hardware development involved as well as the redesign activities prior to the actual flight are discussed. 1991 SAE Transactions Section 1 911569.

The final preparation of the space shuttle orbiter for flight involves the loading of large quantities of hazardous propellants. Additionally, many pyro technically operated mechanical joints are armed and ready for flight. The personnel manning at the pad is minimized during these operations to reduce the risk. Upon completion of propellant loading, the flight crew must be boarded onto the vehicle which at this point has tremendous potential energy. Plans have been made to safely and quickly evacuate the crew should some unforeseen contigency occur. Both aided and unaided egress scenarios have been planned. Personnel protec- tive equipment is an important consideration to assure the high- est chance for survival. Rapid movement of personnel is enhanced by the use of the slidewire system and specially pre- pared armored personnel carriers. The end result, as will be dis- cussed in this paper, is a system that provides a reasonable chance of survival should an emergency occur during late countdown at the pad. 1991 SAE Transactions Section 1 911570. Shuttle abort landing site emergency medical services. David K. McKenas, System Contingency Support Office, Patrick Air Force Base ; and Richard T. Jennings, NASA Johnson Space Flight Center. Shuttle transoceanic abort landing (TAL) sites, located on the African coast and in Spain, reuqire an emergency medical capa- bility for astronauts who may be injured in an abort landing. The remote Aftrican TAL sites present unusual medical planning and logistical problems. 185</page><page sequence="185">911570-911577 Two broad options to meet the challenge of providing advanced emergency medical care at TAL sites were explored by the Department of Defense (DOD) and the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA). The first option considered using a modified surgical response team, and the second involved using physician/medical technician teams. The physician/ technician team concept proved the more cost-effective solution for providing medical support in these regions. Research on the logistics of blood procurement, blood refrigeration, power, air evacuation, and search and rescue (SAR) requirements led to the development of an effective TAL site astronaut medical support system. The system consists of on-scene stabilization by the med- ical personnel, and C-130 air evacuation to trauma centers and DOD tertiary medical centers in Europe. In summary, remote medical care planning requires attention to details far different from those encountered in the routine medical setting. The balance between on-site medical capability and cost-effectiveness is the primary determinant in planning and logistics. 911571. Astronaut recovery following bailout. George Phillips , United States Air Force. Following the Challenger accident, the President's Commis- sion recommended that NASA develop a crew escape system for use during gliding flight. This bailout capability was developed and DDMS was asked to develop a plan to rescue the astronauts following a bailout from the orbiter. METHODS: The plan devel- oped uses a combination of fixed wing aircraft, helicopters, ships, motorized rafts and pararescue specialists. Following a bailout the fixed wing aircraft deploy the motorized rafts and pararescue specialists via parachute to the vicinity of the astronauts. Parares- cue specialists then use the rafts to recover the astronauts and proceed to a common point. Then, either helicopters, if available, or ships of opportunity recover the astronauts and pararescue specialists. RESULTS: The plan was validated during two full scale open ocean exercises and has been in place to support all flights since the Challenger accident. CONCLUSIONS: The recovery plan developed meets all the requirements established by NASA for recovery of the astronauts following a contingency that requires them to bailout. 911573. KSC off-runway contingency operation - Mode 7. Arthur Maples and Donald F. Doerr, NASA Kennedy Space Cen- ter. The possibility of a mishap during a space shuttle landing at Kennedy Space Center (KSC) dictates the need to plans to rescue astronauts from areas other than the shuttle landing facility (SLF). All shuttle landings are unpowered, gliding flight maneu- vers, and a deviation from the planned flight profile could result in a shuttle landing or crashing somewhere other than the SLF runway. The geography of the Kennedy Space Center makes helicopter airlifting the only universal means of transportation for the res- cue crew. This rescue crew is composed of KSC contractor fire- rescuemen who would ride to the crash scene on USAF HH-3 hel- icopters. These crews are provided with personal protective suits and training in shallow water, swamp, and dry land rescues. They aid the egress of the crew to a safe area for helicopter pickup and subsequent triage and medevac. 911574. Simulation of extra-vehicular activity (EVA) self res- cue. Adam Brody , Ames Research Center ; Rick Jacoby, Sterling Software; and Stephen R. Ellis , NASA Ames Research Center. Safety has always been an important issue in the United States space program. One area of particular concern, especially since the Challenger accident, is crew rescue. While much attention has been given to crew rescue during launch and landing, interest in rescuing a stranded EVA crewperson is only beginning to increase now. Although there were orbital EVAs in the Gemini and Apollo programs, they were of short duration, and total excursion ranges were small so reattachment of a safety tether was not required. With maintenance of a piece of real estate as large as space station freedom, astronauts will have to undo and reattach their tethers to reach remote locations. The increasing number of EVAs in the future also elevates the probability of a tether breaking. A mecha- nism for recovering from a crew separation needs to be deter- mined to prevent a life being lost on-orbit. 1991 SAE Transactions Section 1 911575. (SP-872) European space suit design concept verifica- tion.^. Ingemar Skoog, Dornier GmbH ; and Y. Ollivier, Dassault Aviation. The technology development work carried out within the framework of the European EVA system predevelopment activi- ties and complemented with additional analyses and trades have resulted in an improved technical reference concept for the prep- aration of the phase C/D activities. The results of the technology breadboard model testing have been used to verify or alter the overall space suit design concept. Hardware have been manufactured and tested in the areas of: 1) glove breadboard at the nominal suit pressure of 500 hPa; 2) roll- ing convolute shoulder joint bending performance; 3) thermal testing of arm thermal micrometeoroid protection; 4) elbow soft joint mechanical evaluation; 5) seals and bearings performance as for torques and tightness; 6) oxygen high pressure regulators/ valves performance characteristics; 7) sublimator heat removal and porous plate performance; 8) CO2 removal performance in pure oxygen at lower pressures; 9) integrated fan-pump- separator; 10) optimum design and crew comfort of biomedial sensors; and 11) voice processing for optimized crew perfor- mance. This paper presents an overview of the result of the EVA tech- nology development programme and the implications on the ref- erence concept. The latest design status of the European EVA sys- tem space suit concept in the frame of the predevelopment work for the European Space Agency (ESA) is also presented. 911576. (SP-872) Technology for an EVA fan-pump-scparator. S. Klingele and H. Funke, Dornier GmbH; V. Boitel and B. Mer- chie, Technofan ; and Johannes Witt, European Space Agency. In the frame of ESA's basic technology research programme an integrated fan-pump-separator (FPS) unit, for the European EVA space suit system, was developed up to breadboard level. The development was carried out by Technofan (F) as subcon- tractor to Dornier (D) under contract of the European Space Agency. Concept trade-offs and design definition confirmed the advan- tages in power, mass and volume of integrating all three functions into a single unit. The unit is driven by one common brushless DC motor. The performance requirements for the three basic functions (oxygen circulation, coolant water circulation and water separation) were derived from the system layout of the life support system for the European EVA space suit. The separate functional units were comprehensively tested in preliminary development tests. Final assembly of the functional units led to an integrated breadboard, which was sucessfully tested. The paper describes the development approach, the concept selection, the design and the tests with their results. 911577. (SP-872) Development of sublimator technology for the European EVA space suit. P. Kremer, Nord-Micro Elektronik Feinmechanik AG; Johannes Witt, European Space Agency; and Christine Planert, Nord-Micro Elektronik Feinmechanik AG. Temperature and humidity control are important functions for the astronaut's comfort and safety in an EVA space suit. Sev- eral sources within the suit, like electrically powered devices, the CO2 removal system and the astronaut himself are permanently 186</page><page sequence="186">911577-911583 producing heat and humidity. Both have to be removed in order to prevent visor fogging and overheating of the astronaut. Heat from the European space suit will be dissipated by the physical process of water sublimation. At pressures lower than 6 hPa water will directly transform from ice into vapor. In the sub- limator this process will take place within a porous plate and will remove heat from both the oxygen ventilation loop and the cool- ing water loop. The sublimator thust consists of a porous plate with the feed- water distribution underneath and a liquid/gas heat exchanger part. A breadboard model has been fabricated from stainless steel and a new porous plate has been developed. Tests have been per- formed to demonstrate the technical feasibility of the design con- cept. This paper will present results obtained during manufacturing and test of the European sublimator breadboard. Special atten- tion will be given to experience with the new design features. 911578. (SP-872) Development of a PP CO2 sensor for the European space suit. Johannes Witt , European Space Agency ; and Klaus Ammann, Draegerwerk AG. A summary of an ESA/ESTEC sponsored technology research programme is given aiming at the development of a CO2 partial pressure sensor suitable for monitoring the PP CO2 inside the oxygen ventilation loop of the EVA life support module. At first, a trade-off of candidate sensor concepts is presented. As a result, the infrared optical sensor concept has been selected. In the frame of a discussion on basic facts of IR absorption the rationale for the selected configuration of the IR sensor is given. A breadboard model of the PP CO2 sensor together with a test set-up has been established. The sensor was subjected to a test programme consisting of two separate test periods. The main results are given. Finally, the findings are discussed in the light of the development of future flight hardware. 1991 SAE Transactions Section 1 911580. (SP-872) A design process for an interplanetary extra- vehicular activity system. Peter J. Wells , Space Station Program Support Div., Grumman. This paper describes a design process for an extravehicular system suitable for accomplishing a set of specific missions in an interplanetary environment. This process is based upon project management, system engineering, and strategic management concepts. The process is a sequential set of incremental actions which build upon prior activities in order to reach a design solu- tion. Each process step considers a specific goal, environmental influences, as well as the general mission. The paper first addresses the overall mission in order to produce a set of func- tional requirements for each of the major mission components. The extravehicular system is then developed via a similar process to satisfy those functional requirements. The end result of this process is an extravehicular system specifically tailored to accom- plish the mission. 911581. (SP-872) Impact of fault tolerance requirement for the European EVA system. E ink Myrseth, Richard Chase, and Johannes Witt, European Space Agency. A European extra-vehicular activity (EVA) system is being developed by the European Space Agency (ESA) as part of its Hermes programme, with the primary objective of providing a manned intervention capability for external servicing of the Columbus Free Flying Laboratory. The development phase started in 1988. A major design driver for the EVA system is the required level of failure tolerance, to ensure the achievement of sortie objectives and crew safety. The failure tolerance requirements placed on the EVA system may be summarised as follows: no single failure should result in sortie abort, and a safe return to the Hermes "safe-haven" should be possible following a second failure. This paper presents possible design solutions to this require- ment, in particular for life support and associated functions. The failure tolerance characteristics of existing American and Russian EVA systems are also examined for comparison. Although they were developed to satisfy similar failure tolerance requirements, differences in mission requirements, operational environment and development philosophy have resulted in differences in the implementation of failure tolerance. In this analysis, the relevant results of system engineering and technology development work during the initial phases of the European EVA system development are taken into account. 911582. Thermal synthesizer system: an integrated approach to spacecraft thermal analysis. Tim Panczak, Lockheed Missiles and Space Co., Inc.; Mark Welch, Lockheed Engrg. and Sciences Co.; Larry Fried, Lockheed Missiles and Space Co., Inc.; and Ste- ven Rickman, NASA Johnson Space Center. In order to meet the challenging thermal analysis needs of space station freedom and other proposed space exploration ini- tiative missions, a new generation of thermal analysis tools, uti- lizing the latest advances in user-interface design, software engi- neering approaches, graphics capability, CPU speed, and net- working technology will be needed. NASA Johnson Space Center has commissioned the development of the thermal synthesizer system (TSS) to meet these difficult analysis requirements. TSS is being developed by Lockheed Missiles and Space Company, Lockheed Engineering Sciences Company, and NASA Johnson Space Center. The system consists of integrated applications to perform: surface and solid modeling, radiation coupling, orbital analysis, characterization of the thermal radiation heating envi- ronment for a spacecraft in orbit or on a planet surface, conduc- tion network generation, two-phase flow modeling and analysis, temperature predicitions, and general purpose post-processing. While TSS is tailored for spacecraft thermal analysis, it may be used for any general purpose thermal analysis as well. The TSS user interface allows simultaneous menu and com- mand line input. The command language interpreter is fully pro- grammable to allow the functions of TSS to be combined in more powerful ways, for example, automated optimization of desired thermal design parameters. The user interface has successfully integrated the requirements of a rapidly learned, intuitive, menu driven interface with powerful analysis algorithms into a system that can be fully exploited by the expert engineer. This paper presents the motivation for a TSS and its primary functional and design requirements, its basic design philosophy and software engineering approach, and an overview of the main features of each of the applications within TSS. 1991 SAE Transactions Section 1 911583. Implementation of automatic control features in ESA- TAN models. Joachim Lucas, Jürgen Schilke, and Werner H of acker, Dornier GmbH. The representation of functions of environment control and life support systems in ESATAN models requires the implemen- tation of automatic control features. Mainly the air temperature and air mass flow are subject to automatic control. This paper shows - as an example - the implementation of a PI (proportional and integral) controller to represent the effects of automatic control of Hermes ECLSS. Implementing these functions in ESATAN requires different approaches for steady state and transient solutions. The control algorithm is implemented in the model so that it is passed through in each timestep. Hence the setting of the active compo- nents is updated in each timestep. For the calculation of steady state cases the control algorithm had to be implemented so that the controller parameters are not timestep dependent. The paper shows that active control features can be imple- mented in ESATAN models by adding some subroutines. The models can give valuable information on the control strategy to choose and on the layout of the controller. Furthermore transient 187</page><page sequence="187">911583-911592 effects can be studied in more detail due to the fact that the tran- sient effects of automatic control features are accounted for. 911584. Thermal analysis of spacecraft by combining different analysis tools. Werner H of acker, Joachim Lucas, and F. Zilly, Dornier GmbH. The thermal behaviour of spacecraft especially of manned ones is governed by various thermophysical effects. Heat transfer by radiation, conduction and convection infleunce the overall behaviour of the spacecraft. Energy production, distribution and consumption have also strong impacts on the temperature field prevailing in the spaceplane. Moreover, chemical reactions, met- abolic rates of the crew and external heat loads determine the thermal behaviour of the spacecraft. For design and optimisation of the system and its subsystems a mathematical model is require which describes these effects. There are many tools available with which parts of the above mentioned aspects can be covered. However, a comprehensive model of a spacecraft reflecting all aspects can only be established with a combination of different simulation tools. In the present paper methods are described, how different sim- ulation tools can be used to set up such a model. Some of them are used during the definition and set up of the models. Others are required during the execution of the calculations. As an exam- ple, the procedure to establish the thermal mathematical models for the pressurized volumes of Hermes is described. During setup and establishment of the ESATAN model the radiative heat transfer between the inner surfaces was studied. At the same time a CFD study of the flow field in the volumes was carried out. The resulting node model is then connected with a modular system simulation of the ECLSS to get a higher level model in which both, the lumped parameter modélisation of the pressurized volumes as well as the component based model are combined and iteratively processed. Steady state and transiet loadcases have been calculated and gave excellent results. 1 991 SAE Transactions Section 1 911587. ESARAD - The European Space Agency's radiative analyser. P. Jeanne, ESA/ESTEC ; and J. J. Rebis, G EC Alsthom. ESARAD is an integrated suite of analysis tools for the calcu- lation of view factors, radiative exchange factors and solar, albedo and planet heat fluxes. It will replace the VWHEAT soft- ware currently used by ESA subcontractors from the end of the first quarter of 1991. The software provides efficient capabilities in terms of: 1) geo- metric modelling with constructive solid geometry (CSG) approach, using boolean operations (union and difference) between the geometric primitives; 2) calculation flexibility, calcu- lation speed (over 2 orders of magnitude faster than VWHEAT), robustness, and guaranteed convergence, using a Monte-Carlo technique associated with a fast ray-tracing algorithm; 3) user friendliness based on a graphical user interface (GUI) using X-window and OSF/motif as widget set and including a high- level input language; 4) graphic representation of models using phigs and PEX (phigs extension to X); and 5) data storage (input models and simulation results) using the ORACLE database management system. This paper presents the original aims of the ESARAD devel- opment and shows how these have been met by the product now available, and also presents the first results obtained by the Euro- pean Space Agency using the ESARAD software. 911589. Flight performance of the spacelab Astro-1 mission integrated radiator system. Richard M. Hamner and Linda S. Hornsby, Teledyne Brown Engineering. This paper describes the design and performance characteris- tics of the thermal control system for the spacelab Astro-1 pay- load. Dubbed the integrated radiator system, or 1RS, the assem- bly is a thermal radiation system designed to maintain the tem- perature of payload electronics packages within a specified range, regardless of payload or orbiter orientation in space. The radiator is passive in its ability to reject heat, but active when the lower temperature limit is reached. At that point, resistance heaters are energized to maintain the radiator surface temperature within acceptable range. The performance of the radiator system during its flight aboard the space shuttle is reported in this paper. An earlier paper presented the thermal analysis and test data predicting the perfor- mance of the radiator system before the flight. In this paper, data collected during the flight is reported and compared to the perfor- mance predicted by analyses and tests. The radiator consists of two alunimum planes, connected at right angles, which are covered with silverized teflon tape. The radiator structure is attached to the cruciform-shaped platform which supports a cluster of ultraviolet telescopes. The two faces of the radiator surface are connected by a series of fixed conduct- ance heat pipes attached in orthogonal directions to the front and back sides of the radiator surface. The heat pipes were installed to maintain the radiator surface at a uniform temperature. Heat loads are generated by electronics boxes mounted directly to the back side of the radiator. The original design concept for the radiator is presented in brief, including its performance specifications. The testing which was conducted to verify the system performance is also pres- ented. The test history of the heat pipes is given, along with the methods of detecting the presence of noncondensable gases within the heat pipes. The flight performance of the 1RS proved to be nominal for the orbit conditions flown. 1991 SAE Transactions Section 1 911590. Two-phase thermal control system modelling using SINDA'85/FLUINT. Rosemary A. Schmidt, Swales and Asso- ciates, Inc. Simultaneous thermal and hydraulic analysis has been com- pleted using SINDA'85/FLUINT for a two-phase ammonia ther- mal control system proposed for space station freedom attached payload accommodation equipment (APAE). This analysis pro- vided information on system performance, transient behavior during heat load changes, and control system response. Control system logic and non-equilibrium effects were included in the model. This paper describes the hardware used in this thermal control system and the modelling techniques used to represent it. A brief comparison of the predicted system performance with test results from gound testing of similar systems at NASA Johnson Space Center is also provided. 911591. Development and test results of a two-phase reservoir for thermal transport systems used in micro-gravity. Russell B. Schweickart, Ball Aerospace; and Mathew T. Buchko, NASA God - dard Space Flight Center. This paper describes the development and testing of a two- phase fluid reservoir for use in advanced thermal control systems designed for space applications. The aim of this development is to construct a highly reliable reservoir with the capability of con- trolling the saturation temperature of the system working fluid. The design considerations are described along with the methods of achieving the operation requirements. In addition, results from the initial testing of the prototype are presented. 1991 SAE Transactions Section 1 911592. Instrument thermal test bed: a unique two phase test facility. Theodore D . Swanson and Jeffrey Didion, NASA God- dard Space Flight Center. The instrument thermal test bed (ITTB) is a modular, large scale test facility which provides a medium for ground testing and flight qualification of spacecraft thermal control components and system configurations. The initial "shake-down" operations are discussed herein. Operational parameters and performance char- 188</page><page sequence="188">911592-911601 acteristics were determined and quantified on a preliminary basis. The ITTB was successfully operated at evaporator power loads ranging from 600 W to 9600 W as well as in both capillary pumped and series hybrid pumped modes. 1991 SAE Transactions Section 1 911594. Post-restructure U.S. laboratory and habitation mod- ule configuration for space station freedom. Ramzy Boutros and Richard L. Olson, Missiles and Space Div., Boeing Defense and Space Group. The space station freedom (SSF) configuration evolved during the past decade in response to changing requirements and resources. Early space station studies determined that an on-orbit U.S. laboratory (Lab) module was required to accomplish mis- sion goals. A habitation (hab) module was needed to support the objective of a permanently manned presence on the station. Operational requirements were met by providing resouce nodes, pressurized logistics (log) elements, and airlocks. These five ele- ments are the basic pressurized building blocks used to construct SSF. As the SSF design matured, requirement changes were made to accommodate such considerations as launch capability, extra- vehicular activity (EVA) assembly time, intravehicular activity (IVA) outfitting and checkout, and other program resource con- straints. These considerations resulted in design changes that were incorporated into a restructured design that will be finalized and become the SSF baseline by mid-1991. The baselined restructured program is planned to be con- ducted in three phases: 1) a man-tended capability (MTC) phase that provides a U.S. lab element and node to enable early support of scientific experimentation; 2) a permanently manned capabil- ity (PMC) phase with a hab and an additional node to support four crew members on orbit for 90 days; and 3) the eight-man crew capability (EMCC) phase, which will be implemented when funds become available. The European and Japanese laboratory elements will be installed at PMC. This paper presents a design overview for each of the three restructured program phases with respect to the U.S. lab, hab, and pressurized logistics element topologies. An outline of the capabilities for the primary subsystems is also included. The described configuration summarizes all changes that are approved and incorporated in restructure through April 1991. 911595. Space station freedom resource nodes status: first quarter 1991. John B. Lauger and Raymond J. LeVesque, Space Station Div., McDonnell Douglas Space Systems Co. This paper discusses the outfitting of the resource nodes for space station freedom. The driving functional and design require- ments are discussed briefly in relation to the current overall con- figuration and internal outfitting. The major features of the resource node internal architecture, distributed system packag- ing, crew accommodations, utility distribution, and the centri- fuge facility are described. This current design approach meets the program requirements for crew accommodations, on-orbit maintainability, and growth of the re-structured space station freedom over its projected 30 year life. This paper updates a simi- lar paper presented in 1988, and as such, the reader may find it useful to refer to SAE Technical Paper #881120. 911596. Technology development activities for housing research animals on space station freedom. Jeffrey W. Jenner and Vladimir M. Garin, NASA Ames Research Center ; and Frank D. Nguyen, General Electric Government Service, NASA Ames Research Center. NASA is developing a biological flight research laboratory for conducting experiments with live specimens aboard space station freedom. Long-term housing for animals in the space station free- dom operational environment presents many technological chal- lenges beyond those encountered in short-duration space shuttle missions. In order to successfully meet these challenges during the upcoming hardware design phase, the animal habitat devel- opment ground in the NASA Ames Research Center Biological Flight Research Project Office is developing improved micro- gravity animal waste collection methods, along with habitat designs that could reduce crew involvement in, and station resources required for, cleaning operations. Because of its inher- ent simplicity and compatibility with animals, airflow has been selected as the primary waste collection mechanism. Air curtains (localized areas of high-speed directed airflow) are being evalu- ated as a means of obtaining the high air velocities needed to keep the cage interior and animals relative clean while keeping the total airflow rates (thus, power, weight, volume, noise, vibration, and heat production) low. Other related development activities include the study of basic contamination control mechanisms in reduced gravity, design of an animal habitat test bed, and mate- rial selection and evaluation. 1991 SAE Transactions Section 1 911597. Trade study comparing specimen chamber servicing methods for the space station centrifuge facility. Michael L. Calvisi, Dept. ofMech.Engrg., California Polytechnic State Univ.; and Sidney C. Sun, NASA Ames Research Center. The Specimen Chamber Service Unit, a component of the Space Station Centrifuge Facility, must provide a clean enclosure on a continuing basis for the facility's plant, rodent and primate specimens. In the centrifuge facility, animal and plant specimens reside in enclosures called specimen chambers which fit inside larger, self-contained habitat modules. The specimen chabers will become soiled and will require période servicing to maintain a clean environment for the specimens. Two methods of servicing the specimen chambers have thus far been proposed: washing the chambers with an on-board washer, or disposing of the soiled chambers and replacing them with clean ones. The choice of ser- vicing method involves a large and complex set of issues. This paper addresses many of these issues by developing several ser- vicing options, using either cleaning or replacement as the method of providing clean specimen chambers, and then evaluat- ing each option according to a set of established quantitative and qualitative criteria. Through this process, the authors concluded that disposing and replacing the specimen chambers is preferable to washing them. 1991 SAE Transactions Section 1 911600. An ultra pure water processing system utilizing mem- brane pcrvaporation and catalytic oxidation technologies. David Pines and Philip J. Birba ra, Hamilton Standard Div., United Technologies Corp. Future space exploration activities require ultrapure water for experimentation and general laboratory operations. A system which is capable of recycling wastewater to provide ultrapure water will greatly reduce water resupply requirements. A hollow fiber membrane (HFM) phase change technology coupled with an aqueous phase catalytic oxidation (APCO) provides an efficient means of water purification to meet the requirements for the ultrapure water system (UPWS). The HFM phase change system, a pervaporation process, separates water from organics and inor- ganics in an aqueous solution. As with all phase change technolo- gies, volatile organic compounds are transported with the prod- uct water. These organics are then oxidized by the APCO process to significantly reduce the total organic carbon (TOC) concentra- tion. Residual contaminants are then removed by polishing beds containing ion exchange resins and physical adsorbents. 1991 SAE Transactions Section 1 911601. The water evaporator assembly: a heat sink for Her- mes ATCS. Fabrizio Burgio, Alenia, Spazio ; and Benjamin J. G. Leidinger, Deutsche Aerospace, ERNO Raumfahrtechnik GmbH. Evaporative coolers are used for rejecting waste heat from spaceplanes. 189</page><page sequence="189">911601-911625 This paper deals with the requirements and the first develop- ment approach of a water evaporator assembly (WEA) for Her- mes spaceplane. The WEA will be used to reject waste heat from Hermes. The requirements for the evaporator are derived from system and subsystem design activities. Some important activi- ties of the development such as the spray nozzle selection, the capillary structure development, the tooth fin heat exchanger investigations and tests with a technology demonstration model are summarized and main results are discussed. 911602. Restraints as an important aspect of habitability. Muriel Didier , ESA/ESTEC. One of the characteristics of the space environment is the microgravity that influences the human physiology but also the activity of the human acting in this environment. Since every object, also the human, is "floating" around in a space station, some objects might become projectiles and the performance of human might be reduced (i.e. lack of precision). It might end as a safety issue. In the past different concepts have been designed and tested as the "triangle shoes" or the handrails but there are still some improvements to be done. Two other concepts have been tested in ESA: one is based on the velcro concept but using a stronger material (polymer velcro), the other one being a tie down device fixed to rails on the floor. Those systems were trying to fullfill the walking requirements and at this stage of development shall still be improved before judging definitively their efficiency. The major difficulty with restraints being that their character- istics depend on the type of task to be performed but on the other hand a unique type of foot restraints shall be proposed to be used in a space station for technical and practical reasons. 911620. Miniature maglev vehicles for personal non-stop transportation. Douglas J. Malewicki, Aerovisions, Inc.; and Frank J. Baker , Monitoring Automation Systems. The people pods maglev transportation concept uses extremely light weight, 200 pound electric vehicles that are aero- dynamic, non-polluting and carry two passengers. While travel- ing at 100 mph on a monorail track system (safely above all other heavier traffic) a pod achieves an equivalent 400 mpg energy effi- cieny. Because of this miniscule traveling weight, an elevated guideway can be built with minimum materials for less than $2 million per mile and still exceed all static, dynamic and seismic structural criteria. This can be compared with proposed 160 pas- senger monorail trains (weighing 100,000 pounds) which require guideways costing up to $40 million per mile. The light weight of track design allows us to create an auto- mated track forming/manufacturing robot that enables a two shift crew to deploy one mile of two way track per day. This fur- ther reduces costs and interrupts neighborhoods for shorter peri- ods of time. Comfortable, semi-reclined, sports car like seating and careful attention to subsonic aerodynamic streamlining will enable the tandem seated people pod passengers to be carried along at a steady 100 mph for less than V4 cent of electrical energy per pas- senger mile. The personal nature of this transportation concept completely eliminates the time wasted to decelerate, stop, let some passen- gers off and others on and then reaccelerate at each and every sta- tion. A people pod user will board, then travel non-stop on the main track until switching off at his preselected destination sta- tion. Anti-collision sensors, in conjunction with air bags and hydraulic brakes that squeeze the track itself, will provide emer- gency computer controlled 6g deceleration (55 foot stopping dis- tances). The result is safe, V2 second headway spacing (73 foot spacing) and a capacity of 14,400 passengers per hour in each direction. This can be compared with four lane freeways which carry only 12,000 vehicles per hour. The goal of the people pods non-stop grid system is to provide the most attractive, practical, effective, and profitable, public transportation system ever deviced. To accomplish this objec- tive, the pods must be so capital and energy efficient that individ- ual would pay no more to use it than they would normally spend on gasoline. Creating a daily commuting service that is safer, faster, cheaper and less frustrating to use than personal automo- biles is the essential motivating incentive that the people pods concept addresses. The original people pods concept was wheel driven, and based on existing ultra light weight electric motors. The maglev people pod concept offers compelling advantages but requires signifi- cantly newer technologies and related unkown costs. Additional technology ingredients include lightweight streamlined compos- ite structures, advanced power distribution control systems, and today's modern highpowered computers. Using either power sys- tem, the people pods concept can be used to create a useful, low cost, safe public/personal transportation system. 911621. Superconducting maglev on the new test line and related technology development in Japan. Hiroshi Takeda , Rail- way Technical Research Institute. With the government approval of the construction plan of about 43 km long new maglev test line in Yamanashi Prefecture, the superconducting maglev development in Japan has stepped into a new phase. This paper updates the progress in the related research and development on the Yamanashi maglev test line. 911623. Test demonstration of HSST-100 maglev train. Floyd A. Wyczalek, FWLilly Inc.; and Akira O his hi, HSST Corp. This is an assessment of Japanese high speed surface transport (HSST) policy, vision, goals, and magnetic lévitation develop- ment and commercialization strategy. It includes a status report for a test program now underway to demonstrate the safety, lia- bility and economic viability of the HSST-100 maglev train sys- tem. HSST-100 is one of three types of HSST maglev trains planned for implementation in Japan: HSST-100 for 100 km/h urban service, HSST-200 for 200 km/h medium range suburban service, and HSST 300 for the 300 km/h long range interurban application. For the HSST-100 program, included are detailed specifica- tions for the vehicle, location of the Chubu (central Japan) test site South of Nagoya, test site guideway specifications, guideway switching concept, test site facility description, major test activi- ties, and test event schedule. However, the scope of this paper is limited to describing and illustrating the status of the preceding topics, and does not include test results, because construction has been completed and preparatory trials are ongoing. Preparatory trials have demonstrated speeds up to 80 km/h. However, before the official test program begins, the vehicle must meet design point specifications and have demonstrated a peak speed capabil- ity of 110 km/h. 911624. Maglev system design considerations. Howard T. Cof- fey, Argonne National Lab. The characteristics of maglev systems being considered for implementation in the United States are speculative. A confer- ence was held at Argonne National Laboratory on November 28-29, 1990, to discuss these characteristics and their implica- tions for the design requirements of operational systems. This paper reviews some of the factors considered during that confer- ence. 911625. New principles of maglev and traction underlying transportation. Vasilij V. Kozorez and Halyna Kozorez, V.M. Glushkov Institute of Cybernetics, Academy of Sciences of the 190</page><page sequence="190">911625-911628 Ukrainian ; and Kondrat Gishchak, Institute of Problems of Mod- eling in Power Engrg., Academy of Sciences of the. There are two well known basic concepts for achieving mag- netic lévitation of vehicles: one is based on electromagnetic attraction (EMA); and the second method is based on electrody- namic repulsion (EDR). In turn, each of these concepts have at least two variations. This paper presents a third form of magnetic lévitation known in the USSR as the magnetic potential well (MPW) developed by Kozoriz, and in the West as Laithwaite's magnetic river. The MPW effect is based on a dc circuit and exhibits characteristics whereby: the magnetic attraction force passes through a null, before the distance becomes zero, and changes to magnetic repul- sion, as a function of interval separating a superconductive (SC) dc electric circuit and a second dc electro and/or permanent mag- net, and/or two-wire dc line pair of infinite length. In a gravity field, a MPW vehicle exhibits stable static mag- netic lévitation distances of about one-half meter at zero vehicle velocity, either above or below a guideway, with inherent vertical pitch control; and, also inherent lateral yaw control because a null-flux exists laterally also. Furthermore this MPW null-flex and magnetic force reversal becomes the basis for a unique linear traction motor, through an efficient reversible energy transforma- tion between the magnetic potential energy of a SC circuit and vehicle kinetic energy. The scope of this paper is limited to abbreviated reviews of the known concepts of EMA and EDR and an explanation of the MPW concept; and, by comparisons, demonstrates the applica- tions of MPW to high speed lévitation and propulsion in the USSR. A companion paper derives the mathematical relations needed to reduce the MPW concept to design practice in high speed transit applications, but is limited in scope to final forms of the equations only. 1991 SAE Transactions Section 2 911626. Magnetic lévitation based on: magnetic potential well (MPW) effect. V. S. Mikhalevich, V. P. S ha blij, and Vasilij V. Kozorez, V.M. Glushkov Institute of Cybernetics , Academy of Sci- ences of the Ukrainian. There are two well known basic concepts for achieving mag- netic lévitation of vehicles: one is based on electromagnetic attraction (EMA); and the second method is based on electrody- namic repulsion (EDR). In turn, each of these concepts have at least two variations. This paper presents a description of a lesser known third form of magnetic lévitation which in the USSR is called the dc circuit magnetic potential well (MPW) effect, devel- oped by Kozoriz; and known in the West as Laithwaite's mag- netic river which, however, is illustrated for an ac circuit. Fur- thermore, it identifies the boundary conditions which are needed to achieve the dc circuit MPW effect, and illustrates the final forms of the mathematical relationships derived to reduce the MPW concept to practice, in the design of practical high speed maglev vehicles, for automotive and/or mass transit applica- tions. This method is further described generally and design application examples are given in a companion paper. However, the scopes of this and our companion paper are necessarily lim- ited by length to an introductory summary of results. Supplemen- tary lectures may be arranged to present the step by step deriva- tions of the equations presented here only in summary form. 1991 SAE Transactions Section 2 911627. Maglev transit in America and US national energy strategy. Floyd A. Wyczalek, FWLilly Inc. This is an assessment of United States high speed guided tran- sit (HSGT) systems policy, vision, goals, and magnetic lévitation development and commercialization technology; as affected by the new United States National Energy Strategy. It includes a brief review of the key aspects and assumptions which formed the basis for the US National Energy Strategy Scenario, and the tac- tics proposed to implement a national maglev transit network by the target year 2015. It is followed by a historical review of past magnetic lévitation vehicle developments, a review of the present status of maglev trains, and an outline of future (EMA) electromagnetic attraction lévitation for speeds under 400 km/h; (SC) super conductive (EDR) electrodynamic repulsion lévitation for subsonic speeds approaching 900 km/h; and, an introduction to the (MPW) mag- netic potential well lévitation effect as developed by Kozoriz in 1976. Magnetic lévitation transit technology has been under devel- opment in America since the US Congress passed the 1965 high speed guided transit act (HSGT) which authorized the Depart- ment of Transportation (DOT) to fund HSGT projects. Since then, this technology has been an ongoing terrestrial transit devel- opment in Europe and Japan; and, later in the USSR for non ter- restrial applications, such as a new method for docking space craft in earth orbit, and now for a USSR terrestrial maglev transit application. Consequently, prototype maglev trains are now considered ready for introduction into intercity commercial service, and ulti- mately in subsonic applications up to 900 km/h. Im America, new initial steps were taken in 1989 by the US DOT, in a one year assessment of United States transportation policy and system needs for the future, under Secretary for DOT, Mr. Samuel K. Skinner. US DOT transportation policy recommendations were made to the Office of the President of the United States in May 1990; and, followed by the so-called National Maglev Initiative sponsored by the US DOT Federal Railroad Administration in early 1991. 911628. Reformulated gasoline for California: EC -premium emission control gasoline and beyond. K. L. Boekhaus, J. M. DeJovine, D. A. Paulsen , L. A. Rapp, K. J. McHugh, J. S. Segal, B. K. Sullivan, and D. J. Townsend, Arco Products Co. EC-premium is the second gasoline designed and commer- cially introduced by ARCO to reduce air pollution in southern California. EC-premium is designed to be used in cars using unleaded gasoline reqiring the performance of a high octane gaso- line. As with EC-1 regular, the changes made to the gasoline include the addition of an oxygenate (MTBE), reduction in ole- fins content, reduction in aromatics content (and heavy aromat- ics in particular), reduction in benzene content, and reduction in volatility. Two batches of EC-premium were tested: a pilot batch sam- pled in February, 1990, and a commercial production batch sam- pled in September, 1990. The EC-premium pilot batch was tested in a fleet of 20 cars certified to California emissions standards. The cars were selected to be representative of the unleaded premium fleet in southern California. A subsequent analysis of the EC-premium pilot batch used in the earlier experimentation revealed a calibration problem with the GC column used for the aromatics analysis during blending. In actual fact the aromatics content of the pilot EC-premium was 33 vol % rather than the 25 vol % maximum allowed by the speci- fications. A production batch of EC-premium was therefore tested against the pilot batch of EC-premium in fourteen of the same cars used in the earlier work. By combining the two sets of actual measurements (i.e., pilot EC-premium vs. unreformulated premium and pilot EC- premium vs. production EC-premium), we estimate the benefits for production EC-premium vs. unreformulated premium to be as follows: EC-premium reduces total car emissions of THC by 28%, COPM (i.e., carter ozone per mile, or (THC mass) x (THC CMIRI)) by 24%, CO by 34%, no statistically significant differ- ence in NOx, benzene by 51%, and total toxics by 40%. 191</page><page sequence="191">911628-911633 A comparison of the EC-premium test data in late model vehi- cles (87 my and later) to ARCO's correlations of the auto/oil air quality improvement research program (AQIRP) data show good agreement. Chevron's recent test data in SAE paper 910382 are also well predicted by our AQIRP based correlations. For older cars (86 my and earlier), we tested the ARCO and Chevron data with two different sets of correlations: a) correla- tions literally based on the AQIRP "older car" data, and b) corre- lations based on the AQIRP "89 my car" data, but excluding the sulfur effect. Set (b) worked far better, which leads us to wonder just how representative is the AQIRP older car data. We have used the AQIRP based correlations to design four prototype gasolines for confirmational emissions and perfor- mance testing in a fleet of 1990 my California certified vehicles. The goal of this testing will be to determine the most cost effec- tive formula for "EC-X", our code name for a gasoline equivalent to M85 in emissions reducing benefits. The correlations show this equivalency to be a strong possibility. 911630. (SP-876) Gasoline tolerant methanol fueled ride share van. Paul Wuebben, South Coast Air Quality Management ; Rob- ert Nankee , Chrysler Motor Corp.; Wayne McMahon, California Air Resources Board ; and Richard Pefley , Alcohol Energy Sys- tems. The decade of the nineties represents a unique time. Traffic congestion, petroleum shortages and health and environmental concerns resulting from fuel spills, smog and greenhouse effects are converging to force changes in the gasoline powered automo- bile. This presentation recognizes these circumstances as it pres- ents the program and initial results from a flexible fueled ride- share van demonstration project. The ride-share vans are 1990 Plymouth Voyagers with two dif- ferent powertrains: a 2.5 liter normally aspirated engine and a 2.2 liter turbo-charged engine. The 2.5 L fuel flexible engine has elec- tronic spark and fuel management so that it can operate on any combination from 0 to 85% methanol (M85) and gasoline. The 2.2 L gasoline tolerant engine has electronic turbo-boost manage- ment as well as electronic spark and fuel control. The power boost increases with percentage of methanol and its associated octane enhancement. This powertrain delivers 175 hp on M85 versus 150 hp on super unleaded gasoline and hence its designation - gasoline tolerant methanol vehicle. The 10 vehicles, 5 of each powertrain, composing this demon- stration fleet are in operation in the Los Angeles basin under the aegis of the South Coast Air Quality Management District. Emis- sions measurements are being conducted by the California Air Resources Board (CARB). Their test results are being cast in the new emissions format being proposed by CARB. The paper will show the details of the evaluation procedure and the resulting evi- dence for the new format as well as for the well recognized EPA procedure. This early evidence shows that the vans' operation on M85 is beneficial in smog reduction in comparison with their operation on unleaded gasoline. 911631. (SP-876) DDC's production 6V-92TA methanol bus engine. Stanley P. Miller ; Detroit Diesel Corp. In March, 1991, DDC completed the necessary testing to sat- isfy EPA and CARB certification requirements and began first full scale production of its 6V-92TA methanol engine for transit bus applications. This was the culmination of nearly a decade of development and millions of miles of service accumulated at demonstration sites. The purpose of this paper is to document the production con- figuration, and describe some of the more recent developments which led to establishing the final configuration, provide the final thermal efficiency and exhaust emissions numbers achieved, as well as current demonstrated reliability and performance of this configuration in customer service. The 6V-92TA methanol transit bus engine generates lower values of all regulated emissions than its diesel counterpart, meets all future emissions standards known today, achieves ther- mal efficiency within 1-2% of a comparable diesel while produc- ing less than half the NOx emissions, performs as well as a diesel of equal power, and has demonstrated acceptable reliability in customer service. 911632. (SP-876) Methanol transit bus: research and develop- ment to operational reality. Vincent Pellegrin and George Kar- bowski, Southern California Rapid Transit District. The purpose of this paper is to document the development of the Southern California Rapid Transit District's (SCRTD) meth- anol demonstration project and the integration of methanol buses into the existing diesel bus fleet. On June 12, 1989 the first three of thirty neat methanol pow- ered transit buses entered revenue service in Los Angeles. In December 1990 the 30 bus demonstration project logged its one millionth mile. From an operational standpoint, particular emphasis has been placed on the development of methanol subsystem components and related equipment. In addition this paper will cover metha- nol fueling facilities, safety requirements, and the future develop- ment necessary to integrate this alternate fuel technology into everyday operations at the SCRTD. Additionally, the development of safety and training pro- grams must parallel the development of the technology. SCRTD has identified three areas of technical training which must be completed before this project can make a smooth transition from research and development to an operational status. Initially, safety training must address material safety which would include, fire and spill procedures, worker methanol vapor and formalde- hyde exposure levels, as well as appropriate and effective safety equipment and handling procedures. Secondly, detailed orienta- tion programs have been developed to respond to various work group requirements. Transportation (bus operators) and bus maintenance personnel, along with other interested groups, such as the Los Angeles Fire Department and the California Highway Patrol, all received training tailored to their specific needs. Finally, a detailed and comprehensive mechanical troubleshoot- ing and repair curriculum plant was needed. This plan was designed to incorporate all engine and vehicle manufacturer training recommendations and was developed to meet SCRTD's maintenance requirements. The SCRTD's methanol bus demonstration program has been an important element in the development of reducing harmful exhaust emissions from urban transit buses. The efforts of the SCRTD have taken theoretical concepts and made them into a practical means of operating and maintaining a fleet of methanol buses. 911633. (SP-876) A high performance zinc-air powered electric vehicle. Len G. Danczyk, Dreisbach Electro Motive, Inc.; Ray- mond S. Hobbs, Arizona Public Service Co.; and Robert L. Schef- fler, Southern California Edison Co. Arizona Public Service (APS) has joined Southern California Edison (SCE) in sponsoring construction of a high performance electric vehicle based on a Honda CRX using DEMI's proprietary rechargeable zinc-air battery technology. The zinc-air CRX went 215 miles (346 km) on a single charge in its first test at an average speed of 45 mph (72 km/h) (SAE "D" cycle) and demonstrated at top speed of 87 mph (140 km/h). At the Inaugural Solar and Electric (S&amp;E) 500 at the Phoenix Inter- national Raceway April 5-7, 1991, the CRX set a national record for a 1-mile closed course at 69.44 mph (112 km/h). The car won the pole position and dominated the 2 hour race winning by a comfortable 4-lap margin against a field of 12 other EVs from all over the United States. 192</page><page sequence="192">911633-911643 This paper covers the results of vehicle testing to date and the car's battery and electric subsystems. 911634. (SP-876) Performance and life evaluation of advanced battery technologies for electric vehicle applications. William H. DeLuca, K. R. Gillie , J. E. Kulaga, A. F. Tum millo, J. A. Smaga, and C. E . Webster, Chemical Technology Div., Argonne National Lab. Advanced battery technology evaluations are performed under simulated electric vehicle (EV) operating conditions at the Argonne Analysis and Diagnostic Laboratory (ADL). The ADL provides a common basis for both performance characterization and life evaluation with unbiased application of tests and analy- ses. This paper summarizes the performance characterizations and life evaluations conducted in 1990 on nine single cells and fifteen 3 to 360-cell modules that encompass six technologies (Na/S, Zn/Br, Ni/Fe, Ni/Cd, Ni-metal hydride, and lead-acid). These evaluations were performed for the Department of Energy and Electric Power Research Institute. The results provide bat- tery users, developers, and program managers an interim mea- sure of the progress being made in battery R&amp;D programs, a com- parison of battery technologies, and a source of basic data for modeling and continuing R&amp;D. 1991 SAE Transactions Section 6 911636. (SP-876) Design of curved solar arrays for solar- powered electric vehicles. J ovan E. Lebaric and Alan A. Manche, Rose-Hulman Institute of Technology. Students at Rose-Hulman Institute of Technology have designed, fabricated and efficiently integrated a flat solar array in Rose-Hulman's solar phantom solar-powered electric vehicle. The choice of a fixed, flat array was influenced by the simplicity and the cost of manufacturing and the number and cost of photo- voltaic cells rather than just the energy collecting ability of the array itself. There are three basic types of solar arrays used for solar-powered electric vehicles: curved arrays, flat arrays, and tracking arrays. Our objective is to present a comparison of the three array types based on the power and size constraints imposed by the solar-powered electric vehicle race rules. Although in selecting the type of array for a solar-powered electric vehicle there are concerns other than the energy collecting capa- bility, such as the vehicle aerodynamics, we consider the type of study we have conducted as a necessary first step in understand- ing the trade-offs with different array designs. A primer for a transcontinental-class solar-powered electric vehicle solar array design is also presented. 911638. Transportation takes advantage of austempered duc- tile iron. Jack R. Laub, Advanced Cast Products, Inc. The new family of austempered ductile iron materials, as recently specified by ASTM, is routinely able to outperform steel castings, forgings and fabrications in both structural and wear applications. Potential users are normally attracted by the lower price of austempered ductile iron generated by its inherent manu- facturing cost advantages, particularly for parts which need high strength. However, a full range of outstanding features, including an 8-10% weight advantage and a high strength-to-weight ratio, make it of great interest to transportation engineers. These supe- rior mechanical properties result from a truly unique microstruc- ture that has already been proven in numerous transportation applications worldwide. 911639. Optimizing collet chuck designs using variation simu- lation analysis. Jeff Peelman-Fuscaldo, Applied Computer Solu- tions, Inc. Through the use of variation simulation analysis, the develop- ment of turning and grinding chucks can be greatly enhanced due to the ability to predict collet roundness for a proposed concept. 911640. Estimating a process control model of vehicle front wheel alignment: a case study in off-line experimentation. Darrell Radson, School of Business Administration, University of Wiscon- sin-Milwaukee ; and GaryD. Herrin, Dept. of Industrial and Oper- ations Engrg., University of Michigan. An off-line experiment was performed to estimate a model for on-line process control which describes the empirical relationship between the design and production factors affecting the front wheel camber angle. It is shown through a case study that models for process control estimated from off-line experiments may not generate on-line minimal variance predictions for vehicles repre- sentative of those produced in the assembly plant. This occurred in a case study experiment because a characteristic of the vehicle used in the experiment was identified which could not be manip- ulated or controlled during experimentation. It is shown that the developed methodology for augmenting the experiment would improve the model for on-line process control by generating min- imal variance predictions for vehicles more representative of those produced in the assembly plant. 1991 SAE Transactions Section S 911641. Process capability measurements for complex assem- blies. Colin Wearring and Chris Slon, Applied Computer Solu- tions, Inc. This paper will define two factors which represent different sources of dimensional variation in complex assemblies. These two factors distinguish build variation by design from variation associated with manufacturing and assembly. The relationship of these two factors to the process capability (Cp) is defined, and their application to a typical problem illustrated. Utilizing variation simulation analysis (VSA®) (Appendix) to predict build variation under ideal design assumptions, Cp may be expressed as the product of design capability (Cd) and process deviation (Dp), using the relationship of Eq. Design capability (Cd) evaluates the design (component toler- ances and assembly operations by design), while process devia- tion (Dp) measures the ability of manufacturing and assembly operations to achieve results equivalent to an ideal process. The benefits of using Cd and Dp during the design and manu- facturing process are included, with emphasis on improving com- munication within the organization and quantitatively defining sources of build variation. Cd and Dp provide the organization with additional information which can be utilized during process analysis, process control and process improvement activities. 911642. Achieving quality through flexible inspection. Carroll Johnson, Mech. Industrial Engrg., University of Texas at El Paso ; and Joseph W. Foster, Texas A&amp;M Univ. Machine vision has historically been used as a quality audit tool in the automotive industry. New generation vision hardware offers the potential for intergrating machine vision into the man- ufacturing process as an interactive process control tool. This paper is a case study in the application of machine vision inte- grated into a production line to feed process control data to a sys- tem controller in addition to performing statistical process con- trol functions on a real time basis. The paper describes the initial application of the concept referred to as flexible inspection, and an example inspection algo- rithm for determining the presence/absence of components on a printed circuit board. The production activity chosen for the study is a printed circuit assembly line in an automotive electron- ics assembly plant. The potential impact of this type of system on automotive manufacturing is assessed through empirical data. Flexible inspection will reduce process variability while achiev- ing optimum quality levels. 1991 SAE Transactions Section 5 911643. Simultaneous value engineering for quality (SVQ). K. G. K. Rao, Tata Engineering and Locomotive Co., Ltd. 193</page><page sequence="193">911643-911652 Conventional product development techniques need a change to radically new methods to meet competitive market demands. This is all the more so for developing countries where technology gaps have to be bridged. Simultaneous engineering, value engi- neering, and the total quality concept are widely used to rapidly develop "desirable" and cost effective products. Telco used the essence of these processes concurrently in an approach called simultaneous value engineering for quality (SVQ) to develop a new range of light pickup trucks in a span of 30 months. A key element in this approach is the catalytic role played by a multi- disciplinary ground of specialists. 911644. Identifying sources of build variation using VSA audit. Colin Wearring and Gary Cola , Applied Computer Solu- tions , Inc. This paper outlines the use of VSA audit procedures to iden- tify sources of build variation in an assembly operation. VSA audit isolates the effects of component variation from variation incurred during the assembly process, (wear of fixtures, fixture breakage, etc.) This approach provides signficant advantages when troubleshooting dimensional variation issues in an assem- bly plant environment. VSA audit uses measured component dimensions in a com- puter simulation of the assembly process. Initially the VSA model is correlated to the assembly operation such that output from the model matches output from the operation. As new shipments of components are received, measurements from each batch are used by the VSA model to predict the impact of the new batch of parts on dimensional variation in the final assembly. This activity identifies potential problems due to part quality prior to building the product. Identifying trends and correcting or replac- ing parts at this time can generate significant savings for the orga- nization. Troubleshooting dimensional variation issues can benefit from the use of VSA audit. Causes of build variation are usually determined by trial and error, guided by experience. VSA audit is a tool which highlights differences between the assembly opera- tion and an ideal benchmark using objective information. Signifi- cant changes between the values of VSA audit predictions and measured data indicate a change in the assembly process. The nature of this change may be investigated using the VSA model to simulate tool wear, breakage or other potential sources of vari- ation in the process. An example of both applications using a simple assembly will form the basis for a discussion of the VSA audit approach, its strengths, weaknesses and potential benefits for an organization. 911649. (SP-877) Commercial Stirling engine development and applications. Lennart N. Johansson and Ted M. Godett, Stirling Thermal Motors Inc.; James E. Bennethum , Detroit Diesel Corp.; and Thomas D. Laymac , Michigan Technological Univ. Stirling Thermal Motors, Inc. (STM) has been developing and testing a general purpose Stirling engine, designated the STM4- 120. The engine was optimized to produce 25 kW at 1800 RPM and features a four-cycle, double-acting configuration, resulting in high specific power with variable displacement power control for high efficiency over a wide power range. During the last year, Stirling Thermal Motors, Inc. (STM) and Detroit Diesel Corporation (DDC) began a cooperative effort to develop this engine for commercial applications. This engine has demonstrated performance and fuel efficiency equivalent to a diesel with superior emission and noise characteristics. These qualities, in addition to the engine's multifuel capability and the potential for long service free life, have generated interest in man- ufacturing and marketing this engine for commercial applications where operating requirements are not attainable with today's die- sel engine. This paper describes the key technological developments which make the STM4-120 Stirling engine suitable for commer- cialization. Near-term applications including industrial generator sets, marine auxiliary power units (APU), generator sets for hybrid electric vehicles, and military power plants will be pur- sued. Later applications include cryocoolers. The development plans for one particular application, Stirling based hybrid electric buses, is discussed. 911650. Optimized E.F.I, for natural gas fueled engines. N. John Beck , William P. Johnson , and Peter W. Petersen , BKM, Inc. Increasing emphasis on natural gas as a clean, economical, and abundant fuel, encourages the search for the optimum approach to management of fuel, air and combustion to achieve the best results in power, fuel economy and low exhaust emissions. Elec- tronic injection of fuel directly into the throttle body, intake ports or directly into the cylinder offers important advantages over car- buretion or mixing valves. This is particularly true in the case of installations in which the gas supply is available at several atmo- spheres pressure above maximum intake manifold pressure. The use of choked-flow pulse-width-modulated electronic injectors offers precision control over the engine operating range with a wide variety of options for both stoichiometric and lean burn applications. A complete system utilizing commercially available components together with the application, calibration and engine mapping techniques is described. It is projected that ultimately electronic fuel injection will replace carburetors and mixing valves in the same manner as occurred for gasoline fueled engines and for the same reasons. The application to the twin fuel and dual fuel installations is also discussed, along with a perspective of the potential for future improvements. 1991 SAE Transactions Section 4 911651. Modern Mercedes-Benz commercial vehicle engines for the U.S. and Mexican markets. Gerhard J. Frankle and M. von Mayenburg, Mercedes-Benz AG. Mercedes-Benz have developed their 4, 5 and 6-cylinder series 300 and 400 diesel engines for the U.S. and Mexican truck mar- kets. These direct injection and air-to-air charge air cooled engine are of low weight and offer the high power-to-zize ratio required for modern truck applications. The paper presents an overview of legal regulations in the countries where the engines will be offered and highlights tech- nology needed to meet 1991 U.S. emission limits. It deals with the tuning of the combustion process, adaptation of injection and turbocharging systems and design of the injection timing system. The new Mercedes-Benz flame heater systems help to further optimize running characteristics of a cold engine in order to meet environmental criteria during starting, warm up and in the run- ning mode. Designing for future, more stringent emission requirements are also discussed. The new engine being introduced is the in-line Mercedes-Benz OM 366 LA. Other engines discussed will be introduced at a later date. 911652. Activities of the SAE committee on dual/high voltage vehicle electrical systems./. Vincent Hellmann, General Motors Corp.; and Robert J. Sandel, Ford Motor Co. During the past two years, a group of interested engineers have assembled and formed the SAE Dual/High Voltage study group. The participants have an awareness that today's 12 volt electrical power system may not be able to keep pace with forthcoming electronic technology and continued increasing electrical loading in modern automobiles. Their purpose is to address the implica- tions of higher and/or multiple voltages and to make recommen- dations that will facilitate some acceptable global standards. 194</page><page sequence="194">911652-911662 This paper traces the course of the study committee work, reports on their deliberations and interim conclusions, and out- lines items currently under study and discussion. Of special inter- est are the recommendations on the limit for an admissible con- tact voltage and the schematic diagrams of electrical systems dis- cussed by committee members as possible candidates for the vehicle of the future. 911653. The future of vehicle electrical power systems and their impact on system design. G. A. Williams and M. J. Holt, Lucas Automotive Ltd. The electrical power system is the vital lifeline to most of the control systems on modern automobiles. The demands on the system are highly complex, and a detailed understanding of the system behaviour is necessary both to the process of systems inte- gration and to the economic design of a specific control system or actuator. The following general trends are observed: increased use of electrically actuated systems; increased use of electronic control; increasing requirements for high integrity power supplies for safety critical systems; increased average electrical power con- sumption (heating, actuation, control systems); increased electri- cal demand at engine idle combined with reducing idling speeds; increased interest in higher voltage systems; and electrical system problems are a major cause of road-side breakdowns. These trends clearly indicate major changes in the require- ments of vehicle electrical power supply systems, and will demand considerable activity from the vehicle industry in the next decade. Development of new electrical power systems can only be effectively achieved in partnership between the vehicle manufacturers (VMs) and the component and system suppliers on an international level, leading to standardisation and the ben- efits of large scale. Fundamental problems in existing system should be consid- ered during design and development of new electrical systems. The main aim of the paper is to illustrate and promote a systems view of electric power while considering existing and future prob- lems and opportunities. 1 991 SAE Transactions Section 6 911654. Design considerations for higher voltage automotive electrical systems. Michael F. Matouka, General Motors Corp. Raising the 12 volt electrical system voltage or adding a 24, 36, or 48 volt power source will have a tremendous impact on auto- mobiles and the automotive industry. The impact will be on cost, mass, size, complexity, performance, fuel economy, reliability, serviceability, and customer satisfaction. The decision to proceed with a change cannot be made solely on the obvious benefits of higher voltage systems. There are also many disadvantages and many questions that need to be answered regarding the effect of higher voltage on the various components. 1991 SAE Transactions Section 6 911655. Impact of higher vehicle system voltage on automotive batteries. Richard T. Johnson, Johnson Controls Battery Group, Inc. The need for salable features, lower exhaust emissions, greater efficiency and improved safety for tomorrow's vehicles is increas- ing the demand for electrical power. Raising vehicle system volt- age from twelve volts is seen as an effective step toward meeting future power requirements while increasing generation, rectifica- tion, transmission and switching efficiencies. Higher system volt- age will require higher voltage energy storage devices, i.e. batter- ies. Implications for the design and function of vehicle batteries, as well as manufacturing and reliability, are substantial. 911656. Electromagnetic components in dual voltage systems. Eric Macke and Bob Mohan, Ford Motor Co. This paper discusses design and testing of a regulated dual voltage automotive electrical system that provides both 48 and 12 volt subsystems. The paper focuses on the design, perfor- mance, and manufactuirng differences between 12 volt and 48 volt electromagnetic components for vehicle applications. Dual voltage systems have inherent benefits of lower current consumption, smaller/lighter wiring harnesses, and potential improvement in system efficiencies. These benefits help some automotive operations, but are not readily transferred to the elec- tromagnetic product arena. 911657. Power dissipation in MOS power transistors for auto- motive applications: system voltage considerations. James C. Erskine, Electrical and Electronics Engrg. Dept., General Motors Research Labs. The specific on-resistance (product of chip resistance and chip area) of power MOSFET's increases as a power of the transistor breakdown voltage. The exponent is 1.8 for today's transistors and will be about 2.0 for next generation power MOS power tran- sistors. This dependence results in a relatively small reduction in transistor power dissipation with increasing battery voltage of today's MOS power transistors and no change for the next genera- tion devices. Reducing the safety margin (ratio of breakdown voltage to battery voltage) will significantly reduce power dissipa- tion for all battery voltages but requires regulation of the power bus voltage to protect the transistor from overvoltage. 1991 SAE Transactions Section 6 911658. The impact of higher system voltage on automotive semiconductors. Ben Davis, Richard Valentine, and Randy Frank, Motorola Semiconductor Products Sector. Doubling or quadrupling the present 12V electrical system provides advantages and disadvantages to many components, and to systems that utilize these components. The effect that this increase has on vehicle electronics starts at the semiconductor component level. Several design implications including technol- ogy tradeoffs must be evaluated, and the cost impact on silicon area, processing complexity, and current process limitations con- sidered. This paper focuses on the impact of increasing the sys- tem voltage to 24V or 48V with and without centralized load dump transient suppression. The semiconductor devices princi- pally affected are transiet suppression devices, power semicon- ductors, smart power ICs and linear drivers. In addition, the effect of a change in system voltage on MCUs, DSPs, memory devices, and other interface circuits will be discussed. 911661. (SP-876) LNG vehicle demonstration projects. Nancy C. Pehrson, Div. of Arkla, Minnegasco. Liquified natural gas (LNG) may provide economic opportu- nities and be the preferred natural gas vehicle fuel, depending on range, fueling transfer rate requirements and gross vehicle weight (GVW) limitations. Current inexperience with LNG calls for the evaluation of demonstration projects involving LNG vehicle fueling stations and on-board vehicle storage systems. 911662. Natural gas as a dual fuel in marine engines - An operational study. Ian A. Smart, Ministry of Transportation and Highways, Province of British Columbia. A pair of Caterpillar 3406B turbo charged diesel engines were converted to operate in a dual fuel mode installed in a small vehi- cle and passenger ferry and evaluated for performance for both diesel and natural gas operation. Full load power was achieved with dual fueling without knock. The "life" of the engines was extended from 15,000 marine hours to 30,000 marine hours (120, 000 miles). This is equivalent to 600,000 miles and 1,200,000 miles in a road or truck application. Piston, piston rings, valve and bearing wear, was found to be significantly reduced and C02 concentrations in the exhaust were also minimized. Lubricating oil life was also extended. 195</page><page sequence="195">911663-911671 911663. (SP-876) Natural gas conversion systems for heavy duty truck engines. L. E. Gettel and G. C. Perry, British Columbia Research. An electronic dual fuel natural gas/diesel conversion system has been developed for the Caterpillar 3406 diesel engine with the programmable electronic engine control (PEEC) system. This system is microprocessor based, and interfaces with the Caterpil- lar PEEC system to allow control of diesel injection timing as well as fuel quantity. Control of injection timing allows pilot fuel levels as low as 3% at full load, however, to ensure good transient response, minimum pilot level is about 10%. The completed sys- tem has similar performance to the diesel engine, with compara- ble efficiency at full load. Furthermore, the engine's governing characteristics are similar on dual fuel or diesel only operation. Carbon monoxide and hydrocarbon exhaust emissions are higher than on diesel, particularly at light load, however, oxides of nitro- gen emissions are lower. 911666. (SP-876) Operation of a class 8 truck on natural gas/ diesel. Michael S. Sinclair, Canadian Resourcecon Ltd.; and Joseph J. H addon, B.C. Gas Inc. This paper presents the results of a one-year demonstration project in which a class 8 tractor based in Vancouver, British Columbia was converted to dual fuel natural gas/diesel opera- tion. The objective of this project was to demonstrate the viabil- ity of fuelling and operating class 8 trucks on natural gas/diesel under commercial operating conditions. In assessing the viability of the natural gas/diesel system, data were collected and analyzed concerning comparative fuel efficiency, natural gas/diesel pro- portions of fuel use, operating range, refuelling times, and relative fuel costs, along with assessments of its performance by drivers and fleet management. The truck has now been in commercial service for more than two years and has logged in excess of 100, 000 km. 911667. (SP-876) New perspectives on auto propane as a mass- scale motor vehicle fuel. Reginald F. Webb and Paul J. Delmas, R.F. Webb Corp. While today propane is the most widely used alternative to gasoline and diesel fuel as a transportation fuel, it is not being adequately considered as a mass-scale alterantive transportation fuel (ATF) for the future by policy makers and engine manufac- turers. Recent data and interpretations of the comparative supply, performance and cost of propane and liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) relative to other transportation fuels support the view that propane is a practical ATF option. Data is provided on new sources of LPG supply; evaporative, tailpipe and greenhouse gas emissions; new LPG engine technologies including flexible fuel, liquid injection and emission control systems; new equipment to facilitate self-service retailing and to improve propane safety. The early adoption of propane and natural gas as alternative transportation fuels will minimize the long range cost of conver- sion of the U.S. transportation system to the ultimate clean motor vehicle fuel of the future -hydrogen. The thesis is advanced that the long range goals for air quality and energy security established by recent U.S. legislation can best be achieved by large scale use of a triad of gaseous fuels -natural gas, propane and hydrogen. 911668. Identification and analysis of excess CO emissions using EPA approved short tests and remote sensing. Ken Nelson, Kim Bruce Livo, and Ron Ragazzi, Colorado Dept. of Health; and Jerry Gallagher, Air Pollution Control Div., Colorado Dept. of Health. The Colorado Department of Health (CDH) collected CO exhaust emissions data from twenty-one vehicles using three "short" emissions tests, and the Federal Test Procedure (FTP). CO data were also collected from these vehicles using a remote sensing system. Excess carbon monoxide emissions were calcu- lated from the difference between FTP measurements and federal standards. Emissions were then categorized by individual vehicle and by vehicle type. Errors of comission and omission were deter- mined for each of the short tests and remote sensing system. The CDH226 showed the highest correlation for identifying vehicles emitting excessive CO. Compared to the FTP, it identi- fied the vehicles responsible for 98.5% of all excess emissions. All the "short" tests and remote sensing tests identified the vehicles producing the majority of excess emissions. The current BAR '84 type idle "short" test and the CDH226 demonstrated the lowest errors of comission, or false failures. Both tests had zero false fail- ures for an error of comission rate of 0%. The remote sensing test experienced a 14.3% error of comission, the highest error of com- ission. 911669. California's heavy-duty vehicle smoke and tampering inspection program. Paul E. Jacobs, Donald J. Chernich, and John D. Kowalski, California Air Resources Board. Emissions from heavy-duty vehicles are a major contributor to California's air quality problems. Emissions from these vehi- cles account for approximately 30% of the nitrogen oxide and 75% of the particulate matter emissions from the entire on-road vehicle fleet. Additionally, excessive exhaust smoke from in-use heavy-duty diesel vehicles is a target of numerous public com- plaints. In response to these concerns, California has adopted an in-use heavy-duty vehicle smoke and tampering inspection pro- gram (HDVIP) designed to significantly reduce emissions from these vehicles. Pending promulgation of HDVIP regulations, vehicles failing prescribed test procedures and emission stan- dards will be issued citations. These citations mandate expedient repair of the vehicle and carry civil penalties ranging from $300 to $1800. Failure to clear citations can result in the vehicle being removed from service. It is projected that this program will reduce nitrogen oxide, hydrocarbon and particulate matter emis- sions from these vehicles by 19, 22 and 32 tons per day respec- tively at a cost effectiveness ranging from $0.44 to $0.47 per pound reduced. 911670. Development of mechanic qualification requirements for a centralized I/M program. T. C. Austin and H. A. Ashby, Sierra Research, Inc.; B. J. Jackson, British Columbia Inspection and Maintenance Program; and J. M. Lyons, Sierra Research, Inc. The development and application of qualification require- ments for automotive service technicians and mechanics partici- pating in vehicle emissions inspection and maintenance (I/M) programs is vital to the realization of maximum emissions reduc- tions. Using the existing Britich Columbia (B.C.) trades qualifica- tion system for mechanics as a screening mechanism, the provin- cial I/M mechanic certification requirements take into account not only skill and knowledge related to automotive emissions control, but knowledge regarding the administrative require- ments of the program as well. In addition to rigorous mechanic qualification requirements, the centralized B.C. inspection pro- gram will include loaded-mode testing and NOx measurement, as well as thorough visual and functional inspection of emissions control components. Additionally, computer-stored fault codes will be retrieved during the inspection, and transmitted along with applicable technical service bulletins to the mechanics per- forming repairs, thus providng an unprecedented level of diag- nostic information to mechanics. 911671. A comparison of heavy-duty diesel truck engine smoke opacities at high altitude and at sea level. Donald J. Chernich, Paul E. Jacobs, and John D. Kowalski, California Air Resources Board. A study was conducted by the California Air Resources Board to investigate the effects that altitude has on in-use heavy-duty diesel truck smoke opacities. The understanding of these effects may allow for the establishment of a high altitude opacity stan- 196</page><page sequence="196">911671-911675 dard for diesel trucks operating at or above altitudes of 5800 feet. During a three-week study, 170 heavy-duty diesel trucks were tested at an altitude of 5,820 feet using a test procedure consisting of rolling acceleration and snap idle tests. Eighty-four (84) of these trucks were recaptured and retested at an altitude of 125 feet. Results from a regression analysis indicates that, on average, truck smoke opacities increased by 23 opacity points when tested at altitudes near 6000 feet. Possible high altitude cutpoints and failure rates are also discussed. 911672. Identifying excess emitters with a remote sensing device: a preliminary analysis. Edward L. Glover and William B. Clemmens, U.S. Environmental Protection Agency. There has been considerable interest in applying remote mea- suring methods to sample in-use vehicle emissions, and to char- acterize fleet emission behavior. A remote sensing device (RSD) was used to measure on-road carbon monoxide (CO) emissions from approximately 350 in-use vehicles that had undergone tran- sient mass emission testing at a centralized I/M lane. On-road hydrocarbon (HC) emissions were also measured by the RSD on about 50 of these vehicles. Analysis of the data indicates that the RSD identified a comparable number of the high CO emitters as the two speed I/M test only when an RSD cutpoint much more stringent than current practice was used. Both RSD and I/M had significant errors of omission in identifying high CO emitters based on the mass emission test. The test data were also used to study the ability of the RSD to characterize fleet CO emissions. 911673. (SP-877) Organizational responses to intelligent vehi- cle-highway systems. Kan Chen , University of Michigan ; and Robert L. French , R.L. French and Associates. Intelligent vehicle-highway systems (IVHS), based on the amalgamation of information technology with automotive and highway technologies, promise to help public authorities improve traffic efficiency and safety, while presenting new busi- ness opportunities to many private companies. However, IVHS also present new challenges to the cooperation of public and pri- vate sectors in an uncertain new market. Based on a relatively wide range of contacts and discussions with public, private, and academic institutions around the world, the authors try to sum- marize their observations regarding the organizational responses to IVHS in recent years. Both commonality and differences in these responses are discussed. Among the common trends are the formation of consortia and alliances among public, private, and academic institutions; the formation of multidisciplinary teams that work on both basic and applied research; a gradual shift from precompetitive cooperation in program planning toward increasing competition in system differentiation and product development; and an apparaent migration from international competition toward increasing international cooperation. Some professional societies whose scope encompasses important aspects of IVHS have responded by promulgation of IVHS information through their journals and conferences. Differences in organizational responses exist across sectors (public, private, and academic), across industries (automotive, electronics, and communications), and across country blocs (Eu- rope, North America, Pacific Rim, and the newly industrialized countries). Significant differences also exist within each sector, each industry, and each country bloc. Many of the differences seem to be explicable in terms of internal organizational charac- teristics such as the degree of vertical integration, the organiza- tion's traditional strength, the perception of market uncertainty, timing and relevance to organizational capabilities, and strategic choices (e.g., market leader versus follower). Other explaining factors are external to the organizations, such as different societal needs (e.g., urgency in congestion relief), different perception and evaluation of IVHS effectiveness, different legal and institutional barriers, etc. Few, if any, organizational responses to date have been in opposition to IVHS. The authors conclude that a better understanding of the com- monality and differences of organizational responses can be help- ful in public and strategic policy decisions regarding the new opportunities and challenges in IVHS. 911674. (SP-877) Organizational response to intelligent vehi- cle-highway systems in North America: analysis from case studies and historical precedents. Frank P. Stafford and Steven E. Underwood, University of Michigan. Intelligent vehicle-highway systems (IVHS) offer the prospect for improving the effectiveness of the existing road transporta- tion system through the application of advanced computer, elec- tronics, and communications technology. Recent efforts within government, industry, and academia have been directed toward capitalizing on the opportunities promised by such systems. Pub- lic agencies see the potential for improvements in safety and bet- ter traffic management through more effective information dis- semination to the traveler. Industry anticipates growing markets for products and services which make travel more efficient and enjoyable, or at least less of a bother. Academia is positioning to provide the fundamental and applied research necessary for the design and analysis of these systems. Educators also recognize the need for college and continuing education of professionals trained in disciplines relevant to the design and management of IVHS. While the potential benefits of IVHS are relatively clear, the appropriate organizational responses are better characterized as murky, due in large part to the divisions of responsibility and authority among the institutional actors and their inherent inter- dependence in a providing coordinated, intelligent, road trans- portation system. This paper addresses the issue of appropriate organization response by the various actors with stakes in IVHS. It starts with a characterization of the research, development, demonstration, and implementation environment for IVHS in North America. The systems, technologies and user requirements are described along with the nature of the dilemma in providing the necessary infrastructure and in-vehicle equipment. A typology of the actors and their interests in IVHS is then presented in order to clarify the range of roles and possible appropriate responses for the vari- ous actors. This typology was constructed through information gathered in face-to-face interviews with representatives of organi- zations currently active in IVHS. Potential collective responses to IVHS are formulated through analogies to similar historical developments including the development of electrical power over the period 1890-1930, high definition television in the 1980s, and videocasette recorders. Parallels between the historical cases and the development of IVHS serve as the basis for lessons which may benefit organizations in their planning for IVHS. Consis- tency is sought between the lessons and the interests of the vari- ous parties which may be dovetailed for an effective collective response. 911675. (SP-877) The development of IVHS in Europe. Bob McQueen and Ian Catling, Ian Catling Consultancy, Ltd. Over the past two years a variety of European IVHS initiatives have emerged, quickening the pace set by earlier development work such as Autoguide and LISB. Migration from early conceptual development to tangible technologies, almost ready for large-scale exploitation is well underway. In particular, the EC Drive Programme and the European vehicle manaufacturers Prometheus programme have acted as catalysts in generating interest in the application of the new tech- nologies. The complete range of European IVHS initiatives is wide and varied. However, it is not our intention to offer a comprehensive overview in this paper. 197</page><page sequence="197">911675-911683 Instead, this paper covers an outline of current European IVHS applications and developments, focusing on those technol- ogies that are, or likely to be, implemented on a significant scale, over the next 5 years. The impending implementation of such technologies prom- ises to have a dramatic impact on almost every facet of society including the travelling public, commercial organisations and central/local government. The likely impact on such organisations is only now being defined and assessed. This is discussed in context with the observed responses from such organisations to date. The final section of this paper, deals with the way in which IVHS technologies may be utilised in the medium to long term, with the likely impact on travel and society. 911676. (SP-877) Some structural aspects on the "info- mobility" related projects in Japan. Hironao Kawashima , Keio Univ.; Kozo Kitoh, JSK Info-Mobility Research Committee ; and Haruki Fujii, Association of Electronic Technology for Automo- tive Traffic and Driving (JSK). In order to successfully launch the info-mobility or I VHS/RTI systems in the society, many advanced technologies could be properly utilized with necessary R&amp;D and related activities. The realizations of the info-mobility related systems also require rela- tively long time range from concept and R&amp;D stages to final real- ization of the systems. How to efficiently coordinate these differ- ent stages ranging many years could be one of the important and difficult problems we face today to successfully launch the sys- tems in the society. This paper describes the following items with some examples of the past and presently on-going info-mobility related projects in Japan, i.e., roles of public organizations, phases of activities, cooperations between public and private sec- tors, etc. 911677. (SP-877) From area licensing to electronic road pric- ing: a case study in vehicle restraint. Brian G. Field, School of Building and Estate Management, National University of Singa- pore. The urban transport problem is usually perceived as a disequi- librium, at peak times, between the supply of transport infrastruc- ture and the demand for the use of this infrastructure by an increasing population for more journeys. Given the consequent problems of congestion and the environmental constraints acting against any substantial increase in road capacity, the ultimate necessity to restrain the use of the private car is obvious. Policy makers have responded with a range of vehicle restraint measures including petrol taxes, parking controls, traffic management, etc., all of which have contributed to the containment of the problem but are also recognised as short-term palliatives pending the implementation of more radical solutions. Transport economists have generally argued that the only comprehensive long-term solution lies with the introduction of road pricing, and this paper evaluates Singapore's unique experience in actually employing the price mechanism to ration more effectively the use of roads during periods of peak demand, and considers some of the ramifi- cations of such a policy. 911678. (SP-877) Australian initiatives and responses to IVHS. John E. Longfoot, Traffic Control Section, Roads and Traffic Authority. Australia has a number of local conditions which are quite dif- ferent to most other countries. It is a large continent with a mod- est population. An extensive road network is required which must be serviced from limited taxes. The result is a system where urban traffic is carried by arterial road systems and two lane roads provide the inter city links. These road conditions resulted in serious problems over twenty years ago. This led to the development of "technology" solutions then, just as IVHS has lately emerged as a "technology" solution in the US. In Australia an ATMS was developed early and a new system for on line measurement of travel time has been produced and installed. IVHS initiative in Austrilia has been led by government. However, a number of Australian companies are organising con- sortia to exploit the growth of IVHS technology. The advent of IVHS is seen as an opportunity in Australia, to combine our present technology with newly emerging IVHS tech- nologies in North America to our mutual benefit. 911680. (SP-877) A human factors study of driver reaction to in-vehicle navigation systems. R. Wade Allen and David Zied - man, Systems Technology, Inc.; Jaime F. Torres, JFT Assoc.; Abolhassan Halati, JFT Associates ; and Theodore J. Rosenthal and Anthony C. Stein, Systems Technology, Inc. This paper describes a laboratory simulation study of driver reaction to in-vehicle navigation systems. The study included a pre-test questionnaire on demographic background and commut- ing behavior, simulation testing of navigation decision making, and a post-test questionnaire on navigation systems and the labo- ratory simulation. A total of 277 subjects, both male and female, were employed over a wide range of ages. Test subjects were assigned to one of four navigation system groups or a no-system control group for the purpose of comparing system performance. The simulation task required subjects to experience a commuting 'drive' on a Southern California freeway route and minimize trip time by diverting off the main route to avoid congestion. Subjects were given orientation and training on the simulation and their navigation system condition, and were motivated by rewards and penalties to minimize trip time. Simulation results showed that diversion decision making improved with increasing navigation system feedback containing congestion and route diversion information. Questionnaire results showed reasonable acceptance for use of in-vehicle sys- tems for navigation, and a generally positive response to the sim- ulation experience. 911681. Head up display concepts for commercial trucks. Alan R. Greenland and Doyle J. Groves, Delco Electronics Corp. General Motors introduced the first production head up dis- play (HUD) in the United States in the 1988 Oldsmobile Cultass Supreme Indianapolis "500" pace car parade convertibles. Since then, HUDs have been available in limited production on selected GM automobiles. This display technology can also be adapted to commercial trucks. The basic automotive HUD con- cepts are briefly reviewed, then design trade-offs specific to the truck application are discussed. Finally, a description is included of the first prototype HUD installation into a big-rig truck cab. 911682. (SP-877) Integrating transit, paratransit and rideshar- ing services via IVHS/FOCCS technologies. Park Woodworth, Tri-County Metropolitan Transit District of Oregon; and Robert W. Behnke, Aegis Transportation Information Systems, Inc. Germany, France and other foreign countries have used new computer and communications technologies in innovative ways to increase the quality and reduce the costs of public transporta- tion services in urban, suburban and rural areas. This paper pro- vides an introduction to the German Flexible Operations Com- mand and Control System (FOCCS) and its predecessor the Ruf- Bus (i.e. call-a-bus) system. It also outlines how these intelligent vehicle-highway systems (IVHS)-approaches could be adapted to improve the cost-effectiveness of transit, paratransit and ride- sharing services in U.S. cities and counties. 911683. (SP-877) Transportation resources information pro- cessing system (TRIPS). Robert Ratcliff, California Dept. of Transportation; and Robert W. Behnke, Aegis Transportation Information Systems, Inc. 198</page><page sequence="198">911683-911699 California's Department of Transportation (CALTRANS) is developing a plan to team with public and private organizations, domestic and foreign, to develop a Transportation Resources Information Processing System (TRIPS) which will permit urban, suburban and rural communities to use the public tele- phone network to better manage their local transportation resources. TRIPS will use computers and telecommunications to provide drivers, riders, and other local transportation decision- makers with better information about local travel alternatives, including new types of low-cost, door-to-door public transporta- tion services. Preliminary research indicates that TRIPS could greatly increase the productivity of local transportation systems at a low cost to taxpayers. 911684. (SP-876) Preparation and testig of an electric competi- tion vehicle. Edward Aś Bass and Bruce Mabrito , Southwest Research Institute ; and Larry Atkins , Standard Industries. A Dodge Omni electric car was prepared for competition in an electric "stock car" 2-hour endurance event: the inaugural solar and electric 500 race, April 7, 1991. This entry utilized a series- wound, direct-current 21-hp electric motor controlled by an SCR frequency and pulse width modulator. Two types of lead-acid batteries were evaluated and the final configuration was a set of 16 (6-volt each) deep-cycle units. Preparation involved weight and friction reduction; suspen- sion modification; load, charge and temperature instrumenta- tion; and electrical interlock and collision safety systems. Vehicle testing totalled 15 hours of operation. Ranges observed in testing with the final configuration were from 30 to 52 miles for loads of 175 to 90 amperes. These were nearly constant, continuous dis- charge cycles. The track qualifying speed (64 mph) was near the 68 mph record set by the DEMI Honda at the event on the one- mile track. Based on test data, a strategy was developed for the event to allow 2 hours of continuous operation, while maximizing dis- tance traveled. This resulted in a plan of 90 amperes at approxi- mately 30 mph. Improvements are necessary in transmission gear ratios, motor controls and battery energy density to improve overall per- formance. Other plans for development include possible conver- sion to hybrid operation (with a range extender I.C. engine) and supplemental power supplies such as a thermoelectric waste heat generator. 911685. The two-stroke cycle engine, proscribe or prosper. Gordon P. Blair, Dept. of Mech. and Manufacturing Engrg., Queen 's Univ. of Belfast. This address is concerned with the work carried out by an engineeirng academic at The Queen's University of Belfast over the last 26 years. It describes the motivation which impelled the author toward a career in mechanical engineering and into a spe- cialist field from which he has never strayed. It describes research and development into the design of the two-stroke cycle engine, which today is identified as a potential candidate for automobile powerplant production within the decade. At the same time the address illustrated that much of this research and development, including the design, manufacture, build, test, and development of prototype automotive engines, has been heavily contributed to by both undergraduate and postgraduate students as part of their education and training at the university. It is contended that this approach is a vital component of a relevant university education and training for student and academic alike. 911695. (P-245) Use of alternative transportation fuels and its environmental implications in Canada. Chandra B. Prakash, Transportation Systems Div., Environment Canada. Motor vehicles using gasoline and diesel fuel are major con- tributors to atmospheric pollution. There are several alternative fuels that are potentially cleaner than current gasoline and diesel fuel. Exhaust emission measurements of regulated and non- regulated pollutants using a number of alternative fuels including low level alcohol-gasoline blends, natural gas, propane, and methanol in selected vehicles show certain environmental/air quality benefits and indicate future potential to further reduce the motor vehicle emissions. 911697. Potential savings by fuel-economy engine and trans- mission oils. Wilfried J. Bartz, Technische Akademie Esslingen. Applying lubricants is one of the most important measures to reduce friction and wear. Improving the mechanical efficiency of engines and gears by reducing the frictional losses in the mixed film and in the fluid film lubricant regime in principle facilitates the reduction of fuel consumption of the engine or of the energy needed to operate the cars. The maximum consumption reduction that is theoretically possible with lubricating measures is estimated by means of the efficiency analysis of engines and gears and the proportionate effects of lower viscosity and additives reducing friction are eval- uated. The estimate is made on the basis of the given relationship between friction and fuel consumption. Obviously, the possible consumption reductions at partial loads and lower temperatures are higher than at full load and operating temperature. This deter- mines the relevant consequences regarding the possible total energy reductions under political economy aspects. It will be shown that these states of operation, resulting in the highest reductions of fuel, only cover a relatively small range of the total operating times of vehicles. Therefore, possible reductions are more limited than normally is assumed when particularly unfa- vorable conditions are taken as a basis for estimating the effects of lubricant-based measures. The results of this analysis leading to a realistic assessment of total reductions are compared with published data, which will be critically evaluated. 1991 SAE Transactions Section 4 911698. (P-245) Design, evaluation and manufacture of lubri- cant additives in Argentina. Monica Graciela Vázquez, Yacimien- tos Petrolíferos Fiscales, G.G.A.T.; Raúl Bouquet and Liliana Bazzo, Yacimientos Petrolifero Fiscales, G.G.A.T.; Patricia Erre- calde, Yacimientos Petrolíferos Fiscales, G.G. A. T.; and Gerardo Perez, Yacimientos Petrolifero Fiscales, G.G. A. T. Modern engines demand better performance from the lubri- cant. In order to fulfill them it is necessary to add the base oil some products that are called "additives". Between them the zinc dialquilditiophosphate family is worldwide used, and there has not been another product better than this as antioxidant- antiwear-anticorrosive. Such performance is very closely related to its thermic stability and chemical structure. Our research and development group began to work in a six stages project which covered the deep action mechanism's analysis to a manufacture agreement with a private company. At industrial scale it has been got a product which has been tested not only by standard determi- nations but also in bench, engine and fleet tests. As a result we got not only a competitive product both in price and quality, but also the growth of local suppliers of critical components to the petroleum industry. 911699. (P-245) Diesel engine oil consumption depending on piston ring design. Hideki Yoshida, Kazunori Kusama, and Hiroyuki Kobayashi, Riken Corp. Today preservation of the global environment is an interna- tional challenge, and air pollution has attracted more concern than ever. Especially, pollution due to exhaust emission from automobiles is a serious matter, and among others, the improve- ment of exhaust emission is urgent. For this purpose, regulations have been tightened on exhaust emission such as particulate con- trol and NOx control. Thus, it is essential for oil consumption of diesel engines to reduce oil consumption and employ exhaust gas 199</page><page sequence="199">911699-911707 recirculation (EGR), and piston rings are the important key to solve these problems. This paper clarifies the effect of top rings, among piston rings, on oil consumption through engine tests and theoretical calcula- tion of oil film thickness, and suggests techniques to reduce oil consumption. 911700. (P-245) Polymeric fluid as lubricant - Its character- ization in non-newtonian flow. Rubén Victor Figini, Universidad Nacional de La Plata; and Clotilde Godoy Tinta, Yacimientos Petrolíferos Fiscales, G. G. A. T. It is presented a general procedure to calculate the modifica- tion of the basic equation for hydrodynamic lubrication brought about by the use of polymeric fluids with shear depending viscos- ity. The procedure is based on the generalized newtonian fluid model and allows to treat all type of flows. For a given function between viscosity and shear stress the results show that the influence of the non-newtonian behavior is completely characterized by one dimensionless number, namely 2.U.T*/h* where U is the relative sliding velocity, H* is the charactistic film thickness and t* a characteristic time of the lubricant. The use of the procedure is exemplified applying it to determine the relation between hydrodynamic lubrication and average molecular weight, molar mass distribution and concen- tration of the polymer component and the viscosity of the solvent or polymerfree oil. Some practical aspects of this relation are dis- cussed. 911701. (P-245) Natural gas engine oil development.

A natural gas engine oil must be designed and balanced in a proper way in order to be able to offer: excellent deposit control, superior oxidation and nitration control, extended lubricant filter and engine life and reduced frequency of shutdowns for mainte- nance. In order to choose a correct formulation, it was decided to run a field test where five different low ash additive packages were tested. The selected engines are five WAUKESHA, model H2475, they are rated at 300 HP and are used for water pumping. The five engines were rebuilt before the beginning of the test. The liner diameters were measured, the same as the ring gaps. At the end of the test, that lasted 10.500 hs., the measurements were repeated and pistons and crankcases were inspected and califi- cated for deposit formation. Each 700 hours, a lubricant sample was analyzed for its main characteristics in order to evaluate its performance. 911702. (P-245) Feasible non-polluting car engines using air- water components. Dino Dini, University of Pisa. The paper is dealing alternative non-polluting engines for driving cars. Only air-water system components are used as work- ing and heating fluids. Through optimization processes, gaseous nitrogen, oxygen and hydrogen, from air and water, may be obtained at acceptable energy (solar or nuclear) need, to be con- verted in liquid form at low cost. Using such cryogenic liquid flu- ids, solutions are proposed for car heat engines not producing air pollution and greenhouse warming, i.e.: 1) high pressure and tem- perature multiple expansion reciprocating engine, with water steam as working fluid produced in a H2/O2/H2O combustion chamber. In a closed cycle, water steam is condensed by an air- radiator; and 2) superheated and reheated nitrogen in a double acting reciprocating gas expander, whose open cycle get heat from hydrogen-air combustion. 911703. (P-245) Hydrogen fuel storage using activated carbon for vehicles. Karl S. Youg, Yung Technologies International, Inc. Carbon adsorption has been found to be an excellent method to store hydrogen. This is an ideal method for weight sensitive applications without the high pressures of compressed hydrogen gas, and the cryogenic temperatures of liquid hydrogen (20°K/- 253°C). At 150°K (-123°C) and 55-atm (810-psig), hydogen is adsorbed in its condensed phase over the vast surface area of the carbon. The adsorption method can store nearly 2-times more hydrogen than in pure compression at the same conditions. Hydrogen combustion by-product is solely water. In air, combus- tion by-products also include a small quantity of NOx. Vehicles fitted with hydrogen fuel cells can deliver the same power and twice as much range as gasoline or diesel vehicles, but without the pollutants. Hydrogen is the cleanest and most efficient fuel know, and it is totally renewable. 911704. (P-245) The UNICAMP experiments with hydrogen vehicles. Ennio Peres Da Silva, Universidad Estadual De Campi- nas. This work presents the research and development program of Laboratorio de Hidrogénio da UNICAMP for substitution of automotive petroleum fuels by electrolytic produced hydrogen. The possibilities of partial diesel substitution by one mixture of diesel and hydrogen and the total gasoline substitution in a Otto- cycle engine were examined. In both cases the hydrogen storage was realized in the hydride form, with the manufacture of one res- ervoir of FeTi alloy and other of Mg-Ni alloy. This option for the hydride form was because the massive use of hydrogen requires an adequate solution for the problem of its storage. The diagrams of the gas installation in the vehicles, the reser- voirs and the adaptation of the gasoline and diesel vehicles to hydrogen are also presented. 911705. (P-245) A statistical analysis of the variability of the braking efficiency of new, original equipment brake sets installed in the same vehicle. JoseL. Bascunana, U.S. Dept. of Transporta- tion. This paper evaluates statistically the variability of braking effi- ciency obtained with new, original equipment (OE) brake sets, installed successively in the same vehicle. The analysis separates the components of braking efficiency variability caused by: 1) production variability among brake sets (due to differences in materials, machining, and assembling); and 2) measuring errors (pertaining to the braking measurement methods and measuring personnel). The data was obtained using three different methods: torque wheels, a low speed roller dynamometer, and "road transducer plates" (RTP). The data was taken after burnishing each new brake set according to the Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standard No. 105. The most accurate results were provided by the torque wheel measurements conducted simultaneously on the four wheels. With this type of measurement, the variability of braking effi- ciency was due more to brake set differences than to measuring errors. The converse occurred for the low speed roller dynamom- eter and the RTP methods. 911707. (P-245) Qualitative industrial statistics. Gonzalo R. Longas, Lucas In diel S.A. The conventional statistical methods, today in use in our industrial plants, give the mathematical basis for solving gaussi- ans distribution models only or similar. This means that only about 5% of our modern industrial problems can be solved by these methods. The qualitative industrial statistic (Q.I.S.), that we present, covers the statistical needs, of our industrial plants providing a mathematic-technological system with the following characteris- tics. 200</page><page sequence="200">911707-911716 It makes possible the correct evaluation of eighty different models of industrial distribution curves (right and left skewed, rectangular, with upper, lower and both extremes limitation, sta- ble, unstable, with tendency, ciclical, etc.).

It makes possible the determination of limits for continuous control charts, adjusted to preestablished level of P.P.M. in order that if they conform the limits that guarantee the process will make products at that preestablished quality level. The mathe- matical formulaes in use today, used in a indiscriminated way for calculating these control limits, are fixed at ± 3 o and they admit 2700 P.P.M. when process consistenly accomplish at these limits. 911709. (P-245) Perspectives for the utilization of renewable fuels in Latin America. Claus Herzog and Amílcar Fryszman, Mercedes-Benz. This paper gives a broad view over the state-of-the-art in the field of alternative sources of energy for automotive vehicles, mainly those sources whose generation, storage and transporta- tion are made in a renewable way. Whenever possible, focus is made on the specific aspects con- cerned to the technological, environmental and economical situa- tion of Latin America. The renewable fuels discussed are ethanol, methanol, vegeta- ble oils, biogas, hydrogen and chemical batteries. Direct forms of convertion of solar energy into electricity are also discussed. 911710. (P-245) Effect of diesel fuel quality and additives on engine performance- An update. Jose C. Blanco, Exxon Chemi- cal Americas. The trend toward higher proportions of cracked components and heavier streams in the production of middle distillates to meet the growing market demand for transportation fuels, is hav- ing a significant effect on the fuel quality. This has become an issue among engine manufacturers and government organiza- tions concerned with vehicle performance, fuel economy and emissions. Additive technology is being used to help upgrade fuel quality in the areas of low temperature operability, oxidation sta- bility and combustion to assure satisfactory performance of die- sel fuels while allowing refiners to optimize production. This technical paper reviews the challenges in the automotive diesel area concentrating in ignition quality, emissions and fuel economy. The combustion benefits of higher cetane number and cleanliness characteristics of diesel fuels to prevent injector cok- ing have been demonstrated with the use of performance fuel additives. 911711. (P-245) How the variation of chemical composition of diesel fuel affects the operation of a kind of engine from the national market. Lia Ester Nadal and Ricardo Varales, Yacimien- tos Petrolíferos Fiscales Gerencia Gral, de Activos Tecnológicos ; and Antonio Monros and Juan Carlos Levrino, Perkins S.A. The constant needs for planning on energy subject in any country, are mainly based on making the best use of available raw materials, keeping up the fuel quality in the market and promot- ing the production of high added value products. With regard to diesel fuels, refining worldwide trends together with the arrival of various raw materials, have been pressing neg- atively on the quality of these fuels used in fast diesel engines, fact to be studied in order to obtain the optimum equation "quality/ operation". The present work has specifically studied four alternative fuel formulations in comparison with the respective reference diesel oils currently used in Argentina and whose general features per- mit an international standard resemblance. Engine operating characteristics have been defined as a function of the variation in the fuel chemical composition. 911712. (P-245) The tubular combustion chamber for I.C. engines. Radislav Pavletič and Dejan Leskovsek, University of Ljubljana. The influence of the shape of a combustion chamber in S.I. engines on the knock phenomenon has been investigated. The possibility of application of the theory of combustion in a tube for the tubular combustion chamber has been considered. An experimental head with a tubular combustion chamber has been designed and tested on a two-stroke loop scavenged S.I. engine. A comparative investigation of the tubular combustion chamber in comparison with the conventional pentroof combustion cham- ber on the same production two stroke engine has been done. The performances and tendency to knock have been studied on the experimental engine with each combustion chamber. The varia- tion of the compression ratio of the tubular combustion chamber has also been investigated. The superiority in resistance to knock and therefore, in fuel tolerance of the tubular combustion cham- ber in comparison with the pentroof combustion chamber has been noted. 911714. (P-245) Compressed natural gas-fueled Mercedes- Benz urban buses. F. Buehler, R. Pachame, and D. Majic, Mer- cedes-Benz Argentina SA. In view of the great gas reserves in Argentia, that have become the basis of the governmental policies on substitution of oil- derived liquid fuel, Mercedes-Benz Argentina launched the first urban bus manufactured in the country that is compressed natu- ral gas (CNG)-fueled. This paper explains the process followed for building the engine, analyzing the alternatives of the combustion cycle and defining the stage of maximum power and minimum consump- tion for a 1,18 lambda, using conventional technology which is ideal for meeting the current needs of the market. The results of the tests carried out with four vehicles driven by urban bus lines are hereinafter described, defining the perfor- mance of the vehicle. Finally, an analysis of the results with respect to the diesel- engine vehicle enables to reach conclusions on the steps to be taken concerning the evolution of the CNG-propelled urban bus. 911715. (P-245) Compared fuel consumption and acceleration of a dual-fuel commercial vehicle when propelled by gasoline or by compressed natural gas (CNG). Gabriel Horacio Defranco, Andrés F aloci, Carlos Arrua, and Mauro Cavatorta, University of La Plata. The CNG plan has been in practise over five years in Argen- tina. There are innumerable opinions from the users as regards the behaviour of the converted vehicles but no data resulting from specific measurements. Taking this into account, the thermal machinery laboratory (TML) decided to compare the consumption and acceleration of a conventional vehicle that functions both with gasoline and CNG using simple measurements which will provide immediate results. Thus, in energetic terms, gasoline consumption related to the unit of distance covered resulted in up to a 36% higher than that of the CNG. Acceleration capacity was reduced in the CNG adapted vehi- cle, from 10 to 12% as from still position which when accelerating in fourth gear the decrease was higher. 911716. (P-245) Project for liquified natural gas (LNG) pro- duction for use in automobile transportation. Maria Inés Caparrós and Juan Castro, INVAP S.E.; and Julio César Brizzi, Subsecre- taria de Energia de la Republica Argentina. 201</page><page sequence="201">911716-911726 By the end of 1987, the Secretary of Energy of the Argentine Republic reached to an agreement with INVAP Company to demonstrate the feasibility of the liquid methane production (LNG). INVAP developed the technology of liquefying miniplants based on the concept of turboexpansion, making use of energy that makes natural gas (NG) reach urban centres through the gas pipeline. Simultaneously, a plant on a small scale applying the flashing and isoenthalpic phenomena, built. In this way, experiences using LNG as fuel in a vehicle powered by Otto cycle engine, could be carried out. 911719. (P-245) Ceramic coatings for aluminum engine blocks. Roy Kamo, Lloyd Kamo, and Edgars Valdmanis, Adiabatics, Inc. The trend toward lighter vehicles for improved performance has recenlty introduced the use of aluminum and plastic materi- als for vehicle bodies and drive trains. In particular, the alumi- num alloy block for engine application is certain to reappear. The soft aluminum cylinder liner will require additional treatment before acceptance. Three possible approaches appear to solve the aluminum cylinder liner dilemma. These approaches are: 1) use of high silicon aluminum such as the 390 aluminum; 2) insert or cast steel liners into the aluminum engine block; and 3) ceramic coat the low cost standard aluminum engine block. Each has known advantages and disadvantages. It is the pur- pose of this paper to present the merits of option 3, the ceramic coated aluminum cylinder bore from the standpoint of low weight, cost, and tribological effectiveness. The advantages of approaches 1 and 2 are obvious. High tem- perature after treatment of the ceramic engine components is not required. Aluminum properties are such that one must carefully observe changes in physical properties of aluminum such as creep, aging, stress/strain and other important properties depen- dent upon temperature. Therefore, a ceramic coating possessing low curing temperature is highly desirable. A low temperature organo-metallic phosphate (OMP) coating developed recently for aluminum alloy substrates is expected to meet requirements of lowered cost and improved effectiveness for engine applications. Engine tests were conducted to determine the effectiveness of this ceramic composite coating. The aluminum engine block of an 84mm x 70mm (bore x stroke) single cylinder diesel engine was ceramic composite coated and laboratory rig tested. Prelimi- nary engine test data reflects the improved cylinder liner coating over the steel or cast iron mating parts. A reduction in fuel con- sumption due to friction reduction, thermal insulation, and pos- sible improvement in combustion have been demonstrated and observed in SAE paper 910461. The thin coated cylinder liner and its advantage has been further discussed in previous litera- ture SAE paper 890143. The ceramic composite coating on aluminum has performed well. The coating can also be applied in the form of silicon nitride, other nitrides, or carbides onto aluminum, titanium or stainless steel substrates. Durability tests are currently underway to dem- onstrate the viability of these ceramic coated aluminum compo- nents for tribology and insulation of future engine components. 911720. (P-245) Influence of composite reinforcement on fail- ure modes of steel tubes. XŘ G. Wang, INRETS ; and J. A. Bloch and Dominique Cesari, LCB-INRETS. The previous experimental results on the circular steel tubes reinforced by FRP composite have shown that the external rein- forcement by composite improve their crush strength not only because of its own strength gut also through an iteraction with the enveloped tube sheet which reduces the folding wave length and changes the collapse mode from an unstable one to a stabe one. Here, the influence of the external reinforcement by composite on the crushing behavior of square tubes is investigated experi- mentally. The same trend is obtained for square tubes. The exter- nal reinforcement changes the crushing mode from a non com- pact one to a compact one. The highest relative specific energy of the reinforced tube with respect to that of the non reinforced tube is 2.44. 911721. (P-245) A superior hard chromium plating method. Clarence H. Peger, Hard Chrome Plating Consultants Inc. Hard chrome plating is used in the automobile industry quite extensively. Cylinder valves, transmission parts, body part dies and molds are only a few examples. Most automobile companies that have hard chrome plating shops are using methods that have been obsolete for over 50 years. The same is true for their outside chrome plating shop vendors. There is a hard chrome plating method that achieves plating rates of .006 (152) per hour with very even, dense and harder deposits. Even deposits mean less grinding time or no grinding after plating at all. What is considered by most chrome platers impossible to plate is easy to do. Holes and slots as small as .040 (1mm) in diameter can be plated using this system. 911723. (P-245) A theoretical and experimental study of water/engine-oil compact heat exchangers. F. V. Tinaut, Dept. Energy and Fluid-Mechanics Engrg., University of Valladolid ; A. Megar, Dept. of Energy and Fluid-Mechanics Engrg., University of Valladolid ; and Ali A. A. Rahman, Dept. of Energy and Fluid Mechanics Engrg., University of Valladolid. The present study has been performed in order to characterize the compact plate-type heat exchangers that are used to cool the lubricating oil of internal combustion engines. During the work an evaluation model has been developed for water/engine-oil heat exchangers. The evaluation model uses experimental data such as coolant and oil flow rates and the heat exchanger inlet and outlet temperatures. Also a predictive model has been developed, based on the application of the fluid flow and heat transfer equa- tions of the real heat exchanger geometry. This model permits the performance calculation of the heat exchangers in arbitrary con- ditions. Simultaneously an experimental facility has been pro- jected and built for testing the heat exchangers. The test facility allows to fix oil and coolant flow rates and temperatures over a wide range. The theoretical predictive model has been validated by comparing its results with the data obtained in the experimen- tal facility and with data provided by the manufacturer. 911724. (P-245) The influence of wave action on mass flow rate through pipes. M. Endo and J. Iwamoto, Tokyo Denki Univ. The behavior of pressure waves in the exhaust and intake pipes of the internal combustion engine plays an important role in the increase and decrease of the flow rate through these pipes. Using the rotary valve of disc type the effect of the pressure wave on the flow rate through the pipes with junctions or nozzles was studied. It was found that the arrival time of the compression wave at the port of the valve was the important parameter in eval- uating the increase and decrease in flow rate. 911726. (P-245) Motor vehicles and the environment: an agenda for rapidly expanding countries. Michael P. Walsh, Con- sultant. In an effort to minimize the motor vehicle pollution problem, emission rates from cars have been limited by legislation for over two decades. However, increasingly, these reductions in emis- sions per kilometer driven are being offset by the growing number of vehicles. The purposes of this paper are to summarize the cur- rent importance of motor vehicles as a cause of the variety of air pollution problems today, assess the adverse effects which result from this pollution and review the efforts underway to bring about improvements. Analyses of future trends in vehicles and their emissions especially in rapidly expanding countries will be presented to show that much greater emissions and fuel economy improvements will be necessary in the future if environmental 202</page><page sequence="202">911726-911736 concerns are to be adequately addressed. Finally a comprehen- sive strategy for addressing these problems will be presented. 911729. (P-245) Mobile air conditioning and CFC's - An update. Richard L. Radecki, Harrison Div., General Motors Corp. In response to the problem of stratospheric ozone layer deple- tion, the United Nations Environmental Program has enacted a protocol which places restrictions on the future production and consumption of CFC's. This protocol has been widely ratified throughout the world and further discussions are underway to increase the stringency of its provisions. Automotive air condi- tioning systems use the compound CFC-12 as a refrigerant and the proposed restrictions will significantly impact this vehicle option. This presentation will provide an update into the issue of automotive air conditioning and the CFC problem. The latest international regulations will be described. The presentation will then review general findings related to the application of new, environmentally-safe, refrigerant R-134a in vehicle air condi- tioning systems. The implications of higher pressure characteris- tics will be shown, as well as the various considerations involving lubricatns, materials, and component design. 911730. (P-245) Development and optimization of alcohol fueled Si-engines for passenger cars for the Brazilian market. Friedrich Quissek and Klaus Hulak, AVL-List GmbH; and Edoardo Barbera, Fiat Auto. During the last four years Fiat Auto has cooperated with AVL in the development of three generations of ethanol vehicles for the Brazilian market for current, 1992 and 1997 Brazilian emis- sion standards. This paper deals with 1) suitability of ethanol as Si-engine fuel; 2) combustion system development and calibration strate- gies for 1992 lean burn engines and 1997 TWC-concepts; 3) tran- sient and warm up development; 4) single fuel cold start systems; 5) TWC emission control requirements; and 6) vehicle perfor- mance, fuel economy, emissions with and w/o catalyst. The paper shows that the concepts chose allow calibrations with sufficient margin with respect to emission standards. Cold start and driveability can be developed for single fuel operation down to 0 deg. C. Vehicle driveability and performance are on a competitive level. For aldehyde control the TWC is a very good solution. Application problems with TWC can occur if the cata- lyst is located remote from the engine. 911732. (P-245) Noble metal usage reduction strategies for three-way emission control catalysts. Jerry C. Summers, W. B. Williamson, and J. P. Hiera, Allied-Signal Inc. Strict mobile source emission legislation in many countries throughout the world are movtivating research and development efforts to bring forth advanced formulations. Steep rises in the price of rhodium during the past couple of years is resulting in intense efforts to control the costs of the new catalyst technologies being developed. This paper examines some catalyst develop- ment strategies being explored to accomplish the above objec- tives. 1991 SAE Transactions Section 4 911733. (P-245) Commercial vehicles emission control for Latin America. Luso M. Ventura and Ricardo Simões de Abreu, Mercedes-Benz. The emission control for commercial vehicles in Latin Amer- ica has just begun and it brings an exceptional opportunity for the introduction of a common concept toward an air quality program suited for developing countries. The analysis of prior experiences accumulated by countries where legislations on that field have already been settled and improved is a worthy tool to choose the most convenient alterna- tive to deal with the emission control in an affordable way. Steady-state test procedures provide enough information to estimate the engine emission levels on actual operation, avoiding the use of expensive facilities. Through simple and already well-proven methods and consid- ering all aspects concerning the problem, from the fuel quality to the vehicle maintenance, it is possible to reach the main aim, the air preservation, alloting fewer resources and promoting Latin America's integration. 911734. (P-245) Effect of aging and testing conditions on cata- lyst performance. S. P. Burkholder and B. J. Cooper, Catalytic Systems Div., Johnson Matthey. In order to simulate the aging of the emission control system over the life of a vehicle, a variety of engine dynamometer cycles has been developed that accelerate the catalyst aging processes. This paper investigates the sensitivity of automotive emission control catalysts to their aging and testing environments. To show the effects of aging conditions on catalytic performance, three engine stand dynamometer aging cycles were utilized. These aged catalysts were then tested on two test vehicles: one featured multi-point fuel injection; the other, sequential elec- tronic fuel injection. The performance results indicate the sensitivity of a catalyst to aging conditions as well as the various parameters of its operat- ing environment. This sensitivity varied for the two catalyst for- mulations. The more severe aging cycle was quite successful in discriminating between catalyst formulations while the milder cycle did not greatly affect catalyst performance and hence did not clearly differentiate between formulations. The fuel control strategy of the test vehicle was a very significant factor influenc- ing the efficiency of the catalyst formulation. 911735. (P-245) Adsorption-catalytic purification by carbon fibers. O. K. Alexeeva, N. L. Iltchenko, and V. N. Sumarokov, Kurchatov Institute of Atomic Energy ; and O. A. Lukomskya, A. M. Safonova, and I. N. Yermolenko, Institute of General and Organic Chemistry, Academy of Science BSSR. The possibility of carbon fibers use for the removal of H2S from H2S/H2/Ar and H2S/Ar gas mixtures has been studied. Cu- containing carbon fibers and Cu-containing activated carbon fibers proved to be most efficient materials for removing of H2S small amounts in 298-1173 K temperature range at the atmo- spheric pressure. Depending on the treatment method and the specific surface area and porosity values carbon fibers have dif- ferent sorption and catalytic properties at different temperatures. H2S sorption from gas mixtures was observed at room tempera- ture while H2S decomposition to H2 and S occurred at elevated temperatures. Cu-containing activated carbon fibers modified by chemical treatment should be used at room temperature. Less expensive Cu-containing carbon fibers can be used at elevated temperatures. 1991 SAE Transactions Section 4 911736. (P-245) Ceramic converter technology for automotive emissions control. Suresh T. Gulati, Corning, Inc. This paper reviews the development and successful applica- tion of ceramic catalytic converters for controlling automotive exhaust emissions. It presents the scientific rationale for design- ing the high surface area substrate to meet both performance and durability requirements. This is followed by a step-by-step design process for each of the converter components. The initial design stage focuses on understanding automaker's requirements and optimizing component design commensurate with them. The intermediate stage involves laboratory testing of converter com- ponents in simulated environment and ensuring component compatibility from durability point of view. The final design stage addresses the critical tests on converter assembly to ensure performance and field durability. In addition, it examines the necessary trade-offs and associated design modifications and 203</page><page sequence="203">911736-911742 evaluates their impact on warranty cost for system failure.

(P-245) Catalytic ignition of methanol in a diesel engine with a platinum-coated glow plug. J. Reynaldo Agama, Automated Analysis Corp.; and Duane L. Abata and Michael E. Mullins, Michigan Technological Univ. In recent years, intensive research has been pursued through- out the world in order to find substitutes to crude oil based fuel in compression-ignition engines. Among the different fuels stud- ied, methanol is probably the primary candidate to substitute die- sel fuel in the future. The major problems encountered with methanol in diesel engines are its poor cold startability together with unstable combustion levels under low load. Forced ignition techniques such as glow plugs and spark plugs have been used to overcome these problems. The major disadvantages with the use of glow plugs are their high power requirements as well as their limited lifetime. This paper presents the results from recent work done on the feasibility of catalytically igniting methanol with the use of plati- num and platinum/rhodium-coated glow plugs. The effect of the catalysts was determined from glow-plug surface temperature measurements, cylinder pressure analysis, and high-speed pho- tography of the combustion chamber in a two-stroke D.I. diesel engine. The catalytic glow plugs consistently lowered glow-plug temperatures needed for stable combustion by approximately 300 deg C with respect to sandard stainless steel glow plugs. 1991 SAE Transactions Section 3 911738. (P-245) Reduction of NOx in the exhaust gases of an automotive engine using methane gas by water injection in the inlet manifold. Nedo Eston de Eston and Rubens Breno Wachoc- kier, Instituto de Pesquisas Tecnológicas do Estado de Sao Paulo. The main reason for the utilization of methane gas, in the form of natural gas or purified biogas, is as substitute of the diesel oil, aiming to the reduction of the pollution by the exhaust gases from the combustion engines of the urban buses. The largest pol- lutants of diesel engines are the particulates, originated by the combustion process, and the sulphur oxides. The latter, further to act as nucleants for the particulates, contribute to the so called "acid rain". As the natural gas is free from sulphur, and the spark ignition cycle does not originate particulates, these are obvious advan- tages of the utilization of the methane as fuel in the urban vehi- cles. But the spark ignition engines burning methane originates much more NOx, nearly twice as much, than the diesel engine equivalent, particularly at high loads. Several processes are being studied for the reduction of the NOx emissions. In this work it was considered the water injection in the intake manifold, obtaining a reduction of 2/3 in the amount of NOx from the exhaust gases. 911739. (P-245) Octane requirement increase control - A new way of saving. Mark L. Nelson, James E. Larson, and Mark S. Carruthers, Polar Molecular Corp. Due to the accumulation of deposites in the combustion chamber, the "appetite" of an engine for octane increases with mileage. Depending on the type of engine, driving conditions, and gasoline, this octane requirement increase (ORI) ranges from 3 to 10 octane numbers. Because of ORI, national specifications for octane number of gasoline must be based on engines' octane requirement at equilib- rium. Applying the incremental analysis technique to refining economics, F. Bernasconi calculated that the incremental cost of producing each extra octane number by refining ranges from $2 to $6 per ton. It is generally well accepted that an increase of one octane number will lead to a loss in refinery yield of 4 to 6%. Octane requirement increase can be controlled with a new type of ashless, non-metallic additive. An ORI reduction of 50 to 80% has been observed, opening the route to decreasing national gasoline octane specifications. Savings of millions of dollars and up to 20% of crude are possible. Emissions are reduced. 911740. (P-245) A case of regional automotive complementa- tion in South America: the development of a "high tech" plant for E.W. transmissions. Ernesto E. Syriani, Autolatina Argentina. A multinational automotive company operating simulta- neously in two bordering countries - Argentina and Brazil- interested both governments in a future common market based on interchange of parts and vehicles. To attain this objective, a project for the installation of a "high tech" manufacturing plant was developed and is being executed. This plant will source both countries with a modern and versatile E.W. transaxle, with the majority of components made at either one, plus some minor imports from Germany. Finally assembly and delivery of finished product will be done in Argentina. The Company will benefit from per unit cost reduction derived from large scale production methods and reduction of import duty payments, and the possibility of having an entry in markets demanding high quality products, such as Europe. Both countries will benefit of the additional labor occupancy, added tax revenue due to increased local production, foreign currency income when exports to third countries are made, and latest state-of-the-art technology and operating methods and principles. 911741. (P-245) Planning tool for project development. Tullio Giabbani, M aerosa. The objective of this paper is to show the role performed by planning in the development of a project within a very short period of time. The product to be developed was an articulated tractor to be offered for sale ten months after approval of the pre- liminary design. Since the company did not count with industrial background, the Mnaufacturing Division was created in order to face the planning of the project development, Engineering Analy- sis of parts' costs, quality engineering. The manufacture of all developed parts was subcontracted with local plants, previously selected and developed by said division. Through the implemen- tation of an adequate planning and a strict follow-up of all stages of the project, we succeeded in achieving the project, engineering, manufacture, assembly and tests of four prototypes. This allowed the development of the marketing of the product, which at the same time allowed the launching of serial manufacturing. The implemented planning was proved to be the key to success. 911742. (P-245) Analysis of electrical urban transportation systems from the energy standpoint. Elio Daniel Martinez, Universidad Nacional de Rosario; Ricardo Ernesto Burkle, Agua y Energia Electrica; Rubén Raúl Oscar Galante, Empresa Provin- cial de Energia de Santa Fe; and Carlos Alberto Fernandez, Muni- cipalidad de Rosario. Energy resources are now limited and the increasing demand impose a carefully management of them. The transport demands a considerable portion of total energy resources and in recent years many efforts were made toward planification and techno- logical improvements. In Argentina the Federal Energy Authority has began in 1985 a program toward saving and rational use of energy. As a part of the program, a group of engineers has devel- oped studies about urban transport energy planning, considering multimodal systems in which electricity plays an important role as an intermediate link that allows to employ many different energy sources. In expanding countries the urban transport depends nowadays basically from fuel powered motor buses and large investments in future years will be required for the installation of other sys- tems. This paper tries to be a contribution to the knowledge about this subject. 204</page><page sequence="204">911743-911753 911743.

In Argen- tina, highway and railroad infrastructures mainly converge to flu- vial ports which, owing to their lack of depth, cannot take in pres- ent-day vessels. This paper describes a fast wide-gauge train, which cannot be derailed or overturned; it shall enjoy a cheap t/km freight, cheaper than that of current trucks and trains, and even of river and ocean-going ships. It shall unite the North and South regions of Argentina as one backbone, and shall behave like a vast river or inland channel, linking it up with the Patagonian deep-sea ports, integrating and developing the country, which will cause its products to be competitive all over the world. 911744. (P-245) Optimization of urban public transportation systems for energy conservation. Claus Herzog and Philip Derderian, Mercedes-Benz. The strong populational growth rate in this century had great negative influence on environment, which only recently has been fully understood. Matters such as greenhouse effect and ozon layer destruction give now a worldwide dimension to this prob- lem. Also the pollution levels in great cities has become a major problem, demanding short term solutions. Environmental pollution in big urban centers in developing countries has achieved high levels due to their fast expansion without proper planning and the lack of financial capability. Cit- ies like Santiago, Sao Paulo and Mexico-City are a few examples in Latin America. The concentration of pollutants like CO2, CO, NOx and particulate materials in the atmosphere is quite above the acceptable standards. Most of urban air pollution is generated by vehicle engines. As an example, Table 1 shows a comparison of emissions according to their sources for Mexico City. Transportation activity is responsible for 76.7% of the overall amount of polluting sub- stances and is also the main source of CO emission, averaging 96.7% of the total. Improving energetic efficiency of urban transportation is therefore, a must in order to reduce air pollution in big cities. There are three ways of reaching this goal: improving engine ther- modynamical efficiency, improving fuel quality and optimizing the transportation system performance. This paper is concerned to the latter subject, specially transit systems. Indirectly the improvement of the passenger transportation service has a posi- tive impact over cargo and individual traffic and contributes to additional fuel savings. 911745. (P-245) A critical analysis of the history of the auto- motive industry in developing countries: the case of Argentina. Juan Rossi, AITA. The automotive industry, with the great variety of technolo- gies of which it comprises, is, like few others, a fundamental fac- tor which directs and drives the industrial development of a country. With that established an analysis of a single case has become useful: "The history of the automotive industry in Argen- tina." Over time, three distinct stages have evolved. Owing to the frequent changes in the government of the coun- try, each of these three periods was subject to different policies and criteria which determined the technical goals for production. This fact caused a great variety of situations for the country and, consequently, for industry. In this report, to be presented for AIEC, each of the three stages has been analyzed. In each case, the observations have been oriented to demonstrate the evaluated successes and errors, bearing in mind the final result. The intention of this study is to give general directives that may be suggested for new, pending proposals to establish auto- motive industries in developing countries. 911750. Cost and time effective development of microprocessor based control systems. Adrian G. Kallis, Phoenix International Corp. Through the use of modular electronics designs and speically designed electronic development tools, the development time and cost of electronic control systems, such as an engine control- ler or transmission controller, can be reduced. The control system electronics are based on a circuit board which includes the required control system components, including SAE J1708 com- patible communications, high-current and low-current outputs, analog inputs, and a number of digital inputs. By using the same electronics, all development tools can be used across all develop- ment programs. Several such tools include a remote programmer, serial link development system, and a data acquisition system. 1991 SAE Transactions Section 2 911751. Field performance of machine vision for the selective harvest of asparagus. John F. Reid, Agricultural Engrg. Dept., University of Illinois ; and Daniel S. Humburg, Agricultural Engrg. Dept., South Dakota State Univ. A machine vision system was developed to identify and locate harvestable spears of asparagus. An image acquisition vehicle was fabricated to videotape portions of asparagus rows from a commercial production field. Images were acquired using a monochrome CCD camera. The detection of reflectance proper- ties of asparagus was enhanced by using optical bandpass filters for near-infrared radiation. Videotaped segments acquired in the field were analyzed. Image processing techniques based on geo- metrical characteristics of asparagus spears were used to identify and locate harvestable spears in the images. Harvestable spears measured in the field were compared to those found by machine vision. The vision system correctly identified from 86 to 97% of the harvestable spears in six 15 m row segments analyzed. The uncertainty in the location of spears was within a 2.97 by 5.39 cm window with 95% confidence. 1991 SAE Transactions Section 2 911752. An algorithm for computer vision sensing of a row crop guidance directrix. John F. Reid, Agricultural Engrg. Dept., University of Illinois ; and Stephen W. Searcy, Dept. of Agricul- tural Engrg., Texas A&amp;M Univ. A heuristic line detection algorithm is described for comput- ing guidance information from row crop images. The technique processes binary images representing crop rows against a soil background. Points along the centers of crop rows are enhanced using a modified run-length encoding procedure. The properties of lines in images can be improved by filtering based on charac- teristics of the object run-length. A clustering algorithm was used to aggregate pixels that fall on the same crop row. The technique was compared with the hough transform, a common line detec- tion technique in image processing. Both procedures accurately represented lines measured manually in a set of images represent- ing a range of expected field conditions. 1991 SAE Transactions Section 2 911753. A complex system for the automatic control of a farm tractor .Leonid I. Grom-Maznichevski, Ukrainian Research Insti- tute for Agricultural Engineering. On-board vehicle electronics have matured and become a practical replacement for the many menial tasks required of a tractor operator. Electronic control systems allow more applica- tion flexibility and enhance performance more than a human operator could ever be expected to accomplish. This paper covers the possibilities for a fully automated tractor that optimally con- trols engine speed, transmission gears, fuel consumption and attached implement. The paper is written around a Soviet built 205</page><page sequence="205">911753-911761 four wheel drive tractor. The system described has been built and tested with very positive results. 1991 SAE Transactions Section 2 911754. Automation of mobile farm machinery and problems of environmental protection. I. P. Ksenevich, Lenin All-Union Academy of Agricultural Sciences ; and V. A. Trofimov, Research Production Association Selkhozmashavtomatica. Little concern has been given to environmental considerations in the past. Times are changing and there must be a realization of the effects being made by farm machinery on the soil, air and water supply. This paper discusses these realities and proposes that much could be gained by incorporating automation into farm equipment. 1991 SAE Transactions Section 2 911755. About testing devices of automatic equipment systems for unexpected failure. Vasily A. Trofimov, Selkhozmashavtoma- tica; and A. S. Gusev, M ose sow Institute of Agricultural Engineers. This paper explains a method of testing electronic equipment for vibrational problems in a quick and easy way. Resonant fre- quencies are generated in a test bed and with the use of mathema- tic equations developed in the paper, potential problems can be assessed and problems corrected. 911756. Engineered surfaces for gear teeth by PVD processes. S. Ramalingam, University of Minnesota. Substantial progress has been made in the last decade in the development of physical vapor deposition processes and in ion implantation technologies to modify the surface properties of engineered materials and products. Hard coatings are now in wide commercial use in tooling applications both to reduce wear and to extend the tool life. However, the use of wear resistant coatings in engineered parts and in gear components is yet to become significiant. Some of the problems inhibiting wider use of surface engineering in gear teeth applications are discussed in this paper. A recent development in arc coating to overcome the discrete interface problem is described. Results from a study involving the multi-layer deposition of titanium and nickel from a single, composite cathode are presented and discussed to show that compositionally-graded interfaces can now be produced. It is shown that the prospects for increased use of surface engineer- ing to improve performance the characteristics of heavily stressed components and gears have been enhanced. 911757. Spiral bevel tooth topography control using CMM equipment. William R. McVea and Donald W. Mellis, Clark- Hurt h Components. The conformance to specification and quality of cylindrical gears is routinely handled by the use of elemental checks i.e. lead, involute, pitch variation and runout. Since there is no reference figure to define the form accuracy for bevel gears as the involute helicoid does for a cylindrical involute gear, it has not, until recently, been possible to check for tooth form accuracy, i.e. lead and profile (involute), on bevel gears. The use of a coordinate measuring machine during the devel- opment process allows for optimization of the machine settings to achieve a tooth form which is proper for the intended applica- tion. This paper describes the development of a procedure used to establish and control the tooth form of heavy duty drive axle spi- ral bevel pinions and ring gears. Involved in the procedure was the determination of the machine capability using statistical studies made on each battery of equipment, establishment of appropriate soft and hard refer- ence gear sets and a procedure to duplicate the tooth surfaces on repeated set-ups encountered in the "Just In Time Concept". The results have been greater consistency in gear sets and much less dependence on subjective judgement in the control of the soft topography. 1991 SAE Transactions Section 2 911758. Artificial intelligence (AI) applied to gear technology and industry in general. John H. Tanzer, Engineering Consulting and Design, Inc. Artificial intelligence (AI) is the branch of computer science committed to attaining and exceeding the intelligence of the human brain, primarily by innovative software technology. The following significant accomplishments in all phases of human endeavor are proof of its potential: medical diagnostics and treat- ments, military weapon and space technology, learning and teaching, plus manufacturing, expert systems, robotics, etc. The objective of this paper is to provide an overview of AI applications, tools and techniques and to assist and encourage renewed initiative in research, development and applications of AI enhanced expert systems and robotics for the benefit of our industry. 911759. Silencer for hydraulic piston pump pressure pulsa- tions. Richard D. Strunk, Dept. of Mech. Engrg., University of Wisconsin-Platteville. The hydraulic piston pumps that are used on off-highway vehicles create pressure pulsations that may generate excessive noise in the vehicle. The most effective method of reducing this noise is to decrease the amplitude of the pressure pulsations leav- ing the pump by using a reactive type of silencer. A reactive silencer changes the load impedance and reflects the pulsations back to the pump. This paper develops the insertion loss for a specific type of side branch resonator, called a cross-loop attenua- tor, and describes the design parameters that will result in the best insertion loss for a piston pump application. 1991 SAE Transactions Section 2 911760. The measurement of positive displacement pump and motor noise using sound intensity techniques. K. A. Edge and Z. Ngah, University of Bath. The noise levels generated by a variable capacity axial piston pump and a fixed capacity axial piston motor have been mea- sured using sound intensity techniques; no special acoustic test environment was employed. The experimental procedures fol- lowed, as closely as possible, draft International Standard ISO/ DIS 9614-4. Because the machines were mounted on existing test stands it was found difficult to comply completely with the requirements laid down in the draft standard. Typical test results are presented showing that pump overall sound pressure levels increase significantly with increasing deliv- ery pressure. The effect of discharge pipe length on pump noise levels is relatively small. From the motor noise tests, it was found that variations in speed were much more important than load. The work has highlighted the need for the development of sound intensity procedures specifically concerned with fluid power pumps and motors. 1991 SAE Transactions Section 2 911761. A test method for measurement of pump fluid-borne noise characteristics. D. N. Johnston and K. A. Edge, University of Bath. A novel method for evaluating the source flow ripple and source impedance of positive displacement hydraulic pumps is described. The method is based on the measurement and fre- quency domain analysis of pressure standing waves in apipe, and uses a secondary source of pressure ripple for excitation of the pump under test. The method is convenient, accurate and versa- tile and forms the basis of a new British Standard for measure- ment of a pump fluid-borne noise rating. Representative results 206</page><page sequence="206">911761-911767 are presented for an oil hydraulic pump and for a plunger pump for water-based fluid. 1991 SAE Transactions Section 2 911762. Methods of reducing flow ripple from fluid power pumps- A theoretical approach. Mana E. Pettersson, Kenneth Gģ Weddfelt , and Jan-Ove S. Palmberg, Linköping Univ. Noise emission is often considered to be one of the major drawbacks of fluid power systems. One of the main sources of noise is flow ripple caused by positive displacement pumps. This paper is concerned with the problems of modelling and measure- ment of flow ripple with emphasis on analyses with theoretical techniques. A simulation model of a piston pump has been used in this investigation. Simulation has proved to be a useful tool for optimization of the portplate geometry and for developing new methods to reduce pump flow ripple. Different conventional methods are compared with unconventional ones. A new method which gives very low flow ripple over a large operating range is included in this study. 1991 SAE Transactions Section 2 911763. Methods of reducing flow ripple from fluid power pis- ton pumps - An experimental approach. Maria E. Pettersson, Kenneth G. Weddfelt, andJan-OveS. Palmberg, Linköping Univ. Noise emission is often considered to be one of the major drawbacks of fluid power systems. One of the main sources of noise is flow ripple generated by positive displacement pumps. This paper is concerned with the problems of modelling and mea- surement of flow ripple with emphasis on measurement tech- niques. Measurements are performed according to the so-called "two- microphone method". This technique makes it possible to deter- mine the source characteristics of the pump, i.e. both the source flow and source impedance. The technique is described in detail. Measurements have been performed on a piston pump equipped with a number of different port plate geometries. Exper- imental results are compared with results obtained from numeri- cal simulation. 911764. Durability testing of transesterified winter rape oil (Brassica Napus L.) as fuel in smallbore, multi-cylinder, DI, CI engines. C. L. Peterson, Uiversity of Idaho ; and L. A. Perkins and D. L. Auld, University of Idaho. This paper reports on a 1000 hour EMA alternative fuels test that was performed to evaluate compression ignition engine durability when fueled with methyl ester of winter rapeseed oil and number 2 diesel - methyl ester of winter rapeseed oil blends. Three engines, one fueled with 100% methyl ester of winter rapeseed oil, one with a 50% number 2 diesel - 50% methyl ester of winter rapeseed oil blend, and one with a reference fuel of 100% number 2 diesel, were investigated in the 1000 hour test. It was found that methyl ester of winter rapeseed oil was equiva- lent to number 2 diesel when compared on the basis of long term performance and engine wear. The primary factors which were evaluated included engine brake power and torque, injector tip coking, and engine component wear (based on oil analysis). The only noticeable adverse effect of the ester fuel was a slight decrease in engine oil viscosity. 1991 SAE Transactions Section 4 911765. Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons emissions from plant oil based alternative fuels. Leonard W. Cook and Jim Flicker, Dept. of Biochemistry, North Dakota State Univ.; and Hans J. Goettler and Mariusz Ziejewski , Mech. Engrg. Dept., North Dakota State Univ. The intensive drive toward "energy independence" has led many in the United States and other countries to consider plant oils as extenders or replacements for diesel fuel. Interest in the use of plant oils has continued because they are domestically pro- duced and are a renewable energy source. The feasibility of plant oils as diesel fuel in their unmodified form for short-term opera- tion is proven. The serious injector deposits, engine contamina- tion and engine wear problems experienced with unmodified plant oil fuels have been partially overcome by plant oil modifi- cations resulting in satisfactory medium-term operations on some fuels. The same studies have shown, however, that the problems associated with the use of plant oil based alternate fuels in diesel engines cannot be solved by fuel modifications alone. For satisfactory operation on plant oil fuels, the combustion sys- tem must be re-optimized to account for the strongly different physical and chemical properties of the plant oils as compared to diesel fuel. The general trends indicate that better fuel atomization, more vigorous fuel-air mixing, higher combustion system temperature and pressure will improve the combustion process of plant oil fuels. While optimizing the design of current diesel engines to make them suitable for plant oil fuels more research on exhaust emissions is needed. Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAH) emissions in diesel exhaust has received considerable attention since many PAH compounds have been shown to be carcinogenic and mutagenic. As alternative fuels, for diesel engines plant oils contain only insignificant levels of PAH. Petroleum based diesel fuel has 1-4% PAH. Moreover, Abbass, et al. have shown that the fuel PAH is one of the significant sources of particulate PAH. Mills and Howard and Abbass, et al. have studied some aspects of the PAH emissions for plant oil based alternative fuels. The objectives of this investigation are to investigate effects of fuel type, engine speed, and engine load on the level of particulate bound PAH for plant oil based fuels and to determine the overall trends for the reduction of PAH emissions. 911766. Performance and emissions of a natural gas dual- fueled, indirect injected diesel engine. K. C. Midkiff, W. Y. Wong, and S. R. Bell, Dept. of Mech. Engrg., University of Alabama. In order to meet stricter diesel engine emissions regulations, several researchers have investigated the feasibility of utilizing natural gas as an alternative engine fuel. This study reports the performance, gas-phase emissions, and particulate emissions of a single-cylinder prechamber type diesel engine modified to run on natural gas/diesel dual fuel. During dual fueling, up to 73 per- cent of the diesel fuel energy input was replaced with natural gas while the engine power output was maintained at levels similar to those obtained using diesel fuel alone. Thermal efficiency obtained was 38 percent lower for dual- fueling than for straight diesel fueling at one-quarter load. How- ever, at full load the thermal efficiency obtained for dual fueling was similar to that for straight diesel fueling. Similar exhaust NOx concentrations were obtained at one-quarter load, but at higher loads NOx concentrations were higher for dual fueling. Further- more, CO concentrations were considerably higher at all loads using dual-fuels. On the other hand, both SO2 and CO2 concen- trations were reduced as a result of dual fueling. When operating in the dual-fuel mode, Bosch smoke numbers and particulate emissions were reduced by up to 32 percent and 50 percent at full load, respectively. Particulates moisture content and soluble organic fraction (SOF) for dual fueling were higher than those for straight diesel fueling. 911767. The stratified charge glowplug ignition (SCGI) engine with natural gas fuel. Rob H. Thring and Jeffrey A. Leet, South- west Research Institute. The objective was to demonstrate the feasibility of operating a natural gas two-stroke engine using glow plug ignition with very lean mixtures. Based on the results obtained, the term SCGI (stratified charge glow plug ignition) was coined to describe the engine. An JLO two-stroke diesel engine was converted first to a natural gas fueled-spark-ignited engine for the baseline tests, and 207</page><page sequence="207">911767-911771 then to an SCGI engine. The SCGI engine used a gas operated valve in the cylinder head to admit the natural gas fuel, and a glow plug was used as a means to initiate the combustion. The engine was successfully run, but was found to be sensitive to various conditions such as the glow plug temperature. The engine would run very lean, to an overall equivalence ratio of 0.33, offering the potential of good fuel economy and low NOx emissions. Fuel economy was compared to other natural gas engines and found to be not so good on a brake specific basis; however there was not time for much development work, and the potential for good economy still exists. It was recommended that exhaust emissions be measured. 1991 SAE Transactions Section 3 911768. A prêcha mber-type compression ignition engine oper- ated by composite fuels. Shuichi Kajitani , Ibaraki University; Norhiro Sawa , Mech. Engrg. Dept., Ibaraki Univ.; and K. T. Rhee, Mech. and Aerospace Engrg. Dept., Rutgers State University of New Jersey. Reduction of soot and NOx emissions from a prechamber- type diesel engine is studied by employing both chemical and physical aspects of the fuel and induction method. Fuel modifica- tion was performed to produce several forms of composite fuel: solution of alcohol and gas oil (JIS No. 1); emulsification and mixture of methyl alcohol-gas oil prepared by off-and in-line fuel systems; and separate injection of fuels into the pre-and main- chamber. Those composite fuels were introduced by using both conven- tional and unconventional fuel induction methods to have the following cases of engine experiment; 1) injection of alcohol-gas oil solution into the pre-chamber; 2) injection of stabilized emul- sified fuels into the pre-chamber; 3) timed injection of gas oil and methanol into the prechamber to have them in-line mixing by using a newly designed hydroshear device; 4) controlled sequen- tial injection of gas oil and methanol into the pre-chamber through a new adaptor device; and 5) separate injection of gas oil into the pre-chamber and methanol into the main-chamber. In all the cases of composite fuels and induction (chemical and physical) methods investigated in the present study, the brake thermal efficiency (BTE) increased with the portion of alcohol in the composite fuel (R), and peaked when R = 15% in volume. When R =30%, the BTE, however, was comparable with measure- ments from the operation by neat gas oil (i.e., baseline data). Thereafter, it decreased somewhat with increase in R, that is, by about 10% when R=50%. The increase of BTE in case 3 for the entire range of R studied, was most encouraging. Comparing the emission data obtained from operation at R=50% with the baseline measurements, cases 1 and 2 produced emissions of soot and NOx lower by 30-50%; case 3 resulted in the emissions lower by over 50%; case 4 emitted them lower by about 30%; and case 5 had the emissions lower by about 20%. Note that although the emissions of unreacted hydrocarbon and formaldehyde at R=50% were a bit higher than the baseline mea- surements, they were still negligibly low in absolute values. It is especially noted that the timed injection of gas oil and methanol using the new hydroshear device produced highly promising results in both BTE and emissions. Some probable rea- sons for the results were considered in terms of modifications in both chemical and physical aspects of this composite fuel method. 911769. Performance of glow plug assisted direct injection methanol engine by impingement of fuel jet (OSKA-F). Shigeru Onishi and Satoshi Kato, Nippon Clean Engine Lab. Co., Ltd. The authors previously reported the performance of the "strat- ified charge methanol engine by impingement of fuel jet (OSKA system) with spark plug ingition." In that report, the impinging part was installed in the center of the piston cavity and a spark plug was used for ignition. In this report, the impinging part is installed on the cylinder head and a glow plug is used for ignition. A single-hole fuel injector (throttle type) is used. The center- line of the fuel injector coincides with that of the impinging part. A relatively low opening pressure (7 MPa) of the fuel injector is needed for this OSKA system. The fuel is injected against the impinging part, spreads and forms the fuel-air mixture. A glow plug is located just beside the impinging part. Experiments with a single-cylinder 4-stroke cycle prototype engine (bore x stroke = 94 x 90 mm) showed that the maximum brake mean effective pressure (BMEP) was 1.04 MPa and the maximum brake thermal efficiency was 41.9% (429.6 g/kW.h). The NOx emission was lower than that of the diesel engine and the unburnt methanol was lower than that of the OSKA methanol engine with spark plug. Low combustion noise was observed and confirmed by the cylinder pressure analysis. 1991 SAE Transactions Section 3 911770. Applications of metal matrix composites in high per- formance racing engines. R. Dwivedi, G. Altland, P. Barron - Antolin, and J. Leighton, Lanxide Corp.; and T. Gillespie, Com- petition Cams. Metal matrix composite (MMC) engine components for high performance racing applications were produced using the PRIMEX7" pressureless metal infiltration process. Utilization of these composites resulted in significant weight reduction and per- formance benefits for each component. The metal matrix composites which were evaluated consisted of aluminum alloys reinforced with 45-65 volume percent of either aluminum oxide or silicon carbide particulates. The high volume fraction of reinforcing particles resulted in significant increases in yield strength, stiffness, and wear resistance, while a significant decrease in the coefficient of thermal expansion was achieved as compared with unreinforced aluminum alloys. The tested metal matrix composite components included valve spring retainers, fuel pump pushrods, and transmission brake valves. Valve spring retainers, weighing approximately 40% of com- parable steel parts, were subjected to high speed testing for up to 16 hours (equivalent to running four 500 mile races) without showing any wear damage. Some wear damage was noted on the steel spring dampeners. This situation could be corrected by design or material changes. Improvements in retainer mechanical design or MMC strength are being investigated to survive testing under severe valve float conditions. Fuel pump pushrods, weighing approximately 30% of compa- rable steel parts, were tested for 93 hours without detectable wear. Transmission brake valves were subjected to 25 start/stop cycles of dynamometer and vehicle testing. The valves successfully completed these tests with no evidence of wear. 911771. Improvement in the thermal elasto-plastic FEM model applied to exhaust manifold. Hiroaki Kawano, Susumu Inoue, Mie Iwata, Tadashi Yamaguchi, Hideo Yanagisawa, and Eiji Fukumori, Toyoda Automatic Loom Works, Ltd. An exhaust manifold undergoing nonlinear thermal deforma- tion was analyzed, using the thermal elasto-plastic finite element model. The creep strain and the temperature-dependent apparent strain as well as nonlinear stress-strain relation are considered in the model for improving the computational accuracy. The stress- strain relation curve was formulated by means of a multi- regression analysis on the experimental data. Three dimensional solid and shell isoparametric elements were used to discretized the geometry of exhaust manifold. The boundary nodes adjacent to the interface of the cylinder head/exhaust manifold are sup- ported by three-way springs allowing those nodes to be moved freely in the three-dimensional coordinates. A number of experi- ments on the exhaust manifold were also carried out to justify the validity of the finite element model. Comparison of the model study with the experimental data shows an excellent agreement 208</page><page sequence="208">911771-911778 in both the temperature and the strain distributions confirming that deformation due to creep strain cannot be neglected in the exhaust manifold thermal deformation simulation. 911772. Exciting force characteristics in practical diesel engine with non-uniform velocity balancer driven by eccentric gear. Masaru Ogura, Nippon Institute of Technology. This report is concerned with the theory and experiment of reducing the exciting force in piston-crank mechanism by the using of an eccentric gear trains during in a non-uniform velocity balancer system. For the experiment, we designed a special apparatus to mea- sure the exciting force at X and Y directions, and the rolling moment M causing form crankshaft, in an unloaded single- cylinder diesel engine. The obtained results supported our theory, and were com- pared with that of a conventional engine, too. 911773. Variable R/L research engine - Design and prelimi- nary investigations. W. F. Wardzyński and T. J. Rychter, Warsaw University of Technology. In the paper the design of the single-cylinder research engine equipped with the mechanism which make it possible to adjust the compression ratio continuously and currently during the engine operation is introduced. The concept of that engine, called VR/LE (variable R/L engine), and its theory was presented else- where before, but so far the concept has not been brought into practice. By that the feasibility of constructing the real variable compression ratio engine according to the VR/LE principle has been proved. The presented results of the preliminary investiga- tions confirm the advantages of that concept. 1991 SAE Transactions Section 3 911774. Study on DI diesel engine with an impinging nozzle head - Performance and combustion characteristics. Bai-Fu Lin , Nippon Institute of Technology ; Susumu Daidoji, Kantogakuin Univ.; and Yoshio Ikeda and Masaru Ogura , Nippon Institute of Technology. A new impinging nozzle head attached on a normal injection nozzle was designed for improving the performance and combus- tion of DI diesel engine. Since the fuel is directly injected to the nozzle head at a very short distance from a spray tip of nozzle in a DI diesel engine, the fuel particules will be improved in spray diffusion and distribu- tion. In the case of a prototype injection nozzle with four orifices, the spray angle from each orifice is narrow and similar to the shape of conifer's leaves. By using of the new designed impinging nozzle head, however, an improved spray angle and distribution of fuel and a better starting performance at very low temperature have been observed. 911775. Elasticity- An important factor of wet friction materi- als. Satoshi Ohkawa, Takashi Kuse, Nobuyuki Kawasaki, Akira Shibata, and Masao Yamashita, Komatsu Ltd. From investigating the porosity and graphite effects on sin- tered bronze for wet clutch applications, it is clear that elasticity, as determined by the porosity and the graphite content, is impor- tant for both the friction coefficient and the power absorbing capacity. The apparent elastic modulus values, measured by a compres- sion test of clutch disks, show a very good correlation with perfor- mances of various wet friction materials (sintered bronze, paper, graphitics and elastomerics) in both an inertia-brake type clutch testing machine and also on the full-size powershift transmission bench. The lower elastic modulus material has the higher friction coefficient and the better energy/power absorbing capacity. Effects of the material pores, the oil-groove patterns and also the material deterioration on friction performances and hot-spot size are disucssed in conjunction with apparent elastic modules. 1991 SAE Transactions Section 2 911776. Optimization of a farm seeding and fertilizing spring- loaded four-bar mechanism. Raju Dandu, Stephen A. Tennyson, and Sudhir I. Mehta, Mech. Engrg. Dept., North Dakota State Univ. A sequential quadratic programming technique was utilized to synthesize optimal performance of a spring-loaded four-bar mechanism that, when actuated, lifts a farm tillage implement out of the soil. Maximum lift and magnitude of actuation force were significantly improved over a current design. Computer- aided design was used to confirm that interference design con- straints were not violated during optimization. In-field perfor- mance of the mechanism when encountering an obstacle was ver- ified using a dynamic model to realistically simulate the event. This paper presents efforts to improve performance of a spring-loaded four-bar mechanism through the application of computer-aided design technqiues. When actuated, the mecha- nism allows a seeding and fertilizing implement to pivot out of the soil to avoid damage by some obstacle. The manufacturer of this device sought to improve its performance by increasing verti- cal displacement and maintaining a near constant driving force during actuation. These improvements would have a positive impact on reliability and productivity of the implement. Com- puter-aided design techniques were used to evaluate the current design, optimize the design variables to meet design criteria, and simulate "in-field" performance. 911777. New variations of the cardan concept increase univer- sal joint performance. Paul J. Cornay, Drive Technologies, Inc.; and James S. Britton, Stress Engineering Services, Inc. An increased demand for greater performance of universal joints has prompted the development of joints capable of long life at high speeds, high angles, and high loads. The cardan joint has proven to be the only design capable of meeting all these demands. New variations of the cardan and double cardan con- cepts have shown the ability to increase universal joint perfor- mance. The purpose of this paper is to define the advantages of a new universal joint design based on the cardan concept. By changing the shape and location of component parts of the cardan and dou- ble cardan designs, improvements in lubrication, vibration and misalignment can be obtained. Advantages in lubrication can be accomplished by replacing the internal cardan cross or "spider" with an external ring. Vibration improvements over the double cardan joint are obtained by replacing the external connecting yoke with an internal connecting member. Misalignment angles up to 90° are possible with less sacrifice to joint rigidity and space requirements. 911778. The development of a high performance jaw clutch transmission for railcars.

Diesel railcars in Japan have played a major role in transporta- tion over mountain lines with steep gradients. However, the effi- ciency of conventional transmissions is low and the speed of the cars when negotiating gradients is slow being in a range of approx- imately 40km/h as current transmissions operate in hydraulic torque converter phase. The authors have developed a new trans- mission provided with two direct stages of jaw clutch drive and have tested it at Railway Technical Research Institute, the Japan Railways Group (referred to as RTRI, JR). Following a satisfac- tory test, two improved transmission units were built on the basis of the results. The transmissions were installed in a standard JR diesel railcar and tested on a JR mainline in the mountain zone. 209</page><page sequence="209">911778-911787 The test results showed that the performance of the diesel railcar was greatly improved thanks to the new transmissions. 1991 SAE Transactions Section 2 911779. Dynamic modeling of the transmission line of an agri- cultural tractor. François Brassart, Bernard Drouin, and Fernand Gublin , Ecole Nationale Supérieure d'Arts et Métiers ; and Jean-François Goupillon, C.E.M.A.G.R.E.F. The purpose of this study was to analyse the dynamic behavior of a tractor driveline with respect to torsional vibrations in order to improve design procedures for transmission quality. A model of the transmission line was developed by CEMAGREF and ENSAM for the Renault 145-14 TX tractor. The model was tested by comparing the global torsional stiffness of the model to experimental measurements of the actual stiffness for different gears. Then, the natural frequencies of vibration of the model were determined and checked against the frequency of the vibra- tions generated by the engine to detect any detrimental coupling. The results of this investigation are presented in this paper. 1991 SAE Transactions Section 2 911780. Integrated hall effect speed sensing in gerotor hydrau- lic motors. James M. Bowling, White Hydraulics, Inc. Improved technology and hall effect sensing as a source of electronic feedback in hydraulic motor systems are discussed. This paper is to introduce this technology and to heighten aware- ness. This technology will fill a need in monitoring and measur- ing methods for increased economy and will lend itself to ecologi- cal controls. 911782. Small agricultural tractor ROPS - New operator pro- tective zone. Edward A. Fritz, William G. Switalski, and J. I. Case, Triody ne, Inc. The Equipment Manufacturers Institute (EMI) sponsored a literature search conducted by Triodyne, Inc. which attempted to identify all "operator protective zones" ever utilized in the world. This effort was intended to determine whether published infor- mation existed to define a more compact operator protective zone than those of current SAE (ASAE) standards for possible uti- lization in developing a new standard for a more compact design of rollover protective structures (ROPS) for small agricultural tractors. The research has led Triodyne to conclude that the oper- ator protective zones upon which the current SAE (ASAE) ROPS standards are based are the only substantiated zones available for possible application to small agricultural tractors. 1991 SAE Transactions Section 2 911783. A numerical study of pulsating flow in a duct with a junction. J. Iwamoto and M. Endo, Tokyo Denki Univ. The pulsating flow in a duct with a junction was studied numerically using a random-choice method and the experiments were carried out to check if this numerical simulation is valid or not. As a result, good agreement was found between the experi- ment and numerical calculation. Concerning the location of the shock wave the agreement was excellent. The Random-Choice Method may be applied to real reciprocating engines by coupling it to a multi-dimensional in-cylinder simulation. 1991 SAE Transactions Section 3 911784. Chemistry implications form optical diagnostics in engine research. Gregory P. Smith and David R. Crosley, SRI International. Modern optical diagnostics such as laser induced fluorescence (LIF) offer considerable assistance in developing effective com- putational capabilities for complex reactive flows. Applications of these selective, spatially-resolved, nonintrusive technologies include model verification, input parameters, and kinetic simpli- cations for complex calculations. Pertinent examples from our current diagnostics development and flame applications are reviewed with an emphasis on the chemical implications to advanced computational dynamics for engines. Raman, LIF, and chemiluminescence diagnostics are discussed; potential diagnos- tics applications include fluid mixing, pollutants, knock, flame front location, and temperature measurement. 911785. The effects of spray, mixing, and combustion model parameters on KIVA-II predictions. Constantine A. Varnavas, Automotive Systems Lab., Dept. of Mech. and Inustrial Engrg., University of I; and Dennis N. Assanis, Automotive Systems Lab., Dept. of Mech. and Industrial Engrg., University of. The combustion process in a diesel engine was simulated using KIVA-II, a multi-dimensional computer code. The original combustion model in KIVA-II is based on chemical kinetics, and thus fails to capture the effects of turbulence on combustion. A mixing-controlled, eddy break-up combustion model was imple- mented into the code. Realistic diesel fuel data were also com- piled. Subsequently, the sensitivity of the code to a number of parameters related to fuel injection, mixing, and combustion was studied. Spray injection parameters were found to have a strong influence on the model's predictions. Higher injection velocity and shorter injection duration result in a higher combustion rate and peak pressure and temperature. The droplet size specified at injection significantly affects the rate of spray penetration and evaporation, and thus the combustion rate. Contrary to expecta- tion, the level of turbulence at the beginning of the calculation did not affect fuel burning rate. 1991 SAE Transactions Section 3 911786. Evaluation and study of the heat release rate of swirl chamber diesel engines. Song Shouxin, Tongji Univ.; and Zhou Longbao, Han Zhiyu, Xu Bin, Zhang Yuyin, and Du Jialin, Jiao- tong Univ. A zero-dimensional computation model for the heat release rate of a swirl chamber diesel engine is established in this paper. With the aid of control volume analysis method of variable mass thermodynamic system, the instantaneous discharge coefficient of the connecting passage of combustion chambers is accurately determined by calculating the motored indicator diagrams of main and swirl chambers. A deeper study is also made on the heat release rate and other combustion characteristics under various conditions of the swirl chamber diesel engine such as connecting passages with different structural parameters, different shapes of main combustion chambers and different operating conditions. Thus some beneficial conclusions are reached, that is, the com- bustion delay in the main combustion chamber of the swirl chamber diesel engine is an important reason for its fuel economy lower than that of a DI diesel engine besides its greater losses of flow and heat. 911787. Implementation of a fuel spray wall interaction model in KIVA-II. Dennis Assanis, Universtiy of Illinois at Urbana- Champaign; and Leonard K. Shih, University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign. The original spray model in the KIVA-II code includes sub- models for drop injection, breakup, coalescence, and evapora- tion. Despite the sophisticated structure of the model, predicted spray behavior is not in satisfactory agreement with experimental results. Some of the discrepancies are attributed to the lack of a fuel jet wall impingement sub-model, a wall fuel layer evapora- tion sub-model, and uncertainties related to the choice of sub- models parameters. A spray impingement model based on earlier research has been modified and implemented in KIVA-II. Heat transfer between the fuel layer on the piston surface and the neighboring gaseous charge has also been modelled based on the colburn analogy. A series of two dimensional simulations have been performed for a Caterpillar 1Y540 diesel engine to investi- gate droplet penetration, impingement, fuel evaporation, and chemical reaction, and the dependence of predictions on certain model parameters. 1991 SAE Transactions Section 3 210</page><page sequence="210">911788-911796 911788. VR/LE engine concept application to the turbochar- ged diesel engine. T. J. Rychter and A. Teodorczyk, Warsaw Uni- versity of Technology ; C. R. Stone and H. J. Leonard , Brunei Univ.; S. J. Charlton , School of Engrg., University of Bath ; and N. Ladommatos, Brunei Univ. A variable compression ratio concept that can give a different expansion ratio to the compression ratio has been evaluated by means of a simulation of a turbocharged diesel engine. The VR/LE mechanism kinematics have been defined and described, and the compression ratio and expansion ratio have been pres- ented as a function of the eccentric phase angle (a0). A zero- dimensional engine simulation that has been the subject of com- prehensive validation, has been used as the basis of the VR/LE study. The effect of the compression ratio on the engine perfor- mance at fixed loads is presented. The principal benefits are a reduction in fuel consumption at part load of about 2%, and a reduction in ignition delay that leads to an estimated 6 dB reduc- tion in combustion noise. The study has been conducted within the assumption of a maximum cylinder pressure of 160 bar. 911789. 3-D modeling of diesel engine intake flow, combustion and emissions. Rolf D. Reitz, University of Wisconsin ; and C. J. Rutland ', Univeristy of Wisconsin. Manufacturers of heavy-duty diesel engines are facing increas- ingly stringent, emission standards. These standards have moti- vated new research efforts toward improving the performance of diesel engines. The objective of the present program is to develop a comprehensive analytical model of the diesel combustion pro- cess that can be used to explore the influence of design changes. This will enable industry to predict the effect of these changes on engine performance and emissions. A major benefit of the suc- cessful implementation of such models is that engine develop- ment time and costs would be reduced through their use. The computer model is based on the three-dimensional KIVA-II code, with state-of-the-art submodels for spray atomization, drop breakup/coalescence, multi-component fuel vaporization, spray/ wall interaction, ignition and combustion, wall heat transfer, unburned HC and NOx formation, and soot and radiation. The accuracy of the predictions is assessed by comparison with avail- able experimental data. Improved combustion, wall heat transfer and spray/wall impingement submodels have been implemented in KIVA during the first year activity. In addition, work is in progress on a revised atomization model, since preliminary results show that existing atomization models are inaccurate under conditions of high gas temperature and pressure (e.g., tur- bocharged conditions). Finally, a methodology is bieng devel- oped for modeling the intake flow process to provide more realis- tic initial conditions for engine computations. 1991 SAE Transactions Section 3 911790. Modeling of diesel engine operation. Vladimir A. Kula kov, Agricultural Institute. The computer modeling is based on interconnected calcula- tion of the processes in the air-fuel spray and in the combustion chamber. Integral form of gas dynamics equations for air-fuel spray description gives simple, reliable and physically evident method of numerical solving. This allows to carry the numerical simulation of in-cylinder processes from fuel injection to determination of output parame- ters: efficiency, power output, etc. 911791. Electromagnetic compatibility in the off-highway vehicle. James J. Poloniš and William H. McGinnis, Southwest Research Institute. The key words in the marketplace for off-highway vehicles are durability, performance, and efficiency. A manufacturer of these vehicles recognizes that one way to successfully address these needs is by a well thought through electronics design. With the computer sophistication now being incorporated into off- highway vehicles, engineers must work closely to assure electro- magnetic compatibility (EMC) of the entire system. A properly established EMC program extending from concept to final design will support each of a producťs specified operations and still function as an integrated whole. This paper describes the process for designing the EMC for an off-highway vehicle. 1 991 SAE Transactions Section 2 911792. Hydraulic control system for a corn detasseler./. R. Brubaker and Gary W. Krutz, Agricultural Engrg. Dept., Purdue Univ.; P. R. Ukrainetz, Dept. of Mech. Engrg., University of Sas- katchewan; P. L. Nine, Wolf Technical Services; and Harry G. Gibson, Agricultural Engrg. Dept., Purdue Univ. Performance specifications for a corn detasseler position con- trol system were determined. An electrohydraulic position con- trol system was designed and bench tested against the specifica- tions. The bench prototype utilized three different actuators, a 2 inch diameter cylinder, a 6.4 in3 motor, and a 3.0 in3 motor. Each prototype system was tested with a basic carrier bracket load and a complete detassaling assembly load. With a supply of 10 gpm at 2000 psi, a 6.4 in3 motor met the performance requirements. With the same supply, the 2 inch diameter cylinder system was too slow and the 3.0 in3 motor system was unstable. 1991 SAE Transactions Section 2 911793. Sensor requirements for combine harvester control./. N. Wilson and N. D. Klassen, Dept. of Mech. Engrg., University of Saskatchewan. The potential benefits of combine harvester control are out- lined. The implementation of combine automation, however, has been hampered by the lack of available sensors. This paper identifies the major sensor requirements, provides a literature review of sensor development to date, and suggests areas for sensor research and development. 1991 SAE Transactions Section 2 911794. Evaluation of machine vision algorithms for locating corn plants. JianchengJia, Harry G. Gibson, and Gary W. Krutz, Agricultural Engrg. Dept., Purdue Univ. The feasibility study of using machine vision technolgy to locate corn plants was conducted to determine its potential in the development of an intelligent detasseling machine. A corn plant feature, the main vein of leaf, was used and the method of feature detection was developed for corn plant identification. Experi- mental results showed that the leaf feature and the center of the plant can be detected and located using image processing tech- niques when an image is taken from above of a plant. This research showed that it is possible to identify and locate the corn plant using machine vision technology. 1991 SAE Transactions Section 2 911795.

Gusev, Moscsow Institute of Agricultural Engi- neers. Electronics are very sensitive to vibration and it is mandatory that the design engineer be familiar with the environment in which they will be used. This paper describes the vibrational environment of a tractor. A full scale tractor cab was outfitted with sensors and vibrated at various frequencies. The results are supported by theoretical calculations. 911796. Electric technology and agricultural products quality estimation. I. F. Borodin, Moscow Institute of Agricultural Engi- neers.

Bearing performance optimization into the 21st cen- tury. Gregory W. Martin and Charles A. Moyert Timken Co. In order to optimize bearing performance in the 21st century, bearing life prediction will need to consider bearing ratings (the starting point), the actual environmental conditions in which bearings will operate and will need to identify the appropriate adjustment bridge in order to go from rating life to realistic appli- cation life. Generic ratings, as published in standards, are described in this paper as well as specific ratings for a single type bearing based on explicit, experimentally determined parameters. Life adjust- ment factors are then discussed covering both the bearing stan- dards ai, a2, a3 approach and a more comprehensive life adjust- ment approach that recognizes the interdependency of the vari- ous adjustment factors subfactors, and the load-life relationship. This concept is demonstrated with tapered roller bearing exam- ples and experimental support for improved bearing life predic- tion in the more demanding application environments of the future. 911798.

Exploratory testing and analysis of full ceramic ball bearings. Paul E. Duffy, Torrington Co. A small sample lot of conrad type ball bearings fabricated of silicon nitride have been fatigue tested under full film liquid lubrication conditions. Analysis of the failed bearings points to a failure mechanism which is different than that of steel bearing fatigue. A failure model has been developed based on the static strength of the material, manufacturing process effects and basic contact mechanics. The failure mode found identities one limita- tion of the use of ceramic bearings. The limitation is dictated by the tensile stresses produced in operation and the strength of the finished component. It was demonstrated that silicon nitride fails by mechanical fatigue when subject to high Hertzian contact stress. It must be clearly understood, however, that the high hertzian contact stresses (above 350 k.s.i.) used in this test pro- gram are greater than those of recommended design practice. The bearing manufacturing, testing and failure analysis are discussed. 1991 SAE Transactions Section 2 911801. 250 bar vane pump. Harry T. Johnson and Jerome Johnson, Vickers, Inc. Fixed displacement pumps will continue to be a popular choice for hydraulic system designers for decades to come. These pumps are used in almost every industrial and mobile market segment and are generally less expensive than comparable vari- able displacement type pumps. Fixed displacement "vane type" pumps are especially popular because of their low noise characteristics as well as their inherent repair features. The demand for "van type" fixed displacement pumps continues to grow in all market segments. Because of this continued demand, a new design of "fixed dis- placement vane pumps" is being developed. These pumps, desig- nated the VPF series, are targeted to offer continuous operating pressures up to 280 BAR with displacements from 40 to 215 cc/ rev. 911802. Series 51: a family of bent axis motors to meet today's market requirements. Lester J. Thompson and Lyle Bretz, Sauer- Sundstrand Co. The Sauer-Sundstrand Series 51 variable displacement motors were designed to be the most technically advanced hydraulic units in the industry. They are intended to be primarily integrated into a closed circuit hydraulic system for the purpose of transfer and control of hydraulic power. The motors, also, are used in open circuit applications. The Series 51 is a bent axis design and provides features that are advantageous to creating compact hydraulic systems that are cost efficient for a broad range of torque and speed capability. The controls included in the large array of control options were designed to meet the requirements of the worldwide markets for the 1990's hydraulic power trans- missions. 911803. Vickers new PVH variable volume pumps. Joe Robey and Ken Rosenbecker, Vickers, Inc. This paper outlines the design philosophy and evaluation of the new "H" series variable displacement, medium pressure, open-circuit, axial piston hydraulic pumps. The "H" series is based on previously existing, technically successful, rotating group designs, but has significant design improvements affecting the areas of: unit weight; envelope size; ease of assembly, disas- sembly, repairability and modification; and alternate fluid capa- bilities. The "H" series is a family of naturally aspirated pumps nomi- nally rated at 250 or 275 bar (3625 or 4000 psig), depending on system operating parameters. The geometric displacements of the four units in the series are as follows: 57cc (3.5 cu. in./rev.); 74cc (4.5 cu. in./rev.); 98cc (6.0 cu. in./rev.); and 131cc (8.0 cu. in./ rev.). 911804. Silent hydraulic valves. Gabriel Silva, Young &amp; Franklin, Inc. Control valves are one of the major sources of noise genera- tion in hydraulic systems. A valve design that controls the factors that trigger noise during flow throttling is discussed in this paper. The proposed valve geometry avoids noise generation primarily by maintaining laminar flow and avoiding cavitation and bound- ary layer separation through the flow passage. The valve design consists of a variable annular tapered configuration that controls pressure and flow quietly. Experimental verification conducted in a two-way valve shows the effectiveness of the valve design in maintaining airborne noise levels below 40 dbA at high pressure and high flows. 1991 SAE Transactions Section 2 911805. (SP-883) Small utility engine emissions reduction using automotive technology. Robert W. Burrahm , Jeff J. White, and James N. Carroll, Southwest Research Institute. Recent legislation including the California Clean Air Act of 1988 and the Federal Clean Air Act Amendment of 1990 will reg- ulate exhaust emissions from small utility, lawn, and garden equipment engines. In an attempt to gain as much understanding as possible in a short time, SwRI has conducted a series of tests to investigate the effectiveness of late 1960's automotive emis- sion reduction technology on small engines. Experiments were conducted utilizing air injection into the exhaust, exhaust gas recirculation (EGR), and ignition timing changes. The test engine was a 4 stroke generator set engine rated 5.88 Kw at 3600 rpm. Results show these technologies to be very effective in reducing 212</page><page sequence="212">911805-911813 hydrocarbons (HC), oxides of nitrogen (NOx), and carbon mon- oxide (CO). 911806. (SP-883) An emission comparison between a carbu- retor and an electronic fuel injection system for utility engines. Mark Swanson , Walbro Engine Management Corp. An electronic fuel injection system has been developed for utility engines which will reduce exhaust emissions and give greater control of the air/fuel ratio compared to the standard car- buretor. Standard automotive components were used when pos- sible. The electronic fuel injection system is a port fuel injected design using a bottom feed fuel injector which sprays directly on the intake valve. The engine speed/position, throttle position, air intake temperature and cylinder head temperature are measured and fed into the electronic control unit. Look-up tables are used to determine the injection duration time during starting, warm-up, acceleration and normal operating conditions. Normal operating conditions are conditions the engine would encounter during actual use such as idle to governored rpm, no-load to full load, ambient temperature ranges from -40°C to 55°C, and any combination of the above. Corrections for engine overheating are also made, but not for a restricted air filter element. An electric fuel pump and mechanical pressure regulator were used to supply and control the fuel pressure to the fuel injector. 911807. (SP-883) Emission control strategies for small utility engines. Jeff J. White, Southwest Research Institute; James N. Carroll and Charles T. Hare, Southwest Research Institute ; and Jacline G. Lourenco, California Air Resources Board. Recent approval of emission standards for small utility engines by the California Air Resources Board suggests that sub- stantial reductions in emissions from small utility engines will soon be required. While 1994 standards may be met with simple engine adjustments or modifications, 1999 standards are much more stringent and may require the use of catalysts in conjunc- tion with other emission reduction technologies. Assessing the feability of candidate emission control strategies is an important first step. Various emission reduction technologies were applied to three different 4-stroke engines. Emission tests were conducted to determine the effectiveness of air/fuel ratio changes, thermal oxi- dation, exhaust gas recirculation, and catalytic oxidation with and without supplemental air. Results of these evaluations, along with implications for further work, are presented. One engine's emissions were reduced below the levels of 1999 ARB standards. 1991 SAE Transactions Section 3 911808. (SP-883) Present and future European exhaust emis- sion regulations for off-road diesel engines. Jaime E. Sauerteig, Deutz Corp.; and Peter J. H. Treiber, Kloeckn er -Hum boldt-Deu tz AG. The development of European emission regulations for auto- motive heavy-duty diesel engines began in the mid 1970s; the lat- est modifications to test procedures and standards have been in place since 1988. Presently, the emphasis of the European regula- tory activities is in the areas of increasing the stringency of the gaseous standards and developing standards. For non-automotive industrial engines test procedures and standards are presently under consideration. Implementation of these requirements is anticipated in a two-stage approach begin- ning the mid 1990s. This paper provides an overview of the present and future European exhaust emission requirements. 911809. (SP-883) A simulation of lean hunting in gasoline engines. Yoshinori Watanabe and Munenobu Tanaka, Kyushu Tokai Univ. Carburetor engines with an inertia governor sometimes exhibit a self-excited oscillation in rotation speed, called hunting. The mechanism of hunting has been extensively studied for many years. It is our general understanding that the dynamic characteristic of the inertia governor is the primary factor to explain the phenomenon. However, the existence of another kind of hunting, called lean hunting, where lag in air-fuel ratio plays a more important role than the dynamic characteristic of the iner- tia governor, was reported by Tanaka. His previous papers, show- ing various experimental measurements of oscillating engine speed, air-fuel ratio and peak cylinder pressure, explain the nature of the phenomenon. To provide the foregoing work with a theoretical ground, we developed a mathematical formulation for the mechanism of lean hunting. Our new paper demonstrates, by numerical calculations, the process in which engine speed becomes oscillatory reaching a limit cycle, as air-fuel ratio becomes leaner. 911810. (SP-883) Design of a modified hypocycloid engine. David M. Ruch, Frank J. Fronczak, and Norman H. Beachley, Mech. Engrg. Dept., University of Wisconsin-Madison. The modified hypocyloid engine incorporates a unique geared drive that imparts straight-line, sinusoidal motion to the one- piece piston and rod assembly. These kinematic characteristics provide a variety of potential benefits not possible with tradi- tional slider-crank kinematics. Perfect engine balance is achieved through the use of two sets of counterweights. The absence of pis- ton side thrust promises reductions in piston assembly friction and piston slap, even with smaller piston skirts. Additional potential benefits include improved combustion characteristics and reduced piston manufacturing costs. Although simpler hypo- cycloid designs provide the same motion, the modified hypocy- cloid engine reduces gear and crankshaft loading. A description and design details of a prototype engine cur- rently under construction are presented. Patented design improvements over previous hypocycloid designs are described. These improvements reduce crankshaft stresses, ensure a com- pact crankshaft with convenient assembly and dissassembly, and control deviations from the desired straight-line piston motion that are caused by gear tooth backlash. 1991 SAE Transactions Section 3 911812. (SP-884) Modeling the interface between incompati- ble P-element boundaries. Ken Welch and Rich King, Rasna Corp. A common problem in creating a finite element mesh is mod- eling the interface between incompatible element boundaries. Incompatibilities will arise in transitions between continuum and structural elements such as 3D solids and shells or in regions where edge to edge (or face to face) connectivity is not main- tained. Presented here is a method implemented in the commer- cial structural analysis program, Applied Structure, to automati- cally handle these situations. Within the method, consideration is given to shell-to-shell, solid-to-solid, and shell-to-solid transi- tions. A theoretical background and several examples are given which illustrate the robustness of the method. Finally, some prac- tical considerations are discussed with respect to typical applica- tions of the approach. 911813. (SP-882) Intelligent linear actuator. Larry L. Hartter, James A. Kessler, Velliyiur Subbarao, and Richard S. Leemhuis, Vickers Inc. This paper describes a microcomputer-controlled hydraulic actuator designed with controllability, flexibility and ease-of-use as the fundamental goals. To achieve this, the electronics, valv- ing, sensors and hydraulic cylinder are contained in a single, pre- engineered package. The embedded electronics provide complete closed-loop control of the actuator, including self-diagnostic capability and nonvolatile storage of application specific motion 213</page><page sequence="213">911813-911820 programs. Multiple actuators can be controlled via a serial com- munications bus to execute coordinated motions, or individual actuators can operate as stand-alone devices with simple on-off inputs to control their motion. This self-contained motion control package is well suited for the new generation of increasingly automated mobile machinery. 1991 SAE Transactions Section 2 911814. (SP-882) Electrohydraulic loadsensing. W. Backe, University of Technology, Aachen ; andB. Zähe, Institute for Fluid Power Transmission and Control, University of Technology . Valve-controlled hydraulic drives are frequently used when high dynamics, high reliability and a compact structural form are required. A disadvantage which is frequently attributed to a valve-controlled drive is its poor running efficiency. It not only leads to higher energy consumption but - amongst other things - to the necessity of installing large pumps and more elaborate cooling equipment. Both these factors cause an increase in the costs of hydraulic drives. Load sensing is known from the field of mobile hydraulics as a driving concept with high running effi- ciency. In load sensing the supply pressure is adjusted to suit the actuator's highest point of load pressure. The dynamics of this system is worse than that of systems with a constant supply pres- sure. Electrohydraulic load sensing offers possibilities to improve the dynamics of valve-controlled drives in load sensing by using control engineering measures. 1991 SAE Transactions Section 2 911815. (SP-882) Development of a high speed on/off valve. P. Cui, Richard T. Burton, and P. R. Ukrainetz, Dept. of Mech. Engrg., University of Saskatchewan. The direct interface of fluid power components to digital com- puters requires electrohydraulic devices which can be actuated by a digital signal. High speed solenoid valves are devices ideally suited for this kind of application due to their on/off characteris- tics. In the last two decades, considerable research has been focused on developing fast responding on/off valves and this research has achieved some success. The fastest responding valves that have been reported are usually single stage and can only handle low flow rates. Two stage valves which can accom- modate high flow rates have been developed, but they are either slow in responding or complicated in construction. In this paper, the feasibility of a rotary based, single stage, fast responding digital valve is considered. The feasibility study con- sisted of developing a nonlinear model of the valve from which transient and steady state responses were simulated. Based on these simulation studies, a prototype valve was designed and fab- ricated. The configuration of the valve is introduced in this paper. Some preliminary experimental results of the testing of this valve are presented. 1991 SAE Transactions Section 2 911816. (SP-882) Feasibility study of a digital variable flow divider valve. Kin Fu Lu and Greg J. Schoenau, Dept. of Mech. Engrg., University of Saskatchewan ; X. R. Zeng, Power Engrg. Dept., Harbin Institute of Technology ; and Richard T. Burton, Dept. of Mech. Engrg., University of Saskatchewan. The problem of synchronizing several loads has been the sub- ject of many studies over the past few years. Some of the authors have been involved in the design of high precision flow divider/ combiner valves which are accurate to 99% over large pressure and flow ranges. The disadvantage of these designs lies in their inflexibility in terms of varying flow with complete independence to the various loads. Traditional approaches to the multi-load problem have been to use velocity of flow feedback signals to sev- eral electrohydraulic valves to obtain independent action. In this paper, the authors introduce the feasibility of using a single rotary type valve to provide a pulse width modulated flow pulse to each circuit. A model of the basic concept was used to establish the fea- sibility of the approach using simulation studies. A possible valve configuration to implement the concept is presented. 911817. (SP-882) Use of a flapper-nozzle valve for axial piston pump control. S. T. Tsai, Dept. of Industrial Technology, Illinois State Univ.; A. Akers, Dept. of Aerospace Engrg. and Engrg. Mechanics, Iowa State Univ.; and S. J. Lin , Dept. of Industrial Technology, Eastern Michigan Univ. A mathematical model of an axial piston pump with a flapper- nozzle valve was developed. The first stage was dynamically sta- ble, and calculated values of first-stage gain and dynamic response agreed well with experimental values. Linearized rela- tions were produced for each component part and were combined to form the total state-variable representation of the model. The open loop system, the combined axial piston pump and flapper- nozzle valve, exhibited dynamic instability. However, when the feedback loop was augmented by the output pressure differential, stability was achieved. From the time responses of the augmented optimal control system we observed that an increase of input current had little effect on the system response. Doubling the discharge flow rate doubled the overshoot, and an increase in the discharge volume slowed down the system responses. Increasing rotational speed of the pump produced a higher overshoot and a slower response. The performance of an axial piston pump with a flapper- nozzle valve used as a controller was compared to the perfor- mances of such a pump with a four-way hydraulic valve, a single- stage electrohydraulic servovalve, and a two-stage electrohy- draulic servovalve used as controllers. We found the combina- tion of a flapper-nozzle valve and an axial piston pump to be superior to other combinations in terms of the balance between pressure-time response and maximum pressure overshoot. 911818. (SP-882) The dynamics of pump-line-nozzle fuel injec- tion systems. Richard D. Strunk, University of Wisconsin- Platteville. Many diesel engines are equipped with pump-line-nozzle fuel injection systems. These injection systems must be properly tuned in order to achieve the desired fuel delivery without creat- ing secondary injection or cavitation in the injection lines. This paper derives a dynamic model of pump-line-nozzle fuel injec- tion systems that describes how the design variables for the pump, the injection lines and the nozzles are interrelated. Guide- lines are presented for tuning these injection systems in order to obtain the desired performance. 911819. (SP-882) Electronically controlled high pressure unit injector system for diesel engines. Pierre Lauvin, Alf Löffler, Alfred Schmitt, Werner Zimmermann, and Walter Fuchs, Robert Bosch GmbH. To achieve the future emissions regulations with low particu- late and NOx levels, both the engine combustion system and the fuel injection equipment will have to be improved. For the fuel injection equipment, high injection pressure and variable injec- tion timing as a function of engine speed, load, and temperature are of great importance. Bosch is developing two different solu- tions: electronically controlled unit injector and single cylinder pump systems; and high-pressure inline pumps with control sleeve and electronic control. This paper describes: the unit injector and its high-pressure solenoid valve; the requirements for the mounting of the unit injector in the engine; the low-pressure system; and the electronic control unit and the metering strategy. 1991 SAE Transactions Section 3 911820. Improvement of diesel engine performance through fuel-injection equipment optimization. Arcadii Z. Grinshpan and Stanislav A. Romanov, NPO CNITA. 214</page><page sequence="214">911820-911827 A method of calculation is proposed that allows, on the basis of cause-and-sequence approach, to improve the main quantita- tive charactersitics of diesel engines by means of optimization of fuel injection conditions and finding out parameters of fuel injec- tion equipment (TA) for their realization. When using the method, it is assumed that certain technical requirements and limits are to be observed (for instance, the maximum combustion pressure, engine noise, emission standards etc.). The two stages of the method are reflecting the natural sequence of TA design. Components of a developed mathematical model are described in this paper. In particular, special attention is paid to an original phenomenological model of a dispersed fuel spray on the basis of experimental data pertaining to its structure and mix- ture formation mechanism. This method has already shown its effectiveness for different practical tasks of minimizing fuel consumption of a diesel engine with known design and setting parameters. Some results are given of real calculations for diesel engines with different dimensions and supercharging rate. 911821. An investigation on transient rotational speed of inter- nal combustion engines. Huang YiLiang, Cheng Yong, Wu Bo, and Zhang Zimei, Shandong Polytechnic Univ. There are two kinds of rotational speed changes in running of internal combustion engines - rotational speed fluctuation within each working cycle and rotational speed change of succes- sive cycles. Application of transient rotational speed n&lt;p of each crank angle and average rotational speed nc of any working cycle can rationally demonstrate speed of I.C.E. Conventional speed-measure instruments may not be used to measure n&lt;p and nc. Therefore, authors take work on this measur- ing technique. This paper introduces the measuring principle and instrument, and analyses the accuracy of measure. The developed instrument has been used on 5 types of diesel engines, such as 6135, 6130Q, R4100, etc. Measured results at steady condition, low speed radomrunning, sudden loading, free acceleration and starting process are given in this paper. 911822. Design management - The new quality requirement for the 90's. Bruce Renquist, Renquist Associates, Inc. Global competition in the 80's has greatly changed domestic views on the importance of product design. The design manage- ment challenge for U.S. corporations in the 90's is to recognize quality design, integrate it early into the product development process and to manage it well. The criteria of good design, the stages of product development and approaches for integrating design into the process are discussed. 911823. An integrated approach using tire and soil stresses to predict soil compaction. R. L. Raper, A. C. Bailey, and E. C. Burt, USDA, ARS, National Soil Dynamics Lab.; and C. E. Johnson, Dept. of Agricultural Engrg., Auburn Univ. The National Soil Dynamics Laboratory and Aurburn Uni- versity are developing tools and methods to help farmers make correct decisions about how to best avoid compacting their soil€ Four areas of research are being integrated into an overall soil compaction model. These areas are the measurement of soil-tire interface stresses, the measurement of soil stresses in the soil pro- file, the development of constitutive stress-strain relationships for agricultural soils, and the development of analytical and finite element soil compaction models that can accurately predict the depth and degree of excessive soil compaction. 911824. Testing and evaluating properties of new cereal varie- ties for machine processing. B. Szot, Polish Academy of Sciences Institute of Agrophysics ; G. S. V. Raghavan, Agricultural Engrg. Dept., McGill Univ.; and W. K. Bilanski, University of Guelph. Cereal grains are subjected to physical forces produced by agri- cultural machinery during and after harvest. The resulting physi- cal damages have biological consequences such as reduced germi- nation and yield. Damages may be minimized by adjusting equipment to take into account the physical resistance of grain to mechanical and dynamic loading. This paper describes meth- ods for evaluating grain-to-ear binding force and grain physical resistance and presents the results for barley, rye, spring wheat and winter wheat varieties. Results of research on relationships between physical forces and biological effects of varieties of spring wheat and winter wheat are also presented and discussed. 1991 SAE Transactions Section 2 911825. Energy evaluation of tillage tools using soil bin. Mustafa M. Khalid and R. L. Kushwaha, Agricultural Engrg. Dept., University of Saskatchewan. Tillage is an important component of crop production system and may be defined as any mechanical manipulation of soil to improve its appearance and physical condition for crop produc- tion. The factors affecting the energy requirement by a tillage tools include initial soil conditions, tool shape, and manner of tool movement in the soil and the desired final soil conditions. Soil bin facilities have generally been used to evaluate soil forces and compare energy required by tillage tools. Commonly used cultivator sweeps in the Canadian Prairies were tested in the soil bin to evaluate their suitability on energy demand. The draft of the sweeps was found to be a function of the depth and speed of operation. Tool shape plays an important role in the energy demand. The smooth sweep with low soil lifting characteristics was found to be the most suitable under these test conditions. 911826. Factors affecting mechanical handling of fruits: a crit- ical review. S. T. A. R. Kaj una and W. K. Bilanski, University of Guelph. Mechanical handling of fruits from harvesting to marketing has often led to excessive bruises such that few of them make it to the fresh market. This has, therefore, called for a new engineer- ing approach to determine the parameters which influence the firmness of fruits in order to reflect the optimum maturity for mechanical harvesting and post harvest handling. This paper reviews both the destructive and nondestructive techniques for determination of mechanical properties that influence the firm- ness of fruits. Mathematical equations relating fruit parameters like the modulus of elasticity, poisson's ratio, bruise volumes, impact forces, energy absorbed by the fruit, fruit deformation and contact stresses are presented. Also, recent techniques used in mechanical handling of fruits to minimize bruises are addressed. 911827. Satellite based positioning system for farm equip- ment. Jack Ambuel, Iowa State Univ.; Thomas S. Colvin, U.S. Dept. of Agriculture, Agricultural Research Service; and Kandiah Jeyapalan, Iowa State Univ. A satellite-based positioning system is being developed to determine the location of farm equipment while working in the field. A satellite receiver mounted in a moving tractor or combine calculates position coordinates based on signals received from a selection of satellites in the Department of Defense Global Posi- tioning System (GPS). The position coordinates are retrieved from the receiver by a computer and combined in a common data base with additional information collected by the computer such as yield, soil fertility, soil moisture, temperature, implement draft, and fuel consumption. There are a system of possible appli- cations for this system. One is the automation of position infor- mation and data collection for research purposes. Comparison of results between years can be easily made. Another application is the optimized and automated application of manure, fertilizers and chemicals. Profits can be increased and environmental dam- age minimized. 1991 SAE Transactions Section 2 215</page><page sequence="215">911828-911837 911828. Gear shifters and accelerator pedals, the forgotten peripherals in the powertrain communication 'mk.MarkJ. Hirka, William J. Daniels , and Brett A. Reed, Morse Controls. Standards are emerging for powertrain communications between an intelligent engine and an intelligent transmission. However, the most important mechanisms for operator input to these engines and transmissions, namely the gear shifter and the accelerator pedal, have been treated as mere sensors. New intelli- gent shifters and pedals have been developed which possess the capability to interface directly to this intelligent powertrain com- munication link. Design concepts and practices have been uti- lized that provide application flexibility and address the concerns of EMI susceptibility of electronics in the mobile environment. 911831. User-friendly electronic powershift transmission con- trols. Garth H. Bulgrien, Ford New Holland. The 18 speed full powershift transmission in Ford 8030 series agricultural tractors has a fully electronic, drive-by-wire control system. New control strategies were devised to provide advanced features while using simple operator controls. The operator communicates with the control module using a single shift lever, an inching pedal, a digital gear indicator, and the tractor key switch. Normal powershift capability, advanced shuttle shift capability, diagnostics, test modes for service, clutch pressure calibration, and programmability are all provided with- out requiring additional eqiupment. This paper describes the control strategies used to attain some of these capabilities. 911832. (SP-882) Coordinated boom control system for rough terrain forklifts. Keith R. Williams , Sauer-Sundstrand Co. Digital electronics, sensors, and electro-hydraulic control valves have been combined to produce a system which automati- cally coordinates the variable reach boom on rough terrain fork- lifts to produce true horizontal or vertical motion of the forks. The system results in fast and safe load placement and removal of forks from loads in high places with ease. Motion can be com- manded by the operator to be horizontal or vertical. Boom length sensors and boom angle sensors provide information to the micro-controller in order to control the motion of the boom which results in the desired horizontal or vertical motion regard- less of slope of the terrain on which the vehicle is placed. Input of engine speed also ensures that the maximum flow commanded from the valves does not exceed flow available from the hydraulic pump resulting in smooth and fast coordinated boom motion at any engine speed. This paper describes the control system includ- ing the sensors, command joystick, and controller. The imple- mentation of the control logic and trigonometry calculations will also be discussed. 911833. (SP-882) Development of T-325 prentice loader. Gene Huncky Blount, Inc.; and Kurt Lonnemo, Vickers Inc. This paper describes a new model loader, its systems and how their melding produced a much more efficient and productive machine. It discusses in some detail the selected hydraulic sys- tem, a closed center load sensing system with both the traditional flow control characteristics and the newer pressure control char- acteristics, which were utilized to achieve superior swing perfor- mance. A new world class loader to bridge the gap between the compa- ny's current 88.9 kN (20,000 lb.) lift loader and its 133.3 kN (30, 000 lb.) loader was needed. During customer visits and surveys as to their wants and needs in a new machine, the following items kept surfacing: longer booms (log sorting and slashing or scrap handling); faster boom action (balanced with swing speed); greater swing torque (drag loading and delimbing); improved fuel economy and overall performance; operator comfort and safety; better visibility for the operator; and ease of service and no hydraulic leaks. These customer inputs were not particularly startling or unrea- sonable and did help in keeping the program focused on major area's of interest. The new design was accomplished for a truck trailer mounted loader. 911834. (SP-882) Hydraulic brake control system for off- highway vehicles. James F. Kunz , Komatsu-Dresser Co. In February of 1987, Dresser introduced a pair of new mechanical drive, off-highway trucks designed to operate in the 35 to 60 ton, rear-dump, classes. These trucks, designated 140M and 210M, replaced three previous models while covering the same payload range. One distinctive feature of these new vehicles was their hydraulic system and in particular the brake control portion of this system. This new hydraulic brake control system can be described as a closed-center arrangement using a pressure-compensated, vari- able displacement pump as an energy source with accumulator- based energy reserves for independent and redundant circuits. In the basic version, a pair of pressure regulating valves are used to control system pressure at the brakes. These valves can be actu- ated in tandem by a treadle (foot pedal) or separately by hydraulic pilot pressure. A single, filtered hydraulic fluid is used throughout the system and is stored in a single reservoir vented to atmo- sphere. The basic system is capable of accommodating multiple-axle (i.e. more than two) arrangements but was originally applied to a two-axle vehicle using dry, disc-type (caliper and rotor) brakes on all wheels. In February of 1990, the model 140M and 210M trucks were revised to offer rear axle oil-cooled brakes as an option. The brake control system was subsequently modified to provide for this change primarily by the use of an additional pres- sure regulating valve and redundant circuitry. Both the original and latest versions of this system are charac- terized by their use of a unique emergency brake control system. Through the use of logic-type control valves, a loss of hydraulic pressure in one circuit is used to force the remaining high pres- sure circuits into actuating the brakes. This paper will describe the arrangement and operation of this hydraulic brake control system and its function as an integral part of the overall vehicle hydraulic system. 1991 SAE Transactions Section 2 911836. (SP-884) Flexible member serpentine drive analysis: a computer-aided design methodology. D wight D. Furleigh and P. W. Claar, Dept. of Mech. Engrg., University of Wisconsin. The serpentine drive analysis program (SDAP) is developed for designing flexible member (i.e. roller chain, synchronous belt, and V-belt) serpentine drives. The program, based on industry standard design procedures, provides the user with a design tool for investigating alternative configurations. SDAP calculates driver sizes, geometrical relationships, and force transmission characteristics. Basic design methodology is discussed, and two examples illustrate the usage and flexibility of the program. 1991 SAE Transactions Section 5 911837. (SP-884) Modeling linkages with alternative C&amp;E simulation methodologies. W. S. Chmielewski and P. W. Claar , Dept. of Mech. Engrg.y University of Wisconsin. Alternative approaches for modeling linkages with several CAE simulation methodologies are discussed. The linkage design methodology is discussed in terms of the unique design features and capabilities that each CAE software package offers. The CAE software packages include: 1) ANSYS -a finite element analysis (FEA) program, 2) integrated mechanisms program (IMP) -a multibody system analysis (MSA) program with its companion program, geometric modeling of solids (GM OS) -a solid object geometric modeling program, 3) QUATTRO -a spreadsheet anal- ysis program, and 4) special user-written analysis/animation pro- grams. The linkage design methodology is discussed in terms of the unique design analysis features and capabilities that each 216</page><page sequence="216">911837-911843 CAE software simulation methodologies offers. Several illustra- tive modeling/analysis techniques include: 1) ANSYS modeling techniques for the kinematic revolute and prismatic joints, 2) GMOS modeling capabilities for determining the geometric/ inertial properties of each kinematic link, 3) IMP design analysis features for computing the motion and force transmission charac- teristics and animating the relative motion, 4) QUATTRO analy- sis features for parameter sensitivity analysis and "what-if" studies, and 5) special user-written programs for animating the linkage motion. A dump trailer lift mechanism is used to illus- trate the modeling procedures with these four CAE simulation methodologies. 911838. (SP-884) A computer simulation of backhoe type exca- vators. A lan J. Novak and Carl Larson , Dept. of Mech. and Indus- trial Engrg., University of Illinois at Urbana-Champa. This paper describes the simulation model of a backhoe exca- vator. The model uses a prescribed motion cycle and the objec- tive of the program is to determine the power requirements for each of the cylinders as well as the total engine power require- ment. Most computer simulations are developed by expressing the differential equations of motion for the system being studied. The known force inputs to the system are applied and the time response of the system is then obtained by numerically integrat- ing the governing differential equations. This paper on the other hand develops the reverse of this. Uti- lizing a prescribed geometry and trajectory cycle for a linkage sys- tem as the input, the program solves for the types of force inputs that are required to achieve that trajectory. With the time depen- dence of the trajectory known, the total power required and the power required of each cylinder is also evaluated. A typical excavator linkage is shown. It consists of four link members; the bucket, the stick, the boom, and the house. In order to simplify the computer model, a rotating coordinate system is used. This coordinate system is attached to the swing bearing of the house, and the links are considered to move in the X-Y coor- dinate frame and the entire assembly rotates in the ir-direction. 911839.

An interactive simulation program for swing-to-bunch feller- bunchers is described. The simulation allows the interactions between the feller-buncher, its operator, and the forest stand to be examined, the operator interface was designed to emulate the actual operation conditions of a feller-buncher. Animated graph- ics provide feedback to The simulation/feller-buncher operator. The program was developed and currently is run on a graphics oriented RISC processor based computer workstation. 911840. Effects of a catalyzed diesel particle filter on the chemical and biological character of emissions from a diesel engine used in underground mines. K. L. Bickel, U.S. Dept. of the Interior, Bureau of Mines ; Susan T. Bagley, Dept. of Biological Sciences, Michigan Technology Univ.; K. J. Baumgard and L. D. Gratz, Dept. of Mech. Engrg. and Engrg. Mechanics, Michigan Technological Univ.; and W. F. Watts, Jr., U.S. Dept. of the Inte- rior, Bureau of Mines. This report presents results from a collaborative study con- ducted by Michigan Technological University (MTU) and the U.S. Department of the Interior, Bureau of Mines (Bureau). The objective was to assess the effects a catalyzed diesel particle filter (CDPF) and low sulfur fuel have on emissions. Emphasis was placed on determining the chemical and biological character of diesel particulate matter (DPM) from a diesel engine used in underground mining. A Caterpillar 3304, pre-chamber, naturally aspirated, 84 hp engine was tested with and without a precious metal CDPF of the "quad" design. Samples were collected during transient and steady-state engine operation for carbon monoxide (CO), oxidies of nitrogen (NOx), flame ionization detectable hydrocarbons (HC), DPM, and XAD-2 resin organic component (XOC). DPM and XOC mutagenicity using the Ames assay and for selected polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) using high pressure liquid chromatography (HPLC). The CDPF and low sulfur fuel significantly reduced the emis- sions of DPM, including the soluble organic fraction (SOF), by 90 and 99 percent. Gaseous HC, CO, and XOC were also reduced by 59, 79, and 82 percent, respectively. A significant reduction of 98 percent was observed in the DPM-associated mutagenic con- centration. The CDPF significantly reduced DPM-associated polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), with 98 percent or greater reductions in all concentrations. Only two PAHs, fluoran- thene and pyrene, were detected in any of the vapor phase sam- ples without the CDPF and with the CDPF in place concentra- tions were reduced by 90 percent. These results suggest that the use of a CDPF on underground mine vehicles should prove effective in lowering DPM concen- trations without significant adverse affects on other exhaust pol- lutants. 1991 SAE Transactions Section 3 911841. Ignition delay of a diesel spray injected into a residual gas mixture. Soon-Ik Kwon, Hyundai Motor Co.; Hiroyuki Hiroyasu, University of Hiroshima; and Masataka Arai, Gunma Univ. The purpose of this study was to investigate the effect of resid- ual gas fraction and compositions on the ignition delay of a diesel spray. The air-residual gas mixture was produced by injecting die- sel sprays into a constant volume combustion bomb with no sca- venging burned gas in it. The air initially contained in the bomb was enough to completely burn the fuel supplied by more than 20 injections. The spray injected in the bomb was ignited by the self-ignition process affected by the residual gas. Repetitions of the fuel injection raised the fraction of residual gas in the bomb. The ignition delay in each injection was measured by a photo- transistor. The ignition delay was a minimum when the ambient mixture contained about 4% residual gas. The effect of residual gas compositions was investigated by adding small amount of CO, CO2 and THC into the bomb. The CO and CO2 composi- tions in the burned gas produced an elongation of the ignition delay, while the THC shortened the delay period. 1991 SAE Transactions Section 3 911842. In-cylinder fluid motion and emissions of conventional and re-entrant diesel combustion systems. F. E. Cordone, B. M. Vaglieco, and G. Valentino, Istituto Motori, CNR. The optimization of combustion system of a singe-cylinder D.I. diesel engine, representative of heavy-duty family, is dis- cussed. The characterization of in-cylinder fluid motion of a conven- tional straight-sided and a re-entrant combustion chamber, car- ried out by LDA technique, is presented. Engine tests, using the same chambers and sacless nozzles with different holes diameter and appropriate spray angle, have been performed. Strong reduction of smoke and HC emissions has been obtained, remaining unchanged the engine performance. 911843.

A methodological analysis of combustion parameters and pol- lutant emissions measuring procedures during transient opera- tion of a D.I. T.C. light duty diesel engine was performed. Com- bustion process was characterized by ignition delay time, com- 217</page><page sequence="217">911843-911849 bustion pressure peak value and heat release law measurements during the transient ECE 15 schedule on a dynamic test bed with electronic simulation of inertia. The particulate emission was measured every 0.05 s by an I.R. optical method. In addition some correlations, based on pressure cycle and injection law evo- lutioniere implemented in order to calculate instantaneous fuel delivery and transient NOx emission. Some activities were carried out in order to assess the limits of engine configurations ranking performed with steady state measurements of performances and emissions. Strong differences were detected between carbon emission during transient opera- tions and the value obtained by interpolation from a steady state map. Viceversa steady state estimation of hydrocarbons emission on transient schedule fits very well the real transient behaviour. Finally the engine ranking procedure based on measurements in a properly defined steady state point was analyzed and results compared with those obtained running the engine on a transient schedule. 1991 SAE Transactions Section 3 911844. A simple squish model for pentroof combustion cham- ber. Ali Veshagh and Changyou Chen , University of Warwick. This paper describes a simple computer model developed for analysing the squish motion in the pentroof combustion cham- ber. The model is used to predict the effects of various design parameters such as the compression ratio, pentroof angles and compression plane margin on squish velocity. The results of the parametric study are presented together with the mathematical description of the model. A number of guidelines are also given for the design of pentroof chamber. 911845. High temperature diesel combustion in a rapid com- pression-expansion machine. Suk Hong No and Shigeharu Kobiri, Tokyo Institute of Technology; Yoshiteru Enomoto, Musashi Institute of Technology; and Takeyuki Kamimoto, Dept. of Mech. Engrg., Tokyo Institute of Technology. According to previous papers on the combustion process in LHR diesel engines the combustion seems to deteriorate in LHR diesel engines. However, it has been unclear whether this was caused by the high temperature gas or high temperature combus- tion chamber walls. This study was intended to investigate the effect of gas temperature on the rate of heat release through the heat release analysis and other measurements using a rapid com- pression-expansion machine. Experiments conducted at high gas temperatures which was achieved by the employment of oxygen- argon-helium mixture made it clear that the combustion at a high gas temperature condition deteriorated actually and this was probably due to the poorer mixing rate because of the increase in gas viscosity at a high gas temperature condition. 1991 SAE Transactions Section 3 911846. (SP-883) The feasibility of a kerosene fueled spark ignited two-stroke engine. Patrick J. Suky , Jr., General Motors Corp.; Lawrence W. Evers and Julie E. Wank , Michigan Techno- logical Univ.; and Edward J. Morgan , Mercury Marine Div., Brunswick Corp. The feasibility of using kerosene fuel in a spark ignited two- stroke engine was investigated. Primary effort was directed at comparing kerosene fueled performance to gasoline fueled per- formance and to overcomming cold starting problems with kero- sene. The single cylinder research engine had fuel injection upstream of the reed valve and used loop scavenging. A vortex pneumatic atomizer was used to reduced the droplet size. The results of this study indicate that the vortex pneumatic atomizer helps reduce poor performance of the engine when using kerosene fuel. A method to overcome the cold starting problem with kerosene fuel has been developed, which involves heating the atomization air during start up. 911847. (SP-883) A closed cycle simulation model with partic- ular reference to two-stroke cycle engines. Michael G. Reid, Dept. of Mech. and Manufacturing Engrg., Queen's University of Bel- fast; and Roy Douglas, Dept. of Mech. Engrg., Queen's Univ. of Belfast. A quasi-dimensional computer simulation model is presented to simulate the thermodynamic and chemical processes occurring within a spark ignition engine during compression, combustion and expansion based upon the laws of thermodynamics and the theory of equilibrium. A two-zone combustion model, with a spherically expanding flame front originating from the spark location, is applied. The flame speed is calculated by the applica- tion of a turbulent entrainment propagation model. A simplified theory for the prediction of in-cylinder charge motion is proposed which calculates the mean turbulence intensity and scale at any time during the closed cycle. It is then used to describe both heat transfer and turbulent flame propagation. The model has been designed specifically for the two-stroke cycle engine and facili- tates seven of the most common combustion chamber geome- tries. The fundamental theory is nevertheless appliable to any four-stroke cycle engine. The model has been evaluated by the comparison of measured and predicted pressure traces and heat release rates. The results show good agreement across the whole data set. 911848. (SP-883) Effective energy utilization and emission reduction of the exhaust gas in a two-stroke cycle engine. Kazuo Sato, Shibaura Institute of Technology; Haruo Ukawa, Honda R&amp;D Co., Ltd.; and Masamitsu Nakano, Dept. of Mech. Engrg., Shibaura Institute of Technology. This paper deals with a successful attempt to employ the exhaust gases of a two-stroke cycle gasoline engine as an energy source to operate an after burner and a Stirling engine, and to clean the exhaust gases by a catalyzer. By means of a rotary valve and the exhaust pipe sections, the exhaust gases could separate into a high concentration of fresh gas and a high concentration of combustion gas. The former gas was burned by a burner, and then used to heat a Stirling engine. The latter gas was disposed of by an oxidation catalyzer. The investigation revealed the enthalpy and exergy flows of a two-stroke cycle gasoline engine, and then the emission gases (HC, CO, NO) were disposed of by the burner and catalyzer. The investigative analysis shows a method of successfully transferring the energy available in the exhaust gases for the combustion of a burner and the operation of a Stirling engine, a burner and a catalyzer. 1991 SAE Transactions Section 3 911849. (SP-883) LAPAC compressed air assisted fuel injec- tion for high efficiency low emissions marine outboard two-stroke engines. Gaetan Monnier and Pierre Duret, Institut Français du Pétrole (IEP). The implementation of the IFP-developed compressed air assisted fuel injection process (named IAPAC) on a two-stroke engine allows the introduction of the fuel separately from the sca- venging air in order to minimize fuel short-circuiting. The IAPAC process does not require an external air pump since the compressed air used to atomize the fuel is supplied, at no expense, by the crankcase. The premixed charge delivered directly into the cylinder with a high spray quality and its stratifi- cation, for optimized combustion, is controlled by a valve. This process, therefore, provides the advantages of the direct injection but uses conventional low-pressure automotive type injection technology with commercially available gasoline injectors. In earlier work, we showed how the qualities of light weight, compactness, high specific power, high efficiency and low emis- sions make this concept particularly well-adapted for future auto- motive applications. 218</page><page sequence="218">911849-911854 Marine engine exhaust emissions from most conventional 2-stroke engines are excessive, and future legislation will no dobut take this fact into account. In this paper, we show how IAPAC technology provides an interesting solution to signifi- cantly reduce the pollutant emissions and improve the fuel econ- omy of 2-stroke outboard engines. A 3-cylinder 1,2 L marine outboard IAPAC 2-stroke engine has been developed and extensively tested. The results obtained point out that, with maintained quality of compactness and power output, this new engine gives fuel consumption reductions of more than 25% and unburned hydrocarbon emission reduc- tions of 70 to 90%. Pollutant emissions are evaluated according to the ICOMIA procedure and the results clearly show how the IAPAC system is well adapted to take optimum advantage of the two-stroke cycle principle in marine outboard engines applications. 1991 SAE Transactions Section 3 911850. (SP-883) An alternative method for the prediction of unsteady gas flow through the internal combustion engine. Gordon P. Blair , Dept. of Mech. and Manufacturing Engrg., Queen 's Univ. of Belfast. Many computational methods have been suggested for the solution of this theoretical situation, such as Riemann variables, Lax-Wendroff and other finite difference procedures. The basic approach adopted here is to re-examine the fundamental theory of pressure wave motion and adapt it to a mesh method interpo- lation procedure. At the same time the boundary conditions for inflow and outflow, such as the filling and emptying of engine cyl- inders, has been resolved for the generality of gas properties and in terms of the unsteady gas flow which controls those processes. The same generality of gas property and composition is traced throughout the pipe system. This change of gas property is very signficant in two-stroke engines where the exhaust blowdown is followed by short-circuited scavenge air. Vitally important in this context is the solution for the continual transmission and reflec- tion pressure waves as they encounter both differing temperature gradients and gas properties, and both gradual and sudden changes of area throughout the engine ducting. Of equal impor- tance is the ability of the calculation to predict the effect of inter- nal heat generation within the duct or of external heat loss from it, and to be able to trace the effect of the ensuing gas temperature change on both the pressure wave system and the nett gas flow. The new theoretical approach is programmed for a computer and the physical dimensions of a Husqvarna 250 motocross engine are used as input data. The correlation of the theory with the measured pressure and performance characteristics is demon- strably good. Extended insight into the behaviour of the actual engine is described. One of the unusual aspects of this new approach to this neces- sarily very complex theoretical situation is that both the theory, and the computational method for its solution, is realtively easy to comprehend and to apply in practice. 1991 SAE Transactions Section 3 911851.

Regarding the exhaust smoke regulation for a vehicle engine under transitional operation, the so-called free or controlled accelerating operation, are adopted as the sim- ple measuring method. An the engine applied for the construction or agriculture is always operating under the load conditions of stepwise or periodical changes. For two-stroke engines, in particular, the effects of operating conditions on the engine performance and the smoke character are unclear. In order to meet such demand, it is necessary to make clear the transitional character of each transfer element, i.e., the fuel injection system, the combustion process and the frictional loss. Therefore, in this paper, the authors examined the effects of operating conditions on the responses of the indicated and the frictional torques and of the indicated and the frictional torques and of the engine speed to the step changes of the fuel pump's rack. 911852. A diesel exhaust filter system for industrial diesel forklifts. M. E. Wright, E. J. Stesniak , and A. D. Klein, Jr., Don- aldson Co., Inc. Diesel powered vehicles are characterized by two distinctives, of particulate, sensed by sight, and odor, sensed by smell. Dra- matically reducing these distinctives would result in a "clean die- sel". A joint program of Yellow Freight System, Inc. (YFS) and the author's employer (DCI) has addressed on distinctive (partic- ulate) and has resulted in an exhaust filtering system for the diesel forklift trucks YFS use to move freight at their terminals. This paper covers design, installation, and testing of the system to fil- ter the particulate emissions emanating from these forklifts. The filters, designed to operate for one programmed maintenance (PM) cycle, are then cleaned in off-board equipment and returned to service for another cycle. All filter materials utilized are com- patible with the 200°C normal maximum operating temperature, although short excursions to 260°C have not been detrimental. Verification results of our year-long, dock-wide field test opera- tion of diesel forklifts outfitted with the diesel exhaust filter (DEF) are included. 911853. Development of shoe slip control system for ripping application on bulldozers. Toshihiko Fukasawa, Teruo Naka- hara, Hiroshi Itogawa, and Shigeru Yamamoto, Komatsu Ltd. Operations involving excavation of bedrock in large-scale civil engineering projects, or quarrying works for limestone or crushed rock can be broadly divided into two methods: blasting, and excavation using mechanical power. Ripping operation using bulldozers is typical example of the second method, and this method is superior because it is safe and does not cause pollu- tions. For this reason, its applicable range is being expanded including areas where the blasting method was being used. However, ripping operation using bulldozers demands a high level of training from the operator, and in addition to this, shoe slippage causes premature wear of the undercarriage and low fuel economy. The shoe slip control system that we have developed carries out sensing of the acceleration of the machine in forward and reverse directions, and sensing of the input/output speed of the torque converter, and in this way it always knows the traction and the slip ratio of the machine. The system then acts to control the power to a suitable lever so that it always matches the ground conditions. The realization of this shoe slip control system has brought a dramatic improvement in the life of the undercarriage and ease of operation in the ripping work. 911854. The development of the rubber track for small size bulldozers. K. Bando , K. Yoshida, and K. Hori, Komatsu Ltd. Recently, rubber tracked construction machines, particularly mini-hydraulic excavators, are successfully used for urban con- struction in Japan, because they have the following features: 1) they cause little damage to road surfaces; 2) reduced vibration for operators and operating environment; and 3) low noise. This paper outlines the development of the rubber track for small size bulldozers (4000 kg, 7000 kg). 219</page><page sequence="219">911854-911865 The track composition is explained, computer simulations of the development and the performance of the tracks for bulldozers are explained. 1991 SAE Transactions Section 2 911855. Electronics for compact equipment. Scott Jacobson , Melroe Co. Electronic instrument and control systems are common place and accepted technology in automobiles, trucks, construction and agricultural equipment. Until recently, microprocessor driven instrumentation was not available in the compact equip- ment industry. Primarily, the fact that compact equipment is lower cost in comparison to the vehicles that have used electron- ics in the past, prevented electronics from migrating freely into the compact equipment lines. With the introduction of the BOSS system, a microprocessor driven electronics system of high reli- ability, performance, functionality, and value to the customer, has been provided in the compact equipment industry. This paper will outline the features of the BOSS system in its applica- tion to compact equipment and how electronics apply to compact equipment in general. 911857. Review of heavy duty dual voltage systems. Carl R. Smith, Sure Power Industries. New heavy duty vehicle power requirements have generated the need for more efficient, reliable, electrically quiet vehicle power sources. A single voltage system is no longer practical. Present accessories are primarily 12VDC. The requirement for larger motors, air conditions, heaters, heated windshields and other power devices is resulting in 24V, 36V, 48V or higher volt- age requirements. Existing dual voltage charging system technology is being refined and new systems are being developed to effectively meet the increased power demands. Past and present dual voltage sys- tems along with new technology and concepts will be explored to provide a solution for upcoming power requirements. Several hybrid systems may be cultivated to meet specific needs for spe- cific applications. 911860. Factors influencing performance of a plough. H. Dom- zal and J. Hodara, Institute of Soil Science, University of Agricul- ture; W. K. Bilanski, University of Guelph ; and R. L. Kushwaha, Agricultural Engrg. Dept., University of Saskatchewan. Investigations were carried out on five different soils at differ- ent moisture conditions. Soil resistance was measured with a hydraulic dynamograph on a single bottom plough operated with a tractor at 20-22 cm depth with a width of 60 cm. On light soils (sandy and loess soils) the soil resistance to ploughing was relatively small. The amplitude of instantaneous soil resistance measured from the mean value was also small. In the heavy loam soils, these variations were high. The highest instantaneous as well as the total soil resistance were found on the soil made of limy rock soil with a low organic matter. The magni- tude of instantaneous soil resistance increased considerably with soil drying. The tillage tools must, therefore, overcome this short duration of high soil resistance. Such factors should be taken into consideration while designing new tillage tools. 911861. Self-tuning controller for farm tractor guidance. Kwang-Mo Noh, Dept. of Agricultural Engrg., Keonkuk Univ.; and Donald C. Erbach, National Soil Tilth Lab., USDA Agricul- tural Research Service. Automatic guidance of farm tractors would improve produc- tivity of many field operations by reducing operator fatigue and by improving machine performance. A self-tuning steering con- troller, which can be used for noncontact positioning systems, was designed for tractor guidance. A simple two degrees-of- freedom model was chosen with which to develop a prediction model used in recursive least-squares parameter estimation. A variable forgetting factor was implemented and its algorithm modified to cope with time-varying nonlinear systems. The self- tuning steering controller based upon minimum variance control was tested and verified with a tractor dynamic simulator. Circu- lar, lane change, and sinusoidal paths were used. A model tractor was also used to verify controller performance for straight-line and sinusoidal paths. 911862. Traction of low pressure pneumatic tires in deform- able terrain. Dvoralai Wulfsohn, Agricultural Engrg. Dept., Uni- versity of Saskatchewan; and Sbrini K. Upadhyaya, Agricultural Engrg. Dept., University of California. The UC Davis single-wheel traction testing machine has been used extensively to conduct field tests in an investigation of soil- tire interaction. These results have been used in the development of models for tire traction in deformable soils. A technique for measuring the three-dimensional dynamic contact area between a tire and the soil has been developed. Knowledge of the soil-tire contact profile, along with a model of soil behavior, permit accu- rate prediction of tire traction. Profile measurements are pres- ented for two different sized tires in firm and tilled soil conditions at different inflation pressures and axle loads. Tractive forces were predicted by integrating normal and shear stresses over the contact profile based upon a simple model of soil behavior. 1991 SAE Transactions Section 2 911863. Agricultural cab operator comfort. Piotr Zalewski and Tadeusz Juliszewski, Agricultural University of Krakow; and Walter K. Bilanski, University of Guelph. Modern agricultural machines are very complex, requiring extensive monitoring of multiple operations at the same time as they travel over very rough terrain. Hence, the cabs must be designed to provide not only good visibility of all monitors and easy access to all controls, but operator comfort and safety as well. This includes climate control (temperature, humidity, dust, noise, etc.), vibration damping, easy access on to and off of the tractor, good visibility from the cab and no controls jutting out where they could constitute a hazard. Good cab design promotes efficiency, comfort and safety. 911865. (SP-882) Use of computer simulation in the design and selection of critical components in fluid power systems. C. R. Bur- rows, S. P. Tomlinson, and P. A. Hogan, University of Bath. The design of fluid power components and systems based solely upon the use of steady-state analysis may lead to failure and possible safety hazards even in applications where the dynamic requirements are apparently insignificant. For example, the wall thickness of a telescopic actuator, selected on the basis of estimated steady-state pressure values, may prove inadequate under transient conditions where a load is suddenly brought to rest by the action of a hose-break valve. The use of factors of safety, more aptly referred to as factors of ignorance, frequently provides a way forward, but the degree of uncertainty can be reduced if computer simulation is used to predict the actual val- ues of pressure transients. Many designers lack the mathematical and computing skills necessary to model and hence predict the performance of fluid power systems. The resulting set of nonlinear and mathemati- cally stiff equations imposes some difficult problems in numeri- cal integration as required in digital simulation. These problems are compounded by the discontinuous nature of many compo- nent models. For example, a relief valve may crack open, or a pis- ton may reach an end stop. In tackling these academically inter- esting problems we and many colleagues in the fluid power centre in Bath set out to produce a computer simulation package for use by hydraulic engineers with little or no knowledge of computers or numerical analysis. Some of the features of the package, are outlined here and are demonstrated with reference to a particular application. 1991 SAE Transactions Section 2 220</page><page sequence="220">911866-911876 911866. (SP-882) Integration of linkage equations in fluid power analysis. Max P. Gassman, Dept. of Mech. Engrg., Iowa State Univ. Mechanical linkages are often used with fluid power systems to produce desired operations or work. Linkages may be used in hydromechanical servomechanisms or as actuator powered machine members. Many examples can be found of linkages associated with fluid power systems, on construction and agricul- tural machinery. The reaction of linkage members to fluid actuator motion is of considerable interest to machine designers. This paper describes a method of using loop closure equations, from kine- matics, to model and analizē linkages configured with fluid power machinery. 1991 SAE Transactions Section 2 911867. (SP-882) Object-oriented knowledgebase application to hydraulic design. John K. Schueller, University of Florida; Xiaoqing Zhang, DAI Technologies, Inc.; and Herman Lam, Uni- versity of Florida. Issues concerning the use of object-oriented knowledgebases in hydraulic circuit design are discussed. Hydraulic system knowledge representation is described with a semantic associa- tion model. Hydraulic circuit design rules are categorized and modeled as integrity constraint or deductive rules. This work demonstrates that an object-oriented knowledgebase could potentially be a viable tool for providing the hydraulic circuit designer with an evaluation of the designed circuit. The tech- niques need further development to be useful by the practicing designer. 911868. (SP-882) Producing hydraulic radial piston pump by integrated CAD/CAM technique. Yang-ZengXu and Gen-Xi Li, GanSu University of Technology. It is still a new technique to produce series of hydraulic radial piston pump using integrated CAD/CAM technique. That is, a hydraulic pump could be produced according to the required NC format program in NC machine tools (NC post-processing). The program is automatically generalized after the design stage in a RPCADM package is over. One of the highlights to use the integrated CAD/CAM tech- nique is how to use the similitude theory as basic principles for the series design in the CAD stage. Another is the method of transferring detail drawing into required G-codes based on the G-codes bank which NC machine tools could follow to produce the part. The theory and method are explicated in this paper. And the NC format program (G-codes file) conducted from CAD is shown. A package for CAD/CAM of hydraulic radial piston pump is introduced briefly. 1991 SAE Transactions Section 5 911869. (SP-884) Finite element analysis of spiral hose utiliz- ing laminate theory. W. F. Brieg, Dayco Products, Inc. Thick elastomeric composite wire-reinforced spiral hose are modeled as a series of thin-shell layers of rubber-wire separated by rubber layers. A linear elastic small deformation finite element computer code with laminate capability is used for solution. Mea- sured wire helix angle, braid diameter, and hose axial displace- ment are used to fit and equivalent rubber modulus to assure thin-shell plane stress and to partially account for braid angle rotation and diameter change during pressurization. Finite ele- ment results for radial displacement and rotation angle agree with experimental data and theoretical calculations. Computed ten- sion variation between wires is compared with current theory. Strong load sharing is predicted by the finite element method. Inner and outer wire layers carry less tension than wire layers immediately adjacent to the hose midplane. Induced torque is computed. Torsional and flexural rigidities generated from finite element thin-shell laminate theory are com- pared with both theoretical and experimental data. Results are reasonable. Wire reinforcement behavior is analyzed for the region near clamped end couplings. Results agree favorably with theoretical predictions based on deformation of a single helical wire in an outer layer. 1991 SAE Transactions Section 5 911872. (SP-884) An investigation of a road-vehicle directional behavior under steady-state conditions. S. A. Łukowski, R. A. Fiedler, and P. W. Claar, Dept. of Mech. Engrg., University of Wisconsin. An investigation of a steady-state motor vehicle steering char- acteristics is presented. The parameters that influence the steer- ing response (e.g., front/rear load distribution, front and rear tire cornering stiffnesses, and tire slip angles) are included in the ana- lytical development of the tire-vehicle system. A set of handling diagrams are obtained which show the influence of the tire- vehicle system's design factors and motion variables on the vehi- cle steering behavior. These diagrams are obtained for both the linear and nonlinear ranges of tire operation. 1991 SAE Transactions Section 6 911873. (SP-884) Tire structural parameter analysis for road noise using an accurate FEMÍ model. Ryogo Takagi, Nissan Motor Co., Ltd.; and Saguchi Takanari, Bridgestone Corp. Along with recent developments of road noise simulation techniques for vehicle body and suspension, there has been a need to develop an accurate tire model capable of analyzing vari- ous vibration phenomena up to the road noise frequency range. While some FEM tire models have been proposed, they have been limited to the lower frequency range and do not always take into consideration the effect of the tire patch. Consequently, they do not provide the accuracy needed for road noise simulation.- This paper describes a new FEM model that takes into account the tire pressure, patch deformation and tire rotation and pro- vides an accurate prediction of tire vibration characteristics from low frequencies up to 250 Hz in the road noise frequency range. This tire model is incorporated into a vehicle model to investi- gate the effects of tire structural parameters on the passenger compartment noise level. 1991 SAE Transactions Section S 911875. (SP-884) Dynamic analysis of scooter (two wheeler) for ride evaluation. Atul B. Patii, Bajaj Auto Ltd. Computer simulation of ride dynamics of a two-wheeled scooter is carried out to seek directions of improvement in design of its suspension. The paper deals with the study of a scooter adopting link type suspension both in front and rear. A five degree freedom planar model for a two wheeler is developed. It includes geometric non- linearities due to linkage assembly in front and rear suspension, multi rate springs, shock absorber nonlinearity, suspension bot- toming and wheel lift off. A good correlation was observed between the simulated and experimental results. It is shown here how adjustment in damping coefficients of the shock absorber improves the passenger comfort while passing over a road bump. 911876. (SP-884) Reducing vibration of reciprocating engines with crankshaft pendulum vibration absorbers. V. J. Borowski, Ford Motor Co.; H. H. Denman, Wayne State Univ.; D. L.

Ander- son, Ann Arbor, MI. Four-cylinder in-line automobile engines are inexpensive to build and economical to operate. However, they produce high crankshaft torsional vibration and high engine block vibration. 221</page><page sequence="221">911876-911884 Traditional ways to reduce this vibration may harm driveability and fuel economy, and may increase the cost of construction. Crankshaft-mounted pendulums have the potential to simulta- neously reduce crankshaft torsional vibration and block shake at a reasonable cost without affecting driveability and fuel econ- omy. Described in this paper is a study of the feasibility of applying pendulums to modern four-cylinder engines. The study involved the design, construction and testing of hardware, and an exten- sive analysis effort. Explored by analysis were optimal trajecto- ries for pendulum motion, strategies for tuning sets of pendu- lums, the stability of pendulum motion and the shaking behavior of engines equipped with pendulums. Established by both analysis and test was that crankshaft- mounted pendulums can reduce torsional vibration by over 90%. Vehicle test established that there were subjective improvements in NVH (noise, vibration and harshness) and further that lugging performance - low speed, wide open throttle performance- was dramatically improved. The reduction in block shake observed during test was more modest than the reduction of torsion. Ana- lytical studies of shake performance produced predictions of reductions in the range of 40% to over 70% for realistic pendulum damping and for realistic configurations. Shown by the study is the feasibility of crankshaft-mounted pendulums for reducing torsional vibration in modern four- cylinder automotive engines. Also shown is that crankshaft- mounted pendulums is a promising technology for reducing shake in four-cylinder engines. 1991 SAE Transactions Section 2 911877. Advances in diesel protection systems. William H. Fouch and David M. Gross , Synchro-Start Products , Inc. Over the last several years, the use of D.C. solenoids and elec- tronics to ensure safe and reliable diesel engine shutdown has grown significantly. These devices are used during normal engine operation and in the event of a malfunction. Applications include both on and off-highway vehicles as well as generator sets. The use of key start in off-highway equipment has also had a major impact on the use of D.C. solenoids. Reliability has been improved through the use of computerized coil design, constant volume protection boots, external switching and electronic tim- ers. Testing methods (for vibration, shock and temperature extremes) have been developed to promote trouble free product life. 911878. Application of glow plugs for combustion sensing in a diesel engine. Hakchul Kong ; Southwest Research Institute. On-board diagnostics of a diesel engine are very important in keeping emissions low and in maintaining the engine properly. Combustion sensing is the most important objective in engine diagnostics. SwRI-developed temperature controller for glow plugs (TCGP) can be used to detect the temperature in each com- bustion chamber of a diesel engine if it uses glow plugs. If one or more of the cylinders show lower temperature than the predeter- mined value at a given load/speed, the cylinder(s) is experiencing misfiring, improper fuel metering or other problems. The heating element in a glow plug can be used as a temperature sensor while heating the glow plug by a time-sharing method. The heating power can also be turned off completely so that the TCGP works only as a temperature measuring device. Thus, the TCGP or even a simpler glow plug sensing circuitry alone will work with the on- board diagnostics module in a diesel engine. 911880. New Kubota midsize farm tractor. Eisaku Shinohara , Takeshi Ura, Takeshi Imamura, and I kio Inamori, Kubota Trac- tor Corp. Kubota Corporation introduced a 80 H.P. farm tractor in 1991. This tractor was developed; utilizing Kubota's 14 years of U.S. marketing experience in midsize fram tractor. The following "unique design innovations" were incorporated to maximize "versatility", "operator comfort" and "operating efficiency". 911881. New transmission gear train for bulldozers. Masayuki Sato, M. Nakamura, T. Hisamura, and Takashi Kuse, Komatsu Ltd. A higher versatility is required from medium size bulldozers as vehicles other than large size bulldozers. Therefore, the design concept of the transmission for medium size bulldozers has to be changed to that of large size bulldozers. We adopted combination of high capacity torque convertor and low reduction (high output speed) cross ratio gear train for medium size bulldozers' trans- mission. We also evaluated the advantages and disadvantages of rotat- ing clutches, and decided not to use the rotating clutches in new transmission for medium size bulldozers, because of their disad- vantages. By these design concepts and material technology, we can reduce the transmission size and improve the efficiency. 1991 SAE Transactions Section 2 911882. A new method to calculate energy dissipation and tem- perature distribution in multidisc clutches in powershift transmis- sions. Marc Wouters, Clark Components. This paper describes a simulation program to calculate energy throughput and temperature distribution in a clutch pack in powershift transmissions for any gear change. Unlike other approaches, the program is built as a time related loop in which both mechanical and thermal variables are calcu- lated. This approach permits a flexible implementation of depen- dencies of all variables on each other. Given an applied clutch pressure of any shape, the behaviour of any powershift transmission configuration can be calculated. Special care has been taken to solve the temperature equation, using an implicit notation and a technique called TriDiagonal Matrix Algorithm. 1991 SAE Transactions Section 2 911883. Influence of design and material factors on thermal stresses in multiple disc wet clutches and brakes. P. Zagrodski, Warsaw University of Technology. Temperatures and thermal stresses in multiple disc clutches (brakes) are greatly affected by normal pressure distributions on particular friction surfaces. When the pressure distributions are non-uniform, the distributions of heat flux generated on friction surfaces are also non-uniform. This can result in high local tem- peratures and high thermal stresses. The pressure distributions depend on a number of design and material factors. They can also be subject to changes during the clutch engagement due to the thermal deformations. The paper presents a theoretical model of a multiple disc clutch (brake). Using this model, the initial distributions of normal pressure have been examinated as well as their changes which occur due to the thermal deformations. Then temperatures and stresses in the cross-sections of friction discs have been calculated. It has been found out that the initial pressure distributions are greatly affected by the stiffness of the structural elements closing a pack of discs and the mode in which one of these elements is supported. The modulus of elasticity of friction material, in turn, has a considerable effect on changes in pressure resulting from the thermal deformations. The study indicates that under non-uniform pressure distribu- tions stresses in discs can reach values several times higher than those reached under uniform distributions. 1991 SAE Transactions Section 2 911884.

Dennis Kemper, Gates Rubber Co. 222</page><page sequence="222">911884-911904 Hoses and assemblies used in hydraulic applications are con- stantly being required to do more and more. The hydrostatic drives are becoming more sensitive to dirt and contamination. In addition, new hydraulic fluids are now being introduced that are more environmentally safe. As a result, care must be taken in choosing the materials used and the processes of manufacturing in order to ensure that the assemblies provide long life and will not contribute to system failures. 911886. (SP-881) Manufacturing the Allison world transmis- sion. W. Kenneth Sutton, Jr., Allison Transmission Div., General Motors Corp. The purpose of this paper is to outline the manufacturing strategy for North American production of a third generation of heavy-duty automatic transmissions. This strategy consists of three key elements involving the product, the process for manu- facturing the product and the people systems required to design, implement and continuously improve both the product and the process. Each of these elements must be balanced with the other two to provide a stable platform for the entire manufacturing enterprise. This is analogous to a three-legged milk stool as shown. Although there are linkages with the product design and people systems, the focus of this paper is the production process. 911887. (SP-884) Bump simulation model for motorcycles. Shigeru Sugiyama and Shigeo Naito, Yamaha Motor Co., Ltd. To investigate the chassis strength of a motorcycle, the finite element method (FEM) is generally utilized. However, it is diffi- cult to determine the load conditions for FEM analysis on rough terrain. A mathematical model and computer simulation system have been developed to predict the load conditions which is obtained by accelerations at several chassis locations. The dynamic behavior of a motorcycle is simulated on a bench test device composed of rotating drums fitted with protrusions. The model is constructed using flexibile bodies (e.g., front fork and rear arm) in addition to rigid bodies. The flexible front fork model was made by combining beam theory with the substruc- tural method. Also, the analysis includes a tire model which expresses the force characteristics when protrusion is enveloped. The calculated results of this model correspond with actual measurements very closely. The model is necessary and sufficient from the points of view of simplicity and accuracy. 911900. (SP-878) Development of new Toyota electronic modu- lated suspension two concepts for semi-active suspension control. Hiroyoshi Koj ima, Jiro Nakano, Hiroshi Nakayama, and Naoto Kawashima, Toyota Motor Corp.; and Hiroshi Fujimoto, Nippon- denso Co., Ltd. The shock absorber of suspension has two important basic functions. One is to control vehicle attitude changes when steering and when accelerating and decelerating, and the other is to dampen forces transmitted from the road by its damping effect, thus soft- ening shocks. The characteristics of these two demands in perfor- mance, driving stability and riding comfort, conflict with each other but are selected from the concept of a car and from coaching by users. Namely, someone puts stress on driving stability and the other puts stress on riding comfort. Electronics have advanced in recent years and the use of electronic absorber con- trol systems in order to achieve both driving stability and riding comfort has become widespread first of all in Japanese vehicles and also in European and American vehicles. Toyota first developed its TEMS (Toyota Electronic Modu- lated Suspension) in 1983 and since then many improvements have been added. This time we have put to practical use electronic control sus- pension (TEMS) that uses wheel stroke sensors. By developing this system, not only have we introduced effec- tive control logic but we have also used an intelligent power MOSFET module newly developed for the control unit. 911901. (SP-878) Dynamic simulation of suspension load for passenger car with low profile tires. Toshikazu Murakami, Kunio Yamada, and Katsujiro Tachikawa, Toyota Motor Corp. This paper presents a technique to predict the suspension load in early design stage when a passenger car with low profile tires goes over a bump. The suspension load is simulated by using ADAMS (automatic dynamic analysis of mechanical systems). The tire was modeled as a radial spring with nonlinearity decided by test data. The simulated results of suspension load agreed with the test data. The effect of shock absorber characteristics and spring bumper stiffness of the suspension load was studied by using this simula- tion model. As a result, the optimum specification for suspension load reduction was taken. 911902. (SP-878) Advice control strategy for improved han- dling and stability. Masaki Yamamoto, Toyota Motor Corp. Active control systems pertaining to handling and stability have been systematically analyzed and tested. While the tires maintain adhesion the most effective system is steer angle con- trol. A new 4WS strategy utilizing steering wheel angle feedfor- ward and yaw velocity feedback functions is found to minimize the effect of external disturbances as well as to optimize steering response. When the limits of tire adhesion are approached other control systems must be adopted. Experimental methods of con- trolling the distribution of the driving/braking force and roll stiff- ness, based upon yaw velocity model following strategy, indicate a high potential for improving cornering performance. 1991 SAE Transactions Section 6 911903. (SP-878) Digital active suspension. A. Bruce Dun- woody, Dept. of Mech. Engrg., University of British Columbia. The full potential of active suspension has not yet been real- ized because of the limitations of available actuators. Current active suspension systems use hydraulic rams with the flow of hydraulic fluid to the ram controlled by a servo-valve to exert the desired force. The objective of this paper is to describe an alter- nate arrangement of hydraulic actuator which combines great compliance with short reaction times. The heart of the arrange- ment is a set of hydraulic rams which are connected between the body of the vehicle and one wheel assembly. Each of the rams is connected via a separate three-way, two-position valve to an accumulator, kept at a constant pressure, or a reservoir depend- ing on the position of its valve. The force exerted by the actuator depends on the piston areas of those rams connected to the accu- mulator. The response time of the actuator depends only on the switching time of the solenoid valves, typically 25 milliseconds, independent of the compliance of the actuator. Three configura- tions of actuator are shown which incorporate a number of sepa- rate hydraulic cavities within a single unit. Not only is the com- promise between isolation and response time eliminated, but the digital hydraulic actuator consumes significantly less power than a conventional hydraulic ram controlled by a servo-valve. 1991 SAE Transactions Section 6 911904.

Previous work by the authors on fully active control systems is extended to model semi-active systems which a) can only dissi- pate energy and b) involve some restrictions in their response characteristics. Various control laws are studied by the one which turns out to be of most interest includes the "wheelbase preview" effect, i.e. it takes advantage of the information that the rear input is a 223</page><page sequence="223">911904-911910 delayed version of that at the front wheel. For example, the semi- active system which includes this feedforward information is bet- ter overall than a fully active system which assumes uncorrelated inputs at the wheels. 1991 SAE Transactions Section 6 911905. The new 6-litre 12-cylinder engine for the new Mer- cedes-Benz S-class. Hans Bruggemann, Mercedes Benz AG; and JörgAbthoff, Reiner Bachschmid, and Jürgen Willandy Mercedes- Benz AG. Mercedes-Benz presented the new S-class in spring 1991. A new 6-litre, 12-cylinder engine with 4-valve technology has been developed for the top model, the 600 SE/SEL, which is described in this paper. The engine has a maximum power output of 300 kW and a maximum b.m.e.p. of 12.2 bar (= 580 Nm). Maximum permissible constant engine speed is 6000 rpm. The new engine features a light-alloy crankcase and shares the 4-valve cylinder heads as fitted to the 6-cylinder engine, in this case each with two camshafts. Further components are the LH electronic fuel injec- tion system, two motor-driven throttle valves, anti-knock con- trol, to variable valve timing systems. All electronic engine func- tions are interlinked by a CAN interface. 1 991 SAE Transactions Section 3 911906. The Volvo 5-cylinder engine with 4-valve technology - A new member of Volvo's modular engine family. Tor Lars son, Kjellac Bergstrom, Ahe Bengtsson, John Petersson, and Ingemar Denbratt, Volvo Car Corp. During 1991 Volvo Car Corporation has introduced the new Volvo 850 GLT model featuring front wheel drive with trans- verse installation of the engine and gearbox. The powertrain consists of a new in-line five-cylinder engine in combination with a four speed electronically controlled auto- matic gearbox or a five speed manual gearbox. The engine fea- tures DOHC, 20 valves, V-VIS (Volvo variable induction sys- tem), well tuned exhaust system and microprocessor controlled engine management systems. The engine was designed and developed as a new member of Volvo's modular engine family. The first member was the in-line six-cylinder engine B6340F introduced in 1990. The modular engines have a large number of identical components and the major components are machined in common transfer lines which makes the manufacturing process highly rational and cost- effective. By applying simultaneous engineeirng and advanced CAE technology throughout the development process it has been pos- sible to create a compact and light weight engine which is charac- terized by impressive performance, low fuel consumption, low exhaust emission levels, low noise and vibration levels, high reli- ability and long service life. In this paper we will describe the new in-line five-cylinder engine and its development for the European version of the 1992 Volvo 850 GLT model. 1991 SAE Transactions Section 3 911907. The engine management system of the new Mercedes- Benz S-class. Karl Kollmann, Mercedes Benz AG; and Wolfgang Strauss, Horst Behnke, and Arndt Peters, Mercedes-Benz AG. The engine management system of the new Mercedes-Benz S-class has been completely redesigned and fully meets the demands of the new top models. The ignition management, fuel injection management and air management system components are interlinked by a high-speed serial databus, controlling func- tions are performed in real-time and parallel. Open system archi- tecture and a suitable communication structure indicate how engine management systems will be designed in the future. 911908. Passenger car engines for the 21st century. Hirogazu Nakamura, Hikoichi Motoyama, and Yuhiko Kiyota, Mitsubishi Motors Corp. During the next decade, automotive engineers will take up unprecedented challenges to meet a variety of technical demands on passenger cars. While performance, refinement and reliability will continue to be major technical goals of passenger cars, reduc- ing their impact on the environment not only in urban areas but also on the global basis will become an increasingly urgent issue. In addition, the need for energy and resources saving will necessi- tate development of more fuel efficient cars, exploitation of alter- native energy and recycled materials. In this paper, the authors will review various alternative engines as candidates to satisfy the above demands. The authors will also discuss various alternative transportation energy sources such as alcoholic fuels, natural gas, hydrogen and electricity. Finally the trends of future passenger car engine design will be discussed. Optimization of engine design parameters to meet the demands of fuel economy, emis- sions and refinement will be reviewed, and future technologies such as leanburn will be introduced. Comments on diesel engines will also be presented. 1991 SAE Transactions Section 3 911909. The new 6-cylinder engine 3.2 litre for the new Mer- cedes Benz S-class. Hans Bruggemann, Rolf Zeller, and Manfred Schäfer, Mercedes-Benz AG. At the 1991 Geneva Motor Show Mercedes-Benz presented the S-class 140 series as the successor to the 126 series in produc- tion since January 1980. The further developed 6-cylinder in-line engine with 4-valve technology constitutes the lower end of the power plant range. Displacement has been enlarged from 3 to 3.2 litres. In the course of further optimization of the gas cycle, the familiar light-alloy cylinder head with 4 valves per cylinder has been provided with modified timing diagrams and redesigned intake ports. As a result, it has been possible to achieve an over- propotional increase in maximum torque. The maximum power output of 170 kW remains unchanged. Engine speeds have been significantly reduced: engine speed at maximum torque from n=4600 rpm to n=4100 rpm; engine speed at maximum output from n = 6300 rpm to n=5800 rpm. The CIS-E injection system used for mixture formation in the 300 SL-24 and 300 CE-24 has been replaced by an electronic LH fuel injection system with air mass sensor which in turn has given rise to a new intake system with ram manifold and electric throt- tle valve adjusting motor. The proven single-belt drive of the ancillaries has been further developed for higher power transmis- sion. 911910. The new 8-cylinder engines 5.0 and 4 2 litre for the new Mercedes-Benz S-class. Hans Karl Weining, Hans-Jürgen Strauber, and Rolf Ohlendorf, Mercedes-Benz AG. The V8 engines for the new Mercedes-Benz S-calss first shown to the public at the Geneva Motor Show in March 1991 are, in terms of their basic mechanical design, identical to the 5-litre V8 engine familiar from the 500 SL. In addition, a 4.2-litre engine has been developed on the same mechanical basis, which rounds off the performance range at the lower end. The deck height of the crankcase of both engines is the same and has been reduced compared to the SL engine. This has made it possible to standardize exhaust manifolds, intake pipes, major assembly mountings and a large number of parts for the 4.2-litre and 5-litre versions and thus facilitates their production and assembly. Electronic fuel injection with air mass sensor and cylin- der-specific fuel metering is part of the new engine mangement system. A motor-driven throttle valve is used for the first time for air management, which at the same time controls and stabi- lizes engine speed. Injection, air and ignition management are networked with a high-speed serial databus. These three system components interact to achieve favourable emission and con- sumption levels and optimum performance in every operating range. 224</page><page sequence="224">911911-911919 911911. (SP-880) The significance of automated opportunity charging to the viability of general purpose electric vehicles./. C. B olger, Inducirán Corp . The viability of electric vehicles (EVs) is severely hampered by their limited range. Opportunity charging (OC) can extend the range of electric vehicles by making extra energy available to the EV during its operating cycle. Opportunity charge is a weightless substitute for energy that otherwise would have to be carried on the EV in a heavy battery. It can also extend battery life by limit- ing the depth of discharge, thus reducing the first and operating costs of EVs. Opportunity charging must be convenient to use and free from hazards and excessive maintenance if it is to be widely imple- mented. Inductran Corporation has developed magnetically cou- pled systems that automatically charge EVs when they park at a charging station. These systems have provided high reliability and durability in industrial applications, and a prototype system for performing OC tests with a vehma g-van is now under devel- opment. Several advancements in lead acid battery technology are needed if the full benefits of opportunity charging are to be real- ized. These advancements and a new approach to achieving them are discussed. 911912. (SP-880) Zinc-air batteries for electric vehicles. Glenn W. Merry, MATS I, Inc. This paper describes a design for an electric vehicle (EV) bat- tery system using a secondary (rechargeable) lead-acid section for power and a recyclable (mechanically replaced) primary zinc-air section for range. This approach optimizes the performance of each battery, resulting in a system with driving performance (ac- celeration, range, and refueling time) equal to that for internal combustion vehicles (ICVs). The physical characteristics of the system's components are highly compatible with their ICV coun- terparts, resulting in a substantial reduction in the cost of build- ing prototype vehicles. The overall cost of the rechargeable/ recyclable approach is estimated to be equal to that for the tradi- tional single rechargeable battery approach. 911914. (SP-880) Availability of batteries for near-term (1998) electric vehicles. A. F . Burke, EG&amp;G Idaho, Inc. Battery requirements were determined for a wide spectrum of electric vehicles ranging from 2-passenger sports cars and microvans to full-size vans with a payload of 500 kg. All the vehi- cles utilize ac, high voltage (340-360 V) powertrains and have acceleration performance 0-80 km/h in less than 15 seconds) expected to be the norm in 1998 electric vehicles. Battery packs were configured for each of the vehicles using families of sealed lead-acid and nickel-cadmium modules which are either pres- ently available in limited quantities or are being developed by battery companies which market a similar battery technology. It was found that the battery families available encompass the Ah cell sizes required for the various vehicles and that they could be pacakaged in the space available in each vehicle. The acceleration performance and range of the vehicles were calculated using the SIMPLEV simulation program. The results showed that all the vehicles had the required acceleration characteristics and ranges between 80-160 km (50-100 miles) with the ranges using nickel- cadmium batteries being 40-60% greater than those using lead- acid batteries. Significant changes in the design of electric vehicles over the last fifteen years are noted. These changes make the design of the batteries more difficult by increasing the peak power density required from about 60 W/kg to 100-150 W/kg and by reducing the Ah cell size needed from about 150 Ah to 30-70 Ah. Both of these changes in battery specifications increase the difficulty of achieving low $/kWh cost and long cycle life. This is true for both lead-acid and nickel-cadmium batteries. 1991 SAE Transactions Section 6 911915. (SP-880) Performance data from an improved sodium/ nickel chloride cell./. L. Sudworth andH. Böhm, AEG Anglo Bat- tery Holdings. Sodium nickel chloride batteries have been tested in electric cars over the past three years. Although the performance of the cars was satisfactory, reliability was inadequate and it became apparent that the cells needed to tolerate repeated discharges to 100% depth of discharge. A new cell design with an improved sodium electrode was developed and tests with 26 Volt modules of these cells have shown that it will tolerate hundreds of cycles to 100% depth of discharge. The capacity and resistance stability of the new cell design are described and the feasibility of rapid charging is discussed. 1991 SAE Transactions Section 6 911916. (SP-880) Thermal characteristics of electric vehicle batteries. A. Scott Keller and Gerald D. Whitehead, Electrotek Concepts, Inc. This paper addresses one of the most significant problems associated with ambient-temperature batteries in electric vehicles (EVs): maintaining optimum, uniform temperatures within a bat- tery pack. Issues such as temperature dependence of capacity, effects of temperature extremes, and temperature variation within a pack are discussed. Calculations based on a battery/ vehicle model are then given that demonstrate the effects of tem- perature on driving range. Battery thermal management (TM) is next discussed and test results comparing circulating-air and cir- culating-liquid TM systems with non-managed systems in EVs are presented. These data show the importance of incorporating a TM system into an EV to achieve optimal battery and vehicle performance and battery life. 1991 SAE Transactions Section 6 911917. (SP-880) Electric vehicle and battery testing at the electric vehicle test facility./. Hampton Barnett and Harshad S. Tatar ia, Electrotek Concepts, Inc. The electric vehicle test facility (EVTF), operated by Elec- trotek Concepts, Inc., serves as a major research center to evalu- ate electric vehicles (EVs), batteries, and EV-component systems. The 9600 ft2 (890 m2) facility houses special test equipment and computer-controlled instrumentation which, with the adjoining one-mile (1.6 km) test track, is dedicated to EV testing. These research and testing activities have been primarily sup- ported by the Electric Power Research Institute (EPRI) and the electric utility industry. Electric utility and consumer-related concerns were addressed in this effort. At present, the EVTF activities have been expanded to work with automotive and bat- tery companies involved in introducing EVs in the 1998 time frame. Cooperative partnerships are being considered to assist EV development. Activities have included: 1) detailed perfor- mance testing of prototype and pre-production EVs; 2) cursory testing and technology evaluation of EVs; 3) roadability testing/ consumer acceptance of EVs; 4) in-vehicle comparative life test- ing of different near-term battery types; 4) testing of ancillary sys- tems such as battery pack thermal management systems, central- point watering, gas management, state-of-charge metering, and EV field test data acquisition systems; 6) battery charger testing, including characterization of rapid recharge pulse-current sys- tems and their effect on battery life; 7) power quality testing of EV/utility interface; 8) magnetic field testing inside and outside the vehicle; and 9) testing of advanced battery systems such as sodium-sulfur (Na/S) batteries in EVs. Results of these evalua- tions provide information to fleet operators and users on which to base purchasing decisions. 911919. (SP-880) A commercially-viable electric car. Anil Anathakrishna, Maharishi Technology Corp. The present traffic and pollution situation in our large cities and the inefficient use of the internal combustion engine car in city traffic, has been for a long time the catalyst to develop spe- 225</page><page sequence="225">911919-911924 cifie city cars, which can reduce the burden on the environment and be more economical to operate. Several electric cars have been introduced in the past without success. The power/weight ratio of the present lead-acid batteries has been a limiting factor for the commercial success of an elec- tric vehicle. In addition to this the high initial cost, limited range, and high operating cost have contributed to the low level of inter- est by the general public. This paper describes the development of a commercially via- ble electric car based on a range-extending battery system. This car is also designed to be utilised with quick-change battery mod- ules. 911920. (SP-880) Real-world electric vehicle activities at the Sacramento municipal utility district. S. David Freeman , Sacra- mento Municipal Utility District. As a publicly owned utility and community leader, the Sacra- mento Municipal Utility District (SMUD) has stepped forward to lead the Northern California region in promoting the use of nonpolluting electric vehicles (EVs). The district's goal is to bring EVs into the "real world" of commercial and personal use, such as delivery vans and commuter transportation. In July 1990, SMUD's Board of Directors adopted a pro- active policy to reduce air pollution in the Sacramento region and a cornerstone of that policy is encouraging the use of EVs. SMUD has since established a program to encourage the development and the use of both commercial and personal EVs. SMUD is working to implement this policy through an EV loan program, a district-supported educational group called elec- tric vehicle pioneers, and development of the necessary infra- structure to support EVs. 911921. (SP-878) Magic numbers in design of suspensions for passenger cars. Pinhas Barak , GMI Engineering and Manage- ment Institute. Design specifications for suspensions of passenger cars for ride and handling in the past half century were amazingly associated with some "magic numbers." These parameter values are needed for mathematical models which describe the dynamic motions of a vehicle on the road, help researchers to validate the overall per- formance of their simulations. Moreover, these numbers should be viewed as a guide for evaluation of vehicle design practice for moderate pay load and driving conditions. Number 1, for instance, is the magic number assoicated with bounce resonant frequency of the sprung mass, but also related to the desired value for the dynamic index for ride quality and directional control. Number 10, on the other hand, is the magic number associated with wheel hop resonant frequency and the desired total mass/ unsprung masses ratio. This paper demonstrates through some illustrative examples, computer simulation, laboratory and road test results, that since the introduction of the indepedent front suspension (IFS) in the automobile industry more than 50 years ago, a series of specific numbers govern vehicle design for ride and handling. Moreover, these numbers will continue to control our design philosophy in the next decade regardless of high tech- nology concepts such as active suspension and four-wheel steer. These magic numbers are timeless. They are the product of the so-called "past experience" and/or "the slide-rule generation" in the automobile industry. In this respect, despite innovations in suspension design the reality is that there is no change in these design specifications. 1 991 SAE Transactions Section 6 911922. (SP-878) Development of four wheel steering system using yaw rate feedback control. Shin Koike , Hiroki Sato, Hiroyuki Kawai, M asaru Ishikawa, and Hitoshi Iwata, Toyota Motor Corp. Toyota has succeeded in developing for mass production the active four-wheel steering (4WS) system using yaw rate feedback and steering angle feedforward control. The active 4WS system consists of a group of various sensors, including the newly devel- oped yaw rate sensor, ECU, a rear wheel steering actuator that employs a stepping motor and hydraulic valve, and other hydrau- lic elements, which actively control the steering angle of the rear wheels. The new system ensures a good response and a high level of stability for quick steering even during a high-speed drive. When the vehicle deflects due to a sudden side wind, road surface dis- turbance, or abrupt braking, steering is automatically corrected through the rear wheels to significantly improve forward stabil- ity. In addition, the system provides improved performance in making small radius turns because the rear wheels are steering up to five degrees when the front wheels are turned to a large angle. Also, improved vehicle maneuverability at low speed is obtained. 911923. (SP-878) Video-based measurement of dynamic tire envelopes. James S. Walton, 4D Video; James C. Davis, General Motors Corp.; Michael Hribernik, Hartwick Professionals, Inc.; and Frank Vitz, Frank Vitz Consulting. The three-dimensional motions of the front and rear wheels of a passenger car have been obtained from "over-the-road" tests, with great accuracy (lo RMSE s 0.6mm) using raw data recov- ered from synchronized video cameras. Data from a variety of tests have been combined and treated to produce maximal tire envelopes. This effort has demonstrated the potential of image- based motion measurement as a product design and development tool. Traditional techniques for recovering tire envelopes are described, and their limitations discussed. Image-based motion measurement is offered as a more accurate alternative. The task- specific constraints which limit the selection of imaging hardware are discussed, and a scientific foundation for the new technique is provided. A series of tests has been conducted to demonstrate the viabil- ity of the proposed approach. The procedures used to instrument the vehicle and collect raw video images at highway speeds are described. The numerical methods used to reconstruct the histo- ries of the required kinematic parameters are also described. Plots and typical results are included. The three-dimensional motions of the two wheels have been reconstructed using interac- tive computer graphics and a synthesized solid model. The increased ability to understand and interpret the data in this form has been illustrated by down-loading a sequence of computer- generated images to a VHS cassette for general display. A time-dependent 'voxel' representation of the volume occu- pied by the tire and wheel is being developed to generate tire clearance envelopes. 911924. (SP-878) A study of technology for assembling vehicle endurance reliability. Masanori Ueda, Makoto Haraguchi, Akima Kasai, and Yutaka Nagasaka, Nissan Motor Co., Ltd. The ways in which vehicles are used in the field are continu- ally becoming more diverse. In order to provide the optimum solution with respect to performance and weight, it is necessary to be able to assure vehicle endurance reliability with a high degree of accuracy in relation to the manner of use in each mar- ket. This situation has increased the importance of accurately quantifying the ways in which vehicles are used in the field and of designing vehicles with sufficient endurance reliability to match the usage requirements. This report presents a "market model" by which the manner of usage in the field can be treated quantitatively using combina- tions of environmental factors that influence the road load, drive load and corrosion load, representing typical loads vehicles must withstand. A method for predicting the severity of each load 226</page><page sequence="226">911924-911934 based on quantitative data obtained with the market model is described, along with the process in which development targets for endurance relability are set to correspond to the load predic- tions. 911925. (SP-878) An atlas of linkages for independent suspen- sions. Madhusudan Raghavan , General Motors Research Labs . Number synthesis is an important tool in mechanism design. It permits the systematic enumeration of all possible candidate mechanisms for a given application thereby placing bounds on the technology. This paper describes the application of number synthesis to the structural synthesis of independent suspensions. An independent suspension must permit vertical motions of the wheel relative to the car body, while being fairly rigid in direc- tions orthogonal to the vertical. This is best achieved by means of in-parallel linkages, i.e., suspensions consisting of one or more chains of links and joints connected in parallel between the wheel and the car body. We enumerate all possible single-degree-of- freedom in-parallel linkages with up to five chains. A single- degree-of-freedom linkage is specified by a single parameter. The discussion is restricted to linkages with revolute, prismatic, cylin- dric, pin-insphere, and spherical joints. There are 2 single-chain, 82 two-chain, 224 three-chain, 160 four-chain, and 56 five-chain in-parallel linkages which are candidates for possible use as inde- pendent suspensions structural graphs for all these linkages are presented. AU existing independent suspensions appear in this atlas as natural products of the enumeration process. 1991 SAE Transactions Section 6 911926. (SP-878) Transient and steady state performance characteristics of a two-wheei-steer and four-wheel steer vehicle model. L. D. Metz and D. M. Alter , University of Illinois at Urban a- Cham paign. Using a three-degree-of-freedom vehicle model (side slip, yaw and roll degrees of freedom) and a nonlinear, saturating tire model, the behavior of a typical exemplar vehicle (1986 Dodge Lancer Turbo) was simulated. Steady state performance was examined through simulating a skidpad lateral acceleration maneuver. A lane change maneuver was used to represent tran- sient performance characteristics. A few simple experiments were conducted with the exemplar vehicle to establish parameters and verify some performance properties. Results of both steady state and transient simulations showed that four-wheel steer offers little or no demonstrated performance advantages over two-wheel steer. 911927. Multipurpose models of vehicle dynamics for control- ler design. Donald L. Margolis and Jahan Asgari, University of Calif orn ia-Da vis. As an aid in conceptual development of sophisticated inte- grated control strategies for torque, brakes, steering, and suspen- sions in ground vehicles, reasonable physical system models are necessary. These models must be sufficiently complete to include the important dynamics, but no so complete to include the important dynamics, but not so complex that insight is obscured. This paper develops several vehicle models of varying complex- ity that can aid in the design synthesis of controllers. The poten- tial uses of these models is described. 911928. (SP-878) The effects of suspension stiffness on han- dling responses. H. Fred Chen , Ohio State Univ.; and Dennis A. Guenther, Dept. of Mech. Engrg., Ohio State Univ. The purpose of this paper is to investigate the influence of sus- pension roll stiffness on handling responses. A linear mathemati- cal model is utilized to scrutinize responses on sideslip, yaw velocity and roll angle. Due to different sensitivity to suspension roll stiffness, the influence on an oversteer and an understeer vehicle is very distinct. An oversteer vehicle possesses high sensi- tivity to suspension stiffness at high speeds. Forward speed also plays an important role. Responses in root locus plots and steady state gains are illustrated in this study. 911929. Possible compressor problems in handling HFC-134a car air conditioning systems. Katsumasa Azami, Sanden Intl. (USA) Inc.; and Takeo Takahashi, Madaaki Takahashi, and Hidenori Hosoi, Sanden Corp. Several field problems are anticipated with HFC-134a sys- tems. To be evaluated and clarified are the impacts upon: com- pressors and systems of chlorine based solvents left in the system from flushing or parts cleaning; mixing in CFC-12; mixing the new lubricants with mineral oil; the effects of certain lubricants and HFC-134a,s high hygroscopicity and others. The whole industry should share information and endeavor to maintain the reliability of the new systems from a service engineering stand- point. 1991 SAE Transactions Section 6 911932. The development of a calculation model to estimate the heat flow by heat transfer and sun radiation into passenger cars. Detlef Kettner and E. Okura, Zexel Corp. International. A calculation model has been developed to accurately esti- mate the heat transmission through the wall of the passenger compartment of a car. This calculation model estimate the specific heat flow by heat transfer into passenger cars using the calculated outside surface temperatures of the passenger compartment. If the real outside surface temperatures are known, the specific heat flow into the passenger compartment can be calculated pre- cisely without compromising the physical properties of air near the outside surface of the compartment wall. The cooling load can be determined using the calculated out- side surface temperature of a vehicle, in the earliest stage of a new car design. 911933. Engine compartment air management for engine cool- ing and air conditioning system performance. David L. Martin and Refki El-Bourini, Calsonic Technical Center. Engine cooling and air conditioning tests were performed using a sports utility vehicle with a V-6 engine. The original vehi- cle was equipped with an engine driven fan. This vehicle was modified by adding electric motor driven fans, air path sealing and advanced heat exchangers in a predetermined test configura- tion. Engine cooling performance and air conditioning perfor- mance were evaluated at each step. Identical grade load and idle tests were conducted with this vehicle at each step. The V-6 sports utility vehicle was selected due to its use of an engine driven fan. The grade load of 8.7% was selected due to off road use by the consumers. The results of the testing showed that engine cooling perfor- mance and air conditioning performance were improved by using electric motor driven fans, air path sealing and advanced heat exchangers. This improvement was demonstrated both on the grade and during idle immediately following the grade accord- ingly: lower coolant temperature; lower coolant system pressure; lower transmission oil temperature; lower engine oil tempera- ture; lower vent outlet temperature; lower compressor suction pressure; lower compressor discharge pressure; and higher engine compartment air flow. 911934. (SP-879) Static pressure measurement in a torque con- verter stator. Budugar Lakshminarayana, Pennsylvania State Univ.; and Robert R. By, General Motors Corp. The objective of this paper is to experimentally investigate the static pressure field in a torque converter stator. Static pressure is the most reliable and useful quantity to measure since it is based on good fundamental physics and the experimental proce- dure is simple. Although the automotive torque converter is one 227</page><page sequence="227">911934-911942 of the most complicated turbomachines, static pressure measure- ment in this device has not been reported in the literature. Static pressure measurements were made in a stator blade pas- sage. The measurements were taken at 72 locations under several operating conditions. Results show that: 1) the stator pressure field is three-dimensional throughout the whole range of speed ratio conditions, 2) the pressure distribution is poor at the blade tip section, 3) the well-known one-dimensional performance model can not accurately predict the radial distribution of torque from hub to tip, and 4) a two-dimensional inviscid flow model can reasonably predict the static pressure field at the mean radial section. 1991 SAE Transactions Section 6 911936. (SP-879) A systems engineering approach to sub- system design: automotive transmissions. Mark L. Gunderson, Marc R. Jackson , and Keith D. Van Maanen, General Motors Corp. Systems engineering is a disciplined approach to managing the engineering process throughout a product life cycle. This disci- pline has long been practiced in the aerospace industry, enabling successful integration of highly complex subsystems. The rapidly increasing complexity of automotive design and manufacture has necessitated a similar approach. A systems engineering approach to automotive subsystem design is presented in this paper. Special emphasis is given to explaining the procedures and tools used to plan, coordinate, and execute transmission programs. 911937. (SP-879) Design of vane pump suction porting to reduce cavitation at high operating speeds. Tejinder Singh , Powertrain Div., General Motors Corp. Cavitation can occur in positive displacement pumps at high operating speeds. High levels of noise and pitting damage to the pump components are the concerns. A finite difference fluid flow analysis of the suction port of a vane pump is presented as a pow- erful tool to optimize the pump design for eliminating the cavita- tion phenomenon. The test results of the original cavitating pump and the optimized design are discussed. A new design of the pump rotor is also introduced to fully utilize the potential of the optimized suction port. The approach is generic in nature and lends itself to other pump designs as well. 911938. (SP-879) Improving automatic transmission shift quality by feedback control with a turbine speed sensor. Yasushi Narita, Nissan Motor Co., Ltd. Shift quality in automatic transmissions is greatly affected by deterioration and variation of engine torque, hydraulic pressure control valves, friction elements and other factors. This paper presents a new control system that improves shift quality by using a turbine speed sensor to monitor the shift duration, partic- ularly the duration of the inertia phase. The use of feedback control to vary the line pressure according to the shift duration makes it possible to elminate the effects of aging and component variability. Other factors affecting shift quality, such as atmospheric pressure, road gradient and addi- tional engine load from the air conditioner and alternator, were also examined, and it was found that their effects can be virtually eliminated through feedback control. The inertia phase usually becomes shorter as the engaging clutch capacity increases. How- ever, an extremely small torque capacity can cause a short inertia phase, resulting in a large torque disturbance. This problem is avoided by measuring the interval from the initiation of the shift command to the completion of the inertia phase, this making it possible to distinguish between small and large torque capacity conditions. Power-off upshifts, resulting from abrupt throttle closing, can cause shock and chatter. These disturbances are eliminated through synchronized clutch engagement, achieved by sensing the speed ratio between the turbine and output shaft. Power-on downshifts when going downhill pose a critical con- dition for clutch slip. Friction elements are protected from dam- age in this system by controlling the timing and capacity of the engaging and releasing elements. 911939. (SP-879) Saturn transmission family; product and process flexibility by design. Joel M. Maguire and Louis B. Oniga, General Motors Corp.; and John F. Kosin, Saturn Corp. The Saturn vehicle concept evolved from efforts to derive a domestically produced "small car" that would make use of inno- vative design and manufacturing techniques. Within this frame- work a new transmission family was developed based on a reas- sessment of the fundamentals involving design and manufactur- ing. 911940. (SP-879) A grease-filled torsional coupling for CVT vehicles. Stephen Boedo and Donald E. Freyburger, Borg-Warner Automotive, Inc. This paper describes a long-travel, greased -fi lied, torsional coupling for use in reducing driveline torsional vibration in vehi- cles equipped with continuously variable transmissions (CVTs). Desired spring rate and damping of the coupling are determined by computer simulation of the vehicle driveline response during steady-state and transient modes of vehicle operation. Subse- quent vehicle testing of prototype couplings show that tempera- ture, grease volume, and seal damping are additional factors in the resulting coupling performance. 911941. (SP-879) A method for selecting parallel-connected planetary gear train arrangements for automotive automatic transmissions. Craig S. Ross and William D. Route, General Motors Corp. A new design method for automatic transmission layout is introduced. This method is based on the lever analogy for plane- tary gear sets. It uses the desired number of ratios and their mag- nitudes to size and proportion the generalized lever. The lever is then reduced, yielding the specific gear train and the gear set ratios. This systematic approach eliminates most of the iterations and "dead ends" typical of the design process, since the require- ments of the application are used to drive the design. 1991 SAE Transactions Section 6 911942. (SP-879) Resonance type gear fatigue tester. Kazuyoshi Ogawa, Akira Yamada, and Katsushi Saruki, Toyota Central Research and Development Labs., Inc. A resonance type gear fatigue tester has been developed for fast and efficient evaluation of tooth-root fatigue strength. This tester is a sort of pulsating-type, and operates under quasi- resonance condition. One test gear is held stationary, and the mating gear fastened to a vibratory shaft oscillates against the sta- tionary gear. The torsional vibration of the shaft is excited by a rotating eccentric. The torque amplitude is controlled automati- cally by varying the rotational speed of the eccentric and is main- tained during a test. Fatigue tests and measurements of tooth- root strain were conducted on three kinds of helical gears, whose results were compared with those of a running-type fatigue tester. The results indicated that the tooth-root fatigue strengths with the resonance-type tester agreed with the running-type tester by taking the compressive strain which occurred at the tooth-root on the tension side in meshing, the dynamic load and the supporting rigidity into account. 228</page><page sequence="228">911943-911951 911943. (SP-879) Study on gear noise reduction based on heli- cal-gear tooth accuracy. Toshiki Hirogaki, Tsutomu Ida , and Akira Ono , Mitsubishi Motor Corp.; and Shigeru Kawamoto , Mit- subishi Motors Corp. Some papers on gear noise indicate that for helical gears, the vibrational excitation becomes a minimum when the gears in mesh rotate at a total tooth-contact ratio, where the variation of tooth-stiffness may be minimized. Based on this finding, we have designed a pair of helical gears, of which number of teeth in con- tact would be fixed at any instant of time during the gear rotation. Both the face-and total-contact ratios of involute tooth-face have often been considered to be integers, and a little higher value for the gear with inaccurate tooth-face. Meanwhile, it has been confirmed by computation and experi- ments that the vibrational excitation of carburized production gears, paired with carburized or hard-finished ones, would decrease if their total contact ratios have been set higher. The present study reveals that the exciting force is much dependent on the total contact ratio, and is little affected by chosing an inte- ger contact ratio. And the exciting force of gear decreases at higher total contact ratio while no minimum force is observed. When a drive gear rotates at a fixed speed, the variation of driven gear teeth delays, from the theoretical tooth location deter- mined from the gear ratio, due to the tooth deflection and profile errors. This delay is normally variable, and its variable ampli- tude, determined from the pitch circle of the gear, is denoted as the meshing transmission errors (hereinafter referred to MTEs), and the fundamental harmonic mesh component in the exciting force, can be expressed as the fundamental component of MTEs. Another finding from our study is that the MTEs of a gear pair decrease if the tooth face of the drive gear, where the gear tends to advance in the rotation, is smoothly ground off by a few microns. In other words, the MTEs component in the total tooth- face error has been successfully separated by analyzing delay or advance of the driven gear. Moreover, it has been clarified that such MTEs component of the error can be decreased. 1991 SAE Transactions Section 6 911944. Stability and maneuverability problems of ATV's. Robert R. Wright , LEX PERT, Inc.; Frank H. Johnson, S.E.A.L. Corp.; Thomas G. Carpenter, Ohio State Univ.; and Randy Nel- son, Motorcycle Dynamics. All-terrain vehicles, usually called ATVs, are small motorized vehicles operating on three, four, or five low-pressure, high flota- tion tires that are "designed" for off-road use on a variety of ter- rains. As the use of these ATVs increased through the 1980's, the number of accidents resulting in serious injuries and deaths asso- ciated with ATV use increased dramatically. The U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission (CPSC) along with other surveys have estimated that one out of every 25 ATVs being used will be involved in an accident requiring professional medical attention. These problems led to the federal government working out an agreement with the major manufacturers of these vehicles. One apsect of the agreement was that there would be safety and stabil- ity standards that all ATVs would have to meet to be sold in this country. An analysis of some of the safety, steering, and stability problems of ATVs is presented along with an examination of the current American National Standard Institute (ANSI)/Specialty Vehicle Institute of America (SVIA) standards for ATVs. 1991 SAE Transactions Section 6 911945. A safer ATV. Frank H. Johnson, S.E.A.L. Corp.; Rob- ert R. Wright, LEX PERT, Inc.; Randy Nelson, Motorcycle Dynamics; and Thomas G. Carpenter, Ohio State Univ. As reported by Wright and Carpenter and others, the number of accidents resulting in serious injuries and deaths associated with all terrain vehicle (ATV) use increased dramatically during the 1980s. It was decided that a safer, more stable ATV should be and could be built. Three-wheel and four-wheel ATVs were considered. Two three-wheel ATVs and a four-wheel ATV were modified and fabricated as prototypes. While improvements of the three-wheel ATVs were realized, there were still considerable stability problems that could not be sufficiently corrected. The four-wheel prototype, denoted as RCX 250 (roll cage experimen- tal vehicle with a 250 cc engine), demonstrated feasibility with clear improvements in safety. Analysis of the dynamics of the RCX 250 along with the description of the features and the test results are discussed. 911946. Personal watercraft safety (small water jet propelled craft). Mike Burleson, Systems Engineering and Labs.; Al Bruton, SEA Frog Productions, Inc.; and Edward W. Karnes, Metropoli- tan State College. Safety considerations in the operation of personal watercraft and related design concerns are discussed. Accident statistics, hazard analyses, and preliminary testing data have identified potential safety deficiencies and accident causation factors that require further analysis. 911949. Production evidence retrieval system for wiring har- nesses. Akihiro Masda and Masao Igarashi, Yazaki Parts Co., Ltd. Recently, air bag systems have been widely installed in cars. In the wiring harnesses of the air bag system, qualified processing, process record-keeping and process control are rquired to record high reliability and quality. In this regard, a process record -keeping and retrieval system has been developed. This system consists of 16 data terminals with handheld bar code scanners, 5 automatic bar code scanners and a personal computer with opto-magnetic disk as the server. These resources are networked by 1M bps Star-LAN. Software for LAN communication, data logging and retrieval is developed as a quasi-concurrent system on MS-DOS environ- ment avoiding the collision of data on LAN. In combination of a relational database on opto-magnetic disk, a process data retieval in 20 minutes has been proved among the data storage of 1M byte per day, in 15 years, 4G byte in total. The hardware and software of the system would be described as well as the results of the application on quality control in actual production lines. 911950. Environmental protection of electrical splices. Kevin O'Brien, William Biddell, Maria Pena, and Joseph Weber, Ray- chem. The sealing of automotive splices through the use of heat- shrinkable tubing has been shown to be an effective means to pro- vide protection from the electrical, mechanical, chemical, and temperature environments that an electrical splice is exposed to in automotive applications. The product must not only meet these requirements, but also must be able to be installed repro- ducibly at production rates. In order to meet these requirements, a splice sealing system was developed which consists of: a prop- erly designed adhesive lined heat shrinkable tube which can with- stand the electrical, mechanical, chemical, and thermal environ- ments which are present in automotive applications; a methodol- ogy to select the proper size of tubing to seal a wide range of splice configurations, wire types, and wire gauge sizes; and an installa- tion method which will ensure that the product can be installed at production rates in a reliable manner. This paper will highlight this splice sealing system and illus- trates the importance of each of these three steps. 911951. Effect of carbon fiber in dry brake formulations. B. Keith Friley and Brent E. McNeese, Ashland Carbon Fibers ; and James T. Trainor, J. T. Trainor and Associates. Carbon fiber is known to contribute to a new generation of asbestos-free brake friction formulations. Carbon fiber's thermal properties make it a desirable component in applications where 229</page><page sequence="229">911951-911971 high temperatures are involved. It is not an exotic material, and is used commercially by major friction material producers. Car- bon fiber is not known to be a hazard to human health or the environment under present conditions of manufacture and use. It is easily processed in dry brake formulations with equipment typically used in the friction industry. The present paper demon- strates how one unquie type of carbon fiber can make significant improvements in durability and structural properties of dry brake formulations. 1991 SAE Transactions Section 6 911967. (P-246) The C-17: modern airlift technology. Leonard R. Tavernetti, Douglas Aircraft Co., McDonnall Douglas. Three SAE technical papers in recent years have addressed the C-17 program: "C-17 Technical Description" by Robert van't Riet, presented 8 March 1989, and "C-17 Flight Control System" by Alex Brown, and "Meeting the C-17 Reverse Thrust Require- ments" by Frank Junkermann, both presented 3 October 1988. This paper provides an update of these previous presentations by members of the McDonnell Douglas C-17 team. The paper dis- cusses technology adapted from commercial aircraft for military airlift; the military requirement to move large cargo items long distances and land on short runways, which drove C-17 design; and significant design alternatives and the solutions selected. 1991 SAE Transactions Section 1 911968. (P-246) Assessment of aerospace technology in Japan: viewed from an American perspective. Floyd A. Wyczalek, FW Lilly, Inc. This is an assessment of aerospace technology in Japan, the national vision supporting it and the strategy underlies its ulti- mate purpose. It includes a comparison of the organizations and missions of the two principle aerospace agencies: one, the Insti- tute of Space and Astronautical Science (ISAS); and two, the National Space Development Agency (NASDA). Included are the launch capabilities and deep space facilities of ISAS, at Kago- shima Space Center (KSC) in Uchinoura on Kyushu Island; and the NASDA Tanegashima Space Center (TSC) on Tanegashima Island. Also included are the design and development history of domestic Nippon launch and space vehicles, beginning with the licensing of the United States Thor-Delta rocket technology and including the design of the domestic H-I second and third stages and the all domestic H-II vehicles. Included in this essay are over- views of H-I and H-II launch vehicles during assembly at the Oye and Oye West Plants of Nagoya Aircraft Works, Mitsubishi Heavy Industries. ISAS and NASDA have placed more than 40 satellites in orbit since the start of the Japanese space program. 1991 SAE Transactions Section 1 911969. (P-246) The national aero-space plane program a rev- olutionary concept. Robert R. Barthélémy, Wright-Patterson Air Force Base. NASP - the national aero-space plane - is a look into the future. It is a vision of the ultimate airplane, one capable of flying at speeds greater than 17,000 miles per hour, twenty-five times the speed of sound. It is the attainment of a vehicle that can rou- tinely fly from earth to space and back, from conventional air- fields, in affordable ways. It is the achievement of major techno- logical breakthroughs that will have an enormous impact on the furture growth of this nation. Most of all, it is a projection of America at its best, at its boldest, at its most creative. NASP is more than a national aircraft development program, more than the synergy of revolutionary technologies, more than a capability that may change the way we move through the world and the aerospace around it. NASP is a revolutionary technical, manage- rial, and programmatic concept; it is a possibility of what can be in America. The NASP program can be described in a number of ways: technological, programmatic, utilitarian, and conceptual. In each case, NASP has departed from the traditional evolutionary path. In order to achieve the vision of NASP, innovative and revolu- tionary approaches are required: the technical challenges require the synergism of several major technology breakthroughs; the programmatic challenges require a fundamental change in the development, management, and implementation of this strategic, high-tech program; the utility challenge requires a transformation of our thinking about aeronautical and aerospace systems; and the conceptual challenge requires a paradigm shift in national planning, collaboration, and commitment. Each of these challenges, and the NASP response to them, is explored in the following pages. 911970. (P-246) The HL-20 lifting-body personnel launch sys- tem. Howard W. Stone and William W. Piland, NASA Langley Research Center. For several years the NASA Langley Research Center has con- ducted in-dpeth research in supporting technology advancement for a concept which could complement the space shuttle opera- tion and ensure the ability to transport people to and from earth orbit. The concept is called the HL-20 lifting-body and it has been defined as an option for future development as a personnel launch system (PLS). This paper will describe early lifting-body research, expected PLS mission requirements, the HL-20 concept design status, and those features which enhance aerodynamic and aerothermodynamic performance, operation efficiency, main- tainability, reliability, and crew safety. The HL-20 concept evolved from early lifting-body research in the 60's and 70's and has been designed for the primary mis- sion of changing the space station freedom crew. It is sized to accommodate eight passengers plus a flight crew of two. The duration of the mission is 3 days. About 29 ft in length, the vehi- cle has a landing weight of 22000 lb. It is launched vertically, mounted on an expendable or partially reusable booster and has a hypersonic lift-to-drag ratio of about 1.4 with an entry cross- range of 1100 nautical miles to provide flexibility in choice of landing sites for each orbit and in opportunities for landing. Landing is horizontal on runways 10000 feet or longer. Considerable research effort has advanced the HL-20 to a fairly mature design. A broad range of wind tunnel testing has provided a substantial data base for understanding the aerother- modynmic performance and these tests have been complemented by numerous computational flow-field studies. Structural and subsystem design has focused on features which offer operational simplicity with low maintenance costs and rapid vehicle process- ing. Efficiency in operation is achieved through the use of airline approaches to overall system layout and access coupled with built-in test and health monitoring instrumentation. Computer- based flight simulations have involved experienced pilots and astronauts, and the HL-20 concept proved to be relatively easy to fly and to land. A full-scale model of the concept has been con- structed with an interior for conducting crew accommodation studies, ingress and egress, pilot visibility, and other man machine interface investigations. Results of the HL-20 PLS research to date show that the concept has definite advantages for efficiently satisfying future needs for assured manned access to space. The vehicle is designed with operational efficiency, low life-cycle costs, reliability, and safety as the primary criteria. Should there be a decision to develop and operate the vehicle, it has been defined with a substantial technical foundation for reducing the risk of program success. 1991 SAE Transactions Section 1 911971. (P-246) Media selection analysis: implications for training design. H. Barbara Sorensen, Air Force Human Resources Lab., Brooks Air Force Base. 230</page><page sequence="230">911971-911979 A comparative analysis of current media selection models was conducted as part of an overall effort to improve key instruc- tional systems development (ISD) steps that would significantly benefit from automation and decision support features. The media selection step within the ISD process was chosen for in- depth evaluation of its automation requirements. The objectives of this study were threefold: 1) to compare and contrast the media selection models in general use by military, contractor, and civil- ian instructional designers; 2) to identify key features that impact media selection model automation; and 3) to develop a prelimi- nary design of an automated media selection model that incorpo- rates the requirements of as many of the reviewed media selec- tion models as possible. 911972. (P-246) A framework for optimizing total training sys- tems: application to maintenance training and team training sys- tems. Tenny A. Lindholm and Robert F. Bachert, Aeronautical Systems Div., Wright-Patterson Air Force Base. The concept of team or crew training has for some time been acknowledged as extremely important to the accomplishment of any complex task requiring the joint, integrated skills of more than one human. Effective implementation of such a training program becomes a challenge when numerous complex tasks, affecting the actions of several teams or crews, interact with each other in accomplishing higher order tasks or missions. A total sys- tem framework is needed in order to account for and plan for these interactions, many of which could be critical in terms of safe mission accomplishment. In this paper, we introduce such a framework which has enjoyed great success in the analysis and planning of other man-machine systems. We then extend the con- cepts to include maintenance training and aircrew training, and the training function in general within the Enterprise, giving examples that relate to current training challenges. 911973. (P-246) Enhancement of ground handling through optimum selection/use of ground-support equipment (GSE). Paul D. Tuck, Consultant. Advances in development of transport aircraft have histori- cally paced modernization of complementary ground-support equipment (GSE). This paper shows that a family of cargo on/ offloading loaders, capable of servicing the aircraft's main and lower lobes simultaneously is more efficient and cost-effective than a single Cadillac -type super loader that "can do everything." The Air Force has recently awarded two contracts to GSE manu- facturers to build and test two prototype super loaders. The win- ner is supposed to on/offload everything from a C-130 whose cargo deck is only three feet, three inches high to a B-747, whose main deck upper limit is almost 18 feet high, and all other stan- dard-body aircraft in between like DC-8s, B-707s, as well as all of the wide-bodied aircraft lower lobes, whose door sizes and heights vary extensively. 911974. (P-246) The high speed challenge for rotary wing air- craft. Eva n A. Fradenburgh, Sikorsky Aircraft Div., United Tech- nologies Corp. This paper reviews the problems associated with developing a vertical takeoff and landing (VTOL) aircraft that has desirable helicopter-like attributes in hover and low speed operation but is capable of efficient high subsonic cruise speed. A number of dif- ferent configurations that have been proposed are reviewed and an assessment is made of the relative probabilities of future suc- cess. Factors considered to be important discriminators include speed potential, disk loading, empty weight fraction, the need for supplementary propulsion systems or convertible engines, and technical risk. The tilt-rotor configuration has considerable merit but will not achieve the highest speeds desired. It is concluded that incorporation of variable geometry, in the form of a variable diameter rotor system, has the best chance of providing the "ideal" VTOL. The variable diameter tilt-rotor adds on the order to 100 knots to the speed potential of the tilt-rotor and provides numerous other benefits as well. For highest speeds, the variable- diameter single stowed rotor configuration has the desired com- bination of attributes. 1991 SAE Transactions Section 1 911975.

Sikorsky Aircraft and Honeywell Incorporated, in response to customer requirements, began development of an all weather Search and Rescue (SAR) capable S-76 helicopter in April 1989. To accomplish this primarily Overwater rescue mission, an auto- matic approach and hover capability was added to the standard digital automatic flight control system (DAFCS). A key element to the system was the automatic approach and hover with dopp- ler velocity control, and new approach-to-hover and hover elec- tronic flight instrument system (EFIS) displays. 1991 SAE Transactions Section 1 911976. (P-246) High speed VSTOL on the horizon the answer to congestion. William F. Chana, William F. Chana Associates, Inc. High speed VSTOL aircraft that can cruise between 300 and 400 knots are becoming technically and economically feasible. As civil transports, they could help relieve congestion at major air- ports around the world. Demonstrator vehicles have proven that tilt wing and tilt rotor aircraft can meet performance expectations. Advances in propul- sion, materials, flight controls and avionics places aviation on the threshold of truly practical and cost effective high speed VSTOL aircraft. The Bell XV-15 tilt rotor and the Canadair CL-84 tilt wing air- craft were successful demonstrators. They are nearly identical in size, weight and available power; thus, there is a good opportu- nity to make realistic capability comparisons. Future markets for tilt wing and tilt rotor aircraft range from small unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV's) to large 40-passenger transports. Above this size it becomes more practical to use a tilt wing STOL design. A nine-passenger (11 seats) tilt wing vehicle about the size of the XV-15 and CL-84 is considered the most logical first genera- tion high speed VSTOL aircraft for civil roles and search and res- cue (SAR) missions. Design issues and factors relating to the tilt wing and tilt rotor are reviewed. There are many differences, but perhaps most visi- ble are the small diameter propellers on tilt wing aircraft and large diameter rotors on tilt rotor aircraft. There is a real need to do something in a hurry to relieve the congestion existing at major airports. Certain key assumptions are made and the challenge is to put these assumptions in place. 1991 SAE Transactions Section 1 911979. (P-246) Estimation of spaceplane lateral-directional stability and control derivatives from dynamic wind tunnel test. Masaaki Yanagihara, Seizo Suzuki, Shigeo Kayaba, and Kat - suichi Murota, National Aerospace Lab. Dynamic wind tunnel tests using a 5-percent cable-mounted model of the NAL spaceplane have been performed in the NAL low-speed large scale wind tunnel to identify the aerodynamic model including dynamic effects. During the tests performed in March 1991, the lateral-directional motion was excited by aileron and rudder inputs. A flight path reconstruction was applied to the recorded data and a parameter identification study of the recon- structed data was undertaken to extract lateral-directional stabil- ity and control derivatives using the least square method. The estimated derivatives were compared with the results of static wind tunnel tests and theoretically estimated dynamic deriva- tives. They were also evaluated by comparing mathematically simulated time histories calculated using them with the wind tun- 231</page><page sequence="231">911979-911988 nel test data. As a result, all major derivatives were estimated well and effectiveness of the dynamic test was shown. 1991 SAE Transactions Section 1 911980.

Cable-mount dynamic wind-tunnel tests have been made in the NAL low speed wind tunnel for the purpose of extracting aerodynamic parameters of a 5% spaceplane model. The cable- mount dynamic wind-tunnel experiment is described. An identification technique composed of flight path recon- struction and regression analysis (two step method), and the max- imum likelihood method for the identification of the parameters in the linear dynamic system (one step method) were applied to the wind-tunnel test data. The estimation results for the aerody- namic parameters by the two methods are compared. 1991 SAE Transactions Section 1 911981.

(P-246) Status of the FAA flight loads monitoring pro- gram. Terence J. Barnes and Thomas DeFiore, Federal Aviation Administration. In support of the Federal Aviation Administration aging air- craft research program, the Agency has established a flight loads data collection program for commercial aircraft. The objectives of this program are to: 1) review existing data collected by other sources including by not limited to U.S., Foreign, Military, etc.; 2) collect current operational usage data from both large and small transport aircraft; and 3) develop criteria for future genera- tions of transports. This paper presents the status of the various programs which are completed, underway or planned. The FAA will be collecting, storing, and analyzing the data which characterize typical commercial transport operations. The airframe manufacturers will handle the task of calculating the loads and stresses. 911984.

Both kinds can also be devided into the scatter fac- tors for crack initiation lives and those for crack growth lives. This paper also studies the values of different kinds of scatter factors, and gives out suitable ones. Meanwhile, it makes com- ments on the calculation formulas and different values of scatter factors used by other countries. Through the study of the definitions and their parameter dis- tributions of scatter factors and reductions factors, the author considers that it is possible to calculate them by a unified for- mula. 911985.

This paper describes the hardware and software that was designed, developed and built by Boeing to support the major fatigue testing of full scale 757 and 767 airframes. These tests con- trol systems resulted in significant cost savings over previous pro- grams. These systems are capable of applying pseudo random loading of complex flight load spectrums with up to 72 channels of control and 110 channels of data acquisition. The major fatigue tests consisted of the application of two normal lifetimes of flights in a test environment that is performed on the ground with loads applied by closed loop servo hydraulic load control systems. 911986. (P-246) Delamination fracture analysis of composite laminates caused by local buckling and postbuckling. David Tsao, Darning Duan, and WenmeiJi, Northwestern Poly technical Univ. Localized buckling of delaminated sublaminates in composite plates creates high interlaminar stresses around the delamination boundary, and then often causes rapid extensive delamination growth. This delamination growth reduces the global stiffness and thereby lowers the buckling load of the laminate signifi- cantly. With use of the VCCTS technique proposed by the authors, quantitative multiple parametric analyses of embedded elliptically - shaped delamination growth are provided in detail for the first time in this paper. The new results in this paper show that whether a delamination grows or not is determined by both the geometrical and physical parameters and their relations, and therefore they can be used to predict the growth of delaminations with varied kind of parameters. 1991 SAE Transactions Section 1 911987.

Udagawa, Japan Atomic Energy Research Institute. Effects of thermal cycle and irradiation on mechanical proper- ties of carbon fiber reinforced plastic (CFRP) and adhesives were experimentally investigated. The IM-6/6376, toughened epoxy composite and T800/ PMR-15, heat-resistant polyimide composite, and typical nine types of epoxy adhesives were selected as candidate structural materials for the future space applications. These materials were subjected to up to 10 MGy irradiation and/or 3000 thermal cycle (-100°C to 100°C) which simulates the space environment. After these conditionings, specimens were mechanically tested over the temperature range of -100°C to 100°C. The results were that the IM-6/6376 was not affected by irradi- ation and/or thermal cycle. This material showed essentially good overall durability performance in space environments. T-800/PMR-15 was not affected by irradiation. This material showed good durability against radiation. The other hands, the adhesives was greatly affected by irradia- tion and/or thermal cycle. Sensitivity of adhesives against space environment was indicated. 911988. (P-246) Computational aerodynamics: the next gener- ation. Kristin A. Hessenius and Pamela F. Richardson, Aerody- namics Div., NASA Headquarters. Continued advances in the various elements that comprise the field of computational fluid dynamics (CFD) are promoting a radically different approach to the aerodynamic design and anal- ysis of aerospace vehicles and systems. The elements of CFD gen- erally include numerical algorithm development, transition and turbulence modeling, surface modeling and grid generation, sci- entific visualization, and validation methodologies. This paper 232</page><page sequence="232">911988-911994 discusses the research progress and prospects for the future in each of these key elements within the National Aeronautics and Space Administration's (NASA's) CFD and experimental valida- tion program.

(P-246) The impact of CFD on the airplane design process: today and tomorrow. Ronald L. Bengelink and Paul E. Rubbert, Boeing Commercial Airplanes. CFD now stands alongside the wind tunnel in terms of impor- tance to aerodynamic design. Its usage by engineering designers involves many thousands of runs per year, and the rate is increas- ing. For the simpler aerodynamic flows where viscous effects are modest, CFD has become the dominant tool for aerodynamic design. The primary role of the wind tunnel for such flows is for validation of a design and for determination of aerodynamic characteristics over the broad flight envelope. For more complex flows that are dominated by strong viscous effects, CFD is begin- ning to make a contribution. It is thought by many that the principle challenge for the future is to develop better computers and algorithms in order to better address the computation of complex flows over complex airplane geometries. But recent experiences involving the application of CFD to the design of the new Boeing 111 airplane has taught us that the challenge for the future is really much broader. This recent experience has brought into focus a clearer understanding of where the leverage of CFD really is, and what codes must be able to do in order to contribute in truly significant ways to the design of superior airplanes. This paper discusses the characteris- tics of the codes that are found to play a truly central and effective role in airplane design, and describes the challenges that must be met and overcome. 1991 SAE Transactions Section 1 911990. (P-246) Computational aerodynamics in aircraft design: challenges and opportunities for Euler/Navier-Stokes methods. Pradeep Raj and Steven W. Singer ; Lockheed Aeronau- tical Systems Co. Computational aerodynamics offers one of the most promis- ing means of improving the productivity of the aircraft design process. Evaluation of numerous geometric modifications in a typical design cycle is very costly and time consuming if done using wind tunnels alone. The potential-flow computational methods can provide reliable aerodynamic data needed for air- craft design as long as the flow is entirely subsonic or supersonic and remains attached. Methods based on the Euler and Navier- Stokes equations do not suffer from such restrictions and are, therefore, capable of providing aerodynamic data for a much wider range of flow conditions. Such capabilities are illustrated in this paper. Solutions obtained using a state-of-the-art three- dimensional Euler/Navier-Stokes aerodynamic method, TEAM, are presented for four test cases range from an airfoil to the com- plete advanced tactical fighter prototype configuration. In spite of the superior capabilities, the Euler and Navier-Stokes methods are not yet fully effective for aircraft design since the analysis turn-around time is long and the solution reliability is less than satisfactory. Even at the current level of effectiveness, however, these methods can play a very valuable role in aircraft design by complementing wind-tunnel testing. 1991 SAE Transactions Section 1 911991. (P-246) Numerical simulations of separated flows around oscillating airfoil for dynamic stall phenomena. Shigeru Aso and Atsuhiro Sakamoto, Kyushu Univ.; and Masanori Hayashi, Nishinippon Institute of Technology. Dynamic stall phenomena have been investigated numerically by solving incompressible Navier-Stokes equations with a third- order upwind scheme in order to reveal the flow structure and mechanism of dynamic stall. The separated flows around a wing section at static attack angle are calculated and compared with the experiments which are conducted by the present authors. The results show excellent agreements with the experiments and the numerical scheme is proved to work well. Separated flows around oscillating airfoil in pitch are calculated by using the scheme and a moving mesh system. The flow conditions are selected from our experiments. The calculated separated region is small in pitch- ing-up process and it becomes large in a pitching-down process. Quite different characteristics of flow patterns between in a pitch- ing-up and pitching-down processes are obtained. 911992. (P-246) Computational fluid dynamics applications in airplane cabin ventilation system design. Fred Aboosaidi and Matthew J. Warfield, Boeing Co.; and Dipankar Choudhury, Creare.X. Two three-dimensional cabin airflow configurations have been the subject of experimental and analytical testing to estab- lish the validity and role of computational fluid dynamics (CFD) tools in the design of cabin airflow distribution systems. The CFD tools considered here are two separate Navier-Stokes com- puter codes which have been used for a number of applications, including those in the present study. A correlative study of a detailed air supply nozzle configuration has been examined to further understand its flow characteristics and to establish a pro- cedure for examining cases with large size scale differences. The comparison of experimental results with the numerical simula- tions in the two cases is generally quite good, leading to an increased confidence in the application of CFD methods within the cabin airflow distribution system design arena. 1991 SAE Transactions Section 1 911993.

But the wing configuration was not changed. Therefore, this experimen- tal aircraft doesn't always have the optimum configuration of a USB type aircraft. This paper describes the investigations which have been conducted to improve the aerodynamic characteristics of a subsonic jet transport semi-span model with an upper surface blowing flap system which has been newly designed using the NAL STOL-CAD program. The tests were conducted in the NAL 2-by 2-meter gust wind tunnel and results were obtained for several flap and slat deflec- tions at engine thrust coefficients from 0 to 1.85. As compared with the aerodynamic characteristics of the ASUKA model, we obtained the possibility of reduction of the airframe weight and significant improvement of the aerodynamic characteristics. 1991 SAE Transactions Section 1 911994. (P-246) An acrobatic airship 'ACROSTAT'. Af. Onda and Y. Morikawa, Ministry of International Trade and Industry. A novel type of airships or a powered LTA aircraft has been proposed, which is designed with a rather conventionally shaped hull and with conventional thrusters and is not made as a control configured vehicle (CCV) nor utilized any sophisticated control mechanism. None of control surfaces are installed but couples of stabilizers equipped to the aft hull, and without any active control tricks the vehicle holds its stability and realizes enhanced maneu- verability performances. This newly conceived type model is named as 'ACROSTAT'. This airship can ascent and descent ver- tically, and can perform somersaults, spiral flights, and rotates 233</page><page sequence="233">911994-912002 around its C.G. as the center of the movement.

Shohei Niwa and Masayuki Suzuki , Nagoya Univ. Making use of advantages of ducted fan, i.e. compactness and approachability, ducted fan VTOL can be used for many pur- poses, such as construction and servicing of the tall structures, rescue, etc. In this paper the development of a working platform which utilizes the ducted fan VTOL concept is tried. Two types of ducted fan VTOL research models are developed. One is driven by electric motors and the other by an engine. The aim of the development is to investigate the ability of the ducted fan VTOL as a platform for working tasks at a high position. One of the most important problems for the development of the working platform in air is the development of control system which enable precision hovering. In this paper mainly the auto- matic flight control system for ducted fan VTOL is investigated and the control problems are studied which will arise when the VTOL is utilized as a working platform. Among them are the application of two time scale control theory for the feedback con- trol system design and application of Kaiman filter theory to pro- cess sensor data. 1991 SAE Transactions Section 1 911996. (P-246) Arianespace launches llghtsats. Dieter Brand, Arianespace. This paper presents the means Arianespace provides the launching small satellites into geostationary transfer orbit (GTO) or low earth orbit (LEO) and reviews actual as well as potential applications for lightsats. Small satellites weighing less than 50 kg are microsatellites. Satellites with a mass of a few hundred kilo- grams not exceeding 1 ton are minisatellites. Microsatellites are typically built by universities, research laboratories or radio ama- teur organizations and do not constitute a commercial market. Minisatellites on the other hand may have all the functions and the operational life-span of large satellites and may be used for a wide variety of missions. 911997. (P-246) Geostationary earth observatories - Key ele- ments of NASA's "mission to planet earth". William C. Snoddy, NASA Marshall Space Flight Center. The Marshall Space Flight Center (MSFC) has been given the responsibility for conceptual development of the geostationary earth observatory (GEO) element of NASA's mission to planet earth program. Because these multi-instrument geostationary sat- ellites will orbit over given points on the ground, they will each provide continuous observation of large regions of the Earth and will complement other data gathering facilities in low Earth orbit (LEO) such as the polar platforms of the Earth observing system (EOS) and the Earth probe satellites which operate in a variety of specialized LEO's. These various systems will operate over a 15-year period to obtain data with unprecedented global and tem- poral coverage. Because of their Earth-fixed position, the GEO instruments will provide high temporal resolution while the LEO instruments will provide data having higher spatial and spectral resolution. These data will be used to define the hydrologie, biogeochemical, and energy cycles which constitute the Earth sys- tem. Understanding these cycles and developing the capability to predict their course are the ultimate goals of mission to planet Earth. 1991 SAE Transactions Section 1 911998.

Mini-railgun with about 800J power supply was made to launch a small particle at about 100m/s for the purpose of machining. Although the structure of the mini-railgun is the same as a conventional railgun, the acceleration mechanism was found to be different from that of the conventional one. The experimen- tal data of the velocity and the pressure agreed well with those estimated from the gasgun model. 1991 SAE Transactions Section 1 911999. (P-246) Response characteristics of a wing in super- sonic flow near flutter boundary. Hiroshi Torii , Meijo Univ.; and Yuji Matsuzaki, Nagoya Univ. In this paper we examine numerically the subcriticai flutter characteristics of wings in a supersonic flow. Especially the scat- tering property of the criterion parameters which are used in order to estimate a flutter boundary, is studied. The wing response due to the flow turbulence is expressed by the autore- gressive moving-average process through Akaike's estimation procedure. The wing stability is evaluated by applying the Jury's stability determinant method for a discrete system to the esti- mated time series model. The flutter boundary is predicted by plotting the Jury's stability criterion parameter at several dynamic pressures in the subcriticai range. As the dynamic pres- sure approaches to the flutter boundary, the estimated stability parameter and its scattering monotonically decreases while the damping, the conventional flutter estimation criterion, scattered so much near the flutter boundary. 1991 SAE Transactions Section 1 912000. (P-246) A new two degrees -of-freedom actuator used for vibration control of large space structures. Osamu Okamoto, Teruomi Nakaya , Kenji Ogimoto, and Seizo Suzuki, National Aerospace Lab.; Yasuaki Taniguchi and Hajime Sakamoto, Kawasaki Heavy Industries, Ltd.; and Goji Iba, Sotomitsu Hara, and Makoto Hamada, Nachi-Fujikoshi Corp. For large space structures (LSS), the interaction between con- trol system and structural vibration is a major problem. In this paper, the authors will show a new two degrees-of-freedom actua- tor called "super precision positioning device (SPD)" which con- verts rotational motion to translational motion without cams or link mechanism, and experimental results of active vibration control to large space structures using the actuator as an active damping enhancer. In the experiment, the SPD is mounted to a rigid base to which a flexible structure model is attached. The structure is a free standing flexible frame type structure and it has multi- dimensional vibration modes to simulate a real structure. The movement of the SPD is controlled to damp three dimensional vibration by sensing moments of the structure. The experimental results in this paper shows that the SPD is capable of reducing multi-dimensional structural vibration. 1 991 SAE Transactions Section 1 912001. (P-246) Preliminary study of algorithm for real-time flutter monitoring. Katsuhiko Shibata and Katsuya Matsuzaki, Mitsubishi Heavy Industries, Ltd. This paper describes an algorithm for real-time flutter moni- toring. An auto-regressive (AR) model with time varying coeffi- cients is used for continuous monitor of the nonstationary flutter parameters. AR coefficient change rates as well as AR coefficients can be obtained recursively by the Kaiman filter implementation. Using these AR coefficients and change rates, the natural fre- quencies and damping values of vibration modes can be esti- mated, and these values at a few seconds ahead are also predicted. This algorithm was tested on simulated data and wind tunnel test data, and showed desirable estimation performance. 912002. (P-246) Applicability of Euler analysis to prop-fan aerodynamic design. Makoto Kobayakawa and Ryoji Takaki, Kyoto Univ.; Yoshifumi Kawakami, Sumitomo Precision Prod - 234</page><page sequence="234">912002-912008 ucts Co., Ltd.; and Frederick B. Metzger, Hamilton Standard, United Technologies Corp. Applicability of a numerical code to aerodynamic design of a prop-fan is established by precise agreement of numerical results with experimental data, i.e., not only measured integrated perfor- mance indices, such as power coefficient or net efficiency but also pressure distribution on the blade surface should agree well with computed results. For this purpose, an Euler code using the total variation diminishing scheme has been developed. Numerical calculations are performed with this scheme for the SR-7L prop- fan at the freestream Mach number 0.5 and 0.78. The computed power coefficient, Cp = 1.46 at Mx = 0.5 shows good agreement with experimental data. At this computed Cp, the computed pres- sure distributions on the blade surfaces show good agreement with the experimental results. For the 0.78M infinitey case the computed Cp of 0.87 also shows good agreement with the experi- mental results and the computed pressure distributions are in general agreement with the experimental data. These results indi- cate that the present Euler-code could provide guidance for aero- dynamic design of a prop-fan of the SR-7L type. 912003. (P-246) Recent applications of the FNS zonal method to complex flow problems. Kozo Fujii and Yoshiaki Tamura, Institute of Space and Astronautical Science. Newly developed zonal method using the interface scheme based on the fortified Navier-Stokes concept is applied to steady and unsteady flow problems. Two computational results are shown as application examples to unsteady flow problems. One problem is a train moving into a tunnel and the other problem is a blast wave propagation. These problems require the accuracy enhancement and the problem adaptability, both of which are important obstacles of the current CFD technology. The com- puted result indicates that the present method alleviates the diffi- culty with simple modification of the existing codes. Steady flow problems include supersonic intake flow simulation and three dimensional simulation of the complex body configuration. The results indicate that the present method alleviate the difficulty of the simulation of complex flow configuration. In general, it is shown that several types of zonal approach such as overlaid, overlapped, and multi-block methods are treated in the same manner under this concept, and that the present zonal method can make a conventional program to be an effective CFD tool for the analysis of complex flow configuration. 1991 SAE Transactions Section 1 912004. (P-246) Free wake analyses of a hovering rotor using panel method. Gizo Hasegawa, Hiroyuki Nakagawa, Takashi Sato, and Tomoari Nagashima, National Defense Academy. Using a higher order vortex panel method, three dimensional free wake analyses for a rotor in hover are carried out. The pur- pose of this paper is to propose new methods being able to incor- porate wake deformations due to wake-ground interactions into performance predictions. Both rotors at isolated and at close proximity to arbitrary shaped ground surfaces are investigated. The blade is modeled as a lifting surface with one row of cells (equivalent to Weissinger's L model). The wake is divided into the adjoining, near and far regions. The ground is approximated by the quadrilateral panels. The first two regions of the wake are modeled by triangular shaped panels with linear vorticity distri- bution which are adopted by their flexibility for roll up deforma- tions of the wake. A semi-infinite vortex cylinder with the cons- tant radius is substituted for the far wake to avoid instabilities of the wake geometry. Numerical results of wake geometries for rotors both at iso- lated and close proximity to inclined ground surface are pres- ented and advantages of the proposed method are discussed. 912005. (P-246) Results and lessons learned from the STOL and maneuver demonstration program. James A. Laughrey and David J. Moorhouse, Wright Lab., Wright-Patterson Air Force Base. The STOL and maneuver technology demonstrator (S/MTD) program has validated a set of technologies that give a supersonic fighter all-weather short takeoff and landing (STOL) performance while also enhancing up-and-away maneuverability. Significant reductions in both takeoff and landing distances, compared with the unmodified F-15, have been measured. The additional pitch control power of thrust vectoring has been demonstrated up to 30° angle of attack. The effectiveness of up-and-away reversing has been identified. First, major flight test results are presented and then lessons learned from this integration program are dis- cussed. 1991 SAE Transactions Section 1 912006. (P-246) Update of the X-29 hlgh-angle-of-attack pro- gram. Gary A. Trippensee, NASA Ames Research Center. The X-29A forward-swept wing flight research aircraft flight envelope was expanded to 66°-angle of attack in 1990. This work was accomplished at the NASA Dryden Flight Research Facility in Edwards, California, using Grumman aircraft and United States Air Force personnel assistance. The flight envelope expan- sion was accomplished through a carefully planned buildup approach using the number 2 X-29 aircraft and a well docu- mented high-angle-of-attack database established from wind- tunnel results, radio controlled subscale drop model results, and from previous X-29 aircraft number 1 flight data below 22.5°- angle of attack. Following the flight envelope expansion, a mili- tary utility evaluation was conducted to investigate the tactical utility of the X-29 configurations at high-angle-of-attack, slow- speed flight conditions. This paper provides an overall manage- ment view and perspective of the expansion process, the techni- cal problems encountered, and the results obtained when com- pared to the initial predictions. Initially, emphasis was placed on aerodynamic parameter identification for the flight envelope expansion process and simu- lation studies preceding each research flight. However, the approach of using only parameter identification to update the simulation's aerodynamic database has to be altered significantly because of concerns when aircraft performance differed signifi- cantly from expectations. The technique was changed to allow the aircraft to lead the simulation results. Better aircraft controlla- bility was encountered when compared to the initial simulation studies up to 45°-angle of attack with a slow -speed flight envelope virtually free of wing rock. The X-29 aircraft proved to have slow- speed high-angle-of-attack flying qualities equal to or better than some of the current day United States high-performance aircraft. 912008. (P-246) An economic approach to accurate wing design. Tuncer Cebeci and John E. King, Aerospace Engrg. Dept., California State Univ. An interactive boundary-layer method is described for com- puting three-dimensional transonic flows on wing/body configu- rations. The method combines Euler solutions with viscous flow solutions obtained from an inverse boundary-layer method with an interaction law based on the extension of the Hilbert integral formulation used for two-dimensional flows. Depending on the complexity of the flowfield, two versions of Keller's box scheme are used, the regular box scheme in regions of positive crossflow and no separation, and the characteristic box scheme in regions of negative crossflow and flow separation. Preliminary calculations performed for a modern transport wing show good agreement with experimental data and indicate that wing/body configurations in transonic flows can be analysed with good accuracy with this method at substantial savings of computer time. 235</page><page sequence="235">912009-912023 912009. (P-246) Flow field around thick delta wing with rounded leading edge. Yoshiji Nakajima , Yoshiyuki Nakao, Yoshiaki Na kam ura, and Michiru Yasuhara, Dept. of Aeronauti- cal Engrg., Nagoya Univ. A thick delta wing with a rounded leading edge has been exper- imentally studied. To understand the basic flow field of such a wing, experiments have been conducted in low speed wind tunnel at Nagoya University. Three types of flow visualization: oil flow, smoke wire, and tuft methods are employed, and forces: lift and drag, and pressure distributions were also obtained. The same test has been conducted for a thin delta wing for comparison. The results show the different flow field of the thick delta wing from those commonly known for delta wings. However, in other properties except for the flow pattern, similarities were observed between the thick delta wing and thin delta wing. 912010. (P-246) Aerodynamic development of boundary layer control system for NAL QSTOL research aircraft "ASKA". Junichi Miyasita , Kawasaki Heavy Industries, Ltd.; Hirotoshi Fujieda, Hitoshi Takahashi, and Yoshito Miyamoto, National Aerospace Lab.; Kenji Sakai, Kawasaki Heavy Industries, Ltd.; and Yoshio Morito, Mitsubishi Heavy Industries Ltd. "ASKA" developed by National Aerospace Laboratory (NAL) is a quiet, short take-off and landing (QSTOL) research aircraft adopting upper surface blowing (USB) concept as a powered high lift system. To achieving sufficient STOL performance by aug- menting stall angle of attack and roll control power, blowing BLC technique was applied to the outboard leading edges and ailerons. Supplied high pressure air to save the BLC piping space, the BLC system which was fit for use of high pressure air was developed. The BLC system, in which BLC air is discharged by a series of discrete jets from small drilled holes (0.8-3.0 mm in diameter) arranged in a raw, is one of the unique features of the aircraft. In this paper, the summaries of aerodynamic development of the BLC system are described except for the air piping system. 912011. (P-246) Development of high performance carbon- carbon composite by pulse chemical vapor infiltration technique. Jun Gotoh, Hirotoshi Nakayama, Mamoru Imuta, Akihito Sakai, and Naoki Kitamori, Kawasaki Heavy Industries, Ltd. To develop high performance carbon-carbon composite, pre- liminary practices of SiC infiltration into monolithic porous car- bon and carbon-carbon composite preforms were performed using pulse chemical vapor infiltration process, in which the con- centration of CH3SÍCI3 was fixed at 4.5mol%. The preferable conditions for the porous carbon preforms were determined as follows: reaction temperature of 1173K and holding time of 1.5sec. for the preform which has 29vol% poros- ity and 0.2 to 0.5p,m average pore diameter, 1273K and 2.0sec. for that which has 45vol% and 10 to 40p,m. Using the preferable condition, SiC matrix was deposited ini- tially around the center of thickness and finally over the full thickness of the porous carbon preforms. In case of the porous carbon-carbon composite preforms, SiC matrix infiltration was also observed at three temperatures of 1173K, 1273K and 1373K. 65vol% of initial porosity was infiltrated with B-SiC in the condition of 1373K and 1.5sec.. 912014. (P-246) Numerical simulation of a supersonic jet impingement on a ground. Nobuyuki Tsuboi and A. Koichi Hayashi, Nagoya Univ.; Kazuo Arashi, Churyo Engineering Co., Ltd.; Masaru Kodama, Mitsubishi Heavy Industries, Ltd.; and Toshi Fujiwara, Nagoya Univ. An impingement of axisymmetric supersonic jet on the ground is simulated numerically to evaluate the jet flow configu- ration on the gound, which inclines from 0 to 45 degrees, with a real gas assumption for two-dimensional simulations and with an ideal gas assumption for three-dimensional simulations. A solid particle-suspended two-phase jet impinging on the ground is also solved using the Euler equations for the solid particle-phase with a real gas assumption. An explicit TVD-Upwind scheme is used for the gas-phase and an explicit flux vector splitting upwind scheme for the solid-phase. Numerical results of a vertically impinging jet to the ground show that a plate shock forms just above the ground for the cases of the single-phase and two-phase jet. Then the jet flow is curved along the ground after hitting the ground to form the so-called wall jet, which is expanded and recompressed alternately along the ground. The solid particles hit and stay on the ground in the present system. When the ground inclines, the gas temperature at the stagnation point becomes high due to solid particles. An experimental study of the underexpanded axisymmetric supersonic N2 jets impinging on a ground which inclines from 0 to 45 degrees is also discussed. Pressure measurements on the ground surface and Schlieren photometries are performed to investigate the impinging jets. The results show that the maxi- mum pressure on the inclined ground is larger than that on the perpendicular ground due to the possibility of high pressure recoveries through multiple shock systems. 1991 SAE Transactions Section 1 912020. (P-246) Aerodynamic characteristics near the tip of a finite wing by a panel method. Yoshiyuki Nakao, Yoshiaki Naka - mura, Michiru Yasuhara, Yoshiji Nakajima, and Jangsoo Choi, Dept. of Aeronautical Engrg., Nagoya Univ.; and Yushiyuki Sugi- yam a, Dept. of Aeronautical engrg., Nagoya Univ. The aerodynamic characteristics around a wing tip are investi- gated with a first order panel method. The geometry chosen for the study is a rectangular wing of aspect ratio 8.43, with RAF6 airfoil of 10% thickness ratio. The panel method gives similar aerodynamic characteristics to experimental ones even near the tip, such as a dominant suction pressure distribution present near the trailing edge around the tip, and the increase in the local lift and drag at the very narrow region of the tip. These properties are caused by the strong spanwise velocity component around the wing tip, the inviscid effects of which are described in detail, with respect to pressure coefficient, local lift and drag coefficients, downwash, and vorticity on the wing. 912021. (P-246) Aero-structural integrated design of forward swept wing. Junichi Miyakawa, Mitsubishi Heavy Industries, Ltd.; and Takeshi Ohnuki and Nobuhiko Kamiya, National Aero- space Lab. Forward swept wing (FSW) is known to have excellent perfor- mance relative to aft swept wing. The practical application, how- ever, has been limited due to its structural divergence characteris- tics. The current progress in materials, especially anisotropic composites has opened up new future for FSW. This paper describes design study of FSW for transonic transport looking for high drag divergence performance. Inverse code is applied to FSW aerodynamic design to achieve isobar design concept. The performance is verified by transonic wind tunnel test. The paper also mentions the development of aero-structural integrated design tool, a combination of aerodynamic analysis code and structural analysis code, which is essential to FSW wing develop- ment. 912023.

Toshiba Co. has developed a ground test facility capable of dissi- pating a 5kw heat load and tested the components of that facility since 1988.

For the experimental study, the above-mentioned ground test facility was used. In this facility, heat is finally dissi- pated to the heat exchanger using brine as a heat sink. In order to determine static behaviors for an actual radiator heat rejection system used in orbit, numerical simulation was carried out. To confirm the analytical model used in the numerical simula- tion, the numerical result and the experimental result were com- pared. 912024. (P-246) Demonstration of gas liquid separation under the microgravity by aircraft KC-135. Osamu Muragishi and Seiji Nishio, Kawasaki Heavy Industries, Ltd. Liquid reservation and liquid-gas separation system is an important factor in a thermal control system and an environmen- tal control system of spacecraft. A surface tension tank is one of the important device in the system. A functional model and par- tial models were fabricated and their behavior verification tests were conducted under the microgravity. The experiment was conducted in NASA KC-135 reduced gravity plane in 1991 January. Expelling function was verified with a functional model. The tank has channels with fine mesh screen and expels liquid only. The expelled distilled water is returned into the tank again, the ratio of liquid to gas is kept constant, and the flow rate of the dis- charged water is a parameter. The liquid behavior was recorded on video tape and acceleration data was recorded on a data recorder. As a result liquid-gas separation was perfectly achieved in any phase of the parabolic flight, namely under the high-G to micro-G environment, and it was verified that the functional model has the required function. In the partial model experiment, four transparent acrylic spherical tanks were prepared. They had some imitation struc- tures as essential parts of the surface tension tank inside and were half-filled with water. The liquid behaviors were recorded on video tape. By the analysis of video, useful data about behaviors of liquid around imitation channels and fine mesh screen surface was obtained for tank designing. 912025. (P-246) Experimental and numerical studies of radia- tion emission from high-temperature air behind 10 km/s shock waves. H ir oki H on m a, Chiba Univ.; and Hiroyuki lizuka, Mitsu- bishi Atomie Power Industries, Inc. In order to estimate the exact heat transfer from shock-heated air to the re-entering space vehicles, one needs the accurate understanding of its radiative characteristics. The 10 km/s shock waves are produced by a free-piston, dou- ble-diaphragm shock tube, and the total and spectral-resolved radiation intensities of the shocked air are observed by using an image converter camera and a pair of photomultipliers. The numercial analysis is carried out for one-dimensional, steady hypersonic flows with non-equilibrium chemical reactions of hot air, including the evaluation of radiation intensity. The double-peak characteristic of radiation intensity for the Shockwaves above 10 km/s and the time-lag of radiation peak for different wave length are experimentally observed and qualita- tively reproduced in numerical simulation. 912026. (P-246) Multidimensional Euler/Navier-Stokes anal- ysis for hypersonic equilibrium gas. Takuji Kishimoto, Kawasaki Heavy Industries, Ltd. Numerical simulations of hypersonic flow around a 2-D cylin- der and a 3-D complete reentry vehicle have been carried out by solving Euler/Navier-Stokes equations which incorporate the equation of state for an equilibrium gas. The governing equations are solved by an implicit finite volume TVD (total variation diminishing) upwind scheme using a two-equation turbulence model for a viscous flow. Curve-fits for the thermodynamic and transport properties of an equilibrium air are adopted in order to estimate real gas effects. Convective fluxes are calculated by the Roe's approximate Riemann solver generalized for an equilib- rium gas. The results of hypersonic flow analysis using this code suggest us that the real gas effects, such as chemical reaction, are not negligible to predict the hypersonic flow characteristics accu- rately. 912029. (P-246) A calculation of penetration of the jet issuing normally into a cross flow across a wall boundary layer. Yoshiyuki Sugiyama, Nagoya Univ. An increase in jet penetration due to the wall boundary layer is determined in the flow field including an aerodynamic interfer- ence between the wall boundary layer and the jet. The aerody- namic effect of the wall boundary layer is replaced by that of a secondary vortex filament resulting from vorticity in the wall boundary layer. A differential equation governing the increase in jet penetration is derived using the circulation around the sec- ondary vortex filaments, its induced velocity and the empirical decay law of the jet axial velocity along the jet centerline. The cir- culation around the secondary vortex filament is estimated according to Hawthorne's theory and expressed in terms of aero- dynamic characteristics of the wall boundary layer. A numerical example of the present analysis shows a fairly good agreement with the experiment. This indicates that the used vortex flow model simulates the real flow conditions well. 912032. (P-246) A simplified-model approach to group com- bustion of fuel spray. Toyohiko Suzuki, Tattori Univ.; Yoshitaka Ochiai and Seiichi Tanabe, Tottori Univ.; and Yuzuru Ohmori, Toyota Motor Corp. Combustion of a liquid fuel spray distributed in a uniform stream was analyzed with a distributed source model. In this model, each fuel droplet of the spray is expressed mathematically by the moving source, of which the strength is to be determined by the relevant governing equations and boundary conditions. The main equation is an integral equation which expresses the inter-relation among strengths of fuel droplets in the spray. Given the assumptions of a uniform velocity of the stream and zero- relative velocity of fuel droplets, the spatial variation of the drop- let radii can be expressed by a differential equation with respect to a spatial coordinate y. Thus, the set of coupled equations can be solved numerically and iteratively. The nature of the distributed spray combustion in the convective flow is seen to be governed by two non- dimensional parameters, known to be group combustion num- bers. 912033. (P-246) Avionics flight systems for the 21st century. Richard A. Peal, Boeing Commercial Airplane Group. Technology has been the key to advancements in commercial transport airplane avionic systems over the past several decades. These advancements have included discrete operational improvements to existing functions and the addition of new air- borne functions with the goal of improving economics, mainte- nance, and safety of flight. Technology in the 1990s will support new functions as well as multifunction integration. For commercial transport avionics it will bring economic, performance, maintenance, and safety bene- fits that have never before been achievable. Standardization, chip-level redundancy, modularization, and fault-tolerant designs will revolutionize the basic concepts for system design. Until now, most efforts to develop and apply technology advancements were carried on in a "federated" system atmo- sphere where even major functions of the total system were designed and developed without considering interfacing system functions. Today, however, integrated system architectures and functional partitioning possible with new technology require that overall transportation system operation and performance requirements be defined before we proceed with development of 237</page><page sequence="237">912033-912044 design and performance specifications for discrete system func- tions. Similarly, the "charters" of organizations responsible for the design, operation, and control of the 21st century transporta- tion system - developed in the federated environment - must be revamped to support early definition of system-level require- ments. 1991 SAE Transactions Section 1 912036. (P-246) Functional mock-up tests for flight control system of the NAL QSTOL research aircraft "ASKA". Akira Tada, Tadao Uchida, Toshio Oga w a, and Noriaki Okada, National Aerospace Lab.; Hideyuki Yamato -, University of Tokyo ; Isoroku Ucikawa, Kawasaki Heavy Industries, Co. Ltd.; and Yasuro Takeuchi, Shinmeiwa Industries, Co. Ltd. Control system functional mock-up tests were conducted with ASKA, a quiet short take-off and landing aircraft. Simulation was effectively simplified by omitting the control system right half side and shortening the system's straight sec- tions. Characteristic differences were compensated for by chang- ing cable tension, with simulation "fidelity" being sufficient to check each area of concern. All test measurements were precisely taken, and a "filtering sampler," an anti-aliasing device/ technique, was newly designed and used for digital data acquisi- tion. The mock-up tests significantly contributed to the control sys- tem development by providing data to refine the stability and control augmentation system, by enabling accomplishment of system and component clearance tests, by determining unex- pected phenomena, and by allowing performance of experimen- tal studies on possible critical problems. 912037. (P-246) A rational approach to high-reliability, high- performance, low-cost spaceborne data management systems. Lynn S. Diamant, IBM Japan, Ltd. There is a trend in modern space systems to contain as much of the data processing function in the spaceborne component as possible. This relieves much of the operational burden of the ground support systems, but places inordinate requirements on the spaceborne systems. Future systems will need orders of mag- nitude improvements in processing power, reliability/availability and function while requiring equal decreases in cost, weight and power consumption. These considerations will shape the technol- ogies and architectures of spaceborne data processing systems for the foreseeable future. 1991 SAE Transactions Section 1 912039.

Four specific areas are being studied; sensing, alerting, crew response and crew decision making. The objective of Phase I was to identify system concepts that would provide for accurate, timely, and complete guidance to the flight crew for their use in responding to inflight smoke and fire events within the pressurized fuselage.

(P-246) Spectrogram diagnosis of aircraft disasters. F. W. Slingerland, National Research Council of Canada. Impulsive forces applied to an aircraft fuselage generate radial vibration waves in the structure analogous to those in a classical thin shell. It has been found that these waves are detected by the cockpit area microphone, and that spectrogram analysis of the microphone recording can provide information on the nature, origin and strength of the source, whether an explosion or a sud- den decompression. 1991 SAE Transactions Section 1 912042. (P-246) On the possibility of freezing and sticking phenomena in a transport during the ground taxiing and takeoff run and on the preventions of the hazard. Kingo Taksawa, National Aerospace Lab.; and Mitsuo Saka, Japan Air System Co., Ltd. An analytical study on the freezing and sticking phenomena of slush on the horizontal tail surfaces of YS-11 a twin turboprop transport, in the ground taxiing and the succeeding takeoff run phase was conducted. A simple analytical model describing out- flows of heat from slush to the surrounding airflow through the boundary layer, both conductive and accompanied by evapora- tion, was proposed. Influences upon the heat transfer rate caused by meteorological and operational conditions, were evaluated. Under an illustrative climatic condition experienced in airline operations in winter seasons in Japan, outflows of heat enough to stick the elevators were predicted. One of the large operators of YS-lls, Japan Air System Co., Ltd. (JAS) which had been worried about the related problems, took measures to enhance safety operation and introduced the type II ADS (Aircraft De-icing Solution) with two steps treat- ment. The operational experiences and test results, knowledges, collected by pilots interviews at the introduction of the type II ADS, column force data and pilot comments under wide variety of conditions are described. 912043. (P-246) Shock interaction induced by two hemisphere- cylinders. Tetsya Nagashima, Kiyoshi Tsuboi, Yoshiaki Naka- mura, and Michiru Yasuhara, Dept. of Aeronautical Engrg., Nagoya Univ. When shock impinges on the bow shock ahead of a blunt body, the shock-shock interaction occurs. Such interactions are classi- fied into six patterns by Edney. In the present research we selected an interaction referred to as Type IV, where the imping- ing shock was generated by another blunt body. It is well known that pressure and heat transfer are greatly increased at the impinging point. We measured the pressure dis- tributions along the body surface where shock impinges. Then, we performed numerical simulations to investigate the heat transfer rate and the interaction pattern, though it is two- dimensional for simplicity. We employed the FVS, Flux Vector Splitting, method to solve the Navier-Stokes equations. From the numerical simulations, the clear interaction pattern was obtained and it was found that this pattern is an unstable phenomenon. 912044. (P-246) Aerodynamic heating in three-dimensional shock wave/turbulent boundary layer interaction induced by sweptback sharp fins in hypersonic flows. Shouzo Maekawa, Kyushu Univ.; Masanori Hayashi, Nishinippon Institute of Tech- nology; and Shigeru Aso, Kyushu Univ. For the fundamental study of aerodynamic heating of winged vehicle and space planes in hypersonic flow the detailed structure of three-dimensional shock wave/turbulent boundary layer inter- action region induced by sweptback sharp fins are investigated carefully by oil flow technique and pressure distribution. The major objectives of the present study are to study the effects of the shape of the leading edge of the fin to the flow fields on the body and to study the effect of the sweep angle of the leading edge of the fin to the interaction region. Also aerodynamic heating phenomena in the flow fields are investigated by using a new technique. For the measurements a new method of measuring heat flux developed by the present authors are used. The new method is based on a new type of thin-film heat transfer gauge with high spatial resolution and fast response. The results suggest the effects of the shape of the leading edge to the flow fields are quite significant and the sweep of the leading edge of the fin to freestream is quite important to reduce the interaction region. 238</page><page sequence="238">912045-912050 912045. (P-246) Numerical simulations of hypersonic real-gas flows over space vehicles. Masahiro Nakao, Mitsubishi Heavy Industries, Ltd.; and Kozo Fujii, Institute of Space and Astronau- tical Science. Hypersonic flows over simple 3-D bodies and a space vehicle are simulated using a real-gas Navier-Stokes code under an equi- librium air assumption. This code is based on 3-D upwind flux splitting scheme with generalized Roe's Riemann solver. The real-gas effect is incorporated using the VEG (variable equivalent gamma) method. The equivalent gamma and other thermody- namic properties are calculated using empirical curve fits. Numerical simulations are conducted for flow fields around a spherical blunt body, a spherical-nose cylinder, and a cone- cylinder as simple configurations, and HOPE (H-orbiting plane: Japanese spaceplane) as a practical plane configuration. Flow conditions are Mach numbers of 7.72, 15.0 for the blunt bodies, 6.86 for the cone-cylinder, and 15.0 for the HOPE. Computed pressure and density distributions are presented. Results for sim- ple configuration cases are compared with experimental data for the code validation. 912046. (P-246) Impact response of composite LJHB propeller blades. Nobuo Takeda, University of Tokyo ; and Reimon Kobayashi and Yoshifumi Kawakami, Sumitomo Precision Prod- ucts Co., Ltd. Resistance capability of composite rectangular plates com- posed of CFRP, GFRP and their hybrid were surveyed to investi- gate their applicability to UHB propeller blades. Intralamina hybrid of CFRP and GFRP specimen was found promising. Impact testing on the rectangular and flat blade composite speci- men supported in cantilever with projectiles made of teflon was performed to determine the relative resistance performance and also to obtain the time history of strain on the specimens. With- out assuming the time history of load, impact analyses using DYNA3D, a FEM program, were made at the same condition as the experiments to investigate the applicability of the impact analysis to simulate impact testing. The comparison of the analy- sis and the experiment was reasonably good and the applicability of the analysis method to predict responses of composite blades to impact was promised. 912047. (P-246) An analysis of the effect of centrifugal force on the impact Resistance of composite fan blades for turbo-fan engines. Toshio Miyachi, Hidehito Okumura, and Kunihiko Ohtake, National Aerospace Lab. An analysis has been conducted to determine the feasibility of composite fan blade for meeting impact resistance requirements for turbo-fan engines. This report describes the effect of centrifugal force on the impact response of fan blades. Transient deformations of six fan blade models of different materials and sizes generated by bird strike were calculated by finite element method. It was cleared that global deformation of the blade made of heavy material was appreciably reduced by centrifugal force, but the effect of centrifugal force on the local deformation was small. For the blade made of light materials, e.g. polymer matrix com- posites, the effect of centrifugal force is less appreciable than for the blade made of heavy materials. Maximum stress generated by 1.5 lb (680 gram) bird strike is large enough to generate local permanent deformation in the metal blades and to generate global delamination in the polymer matrix composite blades. 912048. (P-246) Finite element analysis of flexural edge wave for composite fan blades. Masahiro Fukuda, Takashi Nakamura, Hidehito Okumura, Kunihiko Ohtake, and Toshio Miyachi, National Aerospace Lab. A geometrically nonlinear finite element analysis of flexural edge waves for the composite jet engine fan blade model is pres- ented. For the transient response problem of the composite fan blade subjected to local impact loading with foreign objects, exis- tence of flexural edge wave in the region of the leading edge and the trailing edge was confirmed for the first time in computer sim- ulation. Amplitudes of edge wave decrease exponentially with distance from the edge. These waves have dispersive characteris- tic even at low frequencies and are important in the region of the leading edge and the trailing edge of composite blade structures. It was found that delaminations of the leading edge in experimen- tal results for ATP (advanced turboprop) blade model presented in the literature were related to this edge wave propagation along the free boundary. And also it was clear that just after the impact, higher order flexural waves are generated owing to local deformations. These higher order waves possess dispersive property related to impact position, impactor's velocity, contact area with foreign objects, contact time etc. The higher order wave is one of the dominant factors on complicate impact fracture mechanism of composite structures. 1991 SAE Transactions Section 1 912049. (P-246) EXEPS: an expert system for simulating air- craft electric power systems. Robert Glass, Waleed Said, and James Thorn, Sundstrand Aerospace. An expert system shell called EXpert Electric Power Simulator (EXEPS) has been implemented to simulate the behavior of air- craft electric power generating systems (EPGSs). The purpose of the tool is to verify the requirements of the power system's circuit breaker control logic before any hardware or software is devel- oped. Previous to the creation of this tool, manual analysis or costly test stand debug was used to verify the performance of the cuircuit breaker control logic. By using expert system technology, a highly effective power system simulator has been developed that can provide the detailed system responses needed to verify that the implemented designs will meet the customer perfor- mance requirements. 912050. (P-246) Electric power generating system for the Boe- ing 777 airplane. John V. Burns, Sundstrand Electric Power Sys- tems; and Carl B. Tenning, Boeing Commercial Airplane Group. The electric power system chosen for the Boeing 111 is an example of the advances seen in response to market demands for superior performance and reliability. The main electric system includes two engine-driven integrated drive generators, a genera- tor driven by the auxiliary power unit, three generator control units, and a bus power control unit. A backup electric system independent of the main system provides the redundancy of elec- trical sources equivalent to a three-engine airplane, considering the axuiliary power unit inoperative. Both systems are automated to minimize crew workload. The highly automated features of the 111 aircraft are enhanced by the equally sophisticated control units of the electrical power system. The state-of-the-art, microprocessor-based control units use a high-level software language to provide control and protec- tion for the system, along with an elaborate built-in-test (BIT) capability. Each control unit has two-way communication through a newly developed ARINC 629 communication bus. In addition to providing monitoring and built-in test information to the central aircraft information management system (AIMS) computer, an automatic checklist in each unit reports the real-time status of all main ac electrical power system control switches across the ARINC 629 communication bus for display in the flight deck. 239</page><page sequence="239">912051-912059 912051. (P-246) 270-Vdc/hybrid 115-Vac electric power gen- erating system technology demonstrator. Richard E. Niggemann, Steve Peecher, and Greg Rozman, Sundstrand Aerospace Opera- tions. Sundstrand is investigating 270-Vdc/hybrid 115-Vac electrical power generating and distribution systems technology so as to be well prepared to offer such systems for future aircraft applictions. The approach taken has been to design, build, and test a represen- tative system that meets or exceeds the tightest of the perfor- mance standards as defined by military standards. This paper describes a single-channel, 120-kW hybrid system and presents some typical performance data. The dc bus supplies a 30-kVA, 400-Hz, 115-Vac inverter; constant power load banks of up to 150 kW; and a resistive load bank of up to 90 kW. System simulation studies indicated the potential for unstable operation due to the negative impedance of the constant power load in conjunction with the source ripple filter and the load EMI filters. Unstable voltage and current were observed in system testing when the magnitude of the sorce impedance was not suffi- cently below that of the load impedance. Plans for installing a sec- ond channel along with an electromechanical actuator and a large vapor-cycle cooling system as active loads are also discussed. 912052. (P-246) Feasibility study on a microwave-powered unmanned aerial vehicle for the communication relay utilization. Kingo Takasawa , National Aerospace Lab. Since 1987, the NAL Tokyo has conducted the system defini- tion study and some components tests to investigate the feasibil- ity of 2 types of unmanned aerial vehicles; microwave-powered unmanned aerial vehicle (MPUAV) for communication relay uti- lizations, and chemical energy powered unmanned aerial vehicle (CEPUAV), with very long range capability for the earth observa- tion utilizations. Here MPUAVs which also need chemical energy in climbing phase are described. The research on energy transmission by microwave has con- ducted in some universities, CRL (communications research lab- oratory) and industries, in both transmitting and receiving tech- nologies. With the extensive use of a simple CAD program for MPUAVs, a configuration of 400kg all up mass and a 30m wing span is proposed, under the tentatively supposed specifications of microwave transmitted DC power supply. A scenario to develop and verify necessary technologies by scale model Eight tests at low altitude is proposed. 912053.

Takashi Ishikawa, Yoichi H ay a s hi, Masamichi Matsushima, and Kingo Takasawa, National Aerospace Lab.; and Tetsuo Sato, Fuji Industries, Ltd. The basic concept of unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) powered by microwave is defined first by specially developed CAD soft- ware. Tele-communication relay or earth observation platform is its possible application. Some preliminary research programs including propeller efficiency, electric power plant, basic struc- tural concepts and materials testings are undergoing at NAL. The present paper desmonstrates the results of a structural concept study and early strength characterization at room and low (= -60°C) temperature points for a system of CF/thermoplastic com- posite as one of candidate material of main structures. The con- cerned strength drop due to a wide difference of low temperature environment from the processing point of CF/PEEK cannot be observed. 912054. (P-246) High altitude lighter-than-air powered plat- form. Masahiko Onda and Yasushi Morikawa, Ministry of Inter- national Trade and Industry. To tackle global environmental problems, the acquisition of plentiful and precise data is necessary, and a means of conducting long-lasting high-resolution measurements over broad areas is required. A feasibility study has been made on a high-altitude (about 20km), super-pressured, and helium-filled PLTA (pow- ered lighter-than-air) vehicle as an ideal platform for environ- mental observation. It has a long service life and carries a larger pay load than an artificial satellite. This PLTA platform, named HALROP (high altitude long range observational platform), uses a solar-powered electric propulsion system to maintain its posi- tion in space against wind currents. The solar power is acquired from solar cells. For night use, solar energy is stored in regenera- tive fuel cells. This study examines energy balance and provides a structural analysis of the vehicle. 1991 SAE Transactions Section 1 912056. (P-246) Experimental and numerical study of aerody- namic characteristics for second generation SST. Kenji Yoshida and Kenji Hayama, Kawasaki Heavy Industries Ltd. Recently the programs for the development of the second gen- eration SST are presented by several industries. On the aerody- namic design of SST, it is very important to improve a cruise L/D. So we have investigated the effects of three typical drag reduction technologies, namely, the application of a suitable wing planform, a warped wing and an area-ruled body, by using both experimental and numerical approaches. The obtained results are as follows. The increment of the cruise L/D is about 0.1 for an arrow planform, 0.6 for a warped wing and 0.5 for an area-ruled body. So we deduce that our SST configuration has the L/D of about 8.6 at cruise Mach number 2.0, including some corrections on the Reynolds number, fuselage volume, etc. And applying our Navier-Stokes calculation code for our testing models, we find that the CFD code is very useful to predict the characteristics at design conditions. 1991 SAE Transactions Section 1 912058. (P-246) Integrated wiring system. Victor E. Saucedo, Lockheed Advanced Development Co. The measure of success in any organization is directly associ- ated with its ability to provide quality communication. Engineering organizations are no exception. Today's innova- tive and technically competent engineer has virtually unlimited opportunity to develop ideas and designs into quality products in minimum time through the powerful communication tool of concurrent engineering. The integrated wiring system (IWS) was Lockheed's first com- puter integrated engineering, manufacturing, and support system. This computer-based system features a single-source data base that is used for all design, documentation, fabrication, and testing of aircraft wiring. This single-source data base ensures that items are manufactured to match all engineering specifications. This application of concurrent engineering minimizes the transmittal of errors; reduces the time required for design, plan- ning and mockup; ensures a coordinated effort among the affected divisions; and, provides high quality documentation. This is an example of quality communication that can be applied to virtually any engineering endeavor. 912059. (P-246) Auxiliary power units for current and future aircraft. Colin Rodgers, Sundstrand Power Systems. Current gas turbine auxiliary power units (APUs) for aircraft main engine starting and secondary power operation are config- ured with pneumatic and electric links, and in some applications with a direct shaft power link. Respective examples are the pneu- matic/electric link used in the S-70B helicopter and the shaft power link in the FSX fighter aircraft. Future high performance aircraft will require more compact and lighter weight APUs. These APUs will require higher thermal efficiency and durable self-sufficient secondary power equip- 240</page><page sequence="240">912059-912065 ment, capable of reliable faster starting over a wider aircraft oper- ating range. Gas turbine auxiliary power design configurations and tech- nology requirements to meet these objectives are examined here for both commercial and military aircraft applications. The trend from existing APUs supplying mixed pneumatic and electric power outputs for main engine starting, environmen- tal control, and electrical services, to all-electric output is paced by high speed starter/generator technology and accessory drive requirements. Extended operating range aircraft, plus secondary power sys- tem growth and the effect upon main engine operating economics also influence the continuous duty APU option. This paper discusses the impact of these and other emerging application trends on APU system design. It presents candidate solutions with associated technology improvements for continu- ing research into the next century. 912060. (P-246) Space shuttle orbiter auxiliary power unit sta- tus. Max Reck, Sundstrand Aerospace Systems; Tim Bauch , STS Corp.; G. Loken , J. Horton , and W. Lukens , Sundstrand Aero- space Systems; J. Baughman, Rockwell International ; and W. Scott, NASA Johnson Space Center. The United States space shuttle orbiter auxiliary power unit (APU) provides power to the orbiter vehicle hydraulic system. The system operates critical flight functions during a mission including aerodynamic control surface actuation, space shuttle main engine thrust vector control, and landing gear deployment, steering, and braking. The APU was designed in the mid-1970s, then flight-certified in support of the approach and landing tests (ALTs) in 1977 and initial orbital flight tests (OFTs) in 1981. During APU design, development, and flight certification, it was necessary to develop a number of technology items representing the state of the art to meet the challenging requirements of space operation. Improve- ments in the APU are continuing to further enhance life and reli- ability. More than 1,500 hours of operating time have been accu- mulated during APU development, certification, and space shut- tle flights. The APU has successfully supported the more than 40 space shuttle orbital missions flown to date, and it continues to be the only flight-certified APU capable of man-rated space oper- ation. Sundstrand is contracted to provide the APU to the space division of Rockwell International for the orbiter vehicle. The space shuttle orbiter prime contract is administered by the NASA Johnson Space Center. 1991 SAE Transactions Section 1 912061. (P-246) Oscillation of oblique Shockwaves generated in a two dimensional asymmetric nozzle. Fumio Higashino and Shigeru Matsuo, Tokyo Noko Univ.; and Taro Tsuyuki, Ishikawa - jima-Harima Heavy Industry. The present work is aimed at experimentally investigating both the development and the oscillation phenomena of pseudo shock waves in a two dimensional asymmetric nozzle. A shock tube was used to generate supersonic flows in nozzles which con- sisted of both short and long walls diverging in the flow direction. Two kinds of nozzles were tested; one with both side walls of the nozzle diverging (Model A) and the other with only one side wall diverging (Model B). Nozzles were connected to a duct with cons- tant cross sectional area. Initial pressures in the test section were 25, 50, and 100 kPa and the initial flow Mach numbers, before the diverging section were about 1.2 for model A and 1.4 for model B. The flowfield in the supersonic nozzle was visualized sequentially by schlieren photographs to observe the develop- ment of a pseudo shock wave and also the unsteady motion of this shock wave oscillating in the flow direction. The oscillation frequencies were determined from pressure measurements by means of a piezo-pressure transducer fixed at different loci. It was found that an oblique shock wave appeared near the turning cor- ner of the diverging section owing to a separation vortex and then it developed into a pseudo shock wave. The supersonic flow that issued from the duct was not much expanded in the flow direc- tion and behaved like an underexpanded jet which was deflected toward the shorter wall of the nozzle. The oscillation frequency was not affected by the initial pressure. However, when the initial pressure was decreased, the osicllation amplitude was increased. 1991 SAE Transactions Section 1 912062. (P-246) Monte Carlo direct simulation of axisymmet- ric rarefied gas flows through thruster nozzles the spacecrafts. Masahiro Ota and Tetsuya Tanaka, Tokyo Metropolitan Univ. Axial symmetric flows of a monoatomic rarefied gas exhausted through the thruster nozzle of an artificial satellite were numerically simulated by the direct simulation Monte Carlo method, since the transitional flow regime occurs at altitudes where the enhancement region is several orders of magnitude larger than the nozzle throat diameter of the thruster (high alti- tude rocket). On macroscopic flows in the nozzle or the orifice, the effects of Knudsen numbers are revealed. At lower Knudsen number regions, the flows are more accelerated by the effects of intermo- lecular collisions. On the inside surface of the nozzle, macro- scopic velocity and temperature distributions are built up in the radial direction. At lower Knudsen number regions, the thickness of these boundary layers are getting thinner. 912063. (P-246) Numerical analysis of RCS jet in hypersonic flights. Yumiko Inoue, Nagoya Univ.; Sho Miyake and Tadashi Katsurahara, Mitsubishi Heavy Industries, Ltd.; and A. Koichi Hayashi and Toshi Fujiwar a, Nagoya Univ. A transversely injected jet into a hypersonic flow is simulated numerically in order to study the flow field of the injection jet in the hypersonic atmosphere, its heat flux on the body surface and the moments working on the body. The flowfields is governed by the two-dimensional Reynolds averaged full Navier-Stokes equa- tions with an algebraic eddy viscosity model developed by Bal- dwin-Lomax. The governing equations are solved using the Har- ten-Yee type TVD and central difference schemes to the convex and viscous terms, respectively. The real gas effect is considered in the numerical analysis. The jets injected across the main flows of Mach 10 and 15 are compared. 1991 SAE Transactions Section 1 912064. (P-246) Energy requirements for the space frontier. Henry W. Brandhorst, NASA Lewis Research Center. The future appears rich in missions that will extend the fron- tiers of knowledge, human presence in space, and opportunities for profitable commerce. Key to success of these ventures is the availability of plentiful, cost effective electric power and assured, low cost access to space. While forecasts of space power needs are problematic, an assessment of future needs based on terrestrial experience has been made. These needs fall into three broad cate- gories survival, self sufficiency and industrialization. The cost of delivering payloads to orbital locations from LEO to Mars has been determined and future launch cost reductions projected. From these factors, then, projections of the performance neces- sary for future solar and nuclear space power options has been made. These goals are largely dependent upon orbital location and energy storage needs. Finally the cost of present space power systems has been determined and projections made for future systems. 912065. (P-246) Electrical system options for space explora- tion. Robert W. Bercaw and Ronald C. Cull, NASA Lewis Research Center. The space exploration initiative (SEI) will need a wide variety of manned systems with requirements significantly different than those for existing systems. This paper discusses the need for a 241</page><page sequence="241">912065-912075 space power utility concept, and examines the impact of this con- cept on the engineering of space power systems. Almost all exist- ing space power systems distribute low voltage direct current. Although they have been very successful, increasing power sys- tem requirements in recent years have exposed their inherent limitations and led to the proposal of a number of alternatives including high voltage dc, and ac at various frequencies. This paper, drawing on the experience gained from space station free- dom and SEI systems studies, discusses the factors that may affect the choice of frequency standards on which to build such a space power utility. 912066. (P-246) Small Stirling dynamic isotope power system for multihundred-watt robotic missions. David J. Bents, NASA Lewis Research Center. Free-piston Stirling engine (FPSE) and linear alternator (LA) technology is combined with radioisotope heat sources to pro- duce a compact dynamic isotope power system (DIPS) suitable for multihundred-watt space applications which appears compet- itive with advanced radioisotope thermoelectric generators (RTGs). Unlike earlier DIPS concepts based on closed cycle Brayton conversion, the small Stirling DIPS is scaleable to multihundred- watt power levels or lower. The FPSE/LA convertor, which is not subject to the tip clearance to swept area scaling limitation of tur- bomachinery, remains a high efficiency convertor in sizes ranging from tens of kilowatts down to only a few watts. At multihun- dred-watt unit size, the FPSE can be directly integrated with the government-furnished general purpose heat source (GPHS) via radiative coupling; the resulting dynamic isotope power system has a size and weight that compares favorably with the advanced modular (mod) RTG, but requires less than a third the amount of isotope fuel. Thus the FPSE extends the high efficiency advan- tage of dynamic systems into a power range never previously con- sidered competitive for DIPS. This results in lower fuel cost and reduced radiological hazard per delivered electrical watt. Having successfully flown on several earlier space missions, free-piston Stirling technology has the potential to achieve, as an isotope engine, the high reliability that is required for years of unattended remote operation. Hermetically sealed inside a con- tainer, there are typically only two moving parts and no sliding seals of any kind. Incorporating noncontacting gas bearings or flexures, there is no wear between the moving parts. Terrestrially, Stirling engine convertors have demonstrated virtually unlimited service life - in test, one radioisotope heated unit has achieved over 110 000 hr continuous operation. On Mars the small Stirling DIPS offers the benefit of being able to operate exposed to the atmosphere without degradation. RTG's must be hermetically sealed inside a container to survive. For these reasons the small Stirling DIPS appears an economi- cal alternative to RTG's. When it is developed, it should prove to be a strong candidate to power the many multihundred-watt robotic missions anticipated within the next three decades for deep space and planet surface exploration. 912067. (P-246) A simulator study of a flight reference display for powered-lift STOL aircraft. Keiji Tanaka, Hiroyasu Kawa - hara, M asaru Nakamura, and Yushi Terui, National Aerospace Lab. The present study deals with a proposed flight reference dis- play for powered-lift STOL aircraft. The display design was aimed at providing pilots with new control cues for keeping its flight safety in low-speed and high-power approach. The display utilizes angle of attack, pitch angle and air-speed to indicate the flight reference for maintaining the flight safety margins. The dis- play integrates the flight reference into an analogue airspeed scale. Piloted simulation using a moving-base flight simulator was conducted to verify the display which was designed on the basis of the flight test results of "ASKA", the experimental STOL aircraft of National Aerospace Laboratory. The test results con- firmed that performance of the display was satisfactory for both flight reference tracking and safety margin monitoring, and proper values of coefficients of the display equations were obtained. Flight tests with the new display are scheduled to finally confirm the best combination of the coefficients which compro- mises sensitivity to change in safety margin with handling quali- ties of flight reference regulation. 1991 SAE Transactions Section 1 912069. (P-246) In-flight simulation of backside operating models using direct lift controller. Yukichi Tsukano, National Aerospace Lab.; Nagakatu Kawahata, Nihon Univ.; Masaki Komoda, Tokyo Metropolitan Institute of Technology; and Toshi - haru Inagaki, National Aerospace Lab. Effectiveness of a direct lift controller (DLC) for in-flight sim- ulation is discussed. When a model aircraft is operating in back- side of power curve, DLC is indispensable. On the basis of this, a quick-moving flaps are installed on the variable stability and response airplane (VSRA) of the National Aerospace Laboratory of Japan. Direct lift capability of the flaps are precisely identified. After tailoring adequate feedback/feed forward gains, a model- following system is constructed to simulate backside-operating models by a mother airplane which is operating in frontside. Included in the paper are the test results of flight verification, showing that a direct lift controller is helpful but not mandatory for simulating frontside-operating models, while it is mandatory for simulating backside-operating models with model-following error of acceptable level. As an application, a flight test result for simulated landing approach in backside range is shown. 1991 SAE Transactions Section 1 912071. (P-246) Aerospace plane hydrogen scramjet boosting. A. S.

Thrust, specific impulse and density impulse are calculated while adding nitrogen, oxygen, water or inert liquated gases. Fuel is injected tangentially to air flow into combustion chamber with high velocity through gas generator nozzles. For scramjet boosting in hypersonic flight it is suggested to add oxygen to stoichiometric part of hydrogen instead of exces- sive part of hydrogen. 1991 SAE Transactions Section 1 912075. (P-246) Socio-cultural issues during long duration space missions. Nick Kanas, University of California. Future space missions will involve multinational crews of men and women who will perform complicated tasks over long periods of time. Under these conditions, social and cultural facotrs will play a significant role in influencing crew morale, cohesiveness, and performance. Important socio-cultural issues include language differences between crew members, cultural and racial biases, gender stereotyping, and differences in career moti- vation. Negative aspects of these issues include the scapegoating and isolation of individuals who are seen as different from the rest of the crew; the formation of subgroups, which creates divi- siveness and unhealthy competition; the presence of interper- sonal tension, which leads to decreased cohesiveness and increased withdrawal and territorial behavior; and the displace- ment of tension and anger to colleagues and families on Earth, which leads to poor crew-ground communications. The negative impact of these socio-cultural factors can be minimized by paying attention to issues of compatibility during crew selection, by pre- flight training and sensitization to these issues, by in-flight moni- toring and support from the ground, and by post-flight debrief- 242</page><page sequence="242">912075-912085 ings that help space travelers deal with the sequelae of problems that might have emerged during the mission. 1991 SAE Transactions Section 1 912076. (P-246) Architectural studies relating to the nature of human body motion in microgravity. Regis S. Fauquet, Design Models, Inc.; and Jun Okushi, Okushi Architects. The absence of gravity in space alters what we take for granted on Earth. In microgravity the human body experiences signifi- cant postural and perceptual changes. From an architectural per- spective these transformations have profound epistemic implica- tions on the human/environment relationship. On Earth what binds every elements of space into a landscape is the invisibile force of gravity. It shapes and structures every- thing around us; and architecture has throughout the ages expressed the relationship between Human beings and their habi- tat in terms of post and lintel structures and their inherent recti- linear geometries. In space, however, the organizational geome- tries of architectural elements obey the laws of microgravity to form a spacescape or spacefield. In order to pursue design strate- gies sensible to the human condition in weightlessness it is neces- sary to assess in practical geometrical terms the interface mor- phology of human mobility in microgravity. Once a basic taxon- omy of human motions and their intrinsic geometries is estab- lished, it becomes possible to design a living habitat addressing in particular orientation, mobility and environmental interface issues. These ideas briefly mentioned here will be presented through several life size mock-up studies done between 1985 and 1988 at the Southern California Institute of Architecture and con- tinued more recently by the Space Projects Group in Japan and in California. If weightlessness can modify our bodily experiences, it will certainly lead our collective consciousness to new ways of know- ing. Thus, the physics of microgravity must be the primary guide- lines to designing crew accommodations for an orbital outpost. 912078. (P-246) Manual control of vehicles with time-varying dynamics. Norihiro Goto, Kyushu Univ.; and Hiroyuki Matsu- moto, Toshiba Co. An experiment was conducted to seek the models of the human pilot controlling a vehicle with time-varying dynamics manually. In the experiment the human pilot controlled basic first-order linear time-varying controlled elements in a compen- satory closed-loop fashion for step and random inputs. The anal- ysis of the experimental data has found that for the step input case the human pilot can be modeled as a stationary proportion- al-plus-integral controller, whereas for the random input case a stationary model with constant coefficients cannot describe the piloťs control behavior sufficiently well. A nonstationary time series analysis suggests that the human piloťs control behavior for the random input case is also time-varying; adapting his char- acteristics to the changing controlled element dynamics in such a manner that the error and output spectral characteristics do not make appreciable changes with respect to time. 1 991 SAE Transactions Section 1 912080. (P-246) Development of the DDV actuation system on the IDF aircraft. Yun-Kun Lee, Ming-Hwang Hsu, Chen-Yan Lai, and Bang-Dar Cheng, Aeronautical Research Lab., Chung Shan Institute of Science. The problems and challenges of designing the closed-loop elec- tronic control of a direct drive valve (DDV) actuator system are discussed. Advantages and disadvantages of the DDV concept compared to the electro-hydraulic valve (EHV) are outlined. Loop closure servoamplifier design, failure monitoring, current equalization, and testability of the DDV are also discussed. The Taiwanese indigenous defensive fighter (IDF) serves as the test- bed for the design, integration, and testing of one such DDV sys- tem. 1991 SAE Transactions Section 1 912081. (P-246) A design of strongly stabilizing controller. Shin Okazawa, Masayuki Suzuki, and Shohei Niwa , Nagoya Univ. It is often realized that the control system design utilizing modern state space theory produces unstable controllers. Such unstable controllers which should stabilize the plant theoreti- cally, do not really stabilize the plants when they are imple- mented. Unstable controllers are not preferable from the view point of robustness and safety. Even if an unstable controller can stabilize the plant, it works well only when it is operating with the original plant. When some accident occurs and the feedback loop is cut, unstable motion of controller brings the worst results. In the design of control system for many aerospace vehicles and space structures, classical design methods of compensator are not applicable and only the modern techniques can be utilized, where the number of states, inputs and outputs are very large. In such cases, controllers should include high dimensional complex dynamics. Therefore, the problem of strong stabilization i.e. the design of stable controller, is especially important for aerospace control problems. The purpose of this paper is to present a new convenient method to obtain a stable controller utilizing the quadratic stabi- lization techniques which is developed for the robust control sys- tem design. 912082. (P-246) A numerical study on the characters of laser- supported detonation wave. Take Oshima and Toshi Fujiwara, Nagoya Univ. Interesting physics and chemistry can happen in LSD wave, including a number of unkown phenomena. As it is impossible to take into account all the phenomena occurring in the process of laser-adsorption heating, a numerical simulation needs appro- priate assumptions. In this simulation four chemical reactions (elastic collision, inelastic collision, bremsstrahlung and inverse bremsstrahlung) are considered for simplicity. It is also assumed that the laser light is focused spherically and all the physical quan- tities are solved by one-dimensional spherical coordinate. The propellant gas used here is Argon, while the source laser is CO2 (wave length ' = 10.6|un). The problem is described by the two governing equations; the laser intensity equation and Euler equation. Once LSD wave is formed, large discontinuity appears at the shock front, so that several devices are required in order to delete the stiffness. The temperature of electron is separated from that of heavy-particle. Another device is the time-splitting technique: as chemical reac- tion is very stiff, it is separated from the flowfield. To control the time step, the characteristic time of each phenomenon is evalu- ated and accurate comparison is always made. In addition, the cutoff effect of plasma is considered and as a result we could simulate "galloping" phenomena. In this simulation the structure of LSD wave, the interaction between the two waves and the effect of the plasma cutoff are ana- lysed. 1991 SAE Transactions Section 5 912085. (P-246) Development of the liquid apogee propulsion system for ETS-VI. Hideyuki Kobayashi and Ideo Masuda, National Space Development Agency. The engineering test satellite VI (ETS-VI) is a 2 ton class geostationary satellite to be launched by the H-II launch vehicle in 1993. The liquid apogee propulsion system (LAPS) which is being developed for the ETS-VI is a pressure-fed, full blowdown bipropellant propulsion system using hydrazine and nitrogen- tetroxide (NTO) as propellants. During the engineering models (EMs) tests and the apogee kick engine (AKE) firing tests, several problems were encoun- tered but could be settled. Especially a thermal problem, which was encountered during the design verification test of the AKE 243</page><page sequence="243">912085-912100 was settled but adopting a unique method "the step-up blowdown scheme". In the LAPS program, not only the AKE but also other major components of the LAPS such as propellant tanks, 50 N class thruster, flowmeter, filter, bipropellant valve, fill-and-drain valve and pyrotechnic valves etc. were developed. This paper presents the outline of the development of the LAPS and technical accomplishments. 912093. The development to production of an integrated health and usage monitoring system for helicopters. Alastair C. Gordon, Bristow Helicopters Ltd. This paper starts with the reasons why Bristow Helicopters as an operator are at the forefront of putting together an integrated health and usage monitoring package. Bristows identifies its long history of design work introducing onto helicopters various major modifications culminating in the IHUMS programme. The paper goes on to deal with the need for health monitoring which is really the outcome of the HARP report. It discusses the trials that were conducted in three phases for the CAA and which led Bristows to believe they could package an integrated CVR/ FDR and health monitoring system together in time to meet the CAA's mandated FDR. The practical specification for the system is discussed and the argument for the need to integrate the system with flight data recording and cockpit voice recording. The opera- tion of the system is then discussed in some detail indicating how the generic nature of the system is accomplished and introducing the vital role of the groundstation and the interface in the ground station between the pilot and the engineer and the system as a whole. The paper goes onto discuss the problems of certification and of gaining manufacturers acceptance of the system on their aircraft, without which of course monitoring would never reach its full potential. The paper finishes with some ideas of future potential and the direction which Bristows believe IHUMS will develop. 912094. The development and integration of an engine moni- toring system for the F-14A=/D super Tomcat. Michele R. Nierenberg, Grumman Aircraft Systems Div.; and Andrew Hess, Naval Air Systems Command. This paper will provide an overview of the engine monitoring system developed for the Navy/Grumman F-14A+/D super Tomcat program. The design, integration and application of this system will be discussed, as well as the many benefits that have been realized through its use. Specific examples from F-14 devel- opment experience will be used to illustrate these topics. Lessons that were learned throughout the course of developing the F-14 engine monitoring system will also be presented, as the results of this experience are beneficial for future applications. 912095. Design considerations for a generic E.V.M. Sheryl Bailey-Smith, ENDEVCO. This paper discusses the design considerations for developing a generic engine vibration monitoring (EVM) unit which can be used for monitoring vibration on all gas turbine engines. The dis- cussion is geared toward large commercial airplane engines, but the EVM is capable of monitoring industrial and smaller engines also. The advantages of this generic EVM to airlines are fleet compatibility, reduction in spares and reduction in ground sup- port equipment. The input/output requirements and the hard- ware and software trade-off decisions is addressed. 912096. A general aviation flight simulation paradigm for the 21st century. David Lombardo, Bowling Green State Univ. Current civilian flight training programs are typically ill- prepared to train ab initio professional pilots for air carrier opera- tions. While there are numerous problems associated with the typical civilian training program, the proposed system addresses several of the training hardware related problems. This paper out- lines a paradigm for future civilian flight training that is divided into two phases of implementation. Phase I relies on a system which combines the emerging technology of the heavily depen- dent software-driven computer-based flight simulation (CBFS) and the more hardware depedent technology of flight training devices (FTD). Current technology exists to implement this ini- tial phase and only awaits manufacturer acceptance of the con- cept. Phase II outlines the future of flight simulation based on the further refined CBFS system combined with the emerging tech- nology of the highly sophisticated simulation capability of virtual reality (VR). This phase is dependent upon successful continu- ance of current reesearch and development in the area of virtual reality. Most of the fundamental components of both phases cur- rently exist in at least an unsophisticated prototype model. Implementation of a Phase II system could happen within the next ten years. 912097. Air traffic control simulation training. Deborah S. Bruce, Systems, Requirements and Services Association. Simulation training of air traffic controllers will undergo major changes in the next few years. Central to the selection of a new ATC simulation training system is the issue of fidelity, both physical and functional. On the one hand, a very high level of fidelity is required to conduct advanced training in simulation labs rather than in the operational environment. However, the cost, particularly in staff resources, of providing and maintaining this level of realism limits its application earlier phases of train- ing. This paper recommends that the future simulation training system provide levels of fidelity appropriate to the level of train- ing to which it is applied. This could be accomplished by either segmenting the capability of the full training system or through the provision of additional PC-based systems. 1991 SAE Transactions Section 1 912098. Why simulators are more difficult to fly than aircraft. Amnon Katz, University of Alabama. Simulators are typically more difficult to fly than the aircraft they represent. The factors involved include limited field of view, degraded visual acuity, scene distortion, absence of depth percep- tion, attenuation or absence of motion cues, and response delays that are often inconsistent among visual, motion, and instru- ments. It is suggested that for most training tasks the added diffi- culty because of these factors is not a drawback, and shold not be alleviated at the expense of dynamic fidelity. 1991 SAE Transactions Section 1 912099. Simulator scene detail and visual augmentation guid- ance in landing training forbeginning pilots. Henry L. Taylor, Gavan Lintern, Jefferson M. Koonce, Robert H . Kaiser, and Greg- ory A. Morrison, University of Illinois. Beginning flight students were taught landings in a flight simu- lator with a visual landing display to examine the effects of scene detail, visual augmented guidance, and the number of landing training trials. Transfer as assessed in a criterion simulator con- figuration showed advantages for larger numbers of training tri- als, visual augmented guidance, and moderate scene detail. Transfer of training to the aircraft showed advantages for low- scene detail over moderate-scene detail for the number of landing training sessions. Subjects who received equal simulator time practicing an instrument pattern (control group) performed bet- ter than the moderate-scene detail group on student assisted land- ings and number of landing training sessions. 1991 SAE Transactions Section 1 912100. Computer-based procedural training. Tom Cordell, United Airlines. 244</page><page sequence="244">912100-912112 Low-fidelity part-task trainers have become well accepted in aviation training programs over the past 25 years. It is generally believed that they provide effective (and possibly, superior) instruction at greatly lower cost. Studies on this family of devices have suggested that their effectiveness lies in their faithful adher- ence to psychological demands of the task and that the physical fidelity of these devices is of secondary importance. Ideally, a part-task trainer will permit systematic interaction between the student and the device, will provide appropriate feedback, and will automatically score student performance. The potential for inexpensive computers to provide these features economically has not been fully exploited within the aviation industry. The training effectiveness of a procedures trainer manufactured from full-scale computer-drawn artwork with touch points for each switch, light, gauge, or control, was studied in this research. Three experiments were conducted with the device using flight-naive college students. The data show that imposition of rigid order on procedural tasks aids learning, that practice on the procedures trainer helps to impose this order, and that procedural skills learned with the system do transfer to the airplane. 1991 SAE Transactions Section 1 912102. Concurrent engineering- Into the curriculum. Reza Pouraghabagher, Martin Koch, and Daniel Walsh, Cal Poly State Univ. Changes in the world economic structure dictate that Ameri- can industry must change or be relegated to a secondary role in the economic order. Academia must play an active role in the transition, despite an existing academic infrastructure that aggra- vates the ptolomeic view prevalent in industry today. Schools of engineering must incorporate team approaches and concurrent engineering concepts into the curriculum, the schools must reas- sess the design-product interface as presented in engineering classes. 912104. Requirements for high flux cooling of future avionics systems. Michael J. Maćkowski, McDonnell Douglas Missile Sys- tems Co. An industry survey was performed to determine future needs for high flux heat removal in advanced electronics systems. The focus of the survey was to determine technology development requirements for military avionics systems. Commercial elec- tronics suppliers were included because many high-power devices are being developed in that part of the industry. This paper pres- ents a summary of all of the interviews and literature reviewed. The summary is sorted by broad application categories, which are: 1) commercial digital systems; 2) military data processors; 3) power processors; and 4) radar and optical systems. For applica- tions expected to be fielded in five to ten years, the outlook is for steady state flux levels of 100 watts per chip for digital processors and several hundred watts per device for power control applica- tions using advanced MOSFETs or MOS controlled thyristor technology. 912105. Flexible heat pipe cold plates for aircraft thermal con- trol. Nelson J. Gernert and David Sarraf Thermacore, Inc.; and Marc Steinberg, Naval Air Development Center. This paper describes the development of flexible heat pipe cold plate (FHPCP) technology for aircraft thermal control. Four different FHPCP's were constructed for a variety of difficult air- craft cooling problems. This included an electronics package embedded in a moving actuator, and a new digital computer installed in a fighter aircraft upgrade. In each application, a cold plate transfers the electronics, heat to the most convenient heat sink by an integrally connected flexible heat pipe. The heat pipe is flexible to allow relative motion between the package to be cooled and the heat sink. It also allows cooling to be provided to surfaces in awkward locations relative to the heat sink. The con- nections to the heat sink can be anything from convective air cooled fins to solid plates bolted on the aircraft's structure. The cold plates were designed to be installed in the gravity-assisted orientation, but the incorporation of a high performance wick structure allows operation in mild against-gravity conditions. 1991 SAE Transactions Section 1 912107. ELS pilot evaluation. Mark C. Anderson, Air Trans- port Systems Div., Honeywell. This paper discusses an evaluation program designed to deter- mine the acceptance and effectiveness of an electronic library sys- tem for commercial flight operations. The program's objective was to determine the needs and applications of the end users, the flight crew, prior to the design of such a complex avionics system. The evaluation program involved over 40 pilots and included testing in a training/classroom environment and in operational flight scenarios in a B727 simulator. In addition to overwhelming acceptance of the electronic library system concept, the results of this program demonstrated the importance of a well-designed graphical user interface for flight deck applications. 1991 SAE Transactions Section 1 912108. Multidimensional ELS user interface. Jim Curran, Collins Commercial Avionics Div., Rockwell International. Intiitive, fast, accurate, and complete access to information on board an aircraft is the goal of an electronic library system. This paper describes some of the principles and techniques for achiev- ing efficient and effective access to electronically-stored informa- tion. 1991 SAE Transactions Section 1 912109. The document revision process for the electronic library system. Philip J. Benedict, Jeppesen Sanderson, Inc. The documents stored on an electronic library system will require extensive tagging and indexing to allow for the updating of specific fields of information, rather than revising whole docu- ments, and to ensure the integrity of the document after the update process. Nivagation charts, which are unintelligent pieces of paper, will require intelligence not only to be selectively dis- played, but to selectively update its components as well. With this kind of volatile data, updates may be stored separately until the effective date of the new information. Transferring revised data to the ELS will range from media replacement to satellite com- munications and will provide greater flexibility for document selection. 912111. ELS for the A340. François Goudenove, Aerospatiale. The electronic library system is a general designation for ground and airborne systems in charge of providing aircraft oper- ators with the information they need. For A330/A340 aircraft, the airborne system is LRU based and the flexibility required by Airlines is provided through a modular configurations. The airborne electronic library system man-machine interface is designed to be consistent with the general cockpit design. In particular, the flight crew display devices are integrated within the sliding tables in front of each pilot station. 1 991 SAE Transactions Section 1 912112. Integrating an ELS into an existing aircraft design. Peter J. Howells, Smiths Industries. Installing an electronic library system into an existing aircraft design has special challenges. For example, the pilot displays must compete with existing displays for valuable panel space. One possible solution to this problem is a thin display, separate from the drive electronics. In this paper other challenges are iden- tified and alternatives are presented that address space, weight, cost and downtime concerns without significantly affecting per- formance or operational commonality. 1991 SAE Transactions Section 1 245</page><page sequence="245">912113-912120 912113. Analysis for the application of hybrid laminar flow control to a long-range subsonic transport aircraft. Philip C. Arcara , Jr. and Dennis W. Bartlett, NASA Langley Research Cen- ter ; and L. Arnold McCullers, Vigyan , Inc. The results of a study that evaluates the application of hybrid laminar flow control (HLFC) to a long-range, twin-engine sub- sonic transport aircraft are presented. The study was performed using the flight optimization system (FLOPS), a rapid and flexi- ble conceptual design and analysis code. This code is a multidisci- plinary system of computer programs for conceptual and prelimi- nary design and evaluation of advanced aircraft concepts. A 300 passenger, twin-engine baseline aircraft was defined for a 6,500 n.mi, design range. All operational and regulatory requirements and contraints, such as fuel reserves, balanced field length and second segment climb are satisfied during the design process. The baseline configuration was sized to account for 50 percent chord laminar flow on the wing upper surface and both surfaces of the horizontal and vertical tails. In addition, the bene- fits of achieving various amounts of laminar flow on the engine nacelles were also studied. The estimated horsepower extration, and initial weight and cost increments required for the HLFC sys- tem (suction to front spar only) were included in the analysis. Results include comparisons of geometry, weights, fuel burn, cruise lift-to-drag ratio (L/D), and direct operating cost (DOC) for the different configurations. The sensitivity of the results to fuel price and off-design range are also presented. 912114. Application of laminar flow control to high-bypass- ratio turbofan engine nacelles. Fayette S. Collier ; Jr. and Richard D. Wagner , NASA Langley Research Center; and Yong Sun Wie , High Technology Corp. Recently, the concept of the application of hybrid laminar flow to modern commercial transport aircraft was successfully flight tested on a Boeing 757 aircraft. In this limited demonstra- tion, in which only part of the upper surface of the swept wing was designed for the attainment of laminar flow, significant local drag reduction was measured. This paper addresses the potential application of this technology to laminarize the external surface of large, modern turbofan engine nacelles which may comprise as much as 5-10 percent of the total wetted area of future com- mercial transports. A hybrid-laminar-flow-control (HLFC) pres- sure distribution is specified and the corresponding nacelle geom- etry is computed utilizing a predictor/corrector design method. Linear stability calculations are conducted to provide predictions of the extent of the laminar boundary layer. Performance studies are presented to determine potential benefits in terms of reduced fuel consumption. 912115. Application of laminar flow control to the high speed civil transport - The NASA supersonic laminar flow control pro- gram. Michael C. Fischer , NASA Langley Research Center; and Chandra S. Vem uru, Analytical Services and Materials, Inc. A balanced program involving both the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) and industry has been struc- tured to carry out a supersonic laminar flow control (SLFC) pro- gram. The program utilizes a balanced mix of computational efforts, ground facility experiments, and flight testing. Advanced computational fluid dynamics (CFD) methods and boundary- layer stability codes offer the opportunity to analyze flow phe- nomena to a greater level of accuracy than in the past, yet the computational prediction and design tools need considerable development and validation for the highly three-dimensional supersonic flow conditions of the F-l 6XL and the high speed civil transport (HSCT). Swept-wing model experiments are underway in a low-disturbance supersonic tunnel to provide data on lead- ing-edge transition physics and flow mechanisms. On-going F-16XL-1 flight tests are obtaining laminar-flow data that will reduce the risk for the NASA experiment on the F-16XL-2. Pre- cursor flight tests on the F-16XL-2 will provide attachment-line design criteria, code calibration data, and an improved under- standing of the flow field over the wing that will add confidence to the design process for the suction panel. Improved measure- ment systems are being developed to meet the challenging mea- surement requirements for this supersonic flight experiment. Flight testing of the active suction panel on the F-16XL-2 will be conducted in 1995. 912116. Application of linear stability theory in supersonic laminar flow design. Robert E. Spall, High Technology Corp.; and Venkit Iyer, Vigyan, Inc. The linear stability of fully three-dimensional supersonic boundary layers formed over swept-wing configurations is inves- tigated using a modified version of the linear stability code COSAL. Configurations studied include a highly swept leading- edge model to be utilized for transition studies in the LARC low- disturbance Mach 3.5 pilot tunnel. The model is a representation of the leading edge of a laminar flow control wing for the F-16XL aircraft. In addition, the region over a laminar flow control glove fitted on the mid-portion of an F-16XL wing was studied. For each configuration, estimates of the location of the onset of tran- sition were computed using linear stability theory and the en method. The effectiveness of suction in stabilizing the boundary layer over the F-16XL wing glove was also investigated. 912118. (SP-885) Development of a viable hydraulic circuit breaker. G. E. Maroney, C. G. West, and J. A. Diemer, M.C. Aero- space. This paper discusses a microprocessor based hydraulic circuit breaker (HCB) that overcomes historical concerns surrounding hydra-mechanical configurations. Specifically, this paper dis- cusses: description, operation, flow sensor selection, software development, reliability, dynamic testing, aeration testing, and live fire testing of the HCB. 912119. (SP-885) Electro-modulate control of supply pressure in hydraulic systems. Paul Lawhead, Abex Aerospace. Hydraulic power requirements of military aircraft have increased significantly over the years. This has brought to the sur- face such issues as how best to manage the higher power require- ments, which in many cases exist for only a small part of the duty cycle duration, and also how to minimize the system losses (heat rejection), which in turn can result in reduced cooling require- ments. This paper summarizes some of the available data on the power requriements of military aircraft, discusses the inefficien- cies of higher pressure systems being considered for high horse- power requirements, and describes the available approaches for better management of the high pressure/horsepower require- ments, with respect to improving the operating efficiency of such systems. The paper draws heavily on the results of an advanced devel- opment program (ADP) administered by the Wright Laboratories -US Air Force, and conducted by McDonnell Aircraft Company (McAir) between 1986 and 1990, to illustrate the benefits that can be realized with variable pressure system designs to meet the high horsepower challenge. The technology to enable such system designs is available today, and is a case of beneficial synergism that can be realized between the hydraulics and the electronics technologies on advanced aircraft. 1991 SAE Transactions Section 1 912120. Comparisons of elastic and rigid blade-element rotor models using parallel processing technology for piloted simula- tors. Gary Hill, NASA Ames Research Center; and Ronald W. DuVal, John A. Green, and Loc C. Huynh, Advanced Rotorcraft Technology, Inc. 246</page><page sequence="246">912120-912127 A piloted comparison of rigid and aeroelastic blade-element rotor models was conducted on the crew station research and development facility (CSRDF) at Ames Research Center. Flightlab, a new simulation development and analysis tool, was used to implement these models in real time using parallel pro- cessing technology. Pilot comments and quantitative analysis performed both on-line and off-line confirmed that elastic degrees of freedom significantly affect perceived handling quali- ties. Trim comparisons show improved correlation with flight test data when elastic modes are modeled. The results demon- strate the efficiency with which the mathematical modeling sophistication of existing simulation facilities can be upgraded using parallel processing, and the importance of these upgrades to simulation fidelity. 1991 SAE Transactions Section 1 912121. A review of recent programs and future plans for rotor- craft in-flight simulation at Ames Research Center. J. Victor Lebacqz, NASA Ames Res. Ctr.; Edwin W. Aiken and William S. Hindson, NASA Ames Research Center; Michelle M . Eshow, U.S. Army Aeroßight Dynamics Directorate ; and Dallas G. Denery, NASA Ames Research Center. A new flight research vehicle, the Rotorcraft-Aircrew Systems Concepts Airborne Laboratory (RASCAL), is being developed by the U.S. Army and NASA at Ames Research Center. The require- ments for this new facility stem from a perception of rotorcraft system technology requirements for the next decade together with operational experience with the Boeing Vertol CH-47B research helicopter that was operated as an in-flight simulator at Ames during the past 10 years. Accordingly, both the principal design features of the CH-47B variable-stability system and the flight- control and cockpit-display programs that were conducted using this aircraft at Ames are reviewed. Another U.S. Army heliopcter, a Sikorsky UH-60A black hawk, has been selected as the baseline vehicle for the RASCAL. The research programs that influence the design of the RASCAL are summarized, and the resultant requirements for the RASCAL research system are described. These research programs include investigations of advanced, integrated control concepts for achieving high levels of agility and maneuverability, and guidance technologies, employing comput- er/sensor-aiding, designed to assist the pilot during low-altitude flight in conditions of limited visibility. The approach to the development of the new facility is presented and selected plans for the preliminary design of the RASCAL are described. 1991 SAE Transactions Section 1 912123. Runway incursions and airport surface traffic automa- tion. Michael J. Harrison, Federal Aviation Administration. Runway incursions occur when aircraft or vehicles get onto a runway and conflict with aircraft cleared to land or take off on that same runway. All are caused by human error. The Federal Aviation Administration has identified reducing these human errors as a safety priority. Application of new technology is part of the solution. This paper highlights recent actions by the agency in addressing runway incursions and discusses a stragegy for development of airport surface traffic automation design to aid the air traffic controller and the pilot in identifying potential run- way incursions. Airport surface traffic automation represents a conflict alert system which adds both automated safety monitor- ing and tools for the controller to use in reducing surface move- ment delays. 1991 SAE Transactions Section 1 912124. Flight operations safety management. Jesse L. Marker ; United Airlines. Managing operational flight safety is critical to the success of any air carrier operation. This paper describes one process for identifying, addressing and managing risk areas associated with air carrier flight operations. The five step process involves data collection, analysis, strategy design, implementation and cri- tique. Several examples will be presented to illustrate the practi- cality and effectiveness of the process. 1991 SAE Transactions Section 1 912125. Aerodynamic performance of a drag reduction device on a full-scale tractor/trailer. Wendy R. Lanser and James C. Ross, NASA Ames Research Center; and Andrew E. Kaufman, Continuum Dynamics, Inc. The effectiveness of an aerodynamic boattail on a tractor/ trailer road vehicle was measured in the NASA Ames Research Center 80-by 120-foot wind tunnel. Results are examined for the tractor/trailer with and without the drag reduction device. Pres- sure measurements and flow visualization show that the aerody- namic boattail traps a vortex or eddy in the corner formed between the device and the rear corner of the trailer. This recir- culating flow turns the flow inward as it separates from the edges of the base of the trailer. This modified flow behavior increases the pressure acting over the base area of the truck, thereby reduc- ing the net aerodynamic drag of the vehicle. Drag measurements and pressure distributions in the region of the boattail device are presented for selected configurations. The optimum configura- tion reduces the overall drag of the tractor/trailer combination by about 10% at a zero yaw angle. Unsteady pressure measurements do no indicate strong vortex shedding, although the addition of the boattail plates increases high frequency content of the fluctu- ating pressure. 1991 SAE Transactions Section 1 912126. Nonlinear induced drag study of generically cambered closely coupled dual wings. Doug Blake and Bruce P. Selberg, University of Missouri, Rolla. A non-linear thin vortex lattice method, BSAERO, with wake rollup has been used to analyze closely coupled generic dual wings. These included drag studies involved using generic mean camber line wings created using two parabolas. Using this parab- ola method the location of maximum camber and the magnitude of the maximum camber were varied independently of one another. Ci/Cdi was used as the success parameter for a particu- late wing system configuration. The best dual wing geometry con- figuration had a Ci/Cd¡ 18% greater than the comparable dual baseline with symmetric wings. The worst dual wing configura- tion had a Ci/Cdi which was 63% below the dual wing baseline. Systematic results are presented which will demonstrate trends as well as magnitudes for the best types of dual wing configurations for minimum induced drag. Contrary to single wing results in which essentially the same C|/Cd¡ results were found with or with- out wake rollup these dual wing results under certain wing geome- tries yield significantly different Ci/Cd¡ results with and without wake rollup. The differences with this parameter for a flat wake versus a rolled up wake varied from 0.5% to 48% with an average of 7.2%. These differences are discussed in detail. 912127. Computational analysis of drag reduction techniques for afterbody/nozzle/empennage configurations. William T. Jones, Dynamic Engineering Inc.; and Khaled S. Abdol-Hamid, Analytical Services and Materials, Inc. Three-dimensional Navier-Stokes solutions were obtained for the external flow around three single-engine body-empennage configurations using the PAB3D code. These solutions were used to study afterbody drag reduction techniques. The configurations were solved at Mach 0.6 and 0° angle of attack and consisted of the following: 1) a baseline case for which experimental data was available, 2) a contoured modification based on the area rule, and 2) elliptic cross section modifications designed to take advantage of the favorable pressures in the tail stagnation regions. The area rule modification resulted in a 6.3% reduction in afterbody/ nozzle drag and an 8.5% decrease in total aft end drag. While the afterbody/nozzle drag for the elliptic cross section case showed a 15.4% decrease from the baseline, the increased pressure drag 247</page><page sequence="247">912127-912137 of the tails resulted in a net decrease of only 1.1% for the body- empennage configuration. 1991 SAE Transactions Section 1 912128. Scale model test of an isolated turbofan nacelle with riblets. Norbert O. Stockman , M. O. Latapy, and Tracy L. Andrew , General Electric Aircraft Engines ; and Donald H. Rog- ers , Jr., General Electric Airdravt Engines. A one-seventh scale model of a high bypass turbofan inlet/ nacelle was tested with and without V-groove riblets applied to the external surface. Tests were conducted in the French ONERA SI transonic atmospheric wind tunnel in modane. Before the test was finished riblets came off in two places and other problems with the riblet arose. These problems were partially solved by selective use of the drag data. Drag reductions up to 6.4%, depending on flow conditions, were obtained. Locally, reductions up to 8% were attained. In general, the higher drag reductions were attained when shocks were present. 1991 SAE Transactions Section 1 912129. Some practical aspects of viscous drag reduction con- cepts. Frank T. Lynch and Mark D. Klinge, Douglas Aircraft Co. Several very practical obstacles presently keeping both riblets and hybrid laminar flow control (HLFC) from inservice applica- tions have been reviewed. For riblets, proving economic viability is a major challenge that will require an order of magnitude reduction in the time to apply them relative to the best applica- tion times demonstrated to date. And, this reduced application time must be achievable by non-specialized workers. In addition, the airlines must be convinced that riblets will retain their full performance benefit for five years with minimal additional atten- tion required. Then, to make the total riblet drag reduction worth pursuing, it will be necessary that riblets can be used on wings and tails without adversely impacting flight characteristics which can effect operating economics. Practical challenges needing to be overcome for HLFC include the definition/development of a practical/effective wing ice protection system compatible with HLFC that does not adversely impact performance character- stics, and devising a means to overcome the performance defi- ciencies and risk incurred by the requirement to use a Krueger- type leading-edge device (in lieu of a slat). Further, it will be nec- essary to demonstrate that HLFC can be effectively used in the wing root area and in areas on the wing influenced by the installa- tion of VHBPR engines, plus wind-tunnel-testing techniques must be developed for HLFC that reliably depict full-scale aero- dynamic characteristics, and economics must be conclusively demonstrated to the airlines. The final challenge for HLFC is to overcome all of the foregoing obstacles without having to resort to a full-up prototype program prior to launching a production aircraft program. 1991 SAE Transactions Section 1 912131. (SP-886) EB Welding of launch vehicles. Attila Szabo, Martin Marietta Manned Space Systems. The electron beam (EB) welding process has gained wide- spread acceptance in the aerospace industry as an efficient, pre- cise, high quality joining process. Because its optimum perfor- mance is realized in a vacuum environment, its use has been lim- ited to welding of fairly small components, where Xray quality, high strength welds are required with minimal part distortion. Larger components can be welded; however, the equipment and operating costs increase with the correspondingly larger vacuum chambers used to house the parts to be welded. This paper will address the process limitation, and will describe a technically sound approach to EB welding of very large (12 -34 ft. diameter) launch vehicle assemblies, with no compro- mise in weld quality. Several materials to be used in future launch vehicles (e.g. 2219, 2090, weldalite™, HP9-4-30/20) were welded under conditions simulating this "large assembly EB welding" approach, with excellent as-welded properties. Tensile strengths of these materials (at both room temperature and cryogenic tem- peratures) were up to 50% higher than comparable arc welded properties. Fracture toughness, a critically important design parameter for launch vehicles, was also studied, with similar results: 40-50% higher EB welded properties than comparable arc welded values. Another study focused on joint fit-up allowables for the EBW process. The test welds were made in 2219-T87 aluminum, with NDE, metallography, and room temperature tensile tests used as acceptance criteria. The results indicate that the EBW process can tolerate the joint gaps, mismatch, and (beam) misalignment pres- ently allowed for arc welding in production of the space shuttle external tank. Considering the inherent advantages of the EB welding process (high travel speeds, minimal weld shrinkage and distortion, built-in seam tracking, elimination of filler metal), it appears to be an excellent alternative to arc welding for future production of selected large launch vehicle assemblies. 912132. (SP-886) Alcoa-Massena operations: an integrated aluminum aerospace forging stock producer. David W. Hohman, ALCOA. Alcoa-Massena Operations is a totally integrated aluminum producer from primary production to fabricated rod, wire and bar products. Alcoa-Massena Operations currently offers sixteen different alloys of forging stock; eight of these have a wide usage in a variety of aerospace applications. Alcoa-Massena Operations can offer both O (annealed) and F (as-fabricated) tempers in both Class I and Class II product forms. Class II forging stock offers two to ten times tighter tolerances from a diameter standpoint than those of Class I. Available alloys now include 2219 and 2618 designed for high-temeprature use and 4032 alloy for high- temperature wear performance (e.g. aircraft pistons). Alloy 7475 is also available, it offers microstructural control to provide supe- rior fracture toughness properties. Details concerning structure-property relationships and over- all facility support to these products and their respective applica- tions will be presented. Capabilities for both aerospace cold- finished rod and bar products along with wire capabilities for aerospace fasteners are listed as well. 912133. (SP-885) The Boeing 747-400 upper rudder control system with triple tandem valve. Henrik H. Straub, Boeing Com- mercial Airplane Group; and Roland Greswell, Parker Bertea Aerospace. To the casual airline passenger the appearance of the Boeing 747-400 jetliner is identical to that of the older model 747-300 with the exception of the winglets. However, modifications and improvements include modern digital avionics, a "glass" cockpit and more powerful rudder control surfaces to cope with the growth in engine thrust. The upper rudder is positioned by three parallel actuators and powered by two independent hydraulic sys- tems. Flow control is provided by a triple tandem servovalve which maintains actuator force fight below allowable limits and synchronizes hydraulic flow to the three actuators. This paper describes the requirements, design, development, analysis and iron bird testing of some of the unique features of the upper rud- der hydraulic control system. 912134. (SP-885) Total flexibility in cartridge valve porting through innovative sealing technology. Peter G. Amos, Jeffrey C. Dickey, and John L. Grillo, Lee Co. A new one-piece seal provides great flexibility in sealing and porting miniature multi-port fluid control components. The new seal provides sealing both axially and radially allowing for dis- tinct ports to be located within the same radial plane. The seal is expanded after insertion, preventing shearing or other damage. 912137. Noise abatement procedures versus safety. Richard A. Deeds, Air Line Pilots Association, Delta Airlines. 248</page><page sequence="248">912137-912144 I believe that accomplishing aircraft noise abatement in the airport terminal area presents the greatest single safety problem to air carrier operations in the United States. To understand the effect of noise abatement we must look at the consequences of noise laws and limitations from a national perspective. Since the passage of the first noise law, the National Environ- mental Policy Act (NEPA) in 1969, there has been only one air carrier airport "planned and built" in the entire country. That air- port is Fort Myers, Florida. In addition, runways have been denied the usage of large air carrier aircraft because those aircraft are environmentally noisy. Airport authorities have placed strin- gent use limitations on many of the remaining runways that are "noise sensitive." Landing thresholds have been displaced to move noise contours. Flight tracks have been adjusted both hori- zontally and vertically. Curfews have been established denying landing authority to late arrivals. During this same time period the air carrier industry was deregulated, permitting many more aircraft to use the limited number of airports and runways. 912138. Alertness management in flight operations: strategic napping .MarkR. Rosekind andPhilippa H. Gander ; NASA Ames Research Center; and David F. Dinges , Institute of Pennsylvania Hospital , University of Pennsylvania School of Medi. Flight operations can involve rapid multiple time changes and long, irregular work schedules. These factors can result in sleep loss, circadian disruption, and fatigue with subsequent effects on flightdeck performance. Countermeasures to reduce or mitigate the effects of these factors can be divided into two approaches: preventive strategies and operational countermeasures. Preven- tive strategies are used prior to a duty period to reduce or mitigate the fatigue created by flight and duty schedules. Operational countermeasures are used during flight operations to maintain performance and alertness. Naps can be used as both a preventive strategy and an operational countermeasure. Strategic napping in two different flight operation environments will be used to illus- trate its application as a fatigue countermeasure. A recent NASA/ FAA study examining the effectiveness of a preplanned cockpit nap to acutely improve alertness and performance on the flight- deck will be described. 912140. Training for advanced technology aircraft - A pilot's perspective. Harry W. Orlady , Orlady Associates. Advanced technology aircraft were a major advance in air transport. They are the aircraft of our immediate future. Training for these aircraft is extremely important. It furnishes the interface between the manufacturer, the operator, and the pilot. It is very expensive. Neither the manufacturers, the airlines, nor the inde- pendent training organizations can afford to do it poorly. Historically, most changes in training and in airline flight operations have been evolutionary, not revolutinary. However, there have been some truly generic changes and in the past few years at least two new training concepts- LOFT and CRM. Sev- eral issues assoicated with the training and operation of advanced technology aircraft have been clarified since their inauguration. 912142. Development of a pneumatic high-angle-of-attack flush airdata sensing system. Stephen A. Whitmore, NASA Dry- den Flight Research Facility. A nonintrusive high-angle-of-attack flush airdata sensing sys- tem was installed and flight tested on the F-18 high alpha research vehicle at the NASA Dryden Flight Research Facility. This sys- tem consists of a matrix of 25 pressure orifices arranged in con- centric circles on the nose of the vehicle to determine angles of attack and sideslip, Mach number, and pressure altitude. During the course of the flight tests, it was determined that satisfactory results could be achieved using a subset of just nine ports. The high-angle-of-attack flush airdata sensing system was cali- brated and demonstrated using reference airdata generated by way of minimum variance estimation techniques which blended airdata measurements from two wingtip airdata booms with iner- tial velocities, aircraft angular rates and attitudes, precision radar tracking, and meteorological analyses. Calibration results are presented. Although analyses were not performed on-board in real-time, the high alpha research vehicle high-angle-of-attack flush airdata sensing system and resulting airdata algorithms were validated as being real-time capable using flight data in ground based simula- tions. Algorithm implmentation, failure detection modes using a X2 "goodness-of-fit" test, and fault tolerance techniques using weighted least squares are described. Flight test results are presented. Under moderate maneuver- ing conditions the high-angle-of-attack flush airdata sensing sys- tem was shown to give excellent results. Empirical verification was performed over a large portion of the high alpha research vehicle flight envelope with a Mach number range from 0.15 to 1 .20 and an angle-of-attack range from -8.0 to 55.0°. Angle of side- slip excursions covered the range from -15.0 to 15.0°. 1991 SAE Transactions Section 1 912143. Air data measurement for hypersonic vehicles. Earl T. Ben s er, Honeywell Systems and Research Center. The advent of vehicles capable of broad-envelope hypersonic flight requires the development of advanced methods for the measurement of air data parameters for vehicle flight and propul- sion control. The requirements for hypersonic air data measure- ment are reviewed, and techniques for the measurement of air data parameters for hypersonic vehicles are presented and assessed. Today's hypersonic vehicles, primarily the space shuttle, have had restricted flight envelopes and required minimal air data measurement performance. Advanced hypersonic vehicles are now being designed that will greatly expand the envelope of hypersonic travel. Accurate measurement or derivation of vehi- cle altitude, rates, Mach number, angle of attack, and sideslip are required to ensure that operation of a hypersonic vehicle over a broader envelope is possible. The hypersonic vehicle must operate in an environment char- acterized by low atmospheric and high dynamic pressures com- bined with high external-surface temperatures that reach extremes higher than 2000°C with flow velocities approaching Mach 25. The air data measurement system must be able to oper- ate within the stressing operational environment expected at the vehicle surfaces or within the propulsion subsystem. Finally, the system must be able to provide rapid update rates and, in some cases, spatially resolved measurements. 912144. On upsets of analog portions of digital flight control systems due to elecctromagnetic interference. Bruce T. Clough, Wright-Patterson Air Force Base. Recent concerns about the susceptibility of digital flight con- trol systems (DFCS) to electromagnetic interference (EMI) have lead to testing a representative DFCS for upset from possible car- rier signal modulations. Tests performed on the analog inputs of a DFCS have confirmed the following traits: waveforms demodu- lated prior to system input must have modulations lying in the passband of the DFCS to cause upset; all esle equal, AC-excited sensors are more sensitive to EMI than DC-excited ones; all else equal, CW signals upset system easier than pulsed signals; upsets are not extremely sensitive to modulation waveform shape for CW signals; analog DFCS inputs are susceptible to average, verses peak, voltages for system upsets; analog sensors requiring AC excitation are more sensitive modulations near, or at, the excitation frequency; frame synchronous operation is desirable to counter EMI-induced analog faults; averaging sensor redundancy management algorithms are less susceptible to EMI than middle- picking algorithms; actuator output averaging mitigates effects of EMI much better than the practice of dedicating a certain channel 249</page><page sequence="249">912144-912154 to drive a certain control surface; and sensor inputs requiring the highest gain are the most susceptible. The above implies that the analog sections of a modern DFCS will not be upset by radar or other high power pulsed radiofre- quncy (RF) sources. High power commercial broadcasting sta- tions can be a concern if and only if the detected signal levels are large enough to trip sensor health monitors, and these levels can be determined by examining system specifications. If EMI caused upsets are deemed a great problem, modifying the redundancy management system to handle multiple-correlated failures will be required to avoid misdiagnosis. Future tests will examine the ability of the fault-tolerant digital sections of the DFCS to be upset by EMI modulations. 1991 SAE Transactions Section 1 912145. Agility and high angle of attack: An air force research perspective. Jeffrey A. Beck and Thomas J. Cord, USAF Wright Lab.; and Mark J. Detroit, University of Dayton Research Insti- tute. Current efforts to extend controlled flight into the post-stall regime will bring about major changes in aircraft dynamic capa- bility. These changes will have far-reaching implications in terms of the specification, design, evaluation, and operational use of future fighter aircraft. Significant research continues to be accom- plished in developing the technologies required to design and build supermaneuverable fighters. This paper discusses some of the background to current agility research and addresses the research which must be accomplished in order for the Air Force to specify requirements for and evaluate these aircraft. 912148. Controls for agility research in the NASA high-alpha technology program. John V. Foster and W. Thomas Bundick, NASA Langley Research Center ; and Joseph W. Pahle, NASA Ames Research Center. Emerging advanced controls technology will allow future gen- eration fighter aircraft to aggressively maneuver at high angles-of- attack. Currently there is a need to develop flight-validated design methodologies and guidelines to effectively integrate this technology into future aircraft. As part of the NASA high-alpha technology program (HATP), advanced controls technology is being developed in ground-based research and demonstrated using the high-alpha research vehicle (HARV) as a flying testbed. Efforts are in progress to develop flight validated control law design methodologies and design guidelines which could be used to effectively exploit the capabilities provided by advanced con- trols at high angles of attack. This paper outlines this research effort and summarizes the design process and preliminary meth- odologies and guidelines developed to date. 912149. Velocity dependence of high angle of attack longitudi- nal flying qualities criteria. David J. Wilson, Neil S. Hall, and David R. Riley, McDonnell Aircraft Co. Piloted simulations were conducted to investigate flying quali- ties requirements for longitudinal maneuvering at 30° angle of attack. Pilot evaluations of various longitudinal dynamics were gathered using acquisition and tracking tasks representative of future fighter air combat maneuvering. Pilot comments and coo- per-harper ratings were used to define designed regions of aircraft dynamics. These criteria were then compared to previously developed 30° angle of attack criteria for a lower speed flight con- dition to determine airspeed effects. The desired region of dynamics was found to depend on equivalent airspeed. This dependency can be used to help design control law gain schedules which provide good high angle of attack flying qualities over a wide speed range. 1991 SAE Transactions Section 1 912150. CFD calculations of closely coupled scissor wings- inviscid, viscous, and vortex lattice with rollup results. Clarence Chenault, University of Missouri-Rolla ; and Bruce P. Selberg, University of Missouri, Rolla. The scissor wing configuration was investigated in the takeoff, landing, and low speed maneuverability area. In this area of oper- ation the scissor lifting surfaces are close to each other and are strongly coupled aerodynamically. Two dimensional viscous and three dimensional vortex lattice results are presented for the scis- sor wings both of which used a NASA 64A-006 wing section. A multi-element vortex panel code was utilized for the inviscid pre- dictions along with a momentum integral boundary layer code for the viscous predictions. A non-linear vortex-lattice code with wake roll-up was used for the induced drag predictions. Studies were conducted with gap variations between the two wings, longitudinal variation between the two wings, variations in the relative angle between the two wings, leading edge flap vari- ations, and trailing edge flap variations. Two dimensional results demonstrate that with proper selection of the gap between the wings, the longitudinal distance between the trailing edge of one wing and the leading edge of the other, and the relative angle between the wings improved lift-drag characteristics can be real- ized over the single wing. Both leading edge and trailing edge flaps, of proper percent chord and deflection, are shown to be able to simulate the optimum geometry without flaps. The dimen- sional vortex lattice results with wake rollup show a lower induced drag when compared to a comparable single wing. 912152. Turbine blade heat transfer prediction using coupled turbulent Prandtl number and transition models. Kevin W. Whitaker, University of Alabama. A study was undertaken to improve the prediction of heat transfer coefficients on the suction surface of turbine blades. The study specifically investigated the effects of coupling turbulent Prandtl number models with boundary layer transition models. A two-dimension boundary layer code, STAN5, was sleeted and the turbulence model modificed by incorporating several turbu- lent Prandtl number and boundary layer transition models found in the literature. Results indicated that subtle effects were attrib- utable to the modified turbulence model. However, desired improvements were not obtained in the heat transfer coefficient predictions. It appears that boundary layer transition models pre- dicting natural transition are not appropirate for use in a turbine blade flow field. 912153. Passive control of supersonic cavity flowfields. N. Chokani and I. Kim, North Carolina State Univ. A computational investigation has been conducted to study the effect and mechanisms of the passive control of a supersonic flow over a rectangular two-dimensional cavity. The passive con- trol was included through the use of a porous surface over a vent chamber in the floor of the cavity. The passive control effectively suppressed the low-frequency pressure oscillations for the open type cavity, (length-to-depth ratio = 6.0). The mechanism for the suppression was observed to be the stabilization of the motion of the free shear layer. For the closed type cavity flow (length-to-depth ratio = 17.5), the passive control modified the flow field to nearly that of an open type cav- ity flow; further the cavity drag was reduced by a factor of 4. The computational results of both cases showed good agreement with the available experimental data and the predictions of a semi- empirical formula. This study demonstrates that the passive control concept can be used to improve the aerodynamic characteristics of open and closed cavity flow fields. 1991 SAE Transactions Section 1 912154. Dynamic response of landing gears on rough repaired runway. Ting-Whai Lee, Menasco Aerosystems Div. 250</page><page sequence="250">912154-912164 A general purpose computer program DADS has been used to study the landing gear response on battle damaged, repaired run- ways during aircraft landing, taxing and take off. Two types of gears have been modeled. One is a cantilever type gear, the other is an articulated gear. The hydraulic orifice darning, pneumatic air spring, bearing friction forces in the shock strut and the tire- load deflection curve are all included in the models. The output includes the tire-ground reaction force, the shock strut dynamic load and the forces in each members of the gear. These two gear models are built in a three dimensional space, and they can be used eigher as a single gear running over a runway repair mat, or combined, together to simulate a whole aircraft operating on a rough field. The study shows the great capability of DADS in the model- ing, simulation and analysis of aircraft ground operations. Rather than writing a generic FORTRAN source code, using the DADS is much easier and more flexible for the user to model and study most types of landing gear systems in a much shorter time frame. 1991 SAE Transactions Section 1 912155. Cut progression during dynamometer testing of for- eign object damaged type VII extra highpressure aircraft tires. Peter C. Vorum, Wright-Patterson Air Force Base. Ground operations over rough surfaces and/or debris strewn taxiways and runways may result in cut damage to the tires. Cut progression during continued flight operations has not been seri- ously studied. This report will follow a group of type VII extra high pressure tires which were damaged by running them over a debris strewn test bed, then run through alternating taxi-takeoff and landing-taxi tests on the 3.05 meter (120 inch) dynamometer in the landing gear development facility at Wright-Patterson Air Force Base. Only 1.3 -23% of the debris struck by these tires resulted in cuts. While testing on the dynamometer, the cut depth grew rapidly until it reached the outer carcass ply, then slowed. The test group included new and recapped bias ply, and prototype radial main landing gear tires. This paper will summarize the tire tests and offer recommendations for future evaluation of the tires and materials. 1 991 SAE Transactions Section 1 912156. Runway drainage characteristics related to tire fric- tion performance. Thomas J. Yager ; NASA Langley Research Center. The capability of a runway pavement to rapidly drain water buildup during periods of precipitation is crucial to minimize tire hydroplaning potential and maintain adequate aircraft ground operational safety. Test results from instrumented aircraft, ground friction measuring vehicles, and NASA Langley's Aircraft Landing Dynamics Facility (ALDF) track have been summarized to indicate the adverse effects of pavement wetness conditions on tire friction performance. Water drainage measurements under a range of rainfall rates have been evaluated for several different runway surface treatments including the transversely grooved and longitudinally grinded concrete surfaces at the space shuttle landing facility (SLF) runway at NASA Kennedy Space Center in Florida. The major parameters influencing drainage rates and extent of flooding/drying conditions are identified. Existing drainage test data are compared to a previously derived empirical relationship and the need for some modification is indicated. The scope of future NASA Langley research directed toward improv- ing empirical relationships to properly define runway drainage capability and consequently, enhance aircraft ground operation safety, is given. 1991 SAE Transactions Section 1 912157. 26 X 6.6 radial-belted aircraft tire performance. Veloria J. Martinson , Thomas J. Yager ; Sandy M. Stubbs , and Pamela A. Davis, NASA Langley Research Center. Preliminary results from testing of 26 X 6.6 radial-belted and bias-ply aircraft tires at NASA Langley's Aircraft Landing Dynamics Facility (ALDF) are reviewed. These tire tests are part of a larger, on going joint NASA/FAA industry surface traction and radial tire (START) program involving three different tire sizes. The 26 X 6.6 tire size evaluation includes cornering perfor- mance tests throughout the aircraft ground operational speed range for both dry and wet runway surfaces. Static test results to define 26 X 6.6 tire vertical stiffness properties are also presented and discussed. 912160. Application of a double actuator electronic fuel control unit on a small gas turbine engine. A. I. Georgantas, R. M. H Cheng, and T. Krepec, Concordia Univ. This paper investigates the performance of a double actuator electronic fuel control unit, when installed on a gas turbine engine. The validated mathematical model of the unit is linked to a quasi-linear engine mathematical model. A combination of two operating modes of the unit is used to improve the fuel deliv- ery characteristics. Acceleration and maximum speed governing of the engine are simulated. Two control strategies are investi- gated. In the first, the fuel flow rate and the engine speed are used as feedback signals. In the second, the N-dot control, which elimi- nates the need for fuel flow feedback during engine acceleration, is studied. 912161. Concorde operations. John D. Eames, British Airways. After seven years of test flying and more than fifteen years of commercial operations Concorde remains unrivalled and unique among civil transport aircraft. Many problems, technical political and financial have been overcome and the aircraft, flagship of both Air France and British Airways, is now proven, safe and reli- able. The aircraft's unmistakable low aspect ratio delta wing, optimized for supersonic cruise, brings with it the penalty of high drag at low speed; a factor impressed on flight crews during initial conversion to type. Concorde's large flight envelope is severely restricted by the need to balance the movement of the aerody- namic centre of pressure by a shift of aircraft centre of gravity. The dual-compressor axial flow Rolls-Royce Olympus engines, augmented by afterburning for take-off and transonic accelera- tion, provide the high jet velocity and high thrust needed for Mach 2 flight. Supersonic flight is limited by the sonic boom to oceanic and some desert routes, the same consideration demands accurate navigation when noise sensitive areas are approached. Flight crew training reflects the fact that Concorde is not only a complex aircraft that operates in a hostile environment, it also requires accurate handling and an awareness of the operational differences from subsonic types. This paper sketches the history of the Concorde project, pres- ents a pilot's view of Concorde operations and ends by answering the question "is Concorde profitable?" 1991 SAE Transactions Section 1 912162. Concorde airframe design and development. Dudley C ollar d, Aircraft Div., Aerospatiale. A survey of the Concorde supersonic transport aircraft pro- gramme has been made, starting from initial studies in the late 1950's and ending with the propsed developed type B version. The survey covers the aspects for which Aerospatiale in France was responsible, with only a mimimum of reference to British Aerospace items, covered in another paper. Much knowledge can be drwan from the study of the technical development of this unique aircraft and it is hoped that this paper will help pass this knowledge on. 1991 SAE Transactions Section 1 912164. Advanced optical condition monitoring. Sarkis Barkhoudarian and G. Cross, Rocketdyne Div., Rockwell Interna- tional. 251</page><page sequence="251">912164-912175 Significant improvements in propulsion system hardware reli- ability, life, and safety, with associated reductions in life cycle cost and maintenance turnaround time can be realized by imple- menting advanced condition monitoring (ACM) methods and technologies. The stragegy of ACM systems is to use novel tech- nologies to continuously monitor critical system components during operation to provide in situ, noncontacting measurements of component degradation. When used in conjunction with dedi- cated electronics and knowledge-gased systems, diagnosis of component failure modes and prognosis of remaining useful life can be automatically provided without time - consuming disas- sembly and manual inspection. Such a system can keep users informed of upcoming maintenance requirements and system availability. The need for scheduled maintenance of monitored components is eliminated while component maintenance, pro- vided well in advance of problems affecting safety or perfor- mance, is ensured. Previous papers have provided overviews of ACM systems for turbomachinery and for specific ACM technol- ogies. This paper provides an overview of two advanced optical ACM technologies developed for in situ and between -flight pro- pulsion system monitoring applications. 1991 SAE Transactions Section 1 912167. Distributed health management systems technology for future propulsion control systems. Jerry Wald, J. Schoess, and G. Hadden, Honeywell Inc. Future missions involving launch vehicle and space systems require available and reliable propulsion control systems. Avail- ability is increased through health monitoring systems technol- ogy capable of first predicting and detecting faults and then expe- diting maintenance and repair. Advances in sensor, microelec- tronic and software technology permit increased system monitor- ing, failure prediction and detection within the propulsion system. These advances make it possible to design and develop distributed health management systems. Smart sensors, advanced processors, predictive diagnostic algorithms, and expert maintenance diagnostic systems have already been dem- onstrated. The development of computationally efficient data fil- tering and analysis algorithms will facilitate the integration of robust diagnostics within low-power microelectronics. Plans are in place to embed this software in smart sensor electronics. 1991 SAE Transactions Section 1 912169. A ground test program to support condition monitor- ing of a spacecraft attitude control system. Douglas J. Clark and Robert W. Lester, Jet Propulsion Labs., California Institute of Technology; and Edmund C. Baroth and Arthur L. Coleman , Jet Propulsion Lab., California Institute of Technology. The comet rendezvous asteroid flyby (CRAF) mission involves seven years of flight from 0.6 to 4.57 astronomical units (AU), followed by about 915 days of maneuvering around a comet. Ground testing will characterize the very critical attitude control system thrusters' fuel consumption and performance for all anticipated fuel temperatures over thruster life. The ground test program characterization will support flight condition moni- toring. A commercial software application hosted on a commer- cial microcomputer will control ground test operations and data acquisition using a newly designed thrust stand. The data acquisi- tion and control system uses a graphics-based language and fea- tures a visual interface to integrate data acquisition and control. 912172. Sealed NiCad versus sealed lead acid batteries charge control and monitor. Richard Michael Haas, TRI-MAG, Inc. Batteries which are used in airborne electrical systems must provide a very high discharge current for APU starting and offer virtually maintenance free service. To achieve this kind of perfor- mance for hundreds of operational cycles, it is important to con- sider the behavior of a battery under actual operating conditions. Several functional parameters such as terminal voltage, state of charge, internal impedance and temperature are continously changing depending on past and present operating conditions. In order to evaluate the available energy which a battery can deliver at any given time, it is necessary to maintain a log of the state of charge index (SOCI). This numerical indicator is based on a functional relationship between terminal voltage, current flow, elapsed time and internal temperature. These parameters are continuously monitoried and periodic measurements are con- verted into a standard index factor. The battery readiness to provide a desired output power for a specified period of time is calculated from several index factors and the net current flow during that same time frame. The significant features of this control regime are: adaptable to NiCad and lead acid batteries; also, the battery state of readi- ness can be established with reasonable accuracy for both types of batteries. Most important, this control regime is continually optimized for best performances. 912173. The use of high voltage direct current in aircraft elec- trical systems - A navy perspective. Ed Taylor, Don Croke, and Eric Speck , Naval Air Test Center. The simplicity, reliability, and weight reduction potential promised by high voltage direct current (HVDC) electrical power systems has enticed aircraft developers to propose the use of such systems in modified form for advanced aircraft. However, HVDC systems have not been flown on any military or commer- cial aircraft and little has been done to independently validate the tradeoffs made and to analyze the impact a HVDC system will have on Naval aviation and its support. To rectify this, the Naval Air Systems Command established a working group consisting of Defense Department activities concerned with aircraft electrical power research and development, testing, avionics development, logistics, and safety. The working group was free to examine all aspects of the development, implementation, and use of HVDC aircraft power systems. It chose to concentrate on performance, weight, efficiency, avionics design, safety, logistics, reliability, distribution components, electromagnetic compatibility, and technical risk. This paper will discuss the technical, logistics, and system benefits and concerns expressed by the group and attempt to develop conclusions concerning HVDC in aircraft electrical systems. 1991 SAE Transactions Section 1 912174. Quantification of aircraft carbon brake wear using regression analysis and periodic wave for m s. Jam es F. Tarter, Air- craft Braking Systems Corp. A new method has been developed to measure and quantify aircraft brake wear. This information is used to evaluate brake life, investigate the effects of design changes, and predict worn brake performance. The process is based on digital acquisition of worn brake disk data. Regression analysis is used to fit the profile data to a specially developed 3-D linear model which quantifies total wear and linear taper. Fourier transforms of the profile data yield frequencies, wave lengths, and phases of the dominant peri- odic wave forms, which define the profile nonlinearities. Devel- opment of these methods has resulted in a new and unique tech- nique for evaluation of aircraft brake wear. 912175. Testing of a titanium matrix composite landing gear. Mark A. Shea, McDonnell Aircraft Corp.; David L. Morris, Wright-Patterson Air Force Base; and William W. Macy, McDon- nell Aircraft Corp. The testing of a titanium matrix composite (TMC) F-15 nose gear outer cylinder is discussed. Two cylinders were fabricated. An entire F-15 nose gear was assembled using the first cylinder. This test gear underwent static structural tests to three critical loading conditions and functional evaluations included load- stroke, rebound snubbing, jig drops and strut stroke cycling. The 252</page><page sequence="252">912175-912184 TMC cylinder successfully completed both groups of testing with no signs of structural or functional degradation. 912176. Future military APU requirements. Edward Durkin, Wright Lab. Future tactical aircraft will have increased capabilities that will place greater demands on their secondary power systems. Added capabilities such as low observability or internal weapons storage are being planned for without significantly increasing the aircraft's size and weight. The power system must therefore have reduced volume, weight, and complexity, while also being more reliable and mantainable. The auxiliary power unit (APU) is a critical component that must be improved to upgrade the capa- bilities of the power system. Increasing the APU's power density is one important way for reducing the power system's size and weight. Increased power density, however, will require a power unit operating with higher gas generator temperatures, so this condition will be the major challenge for new APU designs. To define the effect of present and future APU development, the fol- lowing subjects are discussed: 1) estimation of the weight, perfor- mance, and a mission profile of a new multi-role fighter, 2) the development of APU technology to meet the anticipated require- ments of this aircraft, and 3) estimation of the benefits of power system improvement by estimating the life-cycle cost reduction. 912177. Challenging power density requirements for future fighter APUs. Colin Rodgers and Jack R. Shekleton , Sundstrand Power Systems. Future fighters will require more compact, lighter weight, small gas turbine auxiliary power units (APUs) capable of faster starting, and operation, up to altitudes of 50,000 ft. The US Air Force is currently supporting an advanced components auxiliary power unit (ACAPU) research program to demonstrate the tech- nologies that will be required to accomplish projected secondary power requirements for these advanced fighters. The requirements of the ACAPU program represent a chal- lenging task requiring significant technical advancements over the current state-of-the-art, prominent among which are: small high heat release high altitude airbreathing combustore; high tem- perature monolithic ceramic and metallic small turbines; and capability to operate, and transition from non-airbreathing to air- breathing modes. This paper discusses these challenging requirements and establishes technology paths to match and exceed the required goals. 1991 SAE Transactions Section 1 912180. Concorde propulsion - Did we get it right? The Rolls- Royce/Snecma Olympus 593 engine reviewed. G. A. Ganley, Rolls-Royce pic. The Olympus 593 together with its reheat, primary nozzle and secondary nozzle systems was designed and developed jointly by Rolls-Royce in Britain and Snecma in France. The design objec- tives were met so that the Concorde aircraft still carries a full pay- load of 100 passengers between Europe and America. 600,000 hours of operational experience, over half at Mach 2.0, have shown the control philosophies adopted were correct and are showing that the most significant difference between civil subsonic and supersonic engines is the cruise at high inlet air tem- peratures which has produced some unexpected mechanical affects. 912181. Concorde development - Powerplant installation and associated systems. J. E. Talbot, Airbus Div. Support, British Aerospace. Responsibilities for the various aspects of the design of Con- corde were shared between Aerospatiale and British Aerospace. This paper covers some of the lessons learnt during the design, development and in-service phases of the last 30 years in the fields covered by BAe, namely the power plant installation and its services -fuel, fire precautions, engine-intake compatibility, control systems etc. Structural problems have been dealt with extensively elsewhere. The experience gained so far in 150,000 hours of operation of which 112,500 hours have been at supersonic speeds with approx- imately 100,000 hours at Mach 2.0 have provided a very sound basis for the development and operation of the next series of supersonic transports. 1991 SAE Transactions Section 1 912183. 270 Vdc/hybrid 115 Vac electric power generating system technology demonstrator evolution to a dual-channel, more-electric aircraft technology development testbed. R. E. Nig- gemann, S. Peecher, and G. I. Rozman, Sundstrand Aerospace. Sundstrand has been investigating 270-Vdc/hybrid 115-Vac electrical power generating systems (EPGS) technology in prepa- ration for meeting the electrical power generating system (EPGS) requirements for further aircraft. Systems such as the one being investigated are likely to be suitable for the more-electric aircraft (MEA) concepts presenlyd under industry and military study. The present Sundstrand single-channel testbed is being further expanded to better understand the electrical system performance characteristics and power quality requirements of an MEA in which traditional mechanical subsystems are replaced by those of a "more-electric" nature. This paper presents the most recent Sundstrand 270-Vdc sys- tem transient performance data, and describes the modifications being made to the 270-Vdc/hybrid 115-Vac testbed. These modi- fications will allow more in-depth study of power generation, control and distribution issues and enable development of MEA subsystem and component technologies. The testbed is being expanded to include: 1) two power generation and distribution channels, each rated at 120 kW; 2) two 115-Vac, 400 Hz inverters, each rated at approximately 40 kVA; 3) a Sundstrand-designed environmental control system demonstrator with a 30 kW vari- able speed, electrically driven centrifugal compressor and non- azeotropic refrigerant mixture; 4) a Sundstrand-designed 5 hp electromechanical actuator (EMA); 5) a 250 kW 270-Vdc resis- tive loadbank; and 6) a PC based generator/system control unit (G/SCU). 912184. Condor: an all electric airplane. I. S. Mehdi, R. N. Johnson, and W. J. Hastings, Boeing Military Airplanes. Boeing has designed and built an unmanned experimental autonomously piloted vehicle called Condor, which has success- fully flown. The flight control surfaces are operated using four basic types of electromechanical actuators (EMAs). A common controller design is used to operate all EMAs. This airplane uti- lizes only electrical secondary power to operate all the subsystems in the vehicle. So it is truly an "all electric" airplane. This paper describes the Condor flight control actuation, propulsion control actuation, and electrical power generation and distribution sys- tems. Each propulsion system is controlled by a single full author- ity digital control electronics unit (CEU) with electrical actuators. A separate electronic ignition control unit (ICU) drives the spark plugs, processes camshaft position sensors, and sends speed sig- nals to the CEU and the mission computer. The electrical system consists of two engine-mounted 270 Vac oil cooled brushless hybrid homopolar generators that utilize high energy permanent magnets. The 270 Vac generator output is converted to 135 Vdc and 28 Vdc power by a dual output converter/regulator. The majority of the airplane loads are operated from the 28 Vdc power buses. The 135 Vdc power primarily is utilized for operat- ing the flight control actuation system. Uninterruptible power is provided for operating the flight-critical equipment from the 28 Vdc flight-critical bus which is backed up by a battery with diode isolation. This paper also presents some of the pertinent flight test results for the electrical distribution system, there were no signifi- 253</page><page sequence="253">912184-912195 cant problems with the all electric flight control system during the eight test flights of the airplane. 912185. High speed civil transport electrical power system technology requirements. Edward J. Woods, Boeing Co. The Boeing Company is investigating a high speed civil trans- port (HSCT) aircraft which will transport 300 passengers at speeds up to Mach 2.4. Such a high speed, high altitude aircraft presents unique environmental and safety requirements. The air- craft electric power system configuration must provide the required redundancy and reliability necessary to supply power for fly-by-wire flight control buses as well as other aircraft loads. Emergency power backup must be considered for various power failure conditions. This paper presents some of the issues affect- ing the electrical power system design, and some of the possible solutions which will be considered. 912186. Advanced power generation systems for more electric aircraft. Michael J. Cronin, Adavanced Aeronautical Systems Co. This paper describes the technologies pursuant to more elec- tric aircraft. The title "more electric aircraft" is an appropriate appellation to describe the inexorable trend toward the use of more electrics in future advanced military and commercial air- craft. This trend is sponsored and supported by the U.S. Air Force/WRDC, USN/NADC and NASA. Most recently, the Department of the Air Force issued a solicitation with the acro- nym MADMEL: power management and distribution for more electric aircraft. This a major multi-year program which includes a MADMEL ground demonstrator and flight testing of electric technologies that will replace the several multiple power sources now resident in current aircraft. The trend is not without justification since under the acro- nyms of AEA (all electric aircraft) and IDEA (integrated digital electric aircraft) studies completed by the Lockheed Aeronautical Systems Company (LASC) and Boeing revelaed major weight and cost savings as well as significant improvements in logistics/ maintenance support. NASA was the primary force behind these studies, and the programs were cost shared between NASA and the airframe companies. 912188. Auxiliary power systems requirements for commercial air transports - Past, present and future. Mike P. Miller and C. E. H ix, Boeing Commercial Airplane Group. The auxiliary power unit (APU) requirements for commercial air transports have evolved from those of a convenience item to those of a highly integrated, heavily utilized, automated and sometimes essential, airplane system. This evolution has been driven by increasing demands for reliable airframe electrical and pneumatic power, fuel and weight efficiency, reduced crew work- load, maintainability, and environmental accordance. Moreover, with the growth of extended range twin operations (ETOPS), the APU has become an essential back-up to primary airframe sys- tems. This paper reviews the APU criteria of past and present Boeing commercial jet transports and suggests the direction of future installations. 1991 SAE Transactions Section 1 912189. Secondary power system preliminary design. Richard Ullyott, Pratt &amp; Whitney Canada. Commercial gas turbine auxiliary power unit (APU) require- ments are in many respects more demanding than those for pro- pulsion engines of a similar power level. The successful modern APU design must provide high reliability and durability in a flight weight package which also satisfies diverse and often con- flicting performance requirements. The preliminary design phase represents the first crucial step toward meeting these objectives. This paper examines how the primary APU requirements influ- ence turbomachinery configuration selection, and then flow down through the preliminary design process into individual APU component and sub-system design criteria, using a load compressor APU example. 1991 SAE Transactions Section 1 912192. Concorde flight testing powerplant and performance flying. E. B. Trubshaw, British Aerospace Ltd.; and Gilbert Defer, Aerospatiale. The certification of thw Western world's first supersonic civil transport did not have the benefit of past experience as has been the case in the subsonic field. Supersonic experience was limited to military aircraft which possessed in the main a relatively short duration supersonic dash capability. Concorde has been in airline service since 1976 and has built up over 150,000 hours of which over 112,000 are at supersonic speeds on a worldwide basis. This achievement came about following a flight development and cer- tification programme covering approximately 5,500 hours over six and a half years. This wealth of experience creates a totally different scene to that existing at the time of Concorde's conception and many les- sons are avilable for the next generation of supersonic civil trans- port. 912193. Concorde, fifteen years on the front line. David Mac- Donald, British Airways. In 1962 British and French governments committed funds for the design, testing and production of a supersonic airliner. Four- teen were completed. These aircraft are currently in their six- teenth year of passenger service and, judged on their reliability, have carved out a niche in the air transport market. Behind this success lay the problems of maintaining a radically different air- craft that operates in a radically different environment. 912194. Primary fabrication processes for nickel and iron aluminides. J. R. Weir, Jr., Oak Ridge National Lab; and V. K. Sikka, Oak Ridge National Lab. Alloys based on the intermetallic compounds NÍ3AI and FeßAl have been developed. Intemetallic compounds are characteristi- cally brittle at room temperature, and some are also brittle at ele- vated temperatures. Nickel-aluminide alloys have been made ductile by alloying with a small amount of boron (200 ppm by weight) and adjusting the aluminum content to 24 at. % or less. Iron-aluminide alloys are ductile when chromium is added (&gt;wt 2%) and the aluminum is adjusted to 28 at. %. These alloys begin ordering upon solidification; therefore, a greater shrinkage must be accommodated during casting. The hot-working temperature "window" for the nickel-aluminide alloy is very narrow; how- ever, the alloy can be cold-worked large amounts. Iron-aluminde alloys have a very brod hot-working temperature range but have limited ductility (&lt;20%) at room temperature. The strength and oxidation resistance of these alloys are such that many potential applications exist. Commercialization is in progress. 1991 SAE Transactions Section 5 912195. Process control challenges during the manufacture of large superplastically formed/diffusion bonded structure. Walter Leodolter, FLAMECO. This paper discusses technological aspects of the combined metal stretch and superplastic forming/diffusion bonding (SPF/DB) process applied to the manufacture of large and struc- turally complex engine nacelle components of the C-17 advanced military airlifter. The manufacturing approach uses the McDon- nell Douglas four-sheet SPF/DB process as the principal fabrica- tion method, which in combination with the concurrent stretch is perceived as the most innovative and technologically advanced concept undertaken by the industry. The component is a compound curvature titantium 6A1-4V weld assembly made up of four, 20 mm (0.75 inch) thick sand- wich segments approximately 90 cm by 120 cm (3 feet by 4 feet) in size. 254</page><page sequence="254">912195-912210 Also addressed are the engineering and manufacturing con- cepts, quality criteria, and the need for, and challenges of predict- ing and controlling the SPF/DB process, a prerequisite for the economic viability of the technology. Among the many fabrication steps, the puchase of the raw material to final inspection, the SPF/DB process is considered a critical process which in the context of this dissertation, implies that the quality of the product is solely dependent on the execu- tion of the process itself. 912200. Single lever power management of turboprop engines. L. C. Prevallet, Garret Engine Div., Allied-Signal Aerospace. Historically, turboprop engines have been controlled via two levers in the cockpit -one adjusting engine speed and the other controlling engine power. Engine power was controlled by speed lever and fuel flow (a function of power lever angle). The pilot had to adjust the speed level to obtain the desired engine speed setting, then he would "close the loop" on torque (his primary control parameter) by watching a gage and moving the power lever angle (PLA). This resulted in significant pilot effort in read- justing the engine to different power levels/operating modes. The control system for the TPF351-20 engine, as applied to the embraer CBA123 aircraft, is designed to reduce pilot work- load by providing a single lever system that controls the engine to a torque commanded by the power lever position. This was made possible by the use of a full-authority digital engine control (FADEC). In order to maximize the use of the FADEC in the reduction of pilot workload, it is tied via various serial data busses on the aircraft to the air data computer, the autopilot, and engine indica- tion and crew alerting system (EICAS). These inputs allow the FADEC to schedule torque linearly versus power level command, and to hold each engine to within 1 percent torque of each other which prevents undesirable power lever splits or aircraft yaw. The FADEC also uses the autopilot inputs to adjust engine power during approach to keep the aircraft on the specified glide slope. Pilot workload, aircraft performance, and maintainability are significantly improved by the state-of-the-art advances made in control of turboprop engines on the TPF351-20. 912204. Enhanced vision system option on future aircraft. Paul R. Leckman, Boeing Commercial Airplane Group. An enhanced vision system (EVS) displays sensor derived information to the pilot, usually on a head up display (HUD). The use of at least one on-board sensor would allow the pilot to visualize the runway environment when conventional flight visi- bility would not permit this. The components of the system are integrated in a way that takes into account the specific task to be accomplished and the associated human factors. The technology for EVS appears to be available. There is a potential for EVS to provide added situational awareness for flight crews. One challenge is to determine whether EVS can be economically justified. However, its potential for improving situ- ational awareness may outweigh any economic disadvantage. Airport capacity during fog conditions could be improved. Addi- tionally, the pilot's ability to avoid runway incursions under night/low visibility conditions could be substantially improved. The discussion includes: 1) the EVS option on future produc- tion aircraft, and 2) development of a synthetic vision system (SWS) for the high speed civil transport (HSCT). These two proj- ects are overlapping at this time due to their similar nature. 1991 SAE Transactions Section 1 912208. 94 GHz MMW imaging radar system. YairAlon and Lon Ulmer, Lear Astronics Corp. The 94 GHz MMW airborne radar system that provides a run- way image in adverse weather conditions is now undergoing tests at Wright-Patterson Air Force Base (WPAFB). This system, which consists of a solid state FMCW transceiver, antenna and digital signal processor, has an update rate of 10 times per second, 0.35° azimuth resolution and up to 3.5 meter range resolution. The radar B Scope (range versus azimuth) image, once converted to C scope (elevation versus azimuth), is compatible with the standard TV presentation and can be displayed on the head up display (HUD) or head down display (HDD) to aid the pilot dur- ing landing and takeoff in limited visibility conditions. 912209. (SP-886) Designing design processes in decision- based concurrent engineering. Bert Bras and Farrokh Mistree, Systems Design Lab., Dept. of Mech. Engrg., University of Hous- ton. We believe that the efficiency and effectiveness of human designers can be improved by making available tools that can be used to help negotiate solutions to open or unstructured parts of the process of designing. We assert that the efficiency and effec- tiveness of a designer can be increased by increasing the speed with which the design iteration is accomplished and reducing of the number of iterations. An increment in the iteration speed can be achieved if at least some parts of a design process are known and can be modelled on a computer. One way of reducing the number of iterations in design is by avoiding this corrective rede- sign. This provides the stimulus for developing approaches to design that include concurrent engineering considerations. Thus, in our opinion, a necessary ingredient in increasing efficiency and effectiveness of human designers is the modeling of design pro- cesses in a manner that they can be analyzed, manipulated and implemented. This is the central theme of our paper. 1991 SAE Transactions Section 5 912210. (SP-886) The development and implementation of a comprehensive concurrent engineering method: theory and appli- cation. James M. Schmitz, Dept. of Mech. Engrg., Carnegie- Mellon Univ.; and S. Desa, Dept. of Mech. Engrg., Carnegie Mel- lon Univ. In recent times, concurrent engineering (CE) has been pro- posed in order to overcome the costly and time-consuming short- comings of long-standing product development methods. Simul- taneous engineering teams are typically formed to join the prod- uct designer to provide analysis and reasoning about potential manufacturing, assembly, and performance problems and costs that may result if the current design embodiment is further devel- oped. The designer must take into account these "predictions" and suggestions before finalizing the design, since the final design specifications do determine most of product development costs and results. However, both the theory and implementation of these CE methods must be re-formulated to eliminate their short- comings and to maximize productivity. We propose that a com- plete, successful CE development method must be based on 3 fundamental concepts. These concepts lay the foundation for an ideal product development method. Briefly, this ideal method removes the "guess-work" made by the simultaneous engineering team in predicting future development costs and results, and in generating design improvements; it establishes explicit cause- effect links from design specifications through ensuing develop- ment costs and results; and it establishes a standard forum for communication between development stage experts. This ideal method actually is not feasibile to implement, but by construct- ing a computer network to provide thorough engineering analysis and procedures, such as manufacturing cost estimating and pro- cess verification, we propose a comprehensive development method, which is centered at the design stage, called virtual con- current engineering (VCE). Using this method and implementa- tion network, a product designer can develop his initial design, through automated design evaluation and computer-generated design modifications, so that it is optimized in development cost, reliability, and time, and product performance and quality, all before any real commitments are made in manufacturing, assem- bly, prototyping, etc. We discuss an application of this develop- 255</page><page sequence="255">912210-912218 ment method (VCE) to the design and manufacture of stampings, and conclude by claiming that both man and machine will be needed to carry-out optimal, but realistic, product development. 1991 SAE Transactions Section 5 912211. (SP-886) Managing constraints in integrated and cooperative product development. H. M. Karandikar, West Vir- ginia Univ. Cooperative product development is the principal mechanism for supporting concurrent engineering. In large organizations, cooperative product development is expected to take place with the involvement of teams of geographically separated product developers working in a distributed and heterogeneous computer environment. Communication, cooperation, and coordination are essential for cooperative product development by members of a product development team virtually co-located over a net- work. The coordination framework in a computer-based coopera- tive product development environment is responsible for com- municating work, securing focus, and ensuring progress toward a goal. A necessary function of the coordination framework, pro- vided by a constraint management system, is the ability to cap- ture and manage the constraints in the product development pro- cess. The development of a prototype constraint management system is discussed in this paper. The requirements of a con- straint management system are specified and further work in con- straint management, in the context of applications to product development, is outlined. 1991 SAE Transactions Section S 912212. Aging aircraft and structural airworthiness. Richard Johnson , Federal Aviation Administration. The continued safe operation of the U.S. commercial airplane fleet will depend upon the ability to anticipate required adjust- ments in the inspection and maintenance activités to compensate for the "aging" process. Increasing numbers of aircraft are exceeding their economic design life-the age at which they have historically been retired from major airline service. Presumably, commercial aircraft are designed for "infinite life with proper maintenance." But public confidence in operators abilities to properly maintain older aircraft significantly diminished follow- ing the widely publicized failure of the Aloha Airlines Boeing 737 fuselage in 1988. The FAA established the National Aging Aircraft Research Program to address this diminished public confidence in the air- lines* ability to properly maintain their older aircraft. The goal of this program is to assure the continued structural airworthiness of the U.S. commercial fleet of in-service and future airplanes beyond their economic design lives. This will be achieved through improvements in equipment, techniques, practices, and procedures in airframe and engine structural design, repair, maintenance, and inspection. 1991 SAE Transactions Section 1 912214. Sikorski (S-76) high intensity radiated fields (HIRF) test. Jerry T. Blair ; Scientech , Inc. Concern over the effect of high intensity radiated fields (HIRF) on civil and military aircraft has increased over the past ten years. The increase is due to several factors which affect the safe flight of all fixed-wing and rotorcraft. Previous flight-critical mechanical controls are being replaced by electronic computer-driven controls, manufacturers are increasing the use of composite materials in the fabrication of new aircraft structures, and freqency ranges and output power levels of commercial and military transmitters have significantly increased. While much HIRF susceptibility information has been col- lected, the data are proprietary and have not been released. To address the HIRF concerns and begin development of a releasable HIRF database, the FAA Technical Center, Atlantic City International Airport, NJ, has implemented a HIRF research program. As part of that program, a HIRF test was per- formed on a Sikorsky S-76 helicopter. This paper addresses the purpose, approach, and initial findings of the S-76 HIRF test. 1991 SAE Transactions Section 1 912215. Engineering status of the McDonnell Douglas HSCT program. H. Robert Welge, Jason O. Sutton, and Munir Metw- ally, Douglas Aircraft Co., McDonnell Douglas Corp. A combination of factors including market growth and engi- neering technology advancements in the next few years have raised the possibility of an economically and environmentally viable high-speed commercial transport (HSCT). McDonnell Douglas studies have found that the primary candidate for this application is a vehicle cruising at Mach 2.4. An engineering and environmentally conservative configuration cruising at Mach 1.6 is also being studied. The vehicle incorporates numerous advanced features including an airframe consisting of advanced composites and metals. Takeoff gross weights are on the order of 700,000 to 800,000 pounds for a design range of 5,500 nautical miles. Studies are focused on entry into service in the year 2005, with the authority to proceed with preliminary and full-scale development in 1998. 912216. Advances in aircraft component superplastic forming/ diffusion bonding technology. C. F. Barth , Jet Die/ Barnes Group, Inc. A wide variety of manufacturing operations are utilized to fab- ricate the complete spectrum of components necessary for con- temporary aircraft. Compounding the challenges inherent in uti- lizing these diverse manufacturing operations are the stringent quality, weight, and cost requirements for flight critical hardware. The industry maintains continuing efforts to meet these chal- lenges with innovations in both component design as well as manufacturing technologies. The Jet Die Division of Barnes Aerospace Group, as a supplier of fabricated components to the aerospace industry, has partici- pated in continued development of related manufacturing tech- nologies. This paper addresses a specific advance in fabrication technology that will have wide applications for both airframe and engine requirements. Inherent with any advances in manufactur- ing technology are the emergence of new challenges to maximum utilization of that technology. Some of the key issues to be consid- ered for present and future applications are also outlined relative to this manufacturing technology development, the sutton core process. 1991 SAE Transactions Section 1 912217. Multiple hollow sphere core sandwich fabrication. Frank Gojny and Brian N orris, Rohr Industries, Inc. Sandwich structures fabricated with a core of hollow spheres offer performance and cost advantages over honeycomb core structures for many advanced aerospace applications. This light- weight isotropic core provides strength and stiffness with a mini- mum of weight - a critical requirement in many advanced appli- cations. Cost savings can be achieved by replacing expensive machined solid members, co-bonding the core and panel, reduc- ing consumable tooling and cutting production fit-up and assem- bly time. 912218. Advanced balancing using laser machining./. F. Wal- ton and M. Cronin, Mechanical Technology Inc.; and Ramesh Mehta , Textron Lycoming. The development of a pilot production, automated laser bal- ancing system and the results of metallurgical evaluations of laser machined materials are presented in this paper. The automated laser balancing system is designed to low speed balance, small gas turbine engine components, such as AGT1500 compressors, tur- bines and shafts in a single load and spin-up cycle. A high power pulsed Nd:YAG laser is used to remove material from compo- nents while they rotate at speeds to 2,000 rpm for increased bal- 256</page><page sequence="256">912218-912231 ance precision and efficiency. Metallurgical examinations of laser affected zones in turbine engine materials such as 17-22A(s), IN718, AM355, Waspaloy and IN713LC as well as material fatigue testing are presently being conducted to assess the effects of the laser material removal process on both material and com- ponent fatigue life. This paper, however, presents a summary of only the 17-22A(s) results. Specimens representing manual hand- ground balanced and as-machined new components were also prepared and fatigue tested for comparison with the laser machined specimens. Preliminary results indicate that both the hand grinding and laser machining degrade material fatigue strength. Laser machining does appear to degrade material fatigue life to a greater extent than handgrinding. However, when comparing the material fatigue life to the required life for a 17- 22A(s) component, the laser machined material does retain ade- quate life for that component. Efforts are underway to develop laser machining processing approaches which do not degrade component life for AM355, Waspaloy, IN718, and IN713LC materials. 1991 SAE Transactions Section S 912219. (SP-886) Automatic finite element mesh generation for the automation of parametric conceptual design. Hyunik Yang and D. A. Hoeltzel, Dept. of Mech. Engrg., Columbia Univ. An approach for the automatic generation and refinement of three dimensional finite element meshes subdivided by rigid body movable subdomains has been developed. A combination of computational goemetry and geometric modeling techniques have been employed to implement parametric computer-aided design based on the finite element method. To demonstrate the utility of this approach to parametric redesign, a series of meshes that model a hip joint prostesis and a reciprocating internal com- bustion engine have been generated. 1991 SAE Transactions Section 5 912220. (SP-886) Computer aided life-cycle design. Kosuke Ishii and Steven Krizan , Dept. of Mech. Engrg., Ohio State Univ. This paper focueses on the use of design compatibility analysis (DCA) to maximize the life-cycle value of mechanical systems. Early stages of design affect various issues that comprise the life- cycle cost of products as well as reliability and serviceability. Our research uses the concept of DCA to model the life-cycle cost and customer value of mechanical systems. DCA focuses on good and bad examples of designs and gives an overall evaluation of designs and gives an overall evaluation of designs in a normalized scale. This paper summarizes the methodologies and computer tools developed at the life-cycle engineering lab at Ohio State. Specifically, the paper describes computer programs that evaluate layout designs and give suggestions for improvement. 1 991 SAE Transactions Section 5 912222. Aircraft ground deicing. Charles O. Masters, Aviation Safety Div., Flight Safety Research Branch, FAA. Deicing and anti-icing of aircraft prior to flight in hazardous precipitation including snow, freezing rain, freezing drizzle and other conditions conducive to aircraft surface icing has become the main method for removing and preventing the freezing of contaminants on aircraft wings, control surfaces and other criti- cal components. In turn the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) has promulgated requirements that endorse a "clean air- craft concept" for aircraft that operate under the various federal aviation regulations. Recent advances in aircraft deicing and anti-icing methodologies, materials, equipments and procedures have fostered the need for a review and possible updating of FAA advisory and regulatory materials and other information on the subject. This paper discusses, in general, ongoing efforts to enhance aviation safety relative to aircraft ground deicing and anti-icing, and related ground operations in hazardous weather conditions conducive to aircraft icing. 912224. Development and evaluation of an onboard aircraft cabin water spray system for postcrash fire protection. Richard G. Hill, Constantine P. Sarkos, and Timothy R. Marker, FAA Tech- nical Center. This paper outlines a program that could ultimately lead to design standards for an onboard aircraft cabin water spray system to suppress postcrash fires. A biref summary of the program and the status of current activities is presented. The latter includes full-scale effectiveness tests, a study of possible problems arising from the inadvertent (or intentional) discharge of the system, and computation of the potential benefits (lives saved) from the man- datory requirement of such a system. The bulk of the paper describes the results of full-scale tests under several postcrash fire scenarios to measure the increased survival rate when using a water spray system. It is shown that a water spray system may provide passengers 2 to 3 minutes of additional time to escape under certain postcrash fire scenarios. 1991 SAE Transactions Section 1 912225. (SP-885) British Airways airbus A320 pilots' autothrust survey. Steve Last and Martin Alder, British Airways. The Airbus A320 has an autothrust system which is unique among transport aircraft in not having feedback movement pro- vided to the pilots' thrust levers. There has been some contro- versy in the airline world over the operational aspects of this sys- tem. As British Airways was one of the earliest operators of the type, a survey was conducted to determine the views of line pilots as to the advantages and disadvantages of the system compared with conventional moving levers. This paper contains the results of that survey. It was concluded that the A320 design provides advantages in respect to engagement and selection of rated power settings, and that movement provides better disengagement and information on system function. BA concludes that from a flight operations perspective a future system should consider providing movement between the idle and climb power positions, whilst retaining the A320 thrust setting and engagement "detents" tech- nique. 912229. Recent manufacturing advances for spiral bevel gears. Robert F. Handschuh and Robert C. Bill, U.S. Army Aviation Sys- tems Command, Lewis Research Center. The U.S. Army Aviation Systems Command (AVSCOM), through the propulsion directorate at NASA Lewis Research Cen- ter, has recently sponsored projects to advance the manufacturing process for spiral bevel gears. This type of gear is a critical compo- nent in rotary-wing propulsion systems. Two successfully com- pleted contracted projects are described. The first project addresses the automated inspection of spiral bevel gears through the use of coordinate measuring machines. The second project entails the computer-numerical-control (CNC) conversion of a sprial bevel gear grinding machine that is used for all aerospace sprial bevel gears. The results of these projects are described with regard to the savings effected in manufacturing time. 1991 SAE Transactions Section 1 912231. Abrasive-waterjet machining of ceramic-coated mate- rials. James Whalen, G E Aircraft Engines; and M. Hashish, QUEST Integrated, Inc. This paper addresses an experimental investigation on the fea- sibility of using abrasive-waterjets (AWJs) for the precision drill- ing of small-diameter holes in advanced aircraft engine compo- nents. These components are sprayed with ceramic thermal bar- rier coating (TBC), and the required holes are typically 0.025 inch in diameter with a drilling angle of 25°. The parameters of the AWJ were varied to study their effects on both quantitative and qualitative hole drilling parameters. The unique techniques of assisting the abrasive feed process, ramping the waterjet pressure during drilling, and varying the jet dwell time after peircing were effectively implemented to control hole quality and size. The results of the experiments indicate the accuracy and repeatability 257</page><page sequence="257">912231-912273 of the AWJ technique in meeting the air flow and hole size requie- ments. Production parts were drilled for prototype engine testing. 1991 SAE Transactions Section 1 912232. Configuration design and recovery considerations for a staged SST. Nikos Mills, Todd Lawson, and Jan Roskam, Aero- space Engrg. Dept., University of Kansas. The design and recovery considerations are presented for a staged supersonic transport (SSST). It is shown that the SSST offers economic benefits over the conventional SST. The SSST benefits from the ability to "optimize" the design for minimum drag during supersonic cruise without the penalties of: landing gear, extensive flaps for landing, and the meeting of FAR 36 noise requirements. The recovery considerations are also presented to validate the SSST concept. 1991 SAE Transactions Section 1 912233. Damage tolerance philosophy for fiber/metal lami- nates. R. G. Pettit, Douglas Aircraft Co., McDonnell Douglas Corp. In this paper, structural advantages relating to the fatigue- insensitive, tear-resistant behavior of fiber/metal laminates are discussed in the context of future aircraft design needs. High- altitude aircraft (41,000 feet plus) will have special fuselage design requirements because a rapid decompression could be lethal to passengers. The likelihood of such an incident would be significantly reduced by the use of fatigue-resistant materials. A rational damage tolerance philosophy is proposed for fiber/ metal laminate structures in order to ensure ultimate load capa- bility throughout the design life with reduced inspection require- ments compared to monolithic materials. Attributes of the pro- posed method are compared to conventional fatigue and damage tolerance approaches. 1991 SAE Transactions Section 1 912234. The induced thrust effect; a propulsion method. Salvatore Cezar Pais, Case Western Reserve Univ. This paper deals with a thrust generation method which can be applied to nuclear as well as chemical propulsion systems. It takes into consideration both incompressible and compressible flow cases, however both of these cases are based on one dimen- sional flow within an ideal rocket framework. In the case of constant area duct steady state flow the obtained induced thrust (IT) formula is: IT = (p22U2U*A)/(pi-p2) where p2 and p2 are opposing pressure fields and u* is a function of U2, P2 an udì (ui and U2 being opposing gas efflux velocities). For the compressible and incompressible flow fields, IT formulas are obtained but they are not as reliable. One feasible application for this launch-propulsion method is the joined-ship model. In this model the combustion chamber pressure within one space vehicle acts as the back pressure of the joined space vehicle and vice-versa. When the adaptive shroud that connects the two vehicles separates, the impulse resulting from plume impingement generated by the individual vehicles moving in opposite directions gives rise to the extra force which makes (IT) exceed ordinary thrust; that is thrust obtained from the two vehicles if their combustion chambers were fired individ- ually (unlike the joined-ship model where the space ships are ini- tially connected). The mathematical algorithm used to analyze the concept pres- ented in this paper is original to the best of the author's knowl- edge. 912235. Implementing datalink across the pacific. R. Scott Stahr, United Airlines. Material for this paper was developed in conjunction with an ADS and two-way ATC data communications engineering trials program involving primarily the FAA technical center, ARINC, and United Airlines under the terms of a memorandum of agree- ment signed in September 1989 by the Administrator of the FAA and the Chairman and CEO of United Airlines, Stephen A. Wolf. It was agreed that the focus of effort would be directed to long- range operations over the Pacific Ocean utilizing the SATCOM system developed by Collins Radio, installed and certified by the Boeing Company on a 747-400 aircraft, and an INMARSAT sat- ellite with digital data communications service provided by the COMSAT Corporation. 912270. (P-250) State of the art in automobile cathodic protec- tion. Robert Baboian, Texas Instruments Inc. The use of cathodic protection for metals can be accomplished by sacrificial protection and impressed current protection. This paper discusses the application and misapplication of cathodic protection to automobiles. Fundamental principles and require- ments for successful use of this technology are reviewed, includ- ing the important effect of electrolyte resistance on current flow. Laboratory and field tests show that in the atmospheric automo- bile environment, cathodic protection beyond a few centimeters from the anode is not possible. Distributing the anode, such as in galvanized steel, solves the problem for sacrificial protection and therefore, this technique is used extensively on automobiles. However, distributing the anode for impressed current protection of automobiles is not currently economical. Therefore, successful commercial application of impressed current protection of auto- mobiles has not occurred. 1991 SAE Transactions Section S 912271. (P-250) Evaluation of environmentally acceptable sub- stitutes for cadmium plating. Mark Ingle and Tom Marchesani, Ocean City Research Corp. Cadmium has been identified as a threat to work health and the environment. A test program was conducted to evaluate the performance of environmentally acceptable substitutes for cad- mium plating. Fifteen test coatings were exposed to natural marine, industrial, and rural atmospheres for 12 months. Addi- tional laboratory tests were conducted to determine coating abra- sion resistance, adhesion, fastener breaking torque, and electro- chemical behavior. The relative merits and limitations associated with the alternative cadmium substitutes are discussed. 1991 SAE Transactions Section S 912272. (P-250) Properties of zinc alloy coated steel sheets obtained by continuous vapor deposition pilot-line. Junji Kawa- fuku and Jun Katoh , Iron and Steel Research Lab., Kobe Steel, Ltd.; Masao Toy ama, Steel Wire Rod and Bar Development Dept., Kobe Steel, Ltd.; and Kouki Ikeda, Hidetoshi Nishimoto, and Hiroshi Satoh, Materials Research Lab., Kobe Steel, Ltd. New vapor deposited zinc alloy coatings, which are Zn-Mg, Zn-Al, Zn-Cr, Zn-Ni and Zn-Ti coatings, have been developed by vapor deposition pilot-line. Morphology of surface structure, depth profile of alloy compo- sition and crystal structure have been studied for these coatings. Zn-Mg alloy coated steel sheet showed the best corrosion resis- tance. The corrosion behavior of this coating has been investi- gated. The coating surface is densely covered with a corrosion product layer composed of ZnCl2*4Zn(OH)2, which could play a role as a protective barrier film. The corrosion potential remains active enough to give the substrate galvanic protection for a long time in a corrosive environment. 912273. (P-250) Processes of blister formation in electrodepos- ited coatings on steel. J. H. Payer and G. M. Michal, Dept. of Materials Science and Engrg., Case Western Reserve Univ. A research program in progress to examine the processes of blister formation in electrodeposited coatings on steel is described. The objective is to develop methods to design and con- trol the surface of steel sheet to increase the reliability and perfor- mance of electrogalvanized steel products. Adhesion at the elec- tro-deposit/steel interface is essential for the performance of pro- tective coatings, and adhesion is controlled by the chemistry, 258</page><page sequence="258">912273-912279 structure, and morphology of the interface. A combination of multiple experimental techniques and analytical models is being used to better understand the mechanisms of adhesion loss, the role of hydrogen, and the role of surface composition. 1991 SAE Transactions Section S 912274. (P-250) The corrosion performance of automotive trim systems. Joseph T. Lentine, Inland Fisher Guide Div., General Motors Corp. A proving ground trailer test was conducted on twenty trim materials mounted to three different body panel substrates. The trim materials tested include a detailed stainless steel evaluation, chrome flashed and nickel/chrome plated stainless steels, stain- less steel bilaminates, bimetal, and plated rolled zinc. The body panel substrates were cold rolled steel and 60G60G and 70G70G electrogalvanized steel. The trim materials were tested in grounded and isolated conditions to determine the galvanic inter- action with the body panel substrates. The test data has been cor- related to field surveys in Detroit and Montreal for further valid- ity. 1991 SAE Transactions Section 5 912275. (P-250) Progress by the automotive and steel indus- tries toward an improved laboratory cosmetic corrosion test. R. D. Granata, Lehigh Univ.; W. A. Schumacher, General Motors Corp.; D. C. McCune, Quality /Statistics; R. J. Neville, Dofasco, Inc.; and H. E. Townsend, Homer Research Labs., Bethlehem Steel Corp. A cooperative effort by the North American automotive and steel industries is being spear-headed by the Corrosion Task Force of the American Iron and Steel Institute (AISI). This work is aimed at development of an improved laboratory accelerated test for ranking the cosmetic corrosion resistance of automotive steel sheet products. In this paper, we review the AISI program including its objective, approach, and relationships with other organizations, particularly with SAE's automotive corrosion and prevention committee. Results of four cyclic laboratory tests con- sidered by the task force are compared to those of two-year on- vehicle tests conducted in the severely corrosive environments of St. John's, Newfoundland and Montreal, Quebec. Statistical methods are used to depict the material rankings of each test, and to compare the rankings between the laboratory and field tests. Corrosion mechanisms in the AISI cyclic tests are described in terms of the mode of attack and corrosion products as deter- mined by a variety of analytical methods. Although the AISI cyclic tests give a good correlation with scribe creep of coated sheet in the on-vehicle test, they underestimate the amount of scribe creep exhibited by cold rolled steel, thus indicating that further improvement is needed. Nevertheless, the AISI cyclic tests are much better than the ASTM B117 salt spray test which is shown to be totally unsuitable for ranking the cosmetic corro- sion resistance of coated steel sheet products. 1991 SAE Transactions Section S 912277. (P-250) Further developments toward a standard accelerated corrosion test for automotive materials .Frits Blekken- horst and Evert Nagel Soepenberg, Research and Works Labs., Hoogovens Ijmuiden. To fill the gap between accelerated laboratory corrosion test- ing and real world corrosion behaviour Hoogovens developed its cyclic corrosion test within a European framework. In 1989 Hoo- govens presented during the SAE A.C.A.P. corrosion conference in Dearborn the results of its newly developed accelerated cyclic corrosion test dealing with the work carried out within the frame- work of an extensive test programme established by the automo- tive applications committee of the American Iron and Steel Insti- tute. Objective of this AISI program is to develop a reliable labora- tory accelerated test for cosmetic corrosion resistance in order to obtain a realistic ranking of automotive steel sheet products. In 1990 a second test series was carried out with the Hoogo- vens cyclic test on the same type of test materials as was used in the first test series. These materials are various precoated and bare automotive sheet steels, pretreated and painted with a stan- dard automotive coating system. Objectives of this second program were to establish the repro- ducibility of the Hoogovens cyclic test and the effect of time, type of scribing, depth of scribe and type of assessment of paint delam- ination on the ranking of the various materials in terms of paint creep from the scribe. Moreover, the influence of three different statistical tech- niques (student's with and without pooled variances and the ranksum test) on the discrimination of the various materials was established. In this paper the results of the work are presented and dis- cussed. 912278. (P-250) An assessment of nine accelerated atmo- spheric corrosion sites on the cosmetic corrosion performance of the AISI materials - Interim report. Frank Lutze and R. James Shaffer, Advanced Coating Technologies, Inc. A series of painted materials were exposed at nine atmo- spheric corrosion test sites around the world as part of the AISI/ SAE cosmetic corrosion program. The object of the exposure pro- gram was to assess the impact of accelerated atmospheric weath- ering on the cosmetic corrosion performance of the AISI materi- als and to determine if the accelerated atmospheric environment ranked the performance of materials in the same order as on- vehicle field testing. Accelerated atmospheric weathering was added to the AISI/SAE test program to round out the testing pro- gram and provide another "environment" in which to assess cos- metic corrosion. Accelerated weathering is believed to represent the closest test methodology to simulate actual field testing, the environment in which the materials must perform. The program is continuing, and after 15 months exposure, results are compared to the performance of the same materials in actual on-vehicle field exposure in the Canadian provinces of Quebec and New Foundland (Montreal and St. Johns). Statistical methods are used to compare the rankings of materials at each site against the on-vehicle field results. Interim results indicate that all sites rank material perfor- mance similar to the field results and confirm that accelerated atmospheric exposure can rank material performance on-vehicle. 1991 SAE Transactions Section S 912279. (P-250) Corrosion protection of galvanized steel sheet - Corrosion investigation of field vehicle. Kimitaka Hayashi and Yasuhiko Miyoshi, Steel Research Labs., Nippon Steel Corp.; and Yoichi Ito, Coordination Div., Nippon Steel Corp. Three doors from three field vehicles made with one-side gal- vanized steel on the inside of the outer panels were investigated for perforation corrosion using microscopic and analytical meth- ods after 8 or 10 years' field exposure in the snow-belt areas of North America. Perforation of these doors occurred within the lapped part of the door hems. Outer panel perforation began at the zinc layer on the inside surface of the outer panel at the lapped part and/or at the "bent part" of the outer panel of the door hems. Details of the micro corrosion behavior for the inside surface of the outer panel were made clear using EPMA analyses. The corro- sion products on the inside surface of the outer panel were identi- fied with X-ray diffraction. Initially, zinc corrosion begins at the zinc coating layer of the upper side at the wax-free zone of the lapped part. Eventually zinc corrosion occurred beneath the wax layer as "under-film corro- sion", proceeding gradually from the bottom to the top of the lapped part. The zinc is transformed into ZnO from the protec- tive ZnCl2*4Zn(OH)2 initial product. Eventually, the steel sub- strate corrodes after the zinc coating loses its sacrificial corrosion protection. The steel is transformed into Fe304 and a, y-FeOOH. 259</page><page sequence="259">912279-912285 It was found that this corrosion behavior was a common phe- nomena for the observed door hems. 1991 SAE Transactions Section 5 912280. (P-250) Combined corrosion/weathering testing of coated steel products for automotive applications. Brian S. Skerry, Charles H. Simpson, and Guy R. Wilson, Sherwin Williams Co. An accelerated test method comprising wet/dry corrosion cycling using a 0.05 wt% NaCI/0.35 wt% (NH^SCU electrolyte alternating with exposures in a UV-condensation chamber using UVA-340 fluorescent bulbs has recently been developed primar- ily for assessing industrial maintenance paint performance. In the present work, this method has been applied to a series of 10 coated sheet steel materials intended for automotive applica- tions; the same materials under test in a joint AISI/SAE study. The results indicate that the test weathering component caused little degradation to the automotive paint. Paint creepback from scribe lines on phosphated/cold-rolled steel materials were accel- erated by factors ranging between 5 -7.6 when compared with 2 year field data obtained by the AISI/SAE. Equivalent accelera- tion factors for zinc coated steels were an order of magnitude greater implying that at least two distinct degradation mecha- nisms occurred during testing depending on the presence or absence of a zinc precoat. Suggested alterations to the test method for these materials include a more aggressive UV component and an electrolyte modified in terms of its composition and concen- tration. 912281. (P-250) A new electrochemical method for scab corro- sion. Toshiaki Shimakura , Yutaka Ishida, and Tomomi Watanabe, Nippon Paint Co., Ltd. A new electrochemical method for the scab corrosion test has been developed. Cathodic peak current density in multi-cyclic voltammetry can evaluate scab corrosion resistance of zinc phos- phate coatings. A good correlation is obtained between the cathodic peak current density and the scab blister width in out- door exposure test. This peak current density is related to the oxy- gen reduction current density and the reduction current density of ferrous ions dissolved from the surface of phosphated steel. Accordingly, the cathodic peak current density is valuable for reproducible and rapid scab corrosion testing of zinc phosphate coatings. 912282. (P-250) A statistically designed study of atmospheric corrosion simulating automotive field conditions using a high per- formance climate chamber- Status report of work in progress. Mats Ström, Volvo Car Corp.; Gunnar Ström, AB Volvo ; Wim J. van Ooij, Ashok Sabata, and Ricole A. Edwards, Armco Research and Technology ; and A. C. Ramamurthy, BASF Corp. An extensive atmospheric corrosion test program to simulate automotive field conditions has been undertaken. The aim of this project is to identify the necessary and sufficient key corrosion variables in appropriate dosage levels in order to design an indoor general purpose accelerated corrosion test. This approach is based on a careful study of outdoor condi- tions that an automobile typically would encounter along with inputs from current understanding in the area of corrosion and material properties. A 26*3 factorial design was used to implement this test program. Simulating conditions such as humidity, tem- perature cycling, acid and/or salt depositions, generation of dew and the presence of minute amounts of air pollutants have been achieved by the design and implementation of a high perfor- mance climate chamber. A large matrix of painted metal substrates and some bare metal samples along with previously studied AISI samples consti- tute this study. Outdoor exposure included panels mounted on vehicles, exposure at various global field sites as well as different variations of outdoor scab-testing. Chemical, physical and morphological characterization of selected samples will be made using surface analytical techniques such as XPS, Auger, SEM/EDAX and TOF SIMS. Another facet of this study involves on-line monitoring by electrochemical impedance spectroscopy of the corrosion in progress in the indoor study. 912283. (P-250) SAE ACAP Division 3 project: statistical evaluation of accelerated corrosion test results and correlation with two-year, on-vehicle field results. Michael Petschel, Jr., Parker+Amchem. This is the second paper which describes the activities of the SAE automotive corrosion and prevention (ACAP) division 3 (environmental mechanisms) cosmetic corrosion subcommit- tee's evaluation of cosmetic corrosion test methods using the American Iron and Steel Institute (AISI) supplied test materials. The results from fourteen corrosion tests are compared with field results obtained after two years of on-vehicle exposure in Mon- treal and St. John's, Canada. Standard statistical methods for treating such data are used. The accelerated tests that were evalu- ated include cyclic, environmental, outdoor, as well as proving ground tests. Conclusions are drawn regarding the use of these tests and suggestions are made for further work. 1991 SAE Transactions Section S 912284. (P-250) An evaluation and analysis of commonly used accelerated cosmetic corrosion tests using direct comparisons with actual field exposure. Dennis D. Davidson, Chrysler Motors Corp.; and William A. Schumacher ; General Motors Corp. Direct comparisons of scribe creepage measurements were made between accelerated cosmetic corrosion tests and 2 year field exposure results from St. John's Newfoundland. Test accel- eration rates were calculated for each of the ten AISI materials and their correlation with the field exposure was determined. Comparisons are made using twelve different cyclic corrosion tests, 3 laboratory environmental; 2 highway trailer and 3 prov- ing grounds tests. All of the tests that were investigated acceler- ated the zinc-coated steels at a higher rate than cold rolled steel. The range of the higher acceleration was from 1.4 up to 110 times the field rate. The most favorable tests were the two outdoor scab tests at sea coastal sites, two proving ground test cycles and a highway trailer test. The laboratory test with the most favorable response was the GM 9450 P, method B cyclic corrosion test. Environmental conditions of the tests were analyzed for common features to understand the factors which have the most influence upon the acceleration rate of zinc-coated and cold rolled materi- als. Suggestions for modifying these cosmetic corrosion tests to obtain a more equal acceleration rate are given. 1991 SAE Transactions Section S 912285. (P-250) A review of perforation corrosion testing - 1980 to 1990. L. A. Roudabush, Div. of USX Corp., U.S. Steel Group ; and T. E. Dorsett, Metal Coatings International, Inc. In the past decade, the major emphasis on automotive corro- sion testing has been on the cosmetic performance of outer body panels. A number of accelerated and long terms tests have been established to evaluate the cosmetic corrosion resistance of mate- rials systems. In this time frame, perforation corrosion resistance was addressed by automotive companies through the use of heav- ier coated sheet steels, pre-applied organic coatings, and improved design considerations, and performance corrosion evaluations were primarily accomplished by full vehicle proving grounds testing. However, proving ground testing is not a viable alternative for materials suppliers, and there is no consensus on a standard, reliable laboratory test for perforation corrosion eval- uations. As an objective of the peforation corrosion subcommit- tee of SAE ACAP division 3, a literature review was conducted to document the basic aspects of perforation corrosion, and to compile the various methods for evaluating perforation corro- sion of body panels in the automotive environment, including 260</page><page sequence="260">912285-912295 test panel configurations, corrosion test procedures, and evalua- tion techniques. 1991 SAE Transactions Section S 912286. (P-250) Influence of structure, composition and sur- face morphology on coating adhesion and painted corrosion per- formance of ZnNi alloy coated sheet steels. C. R. Shastry ; Homer Research Labs., Bethlehem Steel Corp. A number of ZnNi coatings were investigated to determine the effect of phase structure, composition and surface morphology on coating adhesion and painted corrosion performance. The differ- ences in the coating characteristics were achieved by controlled variation of selected process parameters in series of pilot studies and production trials. It was seen that the coating adhesion, as measured in a draw bead simulator test, is influenced by the Ni content and the morphology of the coating, with 13%Ni and a micronodular surface morphology favoring good coating adhe- sion. Results of scribe/chipping corrosion tests shown that paint creepage from the scribe on ZnNi coatings is equal to or less than that on electrozinc coatings of twice the thickness, and this prop- erty is influenced by the Ni content but not by the ZnNi structure or coating morphology. The paint loss from chipping, however, is insensitive to substrate differences, probably due to the good anti-chipping characteristics of the current automotive paint sys- tems, one of which was employed in this study. It is concluded from this study that a generally uniform and consistent corrosion performance can be expected from ZnNi coatings over a wide range of composition and microstructures. 1991 SAE Transactions Section 5 912287. (P-250) Cosmetic corrosion of welded hot dip galva- nized steel panels. Wim J. van Ooij, Ricole A. Edwards, and G. L. Neiheisel, Armco Research and Technology. The cosmetic corrosion of welded and painted automotive hot-dip galvanized (HDG) panels in the GM scab test and out- door exposure has been studied. A comparison was made between the performance of laser butt welds, mash seam welds and resistance spot welds. Other variables were the laser speed and the power input in the laser welding process. The underfilm corrosion in welded areas was compared with that in areas with standard scribes through the paint film. The weld areas were characterized by SEM and EDX before and after phosphating and also following corrosion testing by SEM and EDX. Corrosion products were identified by X-Ray diffraction (XRD). The best overall corrosion performance was exhibited by laser-welded panels, provided the weld area is protected from oxidation. Mod- els for the corrosion propagation mechamisms are presented. 1991 SAE Transactions Section S 912288. (P-250) Zinc electrochemical metallizing for corrosion protection of automobile wheel hubs. EricE. Serritella, Selectrons, Ltd. Many papers have been written for SAE on electrochemical metallizing, a modern term for "selective" or "brush" plating. These papers have dealt primarily with the aerospace industry, including the use of non-embrittling cadmium LHE® coatings for corrosion protection on aircraft. Shadowed by 30 years of suc- cesses in the aerospace industry, electrochemical metallizing cor- rosion protection in the automotive industry is often over- looked. Specifically, the use of selectively applied zinc coatings for corrosion protection on wheel hubs during manufacture has proven integral at several European automotive manufacturers. In the past, environmental conditions have corroded both the hubs and wheels of automobiles. Quite often the corrosion is in the microscopic gap between the hub and the wheel, which over time causes the wheel to seize and prevents removal. This has been frustrating to both stranded motorists and shop mechanics. The paper concludes that the use of a selectively applied sacri- ficial metal coating such as zinc eliminates the difficulties assoi- cated with organic coatings and greases. Because the coating will corrode sacrifically, the part will maintain a rust-free surface for extended periods of time. By offering additional corrosion protection, electrochemically metallized zinc coatings offer quicker and easier wheel changes for motorists and shop personnel. In addition, susceptibility of car body panel corrosion can be greatly reduced. This process provides a new, practical methodology for application of sacrifi- cial metal in auotmotive production. It establishes another way for the automotive engineer to improve product longevity by eliminating another of the corrosion "weak spots" in automotive design and manufacture. 912290. (P-250) Corrosion damage to wheel suspension parts. Staffan Hedlund, Swedish Corrosion Institute; and Lennart Odén, Swedish Motor Vehicle Inspection Co. Corrosion damage on wheel suspension parts has been noticed in recent years by the Swedish Motor Vehicle Inspection Com- pany in their annual control inspection of motor cars. This type of damage, which affects relatively new cars, has not occurred on earlier models to any great extent. Since the breakdown of a wheel suspension car lead to a traffic accident, it has been considered necessary to investigate the problem. By evaluating results from the yearly inspections of motor cars, different car models could be judge with respect to extent and age of corroded vehicles. Damaged wheel suspension parts, especially spring mountings of the McPhearson type, were analysed to explain the causes of the corrosion. 912291. (P-250) The performance of autodeposited coatings for vehicle underbody components. Oscar E. Roberto and Robert G. Hart, Henkel Corp., Parker ' Amchem. In recent years, automotive component manufacturers' use of autodeposited coatings has steadily increased due to the perfor- mance, cost-effectiveness, and environmental advantages that this technology offers. This paper presents a comparison of corro- sion performance test results for autodeposited coatings and sev- eral other commonly used coatings employed to protect vehicle underbody components. 912292. (P-250) Accelerated corrosion tests and the evaluation of new automotive brake line coatings. Dominic J. Bologna, Chrysler Corp. New corrosion resistant coatings for brake tubing have been evaluated by use of the accelerated vehicle corrosion test and the trailer corrosion test. These tests appear useful for comparing the end point perforation resistance of the tubing coating combina- tion and for comparing the corrosion and paint adhesion proper- ties of the coatings, respectively. The paper discusses the proce- dure and results of the accelerated vehicle corrosion test as well as burst pressure tests after accelerated vehicle corrosion testing. 912294. (P-250) Corrosion of materials for automotive exhaust systems. R. R. Gaugh, Amrco Inc. A survey was performed on 100 late-model automotive exhaust systems that had been replaced because of corrosion, to determine the materials of construction and locations of failure. Concurrently, laboratory tests were performed on exhaust mate- rials to determine their ranking in both salt and synthetic exhaust condensate. Aluminized carbon steel systems were found to have a proba- ble life expectancy of less than five years, while bare type 409 stainless steel was projected to last somewhat more than five years. Bare type 409 stainless was severely attacked in laboratory tests, followed by bare type 439, type 430M, and aluminized type 409 stainless, in increasing order of corrosion resistance. 912295. (P-250) Calcium sulfonate-based coatings as used in the automotive industry today. John J. Kmetz, Witco Corp. 261</page><page sequence="261">912295-912300 Calcium sulfonate technology has been familiar to the auto- motive industry for several decades. Their original and still most common utility has been demonstrated as a detergent used in fuels and lubricants. The effectiveness of sulfonate chemistry as overbased with calcium carbonate provides detergency and sur- face active properties which keep dirt and metal particles sus- pended in lubricant oils and yield excellent corrosion inhibiting characteristics with regard to ferrous substrates. The basic chem- istry of such compounds is discussed. The corrosion inhibiting mechamism of sulfonates was subse- quently extended to provide an active base from which many metal protectorant coatings have been formulated. Examples include cavity waxes, autobody undercoatings, temporary coat- ings for parts, and hemflange seam sealants and penetrants. Corrosion data exhibited by calcium sulfonate based coatings is presented. Their protective properties as used in traditional corrosion preventative products employed in the atuomotive industry are described. The qualities of calcium sulfonates lend application to corro- sion inhibition in the automobile today. 912296. (P-250) Experimental measurement of the transporta- tion properties of automotive cataphoretic paints. C. Barreau and D. Massinon, Institut de Recherches de la Sidérurgie Française; and D. Thierry , Swedish Corrosion Institute. Total automotive paint systems generally include three differ- ent coating layers: a cataphoretic primer, a sealer, and a top coat. The top coat gives the final aesthetic to the system, and the cata- phoretic primer is supported to be the ultimate protective layer against corrosion as well as the adhesion promoter, being directly in contact with the metal (or with the surface-treated metal). For this reason, it is very important to control the diffusion rate, through the cataphoretic primer, of poisonous species such as chloride or cathodic delamination initiators; i.e. oxygen and water. Although numerous studies have been reported on the cor- rosion mechanisms affecting automotive body panels, (either primer coated or fully painted), little has been done with regard to the transportation properties of the different paint layers con- cerning species such as oxygen and water vapour that are usually considered to be rate determining in the degradation of those sys- tems. We have attempted, in a first stage, to measure experimen- tally the transportation kinetics of such species in cataphoretic primers. To this aim, free films have been made with different compositions in terms of pigment/filler ratio. The influence of the curing temperature has also been investigated. The measure- ments of water vapour and oxygen permeabilities, together with electrochemical impedance. Spectroscopy of the free films yields a very sensitive discrimi- nation between the different systems and shows a good correla- tion with the results of other quality control testing carried out by the paint manufacturers. 1991 SAE Transactions Section 5 912297. (P-250) The effect of the electrodeposition process on pretreatments. Clifford K. Schoff PPG Industries , Inc. The introduction of zinc coated steels, multication pretreat- ments and cationic electrodeposition primers has led to improved automobile corrosion resistance. However, zinc phos- phates over zinc coated steel are more sensitive to the electrode- position process than are those over cold rolled steel. This paper is concerned with the dissolution of zinc phosphate pretreat- ments during electrodeposition. Dissolution was greater than expected, but did not appear to hurt the overall performance of the painted metal. A small amount of dissolution may even allow better anchoring of the E.D. coating. Dissolution was greater at higher voltages and under rupture conditions. There was a defi- nite connection between rupture behavior (electrical discharge) and pretreatment dissolution. Due to their lower alkali solubility, Zn-Mn-Ni phosphate pretreatments were more resistant to attack during electrodeposition than conventional phosphates. 1991 SAE Transactions Section S 912298. (P-250) The effect of pretreatment dissolution on elec- trocoat corrosion resistance. Peter Kamarchik, PPG Industries , Inc. Previous studies have related the cationic electrocoat process to dissolution of phosphate pretreatments from a variety of sub- strates. Little has been reported however, on the effect the amount of dissolution has on the end-use film properties of the coating such as corrosion resistance. Results of this work indicate that the corrosion resistance of a coating system can be impaired by phosphate dissolution but in some circumstances, especially with low level of dissolution, an improvement in the corrosion resistance can be obtained. Comparisons are also given of the effects on corrosion resistance of changes in the coat-out conditions from electrodeposition baths. Coated panels were subjected to corrosion conditions then monitored by ordinary visual inspection and by electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS). EIS results provide an insight to the chemical nature of the failure mechanism. 912299. (P-250) Determination of the phosphate quality of automotive organic coatings on different steel substrates by elec- trochemical impedance spectroscopy. Kim-Hang Ruiz , National Steel Corp.; and Dennis D. Davidson , Chrysler Motors Corp. Various steel substrates which were processed under different pretreatment conditions and coated with automotive paint sys- tems, were investigated by electrochemical impedance spectros- copy (EIS). The impedances of damaged and undamaged organic coatings on cold rolled steel were measured in an aqueous sodium chloride solution. These results were compared with two conven- tional accelerated exposure tests, the high temperature chipping corrosion test (HTCCT), and the modified Volvo outdoor expo- sure test. The chipped organic coatings on cold rolled steel, elec- trogalvanized zinc, ZnFe electrogalvanized, and ZnFe hot dip galvanized were then investigated by EIS. An inhomogeneous three-dimensional surface model was used to analyze the EIS data and characterize the corrosion protection of the paint/ phosphate/metal system. The fraction of the total test area which had undergone paint delamination and corrosion was calculated from the model results. Agreement with the paint loss results from HTCCT and Volvo tests was obtained. The EIS is shown to be a useful and reliable tool to evaluate phosphate quality, and the corrosion performance of painted automotive sheet steels. 1991 SAE Transactions Section 5 912300. (P-250) Phosphatability and painted corrosion perfor- mance of galvanneal coated sheet. T. C. Simpson , J. D. Hoffman , and W. C. Un angst, Homer Research Labs., Bethlehem Steel Corp. The phosphate/primer interface has been identified as the site of attack in several corrosion studies. It is expected that all aspects of the pretreatment process including oiling, cleaning, and phosphating affect corrosion performance. The extent of the effects is likely related to substrate type. An alloy coated material such as galvanneal (with its range of surface morphologies) could be particularly susceptible to variations in the pretreatment pro- cess. This paper reports a study exmaining the relationship of galvanneal surface morphology to phosphatability and resulting corrosion performance. Examination of phosphate crystal mor- phology, coverage, alkaline stability, and coating weight as a func- tion of phosphate application mode and bath chemistry for con- ventional automotive phosphates was completed in the study. Electrochemical methods were used to evaluate phosphate poros- ity and to predict phosphate stability. 262</page><page sequence="262">912300-912313 Painted galvanneal samples containing a wide range of phos- phate qualities were exposed in the GM SCAB test. Galvanneal samples of varying Fe% and with different surface morphologies were also included in this cyclic test. Metallographic, SEM, and electron microprobe characterization of these materials after test- ing was also completed. These studies indicated that galvanneal surface morphology (delta versus zeta surface phase) affects phosphate coating weight and crystal refinement. GM SCAB testing identified galvanneal coating weight and Fe% in the galvanneal coating as the most important variables controlling painted corrosion performance. Phosphate coating weight/quality also affects galvanneal corro- sion behavior. The mechanisms of galvanneal degradation in the GM SCAB test does not appear to be strongly depenednt on galvanneal surface morphology. The chloride anion was identi- fied as the primary actor inducing galvanneal degration in the GM SCAB test. Details of the results of these studies are dis- cussed in this manuscript. 1991 SAE Transactions Section 5 912301. (P-250) European automotive industry's design and materials philosophy for achieving corrosion protection today, and over the coming decade. Roland Dietz , Audi AG. This paper compares the standard of corrosion protection on current European passenger cars with the levels achieved six years ago. Progress is particularly apparent on the more recent car designs. This gives credibility to the up to 10-year warranties cov- ering rust perforation. The various manufacturers have different approaches to the question of corrosion protection, and this report explains the various methods used. Environmental prob- lems and increasing competition in the market will have a consid- erable influence on anti-corrosion materials and processes over the coming decade. 912302. (P-250) Status and prospect of Japanese automotive anticorrosion technology. Yukio Magata and Takao Hamanaka , Nissan Motor Co., Ltd. Anticorrosion technology and the quality of vehicles have been improved so rapidly in the last ten years. The "rust codes" were issued in North America and Europe in late 1970's. According to these trends, automotive manufactur- ers have positively developed how to cope with lengthening the vehicle's life. We introduce the status and prospects of the anticorrosion technology in Japanese automotive industry. 912310. Correlation of knock with engine parameters for ammonia/nitrous oxide mixtures. Sundeep N. Dhall, Sargent and Lundy Engineers ; and E. William Beans, University of Toledo. The knock characteristics of ammonia/nitrous oxide mixtures in a CFR engine were determined as a function of equivalence ratio and compression ratio. The engine speed and ignition tim- ing were constant at 900 rpm and 13° BTDC, respectively. The gas mixture entered the engine at room conditions. Knock was sensed from measurements of cylinder pressure using a piezoelec- tric transducer. The intensity of knock was assessed in terms of the third deriv- ative of cylinder pressure with crank angle, which was deter- mined from a computer analysis of the measured signal. In terms of knock intensity, KI, the data indicates that for normal combus- tion, KI &lt; 3 kPa/CA3; for incipient knock, KI = 3 to 5 kPa/CA3 and for audible knock, KI &gt; 6 kPa/CA3. The knock intensity was normalized in terms of a pressure that is related to energy release per unit volume. A correlation was obtained between the normalized knock function and the equivalence and compression ratios. All data fell within 20% of the correlation equation. 912311. Knock characteristics of liquid and gaseous fuels in lean mixtures. P. D . Ronney, M. Shoda, and S. T. Waida, Dept. of Mech. and Aerospace Engrg., Princeton Univ.; and C. K. West- brook, and William J. Pitz, Lawrence Livermore National Labs. The knock characteristics of natural gas (NG), 89 octane unleaded gasoline, 2,2-dimethyl butane (22DMB), and methyl tert-butyl ether (MTBE) in stoichiometric and lean fuel-air mix- tures were studied in a production 4-cylinder automotive engine. The intake temperature at the knock limit (ITKL) was found to be very different for each fuel but in every case the ITKL of lean mixtures was much higher than that of a stoichiometric mixture. Gasoline and 22DMB exhibited a much greater increase in ITKL than MTBE and NG at lean conditions. Surprisingly, for lean mixtures 22DMB exhibited values of ITKL that were much higher than MTBE and almost as high as those of NG. These results are compared with a detailed numerical model of autoignition chemistry. Good agreement between model and experiment is found for ail modelled conditions. The computa- tions show that the internal isomerization of alkylperoxy radicals which form much more readily in gasoline and 22DMB than the other fuels, accounts for the effect of equivalence ratio on the ITKL. 1 991 SAE Transactions Section 4 912312. Detection of knocking combustion using simulta- neously high-speed schlieren cinematography and multi optical fiber technique. U. Spicher, FEV Motorentechnik GmbH á Co.; and H. Kroger and J. Ganser, Institute for Applied Thermody- namics, Technical University of Aachen. Flame propagation as well as the special role of detonation waves during knocking combustion are still unsolved questions. In order to examine these phenomena during cyclic resolved knocking combustion, high-speed schlieren photography and multi optical fiber technique were applied simultaneously. The pictures were taken at a rate of 200 000 frames per second, whereas the flame radiation signals of the knocking combustion, detected with the multi optical fiber technique at 49 measuring points, were recorded with a sampling frequency of 500 kHz. The exact correlation between schlieren photography and optical fiber technique shows that knocking combustion is initi- ated by self ignitions in the unburned regions, clearly separated from the spark ignited flame. The complete autoignition (i.e. knocking combustion) proceeds in two stages thus showing dis- tinct prereactions. Nearly simultaneous self ignition processes in the entire unburned region as well as single self ignition kernels expanding into the unburned gas were observed. In case of strong knock, the analog light intensity traces indi- cate that shock waves, caused by supersonic flame propagation, are responsible for initiating the characteristic high frequency gas oscillations. Detonative processes (suggested from supersonic flame propagation and correlating peaks in pressure traces simul- taneously recorded) occur only for a very short time. 1991 SAE Transactions Section 4 912313. The autoignition chemistries of octane-enhancing ethers and cyclic ethers: a motored engine study. William R. Lep- pard, Fuels and Lubricants Dept., General Motors Research Labs. The differing chemistries controlling autoignition of octane- enhancing ethers and of cyclic ethers have been inferred from sta- ble intermediate species measurements using the motored-engine technique. Species measurements for three octane-enhancing ethers and three cyclic ethers are presented, compared with litera- ture studies, and contrasted with those of the other ethers. The chemical mechanisms responsible for autoignition of both ether classes are detailed, compared, and used to explain the differ- ences in octane qualities of the two ether classes. Chemical inter- actions resulting from the addition of MTBE to the paraffin, 2,3- dimethylbutane were measured, and are discussed in terms of the 263</page><page sequence="263">912313-912319 chemical mechanisms controlling the autoignition of the neat ether and paraffin. 1991 SAE Transactions Section 4 912314. The autoignition chemistry of paraffinic fuels and pro- knock and anti-knock additives: a detailed chemical kinetic study. Charles K. Westbrook and William J. Pitz, Lawrence Livermore National Labs.; and William R. Leppard, Fuels and Lubricants Dept., General Motors Research Labs. A numerical model is used to examine the chemical kinetic processes leading to knocking in spark-ignition internal combus- tion engines. The construction and validation of the model is described in detail, including low temperature reaction paths involving alkylperoxy radical isomerization. The numerical model is applied to Ci to Ci paraffinic hydrocarbon fuels, and a correlation is developed between the research octane number (RON) and the computed time of ignition for each fuel. Octane number is shown to depend on the rates of OH radical production through isomerization reactions, and factors influencing the rate of isomerization such as fuel molecule size and structure are interpreted in terms of the kinetic model. Knock behavior of fuel mixtures is examined, and the manner in which pro-knock and anti-knock additives influence ignition is studied numerically. The kinetics of methyl tert-butyl ether (MTBE) is discussed in particular detail. 1991 SAE Transactions Section 4 912315. Autoignition chemistry of C4 olefins under motored engine conditions: A comparison of experimental and modeling results. C. K. Westbrook, Lawrence Livermore National Labs.; William R. Leppard, Fuels and Lubricants Dept., General Motors Research Labs.; and William J. Pitz, Lawrence Livermore National Labs. A detailed chemical kinetic mechanism was used to simulate the oxidation of 1-butene, 2-butene, and isobutene under motored engine conditions. Predicted species concentrations were compared measured species concentrations obtained from a motored, single-cylinder engine. The chemical knietic model reproduced correctly the trends in the measured species concen- trations. The computational and experimental results showed the main features of olefin chemistry: radical addition to the double bond leads to the production of the observed carbonyls and epox- ides. For isobutene oxidation, the production of unreactive, 2-methyl allyl radicals leads to higher molecular-weight species and chain termination. 1991 SAE Transactions Section 4 912316. Autoignition chemistry studies of a n-butane in a vari- able pressure flow reactor. M. L. Vermeersch, T. J. Held, Y. Stein, and F. L. Dryer, Dept. of Mech. and Aerospace Engrg., Princeton Univ. Homogeneous gas phase kinetic experiments at high pressures and intermediate temperatures are critical for furthering an understanding of the autoignition chemistry of spark ignition engine fuels. In order to perform such experiments, a new vari- able pressure flow reactor has been developed. This device can be used to study homogeneous gas phase chemical kinetics over the pressure range from 1 to 28 atmospheres and the temperature range from 700 to 1300 K. Initial validation experiments were performed at pressures from 1 to 9 atmospheres using stoichio- metric hydrogen and oxygen mixtures. Post-induction chemical kinetic results compare favorably with earlier atmospheric pres- sure flow reactor data and with numerical results predicted using a recently published comprehensive kinetic CO/H2/O2 mecha- nism. Near stoichiometric n-butane and oxygen flow reactor experi- ments were performed at pressures of 3 atm to 8 atm and with initial temperatures from 708 K to 945 K. Results were compared with predictions generated from a comprehensive kinetic mecha- nism which has been used extensively for predicting and inter- preting n-butane autoignition phenomena. Relative to the experi- ments, the model predicts autoignition time scales that are too short at lower temperatures/higher pressures and too long at higher temperatures/lower pressures. The present model is there- fore likely to over-emphasize the importance of lower tempera- ture kinetic processes on autoignition phenomena. The mecha- nism fails to reproduce some of the high temperature atmo- spheric pressure flow reactor data originally utilized in the initial model development, the hydrogen/oxygen data discussed above, and other flow reactor results on the oxidation of methane at pressure of 3, 6 and 9 atmospheres. Sources of disagreement are multifaceted and cannot be simply repaired. Comprehensive, hierarchical redevelopment of a mechanism for n-butane oxida- tion, validated over an appropriate range of pressures as well as temperatures, is needed. Additional experimental data, similar to that presented here, will be required in order to generate and vali- date a more realistic, accurate comprehensive mechanism for the pressure and temperature ranges relevant to engine autoignition chemistry. While present models may reasonably predict autoignition times, model improvements will be required to quantitatively assess the relative affects of various chemical kinetic phenomena on autoignition behavior. 1991 SAE Transactions Section 4 912317. Oxidation of 1-butene and n-butane at elevated pres- sures. James S. Hoffman and Thomas A. Litzinger ; Pennsylvania State Univ. The oxidation of 1-butene and n-butane in air at elevated pres- sure was investigated in a high pressure chemical flow reactor. Results are presented for pressures of 3, 6, and 10 atm, tempera- tures near 900K, and lean equivalence ratio. Gas samples were analyzed using gas chromatography with aldehydes sampled using a dinitrophenylhydrazine/acetonitrile procedure employ- ing gas chromatography/mass spectrometry analysis. Major com- mon products observed include CO, CH2O, C2H4, C3H6, and CO2. Additional major products included l,3-C4Hé for 1-butene and I-C4H8 for n-butane. Fuel conversion was increased with increased pressure, temperature, and equivalence ratio with 1-bu- tene more reactive than n-butane. Large levels of lower molecular weight carbonyls resulted from 1-butene whereas significant amounts of conjugate and lower molecular weight alkenes resulted from n-butane. Trends in product distributions with increasing pressure were successfully accounted for by current autoignition theories. Paraffin autoignition chemistry is charac- terized by hydrogen abstraction from the fuel, followed by molec- ular oxygen addition to alkyl radicals, with several possible alkyl- peroxy routes determining final product distribution. Olefin autoignition chemistry involves radical addition to the double bond directly, ultimately yielding carbonyls and cyclic ethers. 1991 SAE Transactions Section 4 912318. Plug fouling investigations on a running engine- An application of a novel multi-purpose diagnostic system based on the spark plug. Nick Collings, Steve Dinsdale, and Tim Hands, Combustion, Ltd. A method for non-intrusive measurements of spark plug foul- ing, burn quality, pre-ignition and spark characteristics is described. The technique relies on a continuous monitoring of the leakage current to the spark plug centre electrode, via a high voltage diode stand off arrangement. By way of demonstration, the system operation is reported for investigations of cold start plug fouling. 1991 SAE Transactions Section 4 912319.

Weldon, Center for Electro-Mechanics; and Steve P. Nichols, andH. Tajima, Dept. of Mech. Engrg., University of Texas at Austin. 264</page><page sequence="264">912319-912324 Initial investigations of a new type of high energy ignitor for I.C. engines are described. The ignitor is a miniaturized railgun, or "railplug." The railplug produces a relatively large mass of high velocity plasma. These characteristics may be advantageous for initiating combustion in a number of different applications. Unlike a plasma jet ignitor, the railplug plasma is driven not only by thermodynamic expansion, but by electromagnetic forces as well. Four experimental railplug designs were evaluated using schlieren and shadowgraphy visualiztion to examine plasma movement and shape. Railplug current and voltage were also measured. One railplug consisting of two unenclosed parallel rails was used to demonstrate the electromagnetically induced motion of the plasma at ambient conditions. Schlieren photos showed that the plasma plume moves strongly in the direction of the elec- tromagnetic Lorentz forces. Two transparent railplugs, one with short rails (24 mm) and the other with long rails (35 mm), were tested to show plasma motion and structure inside the plug cav- ity. Plasma exit velocities in excess of 300 m/s were observed for the transparent railplug with short rails in air at ambient condi- tions. Schlieren imaging of the transparent railplugs proved that proper matching of the railplug with the electronics is essential. In the long transparent railplug, a collapse of the current while the plasma was still in the plug cavity resulted in generation of eddy currents which rapidly decelerated the plasma preventing it from reaching the plug exit. A fourth railplug was used to ignite lean ((p=0.85) quiescent methane-air mixtures at 3.3 atm total pres- sure in a constant volume bomb. For the bomb experiments, schlieren imaging and pressure histories were obtained and com- pared with ignition using a conventional spark plug and surface gap ignitor with the same energy as the railplug. Rates of pressure rise in the combustion bomb were much greater for the railplug compared with the conventional spark plug or the surface gap ignitor; the time to peak pressure was approximately cut in half by the railplug. 1991 SAE Transactions Section 3 912320.

Reuter, Texaco, Inc.; Albert M. Hoch- häuser, Exxon Research and Engineering Co.; and William J. Koehl, Mobil Research and Development Corp. An overview of phase I of the auto/oil air quality improve- ment research program is presented. Specific information is pro- vided on each of the individual test fuel matrices that were con- ducted to investigate vehicle/fuel "system" effects on emissions. Procedures for sampling exhaust, evaporative, and running loss vehicle emissions are described, as well as techniques developed for speciation of individual hydrocarbons. Air quality models to project ozone reduction potential of reformulated gasolines and methanol, and economic studies to estimate the relative cost- effectiveness of the vehicle/fuel alternatives are also briefly explained. 1991 SAE Transactions Section 4 912321. Effects of gasoline composition and properties on vehicle emissions: a review of prior studies. William J. Koehl, Mobil Research and Development Corp.; Albert M. Hochhauser, Exxon Research and Engineering Co.; Robert M. Reuter, Texaco, Inc.; Jack D. Benson, General Motors Research Labs.; Vaughn R. Burns, Chrysler Corp.; and Robert A. G orse, Jr., Ford Motor Co. Prior studies of the effect of gasoline composition and physical properties on automotive exhaust and evaporative emissions have been reviewed. The prior work shows that the parameters selected for investigation in the auto/oil air quality improvement research program (AQIRP) - gasoline aromatics content, addi- tion of oxygenated compounds, olefins content, 90% distillation temperature, reid vapor pressure, and sulfur content - can affect emissions. Effects have been observed on the mass of hydrocar- bon, CO, and NOx emissions; on the reactivity of emissions toward ozone formation; and on the emissions of designated toxic air pollutants. The individual effects of some of the AQIRP parameters have been studied extensively in modern vehicles, but the most comprehensive studies of gasoline composition were conducted in early 1970 vehicles, and comparing the vari- ous studies shows that fuel effects can vary among vehicles with different control technology. Compared with prior studies, the AQIRP is the most comprehensive and systematic study of the combined effects of fuel parameters on emissions from modern vehicles. 1991 SAE Transactions Section 4 912322. The effect of aromatics, MTBE, olefins, and T90 on mass exhaust emissions from current and older vehicles. Albert M. Hochhauser, Exxon Research and Engineering Co.; William J. Koehl, Mobil Research and Development Corp.; Louis J. Painter, Statistics Plus; Brian H. Rippon, Ford Motor Co.; Robert M. Reuter, Texaco, Inc.; James A. Rutherford, Chevron Research and Technology Co.; Jack D. Benson, General Motors Research Labs.; Vaughn R. Burns, Chrysler Corp.; and Robert A. G orse, Jr., Ford Motor Co. Exhaust emissions were measured as a function of gasoline composition in two fleets of vehicles -20 1989 vehicles and 14 1983-1985 vehicles. Eighteen different gasolines were tested which varied in aromatic, olefin, and MTBE content and in the 90 percent distilation temperature (T90). Subject to the cautions and qualifications described in the body of this paper, mass exhaust emissions in both fleets of vehicles were affected by changes in fuel composition. Responses to changes in MTBE and olefins were similar in both fleets: adding MTBE reduced emis- sions of HC and CO, and reducing olefins lowered emissions of NOx while raising emissions of HC. In the current fleet, reducing aromatics lowered HC and CO, while in the older fleet, reducing aeromatics raised HC and lowered NOx. In the current fleet, low- ering T90 reduced HC over 20%, while raising NOx slightly. In the older fleet, lowering T90 reduced HC by only 6%. Regression equations were developed which satisfactorily describe the varia- tions in the data. In addition, other analyses were carried out which help to understand the differences between the fleets and between technology types. 1991 SAE Transactions Section 4 912323. Effects of gasoline sulfur level on mass exhaust emis- sions. William J. Koehl, Mobil Research and Development Corp.; Louis J. Painter, Statistics Plus; Robert M. Reuter, Texaco, Inc.; Jack D. Benson, General Motors Research Labs.; Vaughn R. Burns, Chrysler Corp.; Robert A. Gorse, Jr., Ford Motor Co.; and Albert M. Hochhauser, Exxon Research and Engineering Co. In this portion of the auto/oil air quality improvement research program, ten 1989 model vehicles were tested using two fuels with different sulfur levels. These tests were run to deter- mine instantaneous effects on exhaust emissions, not long-term durability effects. The high-and low-sulfur fuels contained 466 ppm and 49 ppm sulfur, respectively. Mass exhaust emissions of the fleet decreased as fuel sulfur level was reduced. Overall, HC, CO, and NOx were reduced by 16, 13, and 9 percent, respectively, when fuel sulfur level decreased. This effect appeared to be immediately reversible. Engine-out mass emissions were unaffected by changes in the fuel sulfur content, therefore, the tailpipe emissions reductions were attributed to increased catalyst activity as the sulfur level was reduced. 1991 SAE Transactions Section 4 912324.

Painter, Statistics Plus ; Robert M. Reuter, Texaco, Inc.; and Brian H. Rippon, Ford Motor Co. This paper presents results derived from phase I of the auto/ oil air quality improvement research program. The clean air act- defined mobile source toxic air pollutants benzene, 1,3- butadiene, formaldehyde and acetaldehyde have been measured in exhaust from twenty current model vehicles and fourteen older model vehicles during testing with 18 gasolines of varying com- position. The gasoline fuel compositional variables evaluated included aromatic content, methyl tertiary-butyl ether (MTBE) content, olefin content, and the 90% distillation temperature (T90). The four fuel parameters were varied at target values of 45 and 20 vol % total aromatics, 0 and 15 vol% MTBE, 20 and 5 vol % total ole- fins and 360 and 280°F 90% distillation temperature. An industry average fuel and an emissions certification test fuel were tested as reference fuels. In the current fleet, benzene levels were lowered when either fuel aromatics to T90 were reduced. Levels of 1,3-butadiene in the exhaust were lowered when MTBE was added and when olefins and T90 were reduced, but were raised by reducing fuel aromatics. Formaldehyde exhaust emissions were lowered when T90 was reduced but raised when aromatics were reduced or when MTBE was added. Acetaldehyde was lowered when T90 was reduced but raised with a reduction in fuel aromatic content. Older fleet benzene emissions were lowered when aromatics were reduced and when MTBE was added. The emissions level of 1,3-butadiene was lowered when olefins and T90 were reduced. Formaldehyde was raised when aromatics were reduced. Acetal- dehyde emissions increased as aromatics were reduced. The aggregate toxic emission levels for the 18 test fuels varied between 10 and 21 mg/mi for the current fleet and 27 and 40 mg/mi for the older fleet. 912325. Toward improved diesel fuel. James E. Bennethum and Richard E. Winsor, Detroit Diesel Corp. Engine hardware modifications, fuel and lube oil properties, electronic controls, and aftertreatment devices may all play a role in meeting future heavy-duty diesel engine emission standards. Detroit Diesel Corporation (DDC) is actively involved in evalu- ating the contributions of these technologies to reduce emissions as well as evaluating the impact on initial and life cycle system cost, fuel consumption, reliability and durability. This paper focuses on the potential of low emission diesel fuels to contribute to lower engine-out emissions. DDC has been testing low emission diesel fuels with low sulfur and aromatics and higher cetane number, systhetic diesel fuels, and today's fuels with various additives. Other industry pro- grams have generated similar data. These results have led us to the conclusion that a significant contribution can be made by tail- oring future diesel fuels to produce low emissions. While more work needs to be done to identify what a low emission diesel fuel specification should be, this paper is intended to stimulate more interest in this subject and encourage engine manufacturers and fuel suppliers to work together to define an acceptable future fuel. 1991 SAE Transactions Section 4 912326. Fuel property effects on ring and liner wear rates in a DDC 6V-53T using SLA techniques. Robert Giannini and Bryan Shaver, David Taylor Research Center; Michael A. Bal - naves and Dennis Czarkowski, Detroit Diesel Corp.; and Henry Modetz, Acu rex Corp. A test program, sponsored by the U.S. Navy, was performed using a high-speed, two-stroke cycle, diesel engine (DDC 6V-53T) to evaluate the impact of specially formulated test fuels using an L-16 full-factorial test matrix. Sixteen test fuels were evaluated with sulfur contents, cetane numbers, viscosities, and trace met- als contents exceeding the limits contained in the Navy fuel speci- fication, MIL-F-16884H, fuel, naval distillate (NATO F-76). Sur- face layer activation (SLA) techniques were used to quantify pis- ton ring and cylinder liner wear rates for each test fuel. The results indicated that sulfur was the primary contributor to piston ring wear. Cylinder liner wear was not significant. 1991 SAE Transactions Section 4 912327. Additive approaches to reduced diesel emissions./l. K. Smith and M. Dowling, Exxon Chemical Ltd.; W. J. Fowler, Exxon Chemical Co.; andM. G. Taylor, Exxon Chemical Ameri- cas. Increasing concern over automotive exhaust pollution has led to very severe legislative limits being imposed on vehicle emis- sions. Whilst the vehicle constructors are working to improve the hardware to meet these limits, it is evident that the contribution to be made from improved fuels and lubricants is of increasing significance. This paper not only shows the effect of diesel fuel additives in maintaining system cleanliness over the required emissions dura- bility limits, but also discusses the effect of new technology giving substantial particulate reductions in the order of 15-40%, whilst leaving the gaseous emissions (HC, CO and NOx) either unaf- fected or reduced. The effectiveness of the technology is demon- strated in a variety of diesel engines - from passenger cars to heavy duty trucks- over the legislated test cycles. Driveability benefits in passenger cars have also been noted with these additives in terms of increased power and improved acceleration times. The effect that the lubricant can have on parituclate emissions has also been examined. Some preliminary data on the combined effect of low emission fuels and oils is presented. Whereas the benefits of hardware improvements are only rea- lised in the new vehicle market, utilisation of these technologies could give an emissions reduction across the entire diesel vehicle population. 912328. The efTects of fuel detergents on nozzle fouling and emissions in IDI diesel engines. K. Reading, D. D. Roberts, and T. M. Evans, Shell Research Ltd. The role and required function of a diesel fuel detergent are discussed and related to the process of nozzle deposit formation. A bench engine test method is described which uses an air-flow technique to measure the fouling produced in IDI nozzles and hence quantify the effectiveness of detergents in the engine test. Data are presented demonstrating the discrimination in deter- gent performance which may be obtained by applying this method at different operating conditions. Results of ECE 15.04 emissions tests are presented from vehicles having nozzle fouling levels ranging between 1-70%. These emission levels are plotted versus nozzle fouling. From these data, it is concluded that reduc- ing fouling produces a systematic reduction in unburnt hydrocar- bon emissions. An optimum fouling level of 15-40% is identified to minimise particulate emissions from this engine. 912329. Development of direct injection diesel engine injector keep clean and clean up tests. Kashmir Virk, Sheldon Herbstman, and Michael Rawdon, Texaco Inc. With the new emphasis to reduce diesel exhaust emissions, there is a greater demand for better diesel fuels. Diesel fuel quali- ties can be improved either by better processing of crudes, which is expensive, or with the use of additives. To develop additives which can prevent injector deposits or clean up already formed injector deposits, prechamber IDI engines are commonly used. Two direct injection (DI) engines tests have been developed in which effectiveness of additives to keep injectors clean can be evaluated.

Considerable work has gone into the development of an active diesel injector additive with both deposit keep clean and clean up capabilities. TFA-4681, a high molecular weight polyisobutylene (PIB) derivative with amine functionality, was developed. In test- ing done with a GM 6.2 liter engine, a Daimler Benz OM-616 engine, and in testing using two 1981 Mercedes Benz 240D vehi- cles, the effectiveness of this additive was established. Some principals of surfactant theory as they relate to this addi- tive development are discussed. The additive behaves as a surfac- tant in hydrocarbon medium. According to theory, an additive can act as a detergent (keep clean) by adsorption on a metal sur- face and, also, as a dispersant (clean up) by forming micelles with deposits. Usually, only high molecular additives are capable of behaving as detergent/dispersants with both keep clean and clean up activity. Experimental work on additive T-96A indicated that neither its clean up nor its keep clean activity increases linearly with con- centration but levels off at some intermediate additive concentra- tion. This is discussed in terms of a monolayer adsorption of the additive on the injector or deposit surface. Based upon infrared studies, the deposit surface contains con- siderable oxidation products such as carboxylic acid, anhydrides, etc. In a first step, the amine function of the additive is thought to react with the acid moitiés on the injector deposit surface at monolayer levels. In second step, the additive-deposit compound is believed to be washed off the injector surface by fresh fuel. This explains the absence of additive chemistries on the surface of injector deposits after contact with additized fuel, as indicated by infrared and X-ray surface analysis (XPS) studies. 912331. Cummins LIO injector depositing test to evaluate die- sel fuel quality. Thomas R. Gallant and Carman M. Cusano , Cummins Engine Co., Inc.; and J. Terry Gray and Nancy M. S trete, Engineering Test Services. Injector deposits have been formed in some manner or other in diesel injection systems since the introduction of the diesel engine. Deposits generally cause sticking of close fitting parts of plugging of passages and spray holes resulting in a reduction of performance, usually defined by power loss and increased emis- sions. Working on the assumption that diesel fuel quality was somewhat fixed and universal, U.S. heavy duty engine manufac- turers took the approach that improvements in deposit control would have to be made by design changes in injection system hardware. However, recent work has indicated that deposits may increase with engine design changes to meet the newer emissions requirements, and that deposits may have a deleterious effect on some diesel emissions. Therefore, it appears timely to approach the deposit control task from the fuel quality side as well as the hardware. In this regard, an engine laboratory test has been developed to evaluate diesel fuel quality with respect to injector deposits. The deposits formed have the same origin as those encountered in the field and the test discriminates between fuels, based on deposit- ing tendencies. Repeatability appears to be satisfactory for an engine performance test, and a criteria for satisfactory perfor- mance has been established by Cummins. 912332. The impact of ambient conditions, fuel characteristics and fuel additives on fuel consumption of diesel vehicles. D. J. Rickeard, Esso Petroleum Canada; S. J. Cartwrìght, Esso Research Centre; and J. E. Chandler, Exxon Chemical Co. Fuel is the single largest operating expense for a diesel truck fleet. This paper presents data on the many factors which affect consumption, and on the ways in which fuels and additives can contribute to minimizing it. Fuel density is the key fuel parameter affecting consumption, since higher density fuels deliver more energy per litre than those of lower density. Diesel cold flow improver additives can play an important role in the economic production of diesel fuel. In addition, they allow the production of higher density fuels while maintaining good low temperature performance. Dynamometer test data are presented to show the effects of ambient temperature, vehicle speed and fuel density on consumption. The performance of flow improver additives in improving low temperature operability while maximizing density is demonstrated. Finally, field test data are presented which show that the improvements due to higher fuel density can be greater than pre- dicted from steady speed fuel consumption tests. These results are confirmed in a dynamometer test, carried out under dynamic operating conditions. 912333. Some observations on the effectiveness of additives for reducing the ignition delay period of diesel fuels. M. A. R. Al- Rubaie, J. F. Griffiths, and C. G. W. Sheppard, University of Leeds. Engine tests have been conducted to establish the ignition delay period of two representative diesel fuels of cetane ratings 40 and 50, and of the lower rated fuel blended with additives. The latter included six organic peroxides, of different chain length and structure, two nitrates and mixtures of additives. The primary role of the additives appeared to be that of heat generation through rapid, exothermic, oxidative degradation following injection to the cylinder. A beneficial degree of synergism was noted with certain mixtures of peroxide and nitrate additives. 1991 SAE Transactions Section 4 912334. An organic diesel fuel additive for the reduction of par- ticulate emissions. G. E. Andrews and L. A. Charalambous, Dept. of Fuel and Energy, University of Leeds. A non-metallic organic diesel fuel additive was investigated, energy plus D 2000, which is marketed as a fuel economy addi- tive, where typical fuel economy benefits are 10%. The influence of this additive on diesel engine pollution was investigated using a Perkins 4-236 NA DI diesel engine. The additive was found to markedly reduce the particulate emissions by up to 75%. The vol- atile fraction was reduced slightly more than the carbon and the additive had a strong direct effect on carbon emissions. The opti- mum level of additive was 0.2%. Higher dosages continued to produce a decreasing level of particulate emissions, but the rate of reduction in the particulates with increase in additive was much lower after 0.2%. However, the active ingredients of the additive are dissolved in kerosene and hence the active compo- nent dosage was much less than the nominal dosage. This type of additive warrants further investigation as a means of diesel particulate control. 912335. A study of compression ignition engine operated by various biomass fuels. Norihiro Sawa, Ibaraki Univ.; Shuichi Kajitani, Mech. Engrg. Dept., Ibaraki Univ.; and Yuzuru Kubota and Shigenobu Hayashi, Muroran Institute of Technology. The engine performance, combustion characteristics and exhaust emission of pre-chamber type compression ignition engine operated by various biomass fuels were investigated experimentally. The biomass fuel investigated in this report are an emulsified fuel made with gas oil and hydrous ethanol or hydrous methanol, an emulsified fuel made with hydrous metha- nol and rape-seed oil, and near rape-seed oil, and gas oil. There are small deviations of the experimental results between the biomass fuels, however, the general tendencies of the engine performances and exhaust gas characteristics operated by bio- mass fuels are as follows. The brake thermal efficiency during biomass fuel operation becomes maximum at a certain injection timing as well as those of the gas oil operation. And this injection timing is advanced 267</page><page sequence="267">912335-912340 with increasing the biomass content in the fuel. The more fuel injection timing approaches the top dead center, in other word, the more retarded injection timing, and the more the biomass content in the fuel, the smoke density and total hydrocarbon con- centration in the exhaust gas are remarkably decreased. Since the ignition lag at the biomass fuel operation is longer than that at gas oil operation, the premixed combustion of the former is higher and consequently the maximum rate of heat release, the maximum rate of combustion pressure rise and the maximum combustion pressure of the former are higher and its combustion noise (sound pressure level:SPL) is louder than those of later. 912336. Evaluation of a wall flow diesel filter after &gt; 4000 hours of use on an underground mining vehicle. Diana L. Sher- wood and William J, vonHagn, Corning Inc.; and Dale L. McKin - non, Engine Control Systems Ltd. A 15" diameter X 15" long, EX -47 wall flow diesel exhaust par- ticulate filter, was operated for approximately 5000 hours on a load haul dump vehicle (LHD) in an underground mine. LHD's are an integral part of production in most underground mines and characteristically operate at high power and load conditions for a significant part of their overall duty cycle. The vehicle was equipped wih a Caterpillar 3306 PCTA engine. Fuel containing 0.2 wt% (or less) sulphur and engine oil specified at 0.025% ash were used. Following removal from the vehicle, the filter was analyzed to evaluate physical and thermal properties of the cordierite diesel filter as well as to inspect for ash accumulation or damage. The filter was found to be in excellent physical condition, however ash accumulation was high. The ash was found to be richest in Ca, Zn and P. This paper provides an overview of various techniques that are useful to characterize diesel particulate filters in assessing their condition after use. 912337. Factors affecting pumpability in heavy duty diesel truck engines at low ambient temperatures. A. G. Alexander, C. J. May, and C. R. Smith, Research Dept., Esso Petroleum Can- ada. The low temperature pumpability performance of twenty -one new and used multigrade oil formulations was determined in fired engine tests conducted with Caterpillar 3406B, Cummins NTC-365 and Detroit Diesel Series 60 heavy duty diesel engines. Significant differences in pumpability characteristics were observed among the test engines, but there was no evidence of pumpability problems in the oils evaluated. In fact, significant pressurization of the oil delivery system occurred during the engine cranking phase, prior to ignition. A comparison of differ- ent SAE "W" viscosity grades indicated pumpability characteris- tics consistent with the J-300 classification system. Good correla- tions were observed between the MRV viscosity of the test oils and pumpability characteristics in the test engines, both on an individual, and on an average engine basis. 1991 SAE Transactions Section 4 912338. Correlation between field and laboratory engine oil pumpability testing in heavy duty diesel engines. Robert L. Freerks and Michael J. Kahn, Chevron Research and Technology Co. The effect of viscosity index improver chemistry on the low temperature performance of engine oils in on-highway trucks must be understood in order to formulate oils for this application. Laboratory data, both from motored and fired heavy duty diesel engines, has been recently published, but no actual field perfor- mance in heavy duty diesel engines has been published. This paper reports on a testing program designed to compare the performance of three different VI improvers and two com- mercial oils under field and laboratory conditions. The test pro- gram was designed to determine if different VI improvers 1) affect engine oil pumpability as perceived by the operator, 2) sat- isfy the lubrication requirements of the engine, and 3) determine if different oil formulations perform the same in different engine designs. The testing program also addressed the correlation between laboratory and field testing of lubricant pumpability. The field testing showed that lubricants with significantly dif- ferent VI improver chemistries and rheology properties give sat- isfactory performance under field conditions. 1991 SAE Transactions Section 4 912339. Investigation into extending diesel engine oil drain interval (part 1) - Oil drain interval extension by increasing effi- ciency of filtering soot in lubricating oil. Makoto Miyahara and Yoshito Watanabe, Nissan Diesel Motor Co., Ltd.; Yasushi Nai- toh, Kyodo Oil Technical Research Center Co., Ltd.; and Kuni- hiko Hosonuma and Keiichi Tamura, Nippon Mining Co., Ltd. Analysis results of used oils sampled from many engines oper- ating in the field show that the most critical factor governing the limits of oil use is insoluble fraction concentration in oil. Hence, the authors developed a new oil and by-pass oil filter to increase soot trapping efficiency, so as to extend oil change interval. Soot trapping efficiency could be improved from 30% to more than 80% using a bigger oil filter with fine mesh and a newly developed low soot dispersancy oil. Engine lubrication performance of the new oil was compared to that of standard and commercial long- drain oils by conducting 300-hour endurance tests on an 11.7 liter direct injection, turbocharged and aftercooled diesel engine at rated output. Test results proved superior engine lubrication per- formance of the new oil. 912340. Investigation into extending diesel engine oil drain interval (part 2) - Development of long drain diesel engine oil having low soot dispersancy. Yasushi Naitoh, Kyodo Oil Techni- cal Research Center Co., Ltd.; Kunihiko Hosonuma and Keiichi Tamura, Nippon Mining Co., Ltd.; and Makoto Miyahara and Yoshito Watanabe, Nissan Diesel Motor Co., Ltd. Soot accumulation in diesel engine crankcase is the dominant factor which governs engine oil drain interval. So, efficient soot elimination from crankcase oil can be a practical way to achieve drain interval extension. Combination of high performance oil filter and low soot dispersancy oil results in an effective measure to trap soot efficiently. In this paper, the behavior of newly devel- oped high performance diesel engine oil having low soot disper- sancy is reported. Prior to oil development, an evaluation method of soot disper- sancy in oil was elaborated. Based on relative viscosity defined as ratio of soot containing oil viscosity to soot eliminated oil vis- cosity, dispersancy parameter was determined. Oil dispersancy evaluated on this parameter agreed with the results obtained from particle size analyzer. Secondly, a method to obtain oil filter soot trap rate to total soot contaminated into crankcase (trap rate) was established. For this purpose, soot contaminations rate into crankcase oil was cal- culated based on an equation derived from a concept of soot bal- ance in an engine. With this method, trap rate in diesel engine bench tests were obtained. A combination of a high-performance by-pass filter and a low dispersancy oil could raise the soot trap- ping efficiency. Based on these findings, we developed a low soot dispersancy high-performance oil. Detergency of this oil was evaluated by JASO diesel engine oil detergency test. Finally, the field test of 60, 000 km with an engine provided with a high-performance filter using a low soot dispersancy high-performance oil was con- ducted. Test result showed a satisfactory level which exceeded the target value of extending drain interval. 1991 SAE Transactions Section 4 268</page><page sequence="268">912342-912346 912342. Clean diesel exhaust but sooty engines: the impor- tance of the crankcase oil./. A. McGeehan and James A. Ruther- ford, Chevron Research and Technology Co.; and M. C. Couch, Cehvron Research and Technology Co. The EPA emissions standards for the 1990,s are "technology forcing" and have caused changes in engine design and combus- tion processes. These changes, in turn, have reduced particulate and NOx in the exhaust but increased soot levels in the crankcase oils of some engines. Why this increase in soot levels? For several reasons: lower oil consumption reduces the soluble organic frac- tion (SOF) in the exhaust. But it also lowers the amount of fresh oil (and additives) added to the crankcase and therefore increases the soot in the oil; high top-ring pistons lower the transient emis- sions by reducing the crevice volume between the top ring and top of the piston and cylinder wall. But the high ring location causes more oil to be scraped from the top of the liner and there- fore causes more soot to be transported to the crankcase oil; and retarded fuel injection timing lowers peak combustion-flame temperatures and reduces NOx formation by displacing the com- bustion event to later in the expansion stroke. But at the same time it exposes more of the cylinder liner to combustion soot. EPA standards require exhaust emissions to be lowered drasti- cally by 1998. This means that high levels of soot in the crankcase oil may be an unavoidable result of the lower exhaust emissions. And if it is not adequately dispersed, it can cause: filters to plug; sludge to form; valve bridges and fuel injector links to wear; and bear- ings to fail. A recent study at Chevron Research and Technology therefore focused on selecting the best ashless dispersants and V.l. improv- ers to prevent these types of failures. It demonstrated that such products, if well selected can disperse high soot levels, minimize viscosity increases and prevent filter plugging. 1991 SAE Transactions Section 4 912343. Voluminosity of soot aggregates: a means of charac- terizing soot-laden oils. P. R. Ryason and T. P. Hansen, Chevron Research and Technology Co. "Oil thickening" due to soot has long been recognized as a potential problem in diesel engine lubrication. Soot-related vis- cosity increase in used crankcase oils is remarkable in that rela- tively small concentrations of soot produce large viscosity increases. Classical studies of suspensions of rigid nonagglom- erating spheres in liquids suggest that the viscosity increase pro- duced by 6 % (by weight) soot in an oil should be less than 10%. In fact, the viscosity increase in such a mixture may be as much as several hundred percent. This discrepancy implies that the effective volume occupied by soot particles supsended in oil is very large. Past theoretical and experimental work on the rheol- ogy of particle suspensions provides a method of quantitively determining the effective volumes ("voluminosities") of soots in oil suspensions. Three different used oils were characterized by controlled shear rate rheometry. Quantitative voluminosities permit the reliable companion of the efficacies of different oils to control soot-related viscosity increase. Mechanisms are specu- lated upon which soots exhibit very high effective volumes in sus- pensions. 1991 SAE Transactions Section 4 912344. Size distribution of diesel soot in the lubricating oil. Ruonan Sun, David B. Kittelson, and Perry L. Blackshear, Jr., Dept. of Mech. Engrg., University of Minnesota. Soot is the largest component of contaminants found in the diesel engine lubricating oil. The soot enters lubricating oil mainly through thermophoretic deposition on the cylinder wall. Although the mechanism is still not fully understood, it is gener- ally accepted that soot particles promote engine wear, reducing engine component service life, fuel efficiency and performance. This problem will be further exacerbated when more and more diesel engines use EGR to reduce NOx emissions and when lubri- cating oil consumption is drastically reduced to control particu- late emissions. In this study, lubricating oil samples were taken from 7 differ- ent operating diesel engines. The size distribution and concentra- tion of the diesel soot particles in the lubricants were investigated by methods of photosedimentation and quantitative spectropho- tometry. The size distributions were compared to those of soot particles in the exhaust. It was found that the mass weighted median diameter of soot particles in the lubricating oil varies from 0.12 to 0.27 n,m, and the geometrical standard deviation from 2.4 to 4.0, largely dependent on the type of the engines. The soot size distribution in the oil is in general similar to that in the exhaust. For a single cylinder diesel engine, soot particles were found entering the lubricating oil at a rate of approximately 4% of the total dry exhaust particulate mass emission rate, which in turn is about 0.1% of the fuel mass consumed. 1991 SAE Transactions Section 4 912345. Predictions of cyclic variability in an SI engine and comparisons with experimental data. Ronald D. Matthews, Uni- versity of Texas ; Mohammed G. Sarwar, Univeristy of Texas; Matthew J. Hall, University of Texas; and David J. Filipe, David L. Miller, and Nicholas P. Cernansky, Drexel Univ. An investigation of cyclic variability in a spark ignition engine is reported. Specifically, the predictions of an engine code have been compared with experimental data obtained using a well- characterized SI engine. The engine used for the experimental work and modeled in the code is the single cylinder research engine developed at Sandia National Laboratories and now oper- ating at Drexel University. The data used for comparison were cylinder pressure histories for 110 engine cycles gathered during operation at a single engine operating condition. The code allows the various factors that could influence cyclic variablity to be examined independently. Specifically, a model has been used to independently examine the effects of variations in equivalence ratio and of the turbulence intensity on cycle-to-cycle variations in the peak cylinder pressure, the crankangle of occurrence of peak pressure, the flame development angle, and the rapid burn- ing angle. The equivalence ratio affects flame stretch and the dis- tribution of flame wrinkling scales. The turbulence intensity affects both of these plus the maximum and minimum flame wrinkling scales. It is shown that variations in the equivalence ratio dominates cyclic variability in the peak cylinder pressure but that variations in the turbulence intensity have a dominant effect on the crankangle of occurrence of peak pressure, the flame development angle, and the rapid burning angle. Physical argu- ments are provided to explain why these conclusions are expected for the fast burn engine examined in this study. 1991 SAE Transactions Section 3 912346. Temporal and cyclic fluctuation of fuel vapor concen- tration in a spark ignition engine. Fu-Quan Zhao, Dept. of Mech. Engrg., Hiroshima Univ.; Toshikazu Kadota, Dept. of Mech. Engrg., University of Osaka Prefecture; and Tooru Takemoto, Dept. of Mech. Engrg., Hiroshima Univ. Laser Rayleigh scattering was applied for the remote, nonin- trusive measurements of fuel vapor concentration in the combus- tion chamber of an automotive SI engine with the multipoint fuel injection. The fuel was simulated by Freon-12, which was injected intermittently or continuously into the flow of dust-free dry air through an intake port. The measurements were made of the time histories of instantaneous fuel vapor concentration at a location in the vicinity of a spark plug in the combustion cham- ber of the engine motored at 650 rpm for various air fuel ratios, fuel injection durations and fuel injection timings. The measured results were analyzed to derive an ensemble-averaged mean con- centration, a cyclic variation of the temporal mean concentration and a temporal concentration fluctuation in a specific cycle. The steady flow test rig was also provided to obtain the spatial distri- bution of the temporal mean concentration and the concentra- 269</page><page sequence="269">912346-912352 tion fluctuation around a spark plug and intake valves during the intake stroke. 1991 SAE Transactions Section 3 912347. Numerical analysis of fuel vapor concentration fields in a spark ignition engine. Mitsuhiro Tsue, Dept. of Mech. Engrg ., University of Osaka Prefecture ; Yoshiya Yamashita, Toyota Motor Corp.; Hiroshi Yamasaki, Ehime Univ.; and Toshikazu Kadota, Dept. of Mech. Engrg., University of Osaka Prefecture. A three dimensional numerical analysis is made of in-cylinder process in a typical four-cycle reciprocating spark ignition engine with an off-center intake valve. The conservation equations of mass, momentum and energy are solved on the basis of the finite volume method. The ordinary two-equation model is employed as the turbulence model. Fuel is injected into the intake port, and fuel vapor, fuel droplets and air flow into the cylinder through the valve clearance during the intake stroke. As the inlet boundary conditions, the inflow velocity distribution, mass fractions of fuel vapor and droplets are given around the intake valve periphery. For simplicity, it is assumed that fuel droplets move with the gas and have the rates of evaporation which are estimated by the clas- sical quasi-steady theory of a single droplet evaporation. Calcula- tion is made from TDC of intake stroke to TDC of compression stroke at every 10 degrees crank angle. The temporal variations of velocity and gas phase fuel-air ratio profiles are predicted dur- ing both of intake and compression stroke. The effects of engine speed, fuel injection timing and duration, inflow velocity distri- bution on the mixture formation process are discussed. 912348. An analysis of induction port fuel behavior. Hiroshi Iwano, MasaakiJaitoh, Kunihumi Sawamoto, andHatsuo Naga- ishi, Nissan Motor Co., Ltd. Since the fuel supply specifications in a multi-point injection (MPI) system are usually determined experimentally, the way fuel behaves in the induction port is still not clearly understood. In this study, a fuel behavior model is developed to gain a better understanding of how fuel behaves in the induction port so that the best fuel supply specifications can be determined on the basis of analysis. This paper outlines a model of fuel spray and wall film and presents some typical calculation results. Taking into account fuel properties, the vapor, the flow and other characteris- tics of fuel in the induction port are calculated using these mod- els. A comparison of the calculated results with experimental data confirms the validity of the model. The calculated results show the effects of the fuel properties and fuel supply system specifica- tions on induction port fuel behavior. 1 991 SAE Transactions Section 3 912349. The effect of fuel-oil solubility on exhaust HC emis- sions. F. H. Trinker, R. W. Anderson, and Y. I. Henig, Engine Research Dept., Ford Motor Co.; W. O. Siegl, Analytical Sciences Dept., Ford Motor Co.; and E. W. Kaiser, Chemistry Dept., Ford Motor Co. Exhaust hydrocarbon (HC) emissions from a single-cylinder, spark-ignition engine have been measured using two liquid fuels (pure isooctane and tracer fuel: a mixture of toluene, isooctane, heptane, hexane, and pentane) and two oils (20W-40 petroleum based and a triaryl phosphate ester) in which the liquid fuels have different relative solubility. Total hydrocarbon emissions from each fuel were measured in back-to-back comparisons (i.e., only fuel changed) in each oil. The difference in total HC emissions generated by the two fuels ([isooctane] -[tracer]) decreases by 210+95 ppmCi when changing from 20W-40 to the phosphate ester lubricant. This consistent trend in hydrocarbon emissions when the oil is changed supports the contention that the presence of oil layers does affect hydrocarbon emissions. Based on results from a conceptual model, the change in relative emissions from the two fuels could be due to either an increase in the amount of oil present in the combustion chamber or a somewhat larger tolu- ene solubility when the ester oil is used. Laboratory measurements of the oil solubility of the fuel com- ponents present in tracer fuel at room temperature show that tol- uene is 28 times more soluble in 20W-40 than pentane with the other fuel components showing intermediate solubility. In the phosphate ester, the solubility of the alkanes was reduced by a factor of 3-4 relative to 20W-40 while those of the aromatic mole- cules remained relatively unchanged. Based on these measure- ments, the hydrocarbon emissions due to the aromatic content of gasoline will be more influenced by oil solubility effects than will the non-armoatic fuel components when using petroleum based motor oils. 1991 SAE Transactions Section 4 912350. Study of a small two-stroke engine with low-pressure air-assisted direct-iitfection system. Huei-Huay Huang, Yu-Yin Peng, Ming-Hong Jeng, and James H. Wang, Mech. Industry Research Labs., Industrial Technology Research Institute. An air-assisted direct injection system has been developed and applied to a two-stroke spark-ignited motorcycle engine of 82 c.c. displacement to reduce exhaust emissions, particularly unburnt hydrocarbons. The injection system, which induces a small amount of compressed air and metered fuel from electronic- control valve, delivers the air/fuel mixture into the cylinder. This paper shows the preliminary results of engine dynamometer tests. Also investigated are the improvement of combustion and reduc- tion of unburnt HC emission by the use of dual spark plugs and skip injection techniques at light load engine condition. 912351. Toyota air-mix type two-hole injector for 4-valve engines. Tomojiro Sugimoto, Keiso Takeda, and Hiroshi Yosh- izaki, Toyota Motor Corp. An air-mix type 2-hole injector has been developed for 4-valve engines. In order to finely atomize the fuel whilst maintaining the separation of the twin sprays that assures minimal wetting of the partition between the siamese ports, the location of the air inlet passages was optimized and studies were conducted to determine the appropriate geometry of the fuel separation portion of the adapter. High speed photographs verify that the finalized adapter realizes centralized fuel flow through the splayed conduits so that the maximum air entrainment is achieved. This new injector both improves transient response and reduces HC emissions under all temperature conditions. It fur- ther enables injection timing to be retarded to the intake stroke at the same low HC level. 1991 SAE Transactions Section 3 912352. Heat transfer characteristics of an uncooled silicon nitride surface in a naturally-aspired DI diesel. Timothy S. Reid and Jay K. Martin, University of Wisconsin-Madison. Instantaneous heat flux and flame position were measured on a silicon nitride diesel engine head. Ionization probes and thin- film platinum temperature detectors were applied directly to the head surface. The ionization probes showed that the flame exited the bowl and propagated asymmetrically from the centerline of the com- bustion bowl. The temperature measurements revealed that average surface temperatures varied with position by more than 200°C. Spatial variations in the temperature swings were also present with large swings resulting from direct combustion effects on heat transfer at locations near the lip of the piston bowl. Peak instantaneous heat flux values varied from 0.3 to 2.0 MW/m2. Five of the seven probe locations exhibited heat transfer rates that were limited due to the combustion rate. At three differ- ent positions, the peak heat flux magnitude and phasing were independent of load. Comparing these locations, the time- averaged heat flux decreased with increased surface temperature. 1 991 SAE Transactions Section 3 270</page><page sequence="270">912353-912359 912353. Reduction of soot emission by air-jet turbulence in a DI diesel engine. Susumu Nagano &gt;, Hiromitsu Kawazoe , and, Kat - suyuki Ohsawa, Toyota Central Research and Development Labs., Inc. It was shown in our previous study that the air-jet in the late combustion period reduces the diesel exhaust soot effectively. However, the plunger-pump type air-jet generator used in our previous study has a big power-loss. In this paper, the reduction of soot emission with a newly designed air-accumulation type air- jet generator is investigated using an experimental single cylinder engine. The optimum design parameters, such as the spring cons- tant and the air outlet diameter, are examined experimentally. The effectiveness of the air-accumulation type air-jet generator for the reduction of soot and NOx emission is about a half of that of the plunger-pump type. It is confirmed that the disappearing speed of the luminous flame region accelerates with the increase of the heat-release in the late combustion period. 1991 SAE Transactions Section 3 912354. A stochastic combustion model of direct injection die- sel engines. Y. Xiao and C. Borgnakke, MEAM Dept., University of Michigan. A simulation model is presented for open chamber direct injection diesel engines. This model is an extension of phenome- nological multi-zone thermodynamic models with emphasis on stochastic description of combustion processes and thermody- namic properties of the charge. This combination of stochastic treatment coupled with deterministic description of flow and spray development gives significant improvements in the predic- tions of thermochemical sensitive processes such as ignition and polutant formations. The equilibrium composition and thermodynamic property model is extended to allow partially burned elements and to cover the full fuel-air ratio range as present in diesel combustion. A new mixing model is proposed to provide a more realistic description of the initial phase of mixing which strongly affects the burn rate. This model is compared with several existing mod- els from the literature with respect to burnrate and PDF predic- tions. The overall model is demonstrated to correlate well with experiments in terms of engine performance. Representative examples of NOx and soot emission predictions are presented as functions of inlet pressure, over-all equivalence ratio, EGR a fuel injection timing. 912355. Distinguishing the effects of aromatic content and ignitability of fuels in diesel combustion and emissions. Noboru Miyamoto and Hideyuki Ogawa, Dept. of Mech. Engrg., Hok- kaido Univ.; and Masahiko Shibuya, Hokkaido Univ. The influence of aromatic content in fuels on the soot and NOx emissions from a diesel engine was analyzed under con- trolled ignition lags with spark-assisted operation. Monocyclic aromatic hydrocarbons and n-hexane mixtures were used as fuels, and the aromatic content was varied from 0 to 75 v-%. The experiments showed that, at the same equivalence ratio and regardless of the molecular structure of the fuel, the soot con- centration in the exhaust gas could be described by a linear- combination function with two variables representing the igni- tion lag and C/H atom-ratio of the fuels. For unchanged ignition lags, the soot emissions increased linearly with increased C/H atom-ratios, which are controlled by the aromatic content. The degree of increase in soot emissions with increasing C/H atom- ratio decreased with decreasing equivalence ratios. The NOx emission increased slightly with increases in the C/H atom-ratio and ignition lag. 1991 SAE Transactions Section 4 912356. Performance and emissions of a DDC 8V-71 transit bus engine using ignition-improved methanol and ethanol. Richard L. Bechtold, Thomas J. Timbario, and Michael T. Miller, E A Mueller, Inc.; and Charles Urban, Southwest Research Insti- tute. A 1979 8V-71 model DDC two-stroke diesel transit bus engine was tested using ignition-improved methanol and ethanol. The testing was conducted using the Environmental Protection Agency heavy duty engine transient test procedure. The metha- nol and ehtanol fuels were found to have very similar combustion characteristics and required the same percentage of ignition improver (7.5 volume percent) to obtain similar peak cylinder pressures and rates of pressure rise as were observed using diesel fuel. Emissions increased rapidly as the percentage of ignition improver was reduced below the optimum determined. Ignition- improved methanol and ethanol can greatly reduce fuel- produced particulate emissions with the trade-off of a small increase in total unburned fuel emissions. Carbon monoxide emissions were found to be dependent on stoichiometry only and not fuel type. Based on this test work, it appears that diesel engines retrofitted to use ignition-improved alcohols in conjunc- tion with an oxidation catalyst could reduce all gaseous emissions and particulates relative to the use of diesel fuel. 912357. Dual fuel injection nozzle for methanol fueled com- pression ignition engine operation. Thomas W. Ryan and Timo- thy J. Callahan, Dept. of Engine Research, Southwest Research Institute ; and Alberto Cassiani Ingoni, AGIP Petroli EURON S.p.A. The objective of the work reported in this paper was to develop and demonstrate an injection nozzle which can be used to inject both diesel fuel and methanol in to a direct injection die- sel engine. The constraints on the nozzle were that it must pro- vide acceptable fuel metering and atomization for the diesel fuel so that the engine can be operated at rated load on diesel fuel alone, or operate at full load with the diesel fuel as a pilot for the methanol. An additional constraint was that the nozzle design was to be easily adaptable to the existing injection nozzle so that engine head modifications are not required. The initial design was evaluated in a constant volume test chamber in which the pressure was varied from atmospheric to engine compression pressures. The design variables were opti- mized in the injection chamber to provide two separate injections with acceptable injection characteristics as determined from records of the injection pressures and high-speed movies of the two sprays. The results of the optimization experiments are discussed in terms of the important design parameters. In addition, the design optimized in the injection chamber was installed in a single- cylinder research test engine and further optimization was per- formed. The engine performance and the steady-state gas phase emissions are presented on a comparative basis with the equiva- lent baseline data obtained during operation in the standard con- figuration with diesel fuel. The results are discussed in terms of the design criteria for best performance based on the results of the engine experiments. 1991 SAE Transactions Section 4 912359. (SP-888) Laboratory and field experience with the use of natural gas fuel in Cummins NTC series engines. Pablo Garcia and William Shiells, Transport Fuel Systems ( NZ ) Ltd. A first retrofit conversion of a Cummins NTC335 engine to spark ignition was carried out in New Zealand in 1984. The con- version used widely available technology for stoichiometric con- trol of natural gas fuel - air mixtures. Experience from the on- road application in a 40,000 kg GVW truck contributed much to the later development of a 400 hp gas-fuelled variant of the same engine family, using lean mixture carburettion control. A second engine entered service in a logging application in February 1989. 271</page><page sequence="271">912359-912366 The following paper summarises results arising from labora- tory testing of the second engine, and from in-field monitoring.

(SP-888) The development of a dedicated knock detec- tion and control system for gas engines. Pablo Garcia , Li Youli , and Pieter Lunenburg , Transport Fuel Systems (NZ) Ltd. Investigations have been made into control of knock in spark- ignited dedicated gas engines. Knock is a limiting factor deter- mining the realisable rating of a spark ignited engine, and con- straining the selection of fuelling and ignition characteristics for optimum efficiency and emissions. The knock phenomenon was studied using four multi-cylinder engines widely used in heavy transport applications, and adapted to high compression spark ignition with natural gas fuelling. Appropriate knock control strategies were developed and refined to accommodate the demands of field application in multi- cylinder engines. A knock control unit is operative for particular engines on which it has been characterised. Continuing development will include use of adaptive control technology to increase the sys- tem's versatility for a variety of engine applications. 912361. (SP-888) Monitoring the spark-plug gap of natural- gas-fuelled stationary engines. Jacob Klimstra and Frido Over- mars, Gasunie Research. The demands on the performance of spark plugs are increasing because of developments in lean-burn engines leading to adverse conditions for ignition and because of the desire for a longer life of the plugs. For improving spark plugs and ignition systems, more insight into the relationship between gap wear and spark- plug design, ignition-system characteristics and in-cylinder con- ditions is required. For that purpose, an instrument has been developed to measure on-line the gap size of spark plugs. This monitor can also be used for on-condition maintenance indicat- ing that a necessary replacement of the spark plugs will be near. The monitor, called Spector, receives a signal from an inductive coil around the high-voltage cable which, under given conditions, is representative for the gap size. 1991 SAE Transactions Section 4 912362. (SP-888) Air-to-fuel ratio control of gas engines using response characteristics of three-way catalysts under dynamic operation. Hisataka Yakabe, Hideo Tai, and Masayuki Matsu - ura, Information Technology Research Institute, Tokyo Gas Co., Ltd. This paper presents a new method of controlling the air-to-fuel ratio (A/F) in gas engines with three-way catalysts. In the method under discussion, the center of the X-window is detected directly through the dynamic response of an O2 sensor installed at the rear of the catalysts. As the result, the A/F remains stable at the center of the X-window for long periods of time, even in cases where static response characteristics of the O2 sensor change due to the deterioration of the O2 sensor, or in instances where the X-window shifts or decreases due to the aging of the catalysts. The responses of the O2 sensor outputs have delay times in both the step changes of lean-to-rich and rich-to-lean A/F. Vary- ing delay times were observed, and it was determined that the dif- ferences depended on the mean value of the A/F of the step change. Moreover, the delay times equalized when the mean A/F was at the center of the X-window. These phenomena are consid- ered to be caused by O2 storage, CO adsorption, HC retention, and the water shift reaction of the catalysts. When the A/F is modulated sinusoidally, these phenomena appear as symmetrical response waveforms in the O2 sensor outputs. The waveforms are asymmetrical when the mean A/F is not centered in the X-window. Therefore, the A/F can be controlled at the center of the X-window by feedback operation that keeps the response waveforms symmetrical. Experiments with new control method demonstrated that less than 80, 150, and 150 ppm emissions of NOx, CO, and CH4, respectively, were achieved even for older catalysts. This method is easily applied to conventional gas engine controllers. 912364. (SP-888) Natural gas as a stationary engine and vehic- ular fuel. William E. Liss, Gas Research Institute ; and William H. Thrasher, American Gas Association Labs. There is growing interest in using natural gas in vehicles in the U.S. and worldwide. Factors driving this development include desire for domestic energy use and diversification, reduced emis- sions, and fuel cost savings. As an engine and vehicle fuel, natural gas has many favorable characteristics as well as attributes that present technical and market challenges. A primary element of addressing these challenges is understanding the chemical and physical properties of natural gas and knowledge of the possible ramifications associated with gas composition variations. 912365. (SP-888) Low-polluting gas fueled heavy-duty vehi- cles. Nils-Olof Nylund, Technical Research Centre of Finland ; and Arto Riikonen, Neste Gas. There is a strong request for heavy-duty gas engines in the nor- dic countries for environmental reasons. Therefore, several research projects are going on. This paper describes two of them: a Finnish Sisu truck and a MAN bus, both operating in the city of Espoo, the hometown of the Technical Research Centre. The truck is equipped with a 7.4 litre finnish valment 612 engine. The development work has included engine tests and tests with a vehicle in laboratory conditions. A 3,3 litre 3-cylinder engine was used for the engine tests. The engine runs on stoichio- metric mixture, and has a three-way catalyst based on metal sub- strate. The engine was run on both methane (compr. ratio 12:1) and propane (compr. ratio 10:1). Emissions were extremely low with both fuels. In the Euro- pean 13-mode test 0.4 g CO, 0.1 g HC and 0.1 g NOx per kWh were achieved. Peak thermal efficiency was 35% for both fuels. Maximum mean effective pressure (BMEP) for a naturally aspi- rated engine is 9 -9,5 bar. Turbocharging was tested with propane, and a knock limited BMEP of 12.5 bar was reached. The truck has been operating on propane since the beginning of 1990. The naturally aspirated 7.4 litre engine gives a maximum power output of 130 kW. Results from tests carried out, both on the road and in laboratory conditions, are given. The MAN bus is also running on propane and uses stoichio- metric air-fuel mixture. The technology is similar to the one used in the city of Vienna. The displacement of the engine is 12 litres, and the maximum power output is 177 kW. The bus has been operating since the beginning of April 1991. It is covered with an extensive follow-up program including exhaust emission mea- surements. This paper describes these procedures and presents results of the first tests. 1991 SAE Transactions Section 4 912366. (P-253) An examination of some measures for improv- ing the performance of gas fuelled diesel engines at light load. G. A. Karim, Dept. of Mech. Engrg., University of Calgary. The dual fuel engine is a means for utilizing gaseous fuel resources efficiently in diesel engines after appropriate conver- sion. These converted engines can provide an effective method for producing power while reducing exhaust emissions, especially exhaust particulates and oxides of nitrogen. More efficient and increased power output relative to the corresponding diesel oper- ation can be achieved with dual fuel engines at relatively high load. The light load performance, especially with high gas to die- sel fuel ratios, remains relatively inferior. 272</page><page sequence="272">912366-912373 Poor fuel utilization efficiences and high unburnt hydrocar- bons and carbon monoxide exhaust concentrations are readily encountered at light loads. This trend has necessitated usually the resorting back to diesel operation at idling and very light load conditions. The paper describes the combustion phenomena that bring about these limitations at light load. It then sets out some guidelines that can be followed to permit improved performance and exhaust emissions of diesel engines converted to dual fuel operation when idling and at light load. 1991 SAE Transactions Section 4 912367. (SP-888) An examination of the role of formaldehyde in the ignition processes of duel fuel engine. G. A. Karim, K. Ito, M. Abraham, and L. Jensen, Dept. of Mech. Engrg., University of Calgary. The preignition processes in a dual fuel engine are described and the roles of the formation and consumption of formaldehyde in these and subsequent processes are discussed. Reference is made to the results of detailed chemical kinetic modelling of the oxidation reactions of the gaseous fuel component during the compression stage. This is supported by experimental evidence of the kinetic role of formaldehyde through its deliberate induc- tion with the intake charge of a dual fuel engine over a range of operating conditions and fuels. It is suggested that the preignition reaction activity of the gaseous fuel-air charge during compres- sion contributes significantly to the observed extension of the ignition delay in dual fuel engines at very low load conditions when relatively small gaseous fuel concentrations are being used. It is also shown that the deliberate changes in the concentrations of formaldehyde within the charge during compression can mod- ify the rates of the preignition reactions of the diesel pilot and hence the ignition delay significantly. 1991 SAE Transactions Section 4 912369. (P-253) Durability characteristics of palladium cata- lysts. Gregory S. Sims, AC Rochester Div., General Motors Corp. In this study, the durability characteristics of three catalyst systems were evaluated. One system was a conventional plati- num-rhodium catalyst. The second was a catalyst formulated with palladium and rhodium as the active components. The third system was a catalyst with palladium as the only active metal. These catalysts were evaluated for emissions performance after aging on two durability schedules. The first was a "3-step" aging schedule which is characterized by three distinct temperature steps from 440°C to 775°C. The second schedule involved steady state aging at 440°C. These aging schedules were set up on water- brake engine dynamometers. After low temperature aging, the palladium containing catalysts did not perform as well as the plat- inum-rhodium catalysts. After 400 hours aging at 440°C, the pal- ladium catalysts had a steady state CO/NOx conversion effi- ciency of 11% while the platinum rhodium catalyst had a CO/NO* conversion of 95%. It was also observed that this low temperature aging effect was reversible. 912370. Impact of washcoat formulation on properties and per- formance of cordierite ceramic converters. Suresh T. Gulati, Cor- ning, Inc.; and J. C. Summers, D. G. Linden, and K. I. Mitchell, Allied- Sign al, Inc. The dual requirement of high conversion efficiency and 50K mile durability for cordierite ceramic converters is achievable through optimization of washcoat and catalyst formulation. This paper presents new data for high temperature physical properties, light-off performance, conversion efficiency and pressure drop through an oval cordierite ceramic converter with triangular cell structure and two different washcoat formulations; namely stan- dard versus high-tech. Both of the washcoat systems have a bene- ficial effect on strength properties with nominal impact on ther- mal shock resistance. Both the standard and high-tech catalysts provide identical light-off performance for CO, HC and NOx con- version. The high-tech washcoat and catalyst system, in particu- lar, provides consistently superior conversion efficiency for CO, HC and NOx. The pressure drop across the catalyst depends on hydraulic diameter and is only 8% higher for high-tech washcoat than for standard washcoat. The durability and performance of both catalysts are discussed in terms of interaction between the substrate and washcoat system. 1991 SAE Transactions Section 4 912371. Systems durability of a ceramic racetrack converter. D. Maret, E.C.I. A.; Suresh T. Gulati and D. W. Lambert, Cor- ning, Inc.; and U. Zink, Corning Keramik GmbH &amp; Co., KG. The long-term durability of a ceramic racetrack converter is examined using the systems approach. Each of the converter components is characterized with respect to its behavior under simulated mechanical and thermal loads. In particular, the impact of three different washcoats on key physical properties, and the load versus deformation characteristics of three different insulation mats are examined from mechanical and thermal durability point of view. Similarly, the can deformation at ele- vated temperature is taken into account to ensure adequate mounting pressure on ceramic monolith under all operating con- ditions. The temperature distribution at the midbed of the catalyst during engine dynamometer testing, together with the compo- nent properties data, are then used in a finite element model to compute thermal stresses in the monolith as function of engine load and speed. The combined stresses in the monolith (including the effect of radial pressure from the mat) are compared with its high temperature strength and the probability of stress corrosion over the lifetime of the converter is examined using thermal fatigue data for the monolith. In this manner, the engine condi- tions and converter designs which limit the operating stresses to less than 50% of monolith strength are identified to ensure fail- ure-free operation of the racetrack converter system. 1991 SAE Transactions Section 4 912372. Sources of monolith catalytic converter pressure loss. Daniel W. Wendland, Engine Research Dept., General Motors Research Labs.; and Philip L. Sorrell and John E. Kreucher, AC Rochester Div., General Motors Corp. Pressure-loss characteristics of a variety of single-and double- substrate metal-foil and ceramic-substrate converters with tapered and truncated inlet and outlet headers were measured in room-air flow, hot-gas flow, and engine -exhaust tests. Test data in the three different media correlated with the inlet-pipe Reyn- olds number when expressed as a loss coefficient, i.e., pressure loss normalized by the inlet-pipe dynamic head. Because restric- tion measurements made in different media correlate well as a Reynolds number-dependent loss coefficient, inexpensive room- air test data can be used to estimate converter pressure losses in the engine environment. The normalized losses in the substrate varied inversely with inlet-pipe Reynolds number, ranging from, e.g., 6 at Re = 30 000 to 2 at Re = 200 000. The remainder of the losses occurred in the inlet and outlet headers and in the section between the substrates. Normalized losses in the headers were essentially independent of Reynolds number and constituted a third of the total restriction at moderate flows and half of the total restriction at very high flows. A normalized loss of 0.2 was associ- ated with flow adjustment in the center section between sub- strates in double-substrate converters. The pressure loss intro- duced by truncating both the inlet and the outlet headers was small, only 4-6% of the total restriction. Offsetting the outlet pipe by 20 mm increased the restriction by 2-6%. 1991 SAE Transactions Section 4 912373. Real-time non-fuel background emissions. Harold M. Haskew, William R. Cadman, and Thomas F. Liberty, Powertrain Div., General Motors Corp.; and C. Gus Mitsopoulos, General Motors Research Labs. 273</page><page sequence="273">912373-912378 The state of California has adopted a "real time" evaporative emission procedure that will be used starting with the 1995 model year. This test, which focuses on high temperature conditions, and measures all sources of evaporative emissions, represents a very stringent requirement. Non-fuel background emissions, i.e., paint, adhesives, and even air conditioning refrigerant, can be a significant fraction of the total measured emissions. California has included a provision in their regulations that allows for the subtraction of background emissions, using a meth- odology to be developed in the future. This paper reviews the his- tory of non-fuel emission regulations, provides data showing the magnitude of the problem using the new real-time procedure, and suggests a methodology for establishing a new background emis- sion test procedure. Using the procedures recommended in this paper, vehicle background emissions ranged from .09 to .25 grams per day for the three vehicles included in this study. Two sources of emis- sions that might be erroneously included in a background mea- surement were identified. These are fuel hose permeation and crankcase/intake system breathing losses. The effect of engine oil and other fluids was also quantified. 1991 SAE Transactions Section 4 912374. Effects of prompt EGR on warm-up and steady state fuel consumption and emissions. D. P. Gardiner ; M. F. Bardon, and V. K. Rao, Dept. of Mech. Engrg., Royal Military College. The effects of prompt exhaust gas recirculation (EGR) on warm-up and steady state fuel consumption and emissions were evaluated in experiments using a single cylinder engine. Prompt EGR was achieved using a modified camshaft which re-opened the exhaust valve late in the inlet stroke. During steady state operation, the prompt EGR system low- ered specific fuel consumption and specific NOx emissions. Unburnt hydrocarbon emissions were improved under some operating conditions, but became worse than those of the stan- dard system at low loads. In warm-up tests from -10°C, prompt EGR provided a large reduction in hydrocarbon emissions and also improved CO emis- sions and specific fuel consumption. Combustion fluctuations were worse in some cases where a sudden reduction in warm-up enrichment took place. Charge dilution through the prompt recirculation of hot exhaust products was found to give combustion and emissions behaviour that differed markedly from the behaviour reported in the literature for external EGR. 1991 SAE Transactions Section 4 912375. Flametube studies of wall quench. M. Peckham and N. Codings, Engrg. Dept., Cambridge Univ. Hydrocarbon wall quenching has been studied using a 19mm diameter, lm long combustion tube, open at one end. Mixtures of propane, heptane, iso-octane and gasoline, initially quiescent, were burnt with the ignition source at the closed end. The post- flame HC levels were measured at a series of axial locations using at fast FID. The results incidate that the effective quench layer thickness increases significantly as the molecular weight of the fuel is increased. The diffusion/mixing time constant of the quench layer was found to be approximately 0.1s for propane, 0.4s for iso-octane and 1.0s for gasoline. The axial variation of residual HC levels suggests that flame stretch is a factor influenc- ing the extent of the quench layer. 1991 SAE Transactions Section 3 912376. Study of induction tumble by particle tracking veloci- metry in a 4-valve engine. Marie Rönnbäck and Wang Xiao Le, Dept. of Thermo and Fluiddynamics, Chalmers University of Technology; and Jan-Roger Linna, Volvo Car Corp. The angular momentum of a tumble vortex occurring inside a 4-valve spark ignition engine was measured by particle tracking velocimetry, PTV. A cylindrical glass liner was designed for a sin- gle cylinder motored engine. Light-scattering particles and a laser light sheet, directed through the axis of the cylinder, were used to observe the simultaneous flow field. Three different intake port designs were used in this study. The in-cylinder tumbling motions were measured and the tumble ratios were calculated. The intake configurations were also visualized and measured with PTV in a steady flow rig, at a fixed valve lift. In addition, the results were compared with measurements from a conven- tional steady flow rig which measures the angular momentum flux with a torque-meter, and with laser doppler measurements, LDV, in a motored engine. All four techniques indicated clearly the qualitative difference between the ability of the intake ports to produce an in-cylinder tumbling motion. Quantitative numbers of angular momentum could be drawn from the PTV-results in the motored engine and from the conventional flow rig, while the LDV-measurements gave significant information about turbulence characteristics. 1991 SAE Transactions Section 3 912377. The effects of exhaust gas recirculation on the perfor- mance and combustion characteristics of methanol-fueled spark ignition engines. Norihiro Sawa, Ibaraki Univ.; Shuichi Kajitani, Mech. Engrg. Dept., Ibaraki Univ.; and Shozo Hon, Ibaraki Univ. To examine the effects of exhaust gas recirculation (EGR) on the exhaust emissions and on the cycle -by-cycle variation of com- bustion process in a methanol engine, the authors have tried to measure the emissions of total hydrocarbon, carbon monoxides, nitric oxides and formaldehyde and to record the cylinder pres- sure development histories of 1000 cycles duration. Moreover, the standard deviation of peak pressure Pmax, the heat release rate and the averaged pressure history are analyzed. The results are compared with those of gasoline fueled opera- tion. The results are summarized as follows: 1) in the case of a methanol-fueled engine operated under exhaust gas recirculation (EGR), similar to that already carried out in a gasoline-fueled engine, the concentration of NOx, in the exhaust gas can be decreased but those of formaldehyde (HCHO) and unburned methanol are increased; 2) the effect of EGR, such as 20% of it, on NOx reduction is the same as those of hydrous methanol of 50% water content; 3) in the case of EGR applied to an EFI engine, its output and thermal efficiency are descreased within the lean mixture region (X&gt;1.0) but these recover and the concen- tration of hydrocarbon is decreased by raising the fuel tempera- ture; are selected, it is possible to improve the exhaust gas charac- teristics concerning NOx, THC, etc., while the decreased in engine output and thermal efficiency is reduced to the minimum. 912378. An analysis of intake valve deposits from gasolines containing polycyclic aromatics. Bruce G . Bunting, Products Research Div., Amoco Oil Co. Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons such as anthracene and pyrene in gasolines are believed to be one of the causes of deposits in internal combustion engines. One source of these compounds is heavy reformate, a high-octane gasoline component. This blending stream can be redistilled at added expense to remove these compounds, commonly referred to as reformer bottoms or reformer polymer. Removing this material also improves the color and gum content of the gasoline. In this study, ten fuels with various concentrations of refor- mate and reformer bottoms were run on a standard intake valve deposit test cycle using a 1987-vintage, 2.5-liter, four-cylinder, throttle-body-injected engine. It was found that characterizing the amount of ultraformer bottoms by the anthracenes + pyrenes (A+P) concentration in the finished gasoline provided an excel- lent correlation (cc = 0.95) to the deposits formed. Naphthalenes concentration did not correlate with deposit formation. This may indicate that only the three-and four-ring aromatics are involved in deposit formation while the two-ring aromatics are not. None 274</page><page sequence="274">912378-912386 of the gasolines contained detergent deposit control additives since it was found that they would mask the test results. Results indicate that as the reformate concentrations in the gasoline increase, as measured by A+P concentration, intake valve deposits also increase. The deposits appear to be an aromat- ic-aliphatic polymer, becoming more aromatic at higher deposit weights. The aromatic cluster size, however, remains constant at three to four rings for all the samples. This suggests that the poly- cyclics are not condensed into a graphite-like structure. Metallic additives from the lube oil contributed a nearly constant weight to the deposits and therefore a decreasing fraction of the total deposits as deposit weight increased. The deposits also contained 10-15% oxygen and 1-2% nitrogen. 1991 SAE Transactions Section 4 912379. Engine combustion chamber deposits: fuel effects and mechanisms of formation. Changsoo Kim and Shi-wai S. Cheng , General Motors Research Labs.; and Sharyl A. Majorski, Dept. of Chemistry, Wayne State Univ. A single cylinder engine was used to collect engine combustion chamber deposits in-situ, and to investigate the influence of fuel composition on combustion chamber deposit formation. High- boiling aromatic compounds were found to contribute greatly to deposit formation, while olefinic compounds did not show any significant deposit-forming tendencies. In a low surface tempera- ture regime, deposit formation increased with boiling point of aromatic dopants added to the base fuel. Various analytical tech- niques (FTIR, GC/MS, EPMA, SEM) were utilized to character- ize carbonaceous deposits in an early stage of formation. Oxi- dized hydrocarbon species (ketones, carboxylic acids, lactones, esters), metal carboxylates, and decomposition products of oil additives were found to be major building blocks of deposits. The oxidized hydrocarbon species formed in a preflame region are condensed/adsorbed on a relatively cold surface to form combus- tion chamber deposits. 1991 SAE Transactions Section 4 912380. Fuel property requirements for multiport fuel injector deposit cleanliness. Akio Shiratori, Mitsubishi Motors Corp.; and Kenichiro Saitoh, Mitsubishi Oil Co. A comprehensive test program has been conducted to deter- mine the effect of fuel properties for injector deposit. Eleven fuel property factors, and the influence of injector temperature and leakage rate were evaluated. A laboratory accelerated test procedure has been developed for the evaluation. The procedure was shown to adequately reflect the effect of fuel properties and injector operating condi- tions. Injector deposits were greatly affected by diene number, olefin content, and sulfur content. The addition of ethanol increased deposits but the addition of methanol and MTBE did not. Detergents prevented deposit accumulation as long as the diene number was low. As a summary of the test program, three grades of fuel limits have been determined to forecast deposit- forming tendencies. Also determined were requirements regard- ing both injector leakage and injector temperature. 912381. Hardware effects on intake valve deposits. Paul J. Ber- lowitz and Howard S. Homan, Exxon Research and Engineering Co. A pseudo-slow motion video system has been used to directly image gasoline transport in the intake system of four engines. Injector spray pattern, location, and timing are all shown to have a strong influence on the wetting and washing of the intake valves. These parameters are strongly correlated with base fuel and additive performance: increasing valve wetting and washing result in better additive performance and lower valve deposit levels. 1991 SAE Transactions Section 4 912382. Evaluation of different resistively heated catalyst technologies. Karl H. Hellman, Gregory K. Piotrowski, and Ron- ald M. Schaefer, U.S. Environmental Protection Agency. Fresh, resistively heated quick light-off catalysts were obtained from two industry sources and evaluated on a neat methanol-fueled vehicle. Catalyst air assist was used, and a larger volume main converter was also added behind each quick light- off catalyst. The objective of this testing was to reduce excess unburned fuel, carbon monoxide, and formaldehyde emissions over the cold start portion (bag 1) of the federal test procedure (FTP) at 24°C. The lowest emission rates occurred with the use of a two- catalyst system (resistively heated/air assisted quick light-off cat- alyst and conventional main catalyst). Bag 1 conversion efficien- cies in excess of 99 percent from no-catalyst levels were noted for unburned fuel and formaldehyde, and 96 percent for carbon monoxide with these two catalyst systems. 912384. Experiences with electrically heated catalysts. R. G. Hurley, D. L. Guttridge, L. A. Hansen, R. J. Pawłowicz, J. M. Smoliński, and H. S. Gandhi, Ford Motor Co. Increasing pressure on lowering vehicle emissions to meet stringent California and Federal 1993/1994 emission standards (TLEV) of 0.125 gpm NMOG, 3.4 gpm CO and 0.4 gpm NOx and future ULEV emission standards of 0.04 gpm NMOG, 1.7 gpm CO, and 0.2 gpm NOx has focused specific attention on the cold start characteristics of the vehicle's emission system, especially that of the catalyst. From test data it is evident that the major por- tion of the total HC and CO emissions occur within the first two minutes of the driving cycle. The use of an electrically heated cat- alyst (EHC) is shown to be advantageous in lowering cold-start emissions during this portion of the drive cycle. This paper addresses the effect on emissions from the standpoint of EHC location, catalyst volume, and engine calibration in an overall emission system approach. Results indicate that locating the EHC downstream of the front TWC provides a level of protection for the mini-EHC without a loss in exhaust gas aftertreatment capability. Further, engine calibration and catalyst volume cou- pled with an EHC show that these optimization factors can con- tribute to meeting ULEV standards. However, these emission improvements have been at a premium, i.e. lower fuel economy, additional vehicle weight, power consumption, and yet to be totally accessed EHC durability. 1991 SAE Transactions Section 4 912385. Vehicle emission performance with an electrically heated converter system. Joseph E. Kubsh, Research Div., IV. R. Grace and Co.; and Peter W. Lissiuk, Environmental Research and Development, Corp. A 1990 Olds Cutlass Calais with GM's quad-4 engine was out- fitted with a Carnet® EHC system and tested for FTP emission performance after 4000 road miles. EHC operation on this vehi- cle reduced NMHC and CO FTP emissions by 77% and 67%, respectively, versus the vehicle's stock catalyst configuration. Absolute NMHC and CO FTP emissions were below California's ULEV 50,000 mile standards with EHC operation. EHC heating strategy tests showed that a post-engine start heating schedule was nearly as effective as a pre-start heating schedule in reducing cold start hydrocarbon and CO emissions. Tests comparing vehi- cle and emission performance with different engine control parameters indicated no change in EHC effectiveness with respect to cold start emissions for the two calibrations evaluated here. 912386. Determination of lubricating oil additive effects in taxicab service. W. M. Kleiser, H. M. Walker, and James A. Ruth- erford, Chevron Research and Technology Co. IIS</page><page sequence="275">912386-912392 A statistically designed field test was run to evaluate the effect of lubricating oil formulation variables on deposit control. The test duration was 160,000 km in midwestern taxicab service. The test engine was a 5.0 liter V-8. Seven variables were evaluated in a 2&lt;7-4) highly fractionated factorial. The test was designed as a resolution III design to deter- mine primary effects only. Variables included additive package composition, viscosity index (VI) modifier type, viscosity grade, and base oil. This matrix of oils spans the performance range from minimum API SG to next generation SG" + " oils. A low ref- erence API SF and a commercially purchased API SG/CD oil were included for comparison. The results of the test show that API SG oils provide a signifi- cant improvement in deposit control versus API SF oils. In addi- tion, improvements in deposit control versus minimum level API SG oils were demonstrated. No difference in oil consump- tion was observed between the SAE 15W-40 and SAE 5W-30 grades in this engine and service. Comparisons between the field test results and the sequence VE test are made. 1991 SAE Transactions Section 4 912387. Observations through a transparent oil pan during cold-start, short-trip service. Shirley E. Schwartz ; Fuels and Lubricants Dept., General Motors Research Labs. Cold-start, short-trip driving causes the accumulation of fuel, water, and other contaminants in oil. In this type of service the engine oil degrades at a rapid rate. To gain a better understanding of the degradition, the oil under these conditions was observed and photographed through a transparent oil pan. In addition the oil was analyzed to provide a quantitative measure of the degra- dation. Oil analysis results confirmed what was observed visu- ally; once oil became warmer, sludge and contaminants were removed, and many of the oil's properties (acid number, pentane insolubles, water in oil, etc.) improved. 912388. Using fiber optics and laser fluorescnece for measur- ing thin oil films with application to engines. Dana E. Richardson, Cummins Engine Co.; and Gary L. Borman, University of Wis- consin-Madison. A new method has been developed for measuring the oil films on cylinder walls in engines that offers benefits in improved understanding of oil transport and consumption. The unique aspect of this work is that fiber optics and laser induced fluores- cence are combined to measure the oil film thickness. As a result the system is much less intrusive than previous methods using windows to observe the fluorescence. Static tests were used to demonstrate the characteristics of the technique. Dynamic tests, performed on a cameron plint wear tester, showed the capability of the system to measure thin films under dynamic conditions and at high loads and temperatures. Finally, the system was installed in a diesel engine and used to measure oil film thicknesses under fired conditions. 912389. An improved method of comparing ASTM sequence HIE viscosity increase results. Julian H. Dancy and S. A. Cryvoff, Texaco Inc.; and Frank C. Wood, ASTM Test Monitoring Center. A method has been developed for expressing ASTM sequence IIIE oxidative thickening in terms of test hours to 375 percent viscosity increase (PVI), instead of by PVI at 64 hours, for use in data handling. Expressing results as hrs-to-375 provides a needed transformation for PVI, and enables clearer and more accurate tracking of PVI results. The method has been approved within ASTM for use in proposed severity bias estimate and multiple test acceptance systems. Use of hrs-to-375 is expected to be required soon. 912390. Prediction of gasoline properties with near-infrared spectroscopy and chemometrics. Stephen J. Swarin and Charlene A. Drumm, Analytical Chemistry Dept., General Motors Research Labs. Near-infrared spectroscopy and chemometric data analysis techniques have been used to predict the chemical and physical properties of gasolines using a set of 359 commercial gasolines from 23 U.S. cities. These methods can estimate ten or more important fuel properties in a few minutes with reproducibilities equivalent to the lengthy ASTM standard procedures. Potential applications include field monitoring of gasolines and on-board sensors of fuel parameters. 1991 SAE Transactions Section 4 912391. Evaluation of the antiknock quality of gasolines by the "energetic criterion". Francesco Avella, Stazione Sperimentale per i combustibili; Alberto Girelli, Stazione Sperimentale per i Combustibili; and Michele Famiglietti and Fabrizio Cattaneo, CISE S. p. A. The aim of the present work is to test and verify the possibility of developing a rational test method founded on the energetic cri- terion to rate the antiknock performance of unleaded gasolines through the measurement of the energetic index (Ic) on current CFR engines. This index gives the specific power (W/m3) associ- ated to the knocking combustion in an I.C. engine. Two conventional CFR engines for ASTM RON and MON ratings were fitted with a suitable instrumental chain in replace- ment of the standard detonation meter and relative magnetostric- tive sensor to process the combustion pressure signals. A number of tests performed in "research" and "motor" oper- ating conditions on primary reference fuels, clear and CORC fuels show the existence of a simple relation between the Ie and the compression ratio. Moreover by means of the new method it is possible to evalu- ate better antiknock performance of unleaded gasolines of differ- ent compositions than by the ASTM octane rating. In particular, it evidences the high knock resistence of aromatic components as observed in road tests. 912392. Analyzing the influence of gasoline characteristics on transient engine performance. Kenji Kanehara and Norio Sasa - jima, Nippon Soken, Inc.; Masahiko Nakada and Nobuaki Kay - anuma, Toyota Motor Corp.; and Tadao Ogawa, Toyota Central Research and Development Labs., Inc. It has been reported that the middle range of gasoline distilla- tion temperatures strongly affects vehicle driveability and exhaust hydrocarbon (HC) emissions, and that MTBE (CH3-O-C4H9) -blended gasoline causes poor driveability during warm-up. The present paper is concerned with the results of sub- sequent detailed research on gasoline characteristics, exhaust emissions and driveability. In this paper, first it is demonstrated by using four models of passenger cars having different types of exhaust gas treatment system that decreased 50% distillation temperature (T50) reduces exhaust HC emission. This result indicates lowering T50 in the market will contribute to improving air quality. Secondly gasoline behavior in the intake manifold is investi- gated by using an engine on the dynamometer in order to clarify the mechanisms of HC emission increase and poor engine response which are caused by high T50. It is found that high T50 cause poor gasoline vaporization and increased remaining liquid gasoline in the intake manifold, and this results in increased HC emission and poor engine response. MTBE-blended gasoline deteriorate driveability by combina- tion of following relations; MTBE content in the mixture of warm-up engines increases more than that of original MTBE- blended gasoline. MTBE has low calorific value. MTBE-blend casues lean mixture because of oxygen containing. 1991 SAE Transactions Section 4 276</page><page sequence="276">912393-912399 912393. A critical road test evaluation of two high- performance gasoline additive packages in a fleet of modern Euro- pean and Japanese vehicles. C. D. Spink , P. G. Barraud, and G. E. L. Morris, Shell Research Ltd. A road test has been conducted to quantify the benefits pro- vided by two additive packages in a fleet of modern cars from the European market. One of the packages contains a high- performance detergent, the other contains the same detergent at lower concentration and a spark-aiding constituent. The test was designed to enable a critical three-way comparison to be made between the base fuel and the same fuel treated with the addi- tives. Dynamometer measurements were made according to both the existing ECE regulation 15 and the proposed extended ECE test procedures. Through careful test design and execution, it has been possible to assess the performance of the additives at a high statistical con- fidence level. Both provide a consistently high level of inlet sys- tem cleanliness which leads to substantial reductions in fuel con- sumption and exhaust HC and CO emissions. NOx increases slightly, but the sum of HC + NOx (controlled in ECE legislation) does not. 912394. The effects of gasoline octane quality on vehicle accel- eration performance - A CRC study. M. J. McNally, Mobil Research and Development Co.; J. C. Callison, Amoco Oil Co.; B. Evans, Coordinating Research Council ; J. P. Graham, Chevron Research and Technology Co.; D. V. Swaynos, Exxon Research and Engineering Co.; J. P. Uihlein, BP Oil Co.; and T. Wusz, Unocal. A study was conducted under the auspices of the Coordinating Research Council, Inc. (CRC) to assess the potential effects of gasoline octane quality on vehicle acceleration performance. Twelve participating laboratories, representing both the oil and the automotive industries, tested a total of 182 vehicles as part of the 1989 CRC octane number requirement survey. The vehi- cles consisted of 78 with electronic knock control systems (knock sensors) and 104 without. All testing was performed using the 1989/1990 CRC FBRU fuel series. The results showed that accel- eration performance of vehicles with knock sensors was signifi- cantly affected by gasoline octane quality. Octane effects on accel- eration performance were most pronounced at maximum- throttle (detent) conditions and at octane levels below the vehicle octane requirement for trace audible knock; however, some knock-sensor vehicles did show improved acceleration perfor- mance with fuels at octane levels above the octane number requirement. Acceleration performance in non-knock-sensor vehicles was unaffected by octane quality. 912395. Temperature effects on friction and elevated tempera- ture behavior of base oil-additive combinations under boundary lubricated conditions. T. C. Ovaert, Dept. of Mech. Engrg., Penn- sylvania State Univ.; andH. S. Cheng and M. C. Shen, Northwest- ern Univ. Lubricant effectiveness is critical to the overall operational success of engine systems and components, particularly when boundary lubricated conditions occur in the contacting regions. In this investigation, several material and base oil/additive com- binations were studied under low-speed boundary lubricated con- ditions in the ball-on-flat configuration, under predominantly bulk elastic Hertzian contact stresses. The purpose of the tests was to investigate the thermal behavior of base oil/additive mix- tures through controlled heat input and performance monitoring as indicated by measured friction coefficient. In doing so, the sliding friction coefficients were sensitive to the lubricant mix- ture and evolving boundary film generated at the interface, mini- mizing contributions from plastic deformation and asperit flash temperature generation. The steels used were AISI 304 stainless, 1095 high-carbon, and 52100. The base oils used were mineral oil and poly-alpha-olefin (PAO) synthetic oil. The additives (1% by mass) were zinc dithiophosphate (ZDP) primary alcohol, over- based magnesium and calcium sulfonates, and stearic acid. The results indicated that the friction behavior is strongly dependent on the specific steel, base oil, and additive combination used dur- ing testing. In addition, some of the results were interpreted based on discussions presented in the literature. 1991 SAE Transactions Section 4 912397. Aggregation behavior of common motor oil additives. Joseph R. Ganc and R. Nagarajan, Dept. of Chemical Engrg., Pennsylvania State Univ. The aggregation behavior of three common motor oil addi- tives, calcium dinonylnaphthalene sulfonate (CaDNNS), zinc dinonyl-dithiophosphate (ZDDP) and polyisobutenyl succini- mide of tetraethylene pentamine (PIB-TEPA) in n-decane were examined using light scattering, osmometry and viscometry tech- niques. The experimental data were analyzed using two phenom- enological models of association, the continous association model which assumes the coexistence of aggregates of all sizes including the monomers, and the closed association model which assumes the coexistence of aggregates of only a single size with the monomers. The closed association model was found to describe the experimental data well for CaDNNS and PIB-TEPA while both association models fitted the data for ZDDP compara- bly, but somewhat poorly. The analysis of experimental data led to the conclusion that CaDNNS micelles were composed of 13 and 11 monomers, PIB-TEPA micelles had 19 and 9 monomers, and ZDDP aggregates had 4 and 3 monomers, at 25°C and 65°C, respectively. At 25°C, the CaDNNS and the ZDDP aggregates were ellipsoidal in shape and it was not possible to discriminate between oblate and prolate ellipsoids. The micelle sizes assuming both shapes have been estimated. The PIB-TEPA micelle was spherical with a diameter of 6.4 nm. For all three additives, the solutions were dominated by aggregates at solute concentrations larger than 0.02 gm/cm3 (20 kg/m3), while below this concentra- tion, the presence of non-aggregated monomers was important to account for. 912398. Application of a new fleet test procedure to investigate emulsion formation tendencies of motor oils. Mary F. Salomon, Mary Galic, and Scot E. Jaynes, Lubrizol Corp. There is concern over water-in-oil emulsion formation in pas- senger cars in the field. Crankcase pressure measurements in the ASTM sequence IID rust test have been used to indicate possible emulsion formation tendencies of lubricants. This paper presents the development of a short duration emulsion fleet test procedure which demonstrates low car-to-car variability and correlates well with a previous four-month winter emulsion fleet test. Physical emulsion characteristics and used oil analyses are described. Evaluation of both sequence IID reference oils and commercial oils in this field test reveals a lack of correlation between sequence IID crankcase pressure results and field performance. The new procedure has been applied to investigate the impact of additive and base oil variations on the emulsion-forming ten- dencies of lubricants in the field. Base oil variables such as viscos- ity grade, composition, and volatility were evaluated. Additive variables included dispersant type and level, viscosity improver type, and detergent metal type. An additive system has been iden- tified which is particularly effective in reducing the formation of water-in-oil emulsions in the field. 912399.

Relation between diffusion process of sulfur oxides in exhaust gas into oil film and wear of cylinder liner and piston rings in diesel engines. Hiroyuki Nagaki and Koji Korematsu , Dept. of Mech. Engrg ., Kogakuin Univ. In this paper, to reveal behavior of SO2 gas which is recir- culated from the exhaust gas on wear of piston rings and cylinder liner in diesel engines, a numerical model to estimate the amount of SO2 in oil layer on the cylinder wall is developed. The experi- mental fact that increase of wear of the piston rings and the cylin- der liner due to EGR can be explained by the increase of the cal- culated SO2 concentration in the oil layer. 1991 SAE Transactions Section 4 912401. Intake port phenomena in a spark-ignition engine at part load. Chun-on Cheng and Wai K. Cheng, Massachusetts Institute of Technology; John B. Hey wood, Sloan Automotive Lab., Massachusetts Institute of Technology ; Damien Maroteaux, Regie National des Usines Renault ; and Nick Collings, Engrg. Dept., Cambridge Univ. The flow and heat transfer phenomena in the intake port of a spark ignition engine with port fuel injection play a significant role in the mixture preparation process, especially at part load. The backflow of the hot burned gas from the cylinder into the intake port when the intake valve is opened breaks up any liquid film around the inlet valve, influences gas and wall temperatures, and has a major effect on the fuel vaporization process. The back- flow of in-cylinder mixture with its residual component during the compression stroke prior to inlet valve closing fills part of the port with gas at higher than fresh mixture temperature. To quan- tify these phenomena, time-resolved measurements of the hydro- carbon concentration profile along the center-line of the intake port were made with a fast-response flame ionization detector, and of the gas temperature with a fine wire resistance thermome- ter, in a single-cylinder engine running with premixed propane/ air mixture. These measurements are used to define the extent of the backflows of gas from the cylinder into the intake port and the mixing that takes place between these backflows and fresh mixture. Hydrocarbon measurements were then obtained in the intake port with liquid fuel injection at selected timings with respect to the engine valve events. It is shown that substantial fuel vaporization takes place in the port, the amount depending on residence time and inlet pressure. Significant displacement of fuel vapor upstream by the backflow which follows inlet valve open- ing also occurs. 1991 SAE Transactions Section 3 912402. The effects of initial flame kernel conditions on flame development in SI engine. Yvan Bianco, GIE Peugeot S.A., Renault; Wai K. Cheng, Massachusetts Institute of Technology ; and John B. Heywood, Sloan Automotive Lab., Massachusetts Institute of Technology. The initial flame kernel behavior in a SI engine was measured by a spark-plug-fiber-optics probe. From these measurements, the flame kernel may be characterized by an expansion speed and a convection velocity. These quantities were correlated with the burn rate on a cycle-to-cycle basis in an engine configurated with quiescent, swirl, and tumble in-cylinder motion. The expansion speed correlates well with the 0-2 percent mass burn duration for all the configurations. The flame convection velocity depends on the in-cylinder motion in the expected manner. There was, how- ever, only a weak correlation between the 10-90 percent burn duration and the initial flame kernel behavior. 1991 SAE Transactions Section 3 912404. The cylinder head temperature measurement by ther- mal imaging technique. H. Zhao, Dept. of Engrg., Cambridge Univ.; Nick Codings, Engrg. Dept., Cambridge Univ.; and T. Ma, Ford Motor Co. A thermal imaging system has been developed for viewing and recording the cylinder head surface temperatures of an internal combustion engine. The system consists of an I.R. scanner, asso- ciated calibration and image processing equipment and an infra- red transmitting window mounted in the piston. The infra-red window material used (silicon) has thermal characteristics close to those of a normal piston. The two dimensional temperature distribution of a cylinder head surface has been measured during start-up. The imaging results from the camera were checked against the readings from the thermocouples fitted into the cylin- der head. The agreement was very good, and gives confidence in the system. 1991 SAE Transactions Section 3 912405. Measurements of spatial structure of BDC turbulence in a model IC engine using flying hot wire. M. Y. E. Selim and Nick Codings, Engrg. Dept., Cambridge Univ. An investigation has been carried out to measure the spatial structure of the turbulence in a model IC engine at near to BDC, inlet stroke. Flying hot wire anemometer measurements have revealed details of the effect of the inlet port angle and valve lift on the spatial turbulence structure. Cycle resolved turbulence intensity and integral length scale are presented at three cutoff fre- quencies of 10 Hz, 100 Hz, and 1000 Hz. Although the situation is transient, conventional analysis methods are shown to be use- ful. The inhomogeneity of the intake turbulence is found to be considerable. It is also shown that high turbulence energy content occurs at lower frequencies. The flow also exhibits high cycle-to- cycle variation in the mean velocity although this variation was not sensitive to the cutoff frequency. AI low cutoff frequency the integral length scale of BDC turbulence was found to be compara- ble with the valve lift. The role of the inlet jet flow is shown to be crucial. 1991 SAE Transactions Section 3 912406. Newly developed active suspension fluid - Investigation on viscosity-temperature characteristics of syn- thetic base fluids. Shoichi Ichikawa, Takao Nomura, and Hiro - hiko Hoshi, Toyota Motor Corp. Hydraulic fluids for automotive chassis systems are expected to have excellent low-temperature fluidity to get quick response at low temperature. A synthetic active suspension fluid has been designed by analyzing viscosity-temperature characteristics of poly methacrylate (PMA)/polya-olefin (PAO) or diester mixtures based on the theoretical formula proposed by Carrasco et al. Measured kinematic viscosities are correlated with calculated ones very well at high temperature. On the other hand, there is some difference between measured and calculated low- temperature viscosities due to wax crystallization resulting from the mineral oils used as carrier oil of polymers. The theoretical formula of Carrasco et al. is applicable to polymer/synthetic base fluid mixtures even under the arctic condition in the case of no wax crystallization. PAO has better wax solubility and low- temperature fluidity than diesters judging from the fact that there is less difference betwen measured and calculated low- temperature viscosities of PAO than that of diesters. A synthetic base fluid consisting of a mixture of PAO and diester at the ratio of 80 to 20 was adopted to develop an active suspension fluid, considering its low-temperature fluidity and material compatibility. 912407. Optimized design of the lubrication system of modern combustion engines. A. Haas, T. Esch, E. Fahl, and P. Kreuter, FEV Motorentechnik ; and F. Pischinger, FEV Motorentechnik GmbH. 278</page><page sequence="278">912407-912412 Lubrication networks in today's passenger car engines are complex systems managing the interactions between the manu- facturers' demand for long engine-life, low friction characteristics and sufficient heat-transfer work of the lubricant. Modern engines work harder and run hotter and consequently place more demands on the engine oil and the design of the lubrication sys- tem. The paper presents an overview of the influences of various oil pump parameters as oil pump suction port, rotor geometry and oil pump component clearances on the engine's operating behavior. The results of detailed investigations, intended to design the oil pump capacity exactly to the requirements of the optimized lubrication system, are shown in combination with the analysis of the oil draining system, aimed to reduce the hydraulic losses. A potential is presented that engine manufacturer can obtain in terms of saving energy. The positive influence on fuel consumption by a consequent improvement of the oil pump design, the reduction of the hydraulic losses within the lube system and the elimination of power train losses by minimizing the amount of splashed oil in the crankcase is demonstrated. 912408. Results of a 500,000-mile field test of a gear lubricant and an engine lubricant in heavy-duty manual transmissions. C. G. Salentine, Chevron Research and Technology Co. A GL-5 gear lubricant containing a dispersed solid borate additive and a CD synthetic engine lubricant were evaluated in the overdrive transmissions of 17 new class 8 trucks in a 500,000- mile per truck, on-highway field test. With 500,000-mile oil drain intervals, both lubricants gave acceptable performance as judged by end-of-test inspections: deposit/sludge formation was mini- mal, overall wear was low, and seal/yoke performance was good. The borate lubricant gave a statistically significant lower wear rate than the synthetic lubricant based upon oil sample analysis; inspections also showed lower wear on some parts. Additionally, oil sample analysis from the tandem drive axles showed that the forward axle gave a statistically significant higher wear rate than the rear axle. Transmission and drive axle oil temperatures were monitored during a portion of the test. 912409. Pour point and flow improvement in lubes: the interac- tion of waxes with methacrylate polymers. Isaac D. Rubin , Mun- mayaK. Mishra, and Rocco D. Pugliese , Texaco Research Center. The most widely used pourpoint depressants are methacrylate polymers. Even though they have been employed commercially for many years to depress pour points and improve flow, the exact mechanism by which they do it remains obscure. It is gener- ally believed that they function by disruption or preventing the formation of three-dimensional wax networks, leaving the amount of crystalline wax unaffected. This paper deals with dif- ferential scanning calorimetry (DSC) and X-ray diffraction (XRD) analysis to study blends of methacrylate polymers with both model paraffinic compounds and a paraffin/ microcrystalline wax to gain a better understanding of their inter- actions. Some important structure requirements for polymer- paraffin interaction with a bearing on pour point depression have been identified. It is also shown that the polymethacrylate can have an effect on the amount of paraffin or wax that can crystal- lize. 912410. Multifunctional pour point depressant. W. Böttcher and H. Jost , Röhm GmbH. In the past political and economical developments have fre- quently required rapid changes in crude and consequently base oil supply. Changing crude oil provenances means changing paraffin con- tent and structure of base oils and subsequently to a certain degree low temperature properties. The most important problem area is represented by engine oil formulations with their stringent requirements for startability and pumpability under winter con- ditions. Today most potent pour point depressants -primarily based on the flexible chemistry of polyalkylmethacrylates -are able to solve problems by optimum control of paraffin crystallization. The application for these specialised products ranges from blends of a wide variety of conventional base oils to the even more diffi- cult special raffinâtes and to semi or part synthetic formulations e.g. for SAE 5W-30 oils. The functionality of these most potent pour point depressant has been extended to provide viscosity increase and viscosity index improvement as well as dispersancy. The first effect is only limited by shear requirements or the molecular weight of the polymethacrylates. Due to their small thickening effects at -20°C or -25°C the multifunctional pour point depressants allow more flexibility in adjusting base oil blends to meet CCS viscosity or volatility targets. The second effect i.e. the dispersancy has been included to replace some of the PIB-based dispersants with its poorer CCS-thickening properties and to achieve maximum per- formance in sludge tests such as sequence VE or M102E without impairing low temperature startability, often a limiting factor in formulating high performance gasoline and diesel engine oils. The sum of properties of the new multifunctional pour point depressant is technically and economically attractive. 912411. Prediction of high temperature viscosities of polymer solutions up to 107 sec"1 shear rates. E. E. Klaus, J. L. Duda, and V. Bala, Pennsylvania State Univ. The Penn State high shear viscometer has been used to mea- sure viscosities of polymer solutions at shear rates up to 106 sec1 over a temperature range of 20°C to 175°C. A double truncated power law model has been developed for analysis of the primary data from the viscometer. This model can be used to determine the shear rate at which incipint non-Newtonian behavior occurs, the power law index, and the shear rate at which a second Newto- nian region is found. These three parameters appear to be regular functions of temperature for a given polymer (viscosity index improver) type. The correlation of these three functions with temperature provides a convenient method of predicting viscos- ity properties of polymer solutions at various temperatures and shear rates up to 107 sec1. The Penn State high shear viscometer has been used to evalu- ate methacrylate and olefin copolymer VI improvers in mineral oil base stocks at shear rates of 106 sec1 at various temperatures. These data are then used to provide viscosity values at shear rates of 107 sec1. 912412. Measurement of the viscosity of thin films of lubri- cants on solid surfaces. Selda Gunsel, Pennzoil Products Co.; and Richard W ay te and Hugh A. Spikes, Imperial College. This paper describes the development of a thin film rheometer able to measure the viscosity of lubricant films of the order of 200 jim thickness on flat, solid surfaces. The rheometer consists of a small cylinder mounted on a piezo bimorph which is divided electrically into two halves. When an AC voltage is applied to the one half of the piezo it causes the flat surface of the cylinder to oscillate in its own plane with an ampli- tude of a few microns. This motion produces an AC output from the other half of the piezo. The flat face of the cylinder is held par- allel to an oily test surface and the latter is supported on a micrometer stage so that the gap between the two surfaces can be adjusted. As the gap is narrowed the oil film dampens the sinusoi- dal motion of the cylinder and the extent of this damping can be used to determine the viscosity of the oil film between the sur- faces. 1991 SAE Transactions Section 4 279</page><page sequence="279">912413-912419 912413. (SP-889) An overview of the technical implications of methanol and ehtanol as highway motor vehicle fuels. Frank Black, U.S. Environmental Protection Agency. The characteristics of methanol and ethanol as highway motor vehicle fuels are contrasted with those of conventional gasolines and diesel fuels. The implications of the physical and chemical differences of these fuels for motor vehicle design and emissions are discussed. Potential material compatibility concerns, such as elastomer swelling and metal corrosion, and safety concerns, such as fire hazard, flame luminosity, and human toxicity are examined. A number of possible air quality impacts are exam- ined including changes in ozone, carbon monoxide, oxides of nitrogen, particulate matter, toxic compounds (benzene, alde- hydes, 1,3-butadiene), and global climate "greenhouse" gases (carbon dioxide, methane, nitrous oxide). 1991 SAE Transactions Section 4 912414. (SP-889) Methanol preignition temperature behavior. William H. Haight, Dept. of Civil and Mech. Engrg.y United States Military Academy ; and Philip C. Malte , Dept. of Mech. Engrg.y University of Washington. The preignition behavior of neat methanol in the four-stroke, naturally aspirated, watercooled, spark ignition engine is reported. Specifically, the preignition threshold (or minimum) temperature for a hot spot other than the firing spark plug is determined as a function of the engine variables, including com- pression ratio, fuel-air ratio, spark timing, coolant temperature, and intake charge temperature and degree of valorization. These experimental results are quantitatively compared to a methanol preignition model available in the literature. The range of preignition threshold temperatures measured is 1020 to 1220K. The trend of decreasing preignition threshold tempera- ture with increasing cylinder pressure is observed, consistent with the model. However, there is a quantitative difference between the measurements and model results, which is discussed in the paper. Also, briefly examined are the effects of charge swirl and lubricating oil composition on preignition tendency. The study was conducted with a single cylinder Cooperative Fuels Research engine, of simple combustion chamber geometry, and thus, the results are of value primarily for their fundamental content, and for comparison of behavior. 1991 SAE Transactions Section 4 912415. (SP-889) Vapor pressure characteristics of M85 meth- anol fuels. Robert L. Furey and Kevin L. Perry , General Motors Research Labs. This study was undertaken to determine the vapor pressure characteristics of M85 fuel, a mixture of 85 percent methanol and 15 percent gasoline or other hydrocarbons. For M 85 fuels made with full-boiling-range gasolines, the vapor pressure of the M85 fuel at 37.8°C increased linearly with an increase in the vapor pressure of the gasoline. A different linear relationship was obtained for M85 fuels made with pure hydrocarbons rather than with gasolines. The vapor pressure of an M85 fuel was higher when the hydrocarbon component was a pure hydrocarbon or simple hydrocarbon mixture rather than a gasoline of the same vapor pressure. Vapor pressure versus temperature characteristics were mea- sured for a number of M 85 fuels and the hydrocarbons from which they were made. In most cases, a change in temperature caused a greater change in the vapor pressure of the M85 fuel than in the vapor pressure of the hydrocarbon component of the M85. 1991 SAE Transactions Section 4 912416. (SP-889) Fuel methanol composition effects on cold starting. John E. Kirwan and Norman D. Brinkman , General Motors Research Labs. This paper documents the effects of primer composition and concentration on cold starting of 3. 1L variable fuel vehicle (VFV) engines with fuel methanol. Primers were restricted to two com- mercially viable types: full boiling range gasolines and light isocrackate (LIC). Results show that cold starting performance improved with increasing pentane:butane ratio in fuels of equiva- lent RVP, and improved with increasing primer content. Cold starting performance showed an excellent correlation with vapor- air equivalence ratio (3&gt;fv) and with initial liquid mass fraction of butanes and pentanes; the correlation between cold starting performance and fuel RVP was poor. 1991 SAE Transactions Section 4 912417. (SP-889) A simulation model for a methanol fueled turbocharged multi-cylinder automotive spark ignition engine. P. Mohanan and M. K. Gajendra Babu , Indian Institute of Technol- ogy . The development of a computer simulation model for an automotive turbocharged mutli cylinder spark ignition engine for gasoline and methanol operations is described in this paper. The model illustrates the simulation of the thermodynamic cylce comprising of compression, combustion, expansion, exhaust and intake processes. The scheme employed for matching the turbo- charger and engine is also highlighted. The computed data of the above model is validated with the available experimental data. The model predicts the brake power developed by the engine, brake specific energy consumption, the nitrogen oxide and car- bon monoxide emissions for both the gasoline and methanol operations, corresponding to the original and improved manifold design configurations. The overall analysis of the results show an increase in power output, lower nitrogen oxide and carbon mon- oxide emissions and improved brake specific energy consump- tion for the methanol fueled engine as compared to the gasoline version for both the original and modified engine designs operat- ing on naturally aspirated and turbocharged conditions. 912418. (SP-889) Neat methanol combustion in a D.I. diesel engine using catalytically coated glow plugs. William L. Mitchell Dept. of Mech. Engrg.y Pennsylvania State Univ.; and Thomas A. Litzinger and Domenie A. Santaviccat Pennsylvania State Univ. Enhancement of methanol combustion in a direct injected die- sel engine using catalytically coated glow plugs was examined for platinum and palladium catalysts and compared to a non- catalytic baseline case. Experiments were performed for 6 and 10 brake kilowatts (bKW) at 2500 rpm. Comparisons were made based on combustion, performance, and emissions including car- bon monoxide (CO), oxides of nitrogen (NOx), unburned hydro- carbons (UHC), unburned methanol (UBM), and aldehydes. Results show a decrease in glow plug temperature of 100 K is achievable using platinum catalysts, and 150 K for palladium. Furthermore, the palladium catalyst was found to provide better combustion characteristics than the platinum catalyst. Also, the use of both catalysts produced lower aldehyde emissions, and the palladium reduced NO* emissions as well. However, unburned methanol increased for both catalytic glow plugs with respect to the non-catalytic case. 1991 SAE Transactions Section 3 912419.

The test variables included the type of fuel, equivalence ratio, ignition pressure and ignition temperature. It was found that coal-derived fuels exhibit a longer ignition delay than light diesel fuel, primarily because of its higher aromatic content. Rich and lean mixtures produce long delay whilst the minimum delay occurred at the stoichiometric mixture. Higher ignition pressures and temperatures reduced the 280</page><page sequence="280">912419-912426 delay. The fuels that were considered suitable for high speed engines were singled out; also those suitable for medium and slow speed engines were put forward. A correlation was developed to predict the data which read: t = Apn¡g Kmexp(E/RT¡g). Arrhenius plots were made to evaluate the activation energy of each test fuel. 912420. (SP-889) Dimethyl ether as an ignition enhancer for methanol-fueled diesel engines. Michael E. Karpuk , John D. Wright, James L. Dippo, and Daniel E. Jantzen, TD A Research, Inc. Methanol-fueled diesels may be an attractive means of meet- ing future, more restrictive diesel particulate standards since methanol combustion forms very little soot. Unfortunately, methanol's autoignition temperature is high, and some means of improving its ignition is required. Therefore, we have investi- gated the use of dimethyl ether (DME), aspirated with the com- bustion air, to enhance the ignition of the injected methanol. A small, on-board catalytic reactor could be used to generate DME from the methanol fuel. This system requires minimal modifica- tions to the engine design, and does not require use of an additive or fuel other than methanol. In this study, we measured maximum cylinder pressure and rate of pressure rise, ignition delay, emissions, and relative effi- ciencies for a single-cylinder, direct injection, high-speed diesel engine operated on both diesel fuel and methanol-DME. The tests showed DME to be an effective ignition-enhancer over the engine's entire operating range, without excessive maximum cycle pressures, with lower maximum rates of pressure rise, and with efficiencies equivalent to those achieved on diesel fuel. Additionally, ignition timing was controllable (within limits) by adjusting the concentration of DME in the inlet air. At a given operating point, acceptable operation was achieved with a wide range of DME concentrations. Particulate emissions were greatly reduced during operation on methanol-DME. NOx emissions were also reduced when com- pared to diesel-fuel operation, but were more a function of igni- tion timing than fuel. Moderate increases were seen in unburned hydrocarbons. As with diesel-fueled operation, CO emissions were negligible, but were slightly higher during operation on methanol-DME. However, in the air-rich exhaust of a diesel engine, HC and CO are considerably easier to control with cata- lytic converters than particulates and NOx. 912421. (SP-889) A simple method to determine the methanol content of methanol fuels. Scott W. Jorgensen, Robert L. Furey, and Kevin L. Perry, General Motors Research Labs. We have developed and validated a simple, quick, inexpen- sive method for determining the methanol or hydrocarbon con- tent of a methanol blend fuel (a mixture of methanol and gaso- line). The method exploits the insolubility of water in hydrocar- bons. Briefly, 50 mL of fuel is mixed with a like amount of water and allowed to settle; the volume of the upper phase is directly correlated to the amount of hydrocarbon in the fuel. Equations and graphs are provided which translate between the hydrocar- bon volume measured and the methanol content or the hydrocar- bon content of the fuel. This method and the graphs and equa- tions in this report are valid for methanol fuels made with any gasoline or virtually any hydrocarbon mixture, provided there are not oxygenates such as ethanol or MTBE present in the hydro- carbon fraction. The accuracy and precision of the method are excellent, for mixtures of dry methanol and oxygenate free gaso- line. 912422. Global progress and problems in motor vehicle pollu- tion control. Michael P. Walsh, Consultant. Over the past century, huge amounts of air pollutants and gases have been released into the atmosphere that now pose risks to human health, natural ecosystems, and the earth's climate. Motor vehicles are a major contributor to both the built-up of greenhouse gases - potentially the most serious of these problems - and the creation of urban smog and acid rain. The purpose of this paper is to summarize the nature of these prob- lems and the role played by motor vehicles in causing them. The significance of pollutants other than CO2 which are emitted in large quantities from vehicles will be shown to be important for global warming. Further, the increasing significance of vehicles produced or registered in rapidly expanding countries will be assessed. Finally, the growing importance of vehicle modes other than passenger cars will be summarized. 912423. Diesel vehicles emissions control in Santiago, Chile: itinerary and technical developments. Richard A. Katz, S.K. Ecologia; and Alejandro A. Saez, Reysa. Air quality in Santiago (4.500.00 habs) has deteriorated during the last decade. This situation is aggraveted by the topographical and meteorological set up of Santiago. Around 55% of the trips are served by diesel buses, the rest through, cars, taxis, shared taxis, metro and foot. Buses in Santiago are constructed using truck chassis with school bus type body. Engines are water refrig- erated, 4-6 cylinder direct injection diesels. Analysis of environ- mental data shows that 70% of PM-10 comes from diesel emis- sions. Emissions have been measured according to Santiago's cycle. Measurement procedures EPA based. Emissions are 3 gr/km. I&amp;M procedures were researched to determine the motives for the high emissions. Results showed that this area is highly under- developed. A pilot program in which different fuels and technolo- gies were used was implemented. Results of this experience is that the best C/E solution was well maintained diesel engines. Emis- sions of 0,34 gr/km was achieved. Other aspects analyzed were: emission inspection through dynamometer and opacimeter. This system is being automatized. New emission standards were drafted. The standards establish a gradual increase in emission limitations. In the final step 1991 EPA diesel standard for urban buses are proposed. 912425. The effect of fuel properties on particulates emissions in heavy-duty truck engines under transient operating conditions. W. W. Lange, Shell Research Ltd. The effects of diesel fuel properties and composition have been investigated in an andvanced, low emissions, Detroit Diesel Corporation (DDC) series 60 engine. The test results have revealed that particulates emissions in the U.S. Transient test are governed mainly by fuel sulphur content and fuel density. The density effect is due to overselling of the engine which may result from how the cycle is calibrated and from how heavy-duty engines are governed under transitional operation. The model developed from these data correlates well with other published data and confirms the general case that fuel density, rather than aromatics content, is-with fuel sulphur-the dominant factor affecting exhaust particulates. The analysis of particulates com- position supports these findings but reveals an additional fuel parameter, volatility, which has a minor second-order effect on particulates emissions. 1991 SAE Transactions Section 4 912426. Motor vehicle pollution control in Mexico City. Bravo A. Humberto, Torres J. Ricardo, and Sosa E. Rodolfo, Centro de Ciencias de la Atmosfera. The geographical location of the metropolitan zone of Mexico City (latitude 19°35'N and 99°40' west of longitude), its physiog- raphy (located in a basin at 2240 m of altitude) and its regional meteorology (high frequency of calms and temperature inver- sions through the year) combine with the emissions of stationary and mobile sources to conform a "virtual" natural reactor where the photochemical activity, represented by a high number of exceedences to the ozone Mexican air quality standard (0.11 ppm 281</page><page sequence="281">912426-912432 lhrs/day) is in the early 90's, the biggest problem in Mexico City. An analysis of the spatial distribution of the NOx and COV in the Metropolitan Area of Mexico City is made. Also, included is an evaluation of the air quality control strategies implemented and its effects on the air quality of the Mexico Basin. 912427. Motor vehicle exhaust emissions legislation policy in Yugoslavia. Stojan Petrovic, University of Belgrade ; Vladan Popovic, Institution for Standardization ; Ferdinand Terne, Insti- tute TAM; and Dusan Venturini, Institute TOMOS. According to UN '58' agreement", Yugoslavia is applying exhaust emissions ECE Regulations in three directions: vehicle type approval, conformity of production and control of vehicle in use. Approximately 95% of Yugoslav engine and vehicle pro- duction has been covered by type approvals granted by Yugoslav Federal Institution for Standardization. However, test results show that over 50% of approved vehicles are not more than 20% below existing limits. Therefore, measures are undertaken to ensure conformity of production, though there are not enough data to judge emissions quality during production because of manufacturers lack of instrumentation. Emissions control of vehicles in use involves once a year regular inspection and peri- odic inspections in traffic. Inspections include idle CO for gaso- line engines and free acceleration smoke for diesel engines, but incomplete results show unsatisfactory level of about 25% vehi- cles over existing limits. It is expected that Yugoslavia will follow future European regulations for 1992. 1991 SAE Transactions Section 3 912428. Yugoslav approach to the solution to problems of eco- logical environment. Milan Radovanoviç and Stevan Veinoviç, IME; Bogdan Veselinoviç, IMR ; and Dragoslav Baniç, Yugo. Development of car production industry in Yugoslavia has three ecological phases. The first one is to satisfy the ECE rules by optimization of engine and vehicle equipment. The second phase is to enter the American market with help of professional foreign development institutions. The third phase is now in focus: to adjust to new European regulations. For the development tasks it is typical to lean on foreign licenses. The real development jobs were occasionally given to faculties, while the research units in factors were overburdened by operative tasks from production. Research jobs were always at mother companies, and only some small segment of them was, for the short period, at some faculty of larger institute. 912429. (SP-890) Composition and reactivity of fuel vapor emissions from gasoline-oxygenate blends. Robert L. Furey and Kevin L. Perry, General Motors Research Labs. Laboratory bench tests were conducted to simulate both the diurnal and the hot-soak (carburetor only) parts of an evapora- tive emissions test with gasolines containing various alcohols and ethers. The mass of vapor generated during each test and the detailed composition of the vapor were determined for each fuel. Using published atmospheric reactivity scales, the ozone-forming potential of the vapor was estimated. Based on the scale of maxi- mum incremental reactivities, which the California Air Resources Board has proposed for future emissions standards, the diurnal test results showed that the addition of methyl terti- ary-butyl ether (MTBE) or ethyl tertiary-butyl ether (ETBE) to gasoline resulted in about the same or lower total vapor reactivity compared to the gasoline alone. A blend of gasoline with ethanol or with a methanol-ethanol mixture also produced diurnal vapor with lower total reactivity, but only when the vapor pressures of the gasoline-oxygenate blends did not exceed that of the gasoline. At equal oxygenate concentrations in the fuel, MTBE was the most effective in reducing the reactivity per gram of vapor. In the carburetor hot-soak tests, the total reactivity of the vapor was higher for all of the gasoline-oxygenate blends than for gasoline alone because the blends generated more vapor. How- ever, the reactivity per gram of gasoline-oxygenate blend vapor was similar to or lower than that for gasoline. 1991 SAE Transactions Section 4 912430. Why gasoline 90% distillation temperature affects emissions with port fuel injection and premixed charge. Ather A. Quader, Thompson M. Sloane, Robert M. Sinkevitch, and Keith L. Olson, General Motors Research Labs. Statistically designed experiments were run in a single- cylinder engine to understand the reason for the decrease in exhaust mass HC emissions found in the auto/oil program with decreasing 90% distillation temperature (T90) of gasoline. Besides T90, the effects of mixture preparation, equivalence ratio, and ambient temperature on emissions and fuel consump- tion were measured. HC emissions were higher with PFI than with premixed charge, but decreasing T90 decreased HC emis- sions with both premixed charge and PFI. Rich mixture and low ambient temperature increased HC emissions. Speciated exhaust HC measurements indicate that incomplete vaporization of heavy components of the gasoline (C8-C10 alkanes, C6-C9 aro- matics and alkenes) was responsible for higher HC emissions. 1991 SAE Transactions Section 4 912431. (SP-890) Effect of reformulated gasoline and metha- nol on exhaust emissions. Kazuo Kojima, Toshio Hirota, and Keiji Yakushiji, Engine Development Dept., Nissan Motor Co., Ltd.; Yasunori Iwakirì, Engine and Powertrain Research Lab., Nissan Motor Co., Ltd.; Keisuke Oda, Materials Research Lab., Nissan Motor Co., Ltd.; and Yasuhisa Akutsu, Administration and Service Engrg. Dept., Nissan Arc Co., Ltd. This study evaluates the influence of speciated emissions on ozone reactivity using the values of maximum incremental reac- tivity published by the California Air Resources Board in Sep- tember 1990. To evaluate the influence of fuels and vehicle specifications on speciated emissions and ozone reactivity, three different fuels (gasoline, reformulated gasoline, and methanol (M85)) were used. Hydrocarbon species were measured using three types of gas chromatographs. Aldehydes were collected in a dry cartridge and measured by high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). Alcohols were collected using impingers and measured by a gas Chromatograph. In the case of gasoline, as non-methane organic gas (NMOG) is reduced, the proportion of speciated emissions with high ozone reactivity decreases, and this tends to lower ozone forming poten- tial (OFP). In the case of reformulated gasoline, OFP does not decrease, but non-methane hydrocarbons (NMHC) do as NMOG is reduced. In the case of M 85, it is difficult to find a general corre- lation between NMOG and OFP. 1991 SAE Transactions Section 4 912432. Effect of volatility on intermediate-temperature driveability with hydrocarbon-only and oxygenated gasolines. J. P. Graham, Chevron Research and Technology Co.; B. Evans, Coordinating Research Council; Robert M. Reuter, Texaco, Inc.; and J. H. Steury, Amoco Oil Co. A cooperative cold-start and warmup driveability program was conducted by the Coordinating Research Council (CRC) in Yakima, Washington, during the fall of 1989. The program inves- tigated the independent effects of front-end and mid-range vola- tility on cold-start and warmup driveability of twenty-four late model vehicles at intermediate ambient temperatures (30°F -56°F). Volatility ranges investigated were those that may be required of future summertime fuels. Mid-range volatility, (T50) was found to have a substantially significant impact on drivea- bility, regardless of fuel-system type, while front-end volatility (RVP) was found to show a lesser but still significant effect on carbureted and throttle-body-injected vehicles. Oxygenate con- tent/type was also a significant variable. 282</page><page sequence="282">912433-912637 912433. Overview of on-board diagnostic systems used on 1991 California vehicles. Michael A. Bogdanoff and Steven Hada, Cali- fornia Air Resources Board. In October 1985, the Air Resources Board (ARB) adopted requirements that 1988 and later California vehicles be equipped with on-board diagnostic (OBD) systems. These systems were required on all new passenger cars, light-duty trucks and medi- um-duty vehicles equipped with three-way catalysts and feedback fuel controls. Exemptions from these requirements were granted for up to three model years if a manufacturer's change-over schedule for an electronic design was not consistent with the 1988 implementation. However, full compliance with OBD provisions was required beginning with 1991 models. This report summa- rizes the OBD system designs used on most 1991 California mod- els. The purpose of the OBD system is to expedite the proper repair of emission-related malfunctions and, thus, reduce vehicle emissions. The OBD system is to regularly monitor the function of the on-board computer, computer-sensed components, the fuel metering system, and the exhaust gas recirculation system. When malfunctions are detected, a malfunction indicator light (MIL) mounted in the dash panel illuminates thereby cautioning the vehicle operator that a repair is needed. Also, a fault code is stored in the OBD computer memory. When the vehicle is brought to a repair facility, the computer code provides the mechanic with the likely areas of malfunction for diagnosing and repairing the vehicle. After the repair is performed, the fault code is cleared and the MIL is extinguished. The OBD system will sub- sequently confirm if the proper repair has been performed. Besides reducing emissions through expedient and proper repairs, the OBD system encourages manufacturers to design and build more reliabile emission-control systems. The motivation of this is to reduce warranty costs because certain component fail- ures would now be automatically identified and repaired under warranty. Additionally, the manufacturers would like to diminish the likelihood of MIL illumination because this affects the con- sumers' perception of vehicle quality and the make of vehicle, even after the warranty has expired. The OBD system also improves the effectiveness of vehicle inspection programs by identifying malfunctions in sophisticated emission-control sys- tems which might otherwise go undetected. 912434. The SAE oil Labeling assessment program - 1990 sample set. M. L. McMillan, Oil Labeling Assessment Program Review Committee; and R. M. Stewart, Consultant. The results of analyses on 300 samples of engine oil purchased in the retail market in 1990 are discussed. All samples were labeled with the API SF or SG service category, separtely, or in combiantion with an API C category designation. Also, 17 oils previously found to be questionably labeled, from the 1989 set, were repurchased and analyzed. The results are inlcuded. 912436. Particulate emissions from current model vehicles using gasoline with methylcyclopentadienyl manganese tricar- bonyl. R. H. Hammerle, T. J. Komiski, J. E. Weir, E. Chládek, C. A. Gierczak, and R. G. Hurley, Ford Motor Co. Particulate and manganese mass emissions have been mea- sured as a function of mileage for four Escort and four Explorer vehicles using both methylcyclopentadienyl manganese tricar- bonyl (MMT) gasoline at 1/32 g Mn/gal and MMT-free gasoline. The vehicles were driven on public roads at an average speed of 54 mph to accumulate mileage, and the MMT was used in half of the fleet starting at 5,000 miles. This is an interim report describing the particulate and manganese emissions at 5,000, 20, 000 and 55,000 miles. These vehicles are scheduled to continue mileage accumulation to 105,000 miles with emission testing at 85,000 and 105,000 miles. Of the total manganese used in the fuel, between 6% and 45% was emitted as airborne particulate matter, and the remainder was probably stored in the engine, cat- alyst and the exhaust system. The percentage of the manganese that was emitted increased with mileage accumulation. The EPA reports that manganese emissions of this magnitude may repre- sent a health hazard. Also about 8% of the manganese used in the fuel was found in the engine oil. The manganese that is stored in the engine, catalyst and the exhaust system will be analyzed when the vehicles reach 105,000 miles. The total particulate emissions were between 0 and 5 mg/mi increasing with mileage accumula- tion and with MMT usage. The regulated emissions are approxi- mately 0.3 g HC/mi, 3 g CO/mi and 0.4 g NOx/mi. The regulated and non-regulated gaseous emissions will be described in com- panion reports. 1991 SAE Transactions Section 4 912437. The effect on emissions and emission component durability by the fuel additive methylcyclopentadienyl manganese tricarbonyl (MMT)./?. G. Hurley, L. A. Hansen, D. L. Guttridge, H. S. Gandhi, R. H. Hammerle, and A. D. Matzo, Ford Motor Co. Vehicle emissions have been measured and the results statisti- cally evaluated for a vehicle test fleet consisting of four Escorts and four Explorers using both methylcyclopentadienyl manga- nese tricarbonyl (MMT) at 1/32 gram Mn/gallon and clear (MMT free) fuel. The fleet was divided in half -half with MMT and half without MMT doped fuel. This interim report covers emission measurement results at 5,000; 15,000; and 50,000 miles of exposure to MMT doped fuel. The planned mileage accumula- tion is for 100,000 miles of durability and exposure to MMT based fuel. A modified paired t-test is used to analyze the emis- sion data obtained from all the fleet vehicles. The statistical eval- uation of both feedgas and tailpipe emissions indicated that the use of MMT is detrimental to emissions of HC at both the 15,000 mile and 50,000 mile levels of MMT exposure. Indications also are as mileage is accumulated, the worse the effect on HC by MMT. CO tailpipe emission responses at 15,000 miles show a deleterious effect by MMT but a beneficial effect at 50,000 miles. All NO* emission responses show a beneficial effect by MMT at the 15,000 mile level but all emission responses indicate a delete- rious effect at 50,000 miles by MMT. Particulate emissions are described in a companion report. The physical and chemical characterization, as well as the final emission results, of emission components will be reported following completion of the pro- gram at 100,000 miles. 1991 SAE Transactions Section 4 912636. Update of SPC process on automatic fastener installa- tions. Phillip J. Swart, Boeing Co. Last year we preseneted a short paper regarding using statisti- cal process control (SPC) on CE rivets. This year we would like to update you on the status of this project. In addition, we would like to introduce you to another application of this process. The application is regarding the window frames installed on the 737 airplane. In this paper, we will deal with the interaction of the operators and the SPC focal, the short term results and the long term effects. In the new example of window frame, we will deal with the statis- tical quality control (SQC) software developed by Boeing for our- selves and our vendors. We will touch on our changing relation- ship with our vendors and the cost justification to improve our product. 912637. Production automation support advantage's of a spe- cilized team.

Mechanical joining characteristics of aluminum- lithium in a production environment. Steven G. Keener ; Douglas Aircraft Co., McDonnell Douglas Corp. Aluminum-lithium (Al-Li) alloys have been developed with reduced weight and increased durability characteristics. The application of these new alloys as primary aircraft structure has created the need for refinements in the mechanical joining and stress-coining processes currently employed throughout the aero- space industry. These processes deal specifically with fastener hole preparation, installation processes, and fatigue enhancement techniques associated with stress-coin cold-working methods for mechanical joints. This paper attempts to dispel the myths asso- ciated with such processing of 2090 Al-Li alloy sheet and extru- sions. Presented are some lessons learned during assembly of the USAF's new C-17A STOL transport airlifter when utilizing Al-Li material. 1991 SAE Transactions Section 1 912641. Development of a semi-automated fastening sub- system. Ross Welterlen and Gary J. Mueller, McDonnell Douglas Corp. As part of an ongoing effort to automate air-frame assembly at the McDonnell Aircraft Company, an automated drilling sys- tem has been implemented to perform outer mold-line fastener hole preparation for the AV-8B, Harrier, wing assembly. The skin must be secured to the substructure as the hole preparation prog- ress in order to assure consistent hole quality and skin to struc- ture fit-up. The development of this capability posed a challeng- ing production engineering problem for McDonnell Aircraft manufacturing engineers to solve. Ultimately, a semi-automatic fastening subsystem was developed to temporarily secure the skin to the structure. This paper outlines the engineering studies and decisions that led to the development of this technology and those that determined its final form. 912643. Quality quest of a TQM approach for automated fas- tening. Norman Reinertsen and Richard Chance, Grumman Corp. Our current emphasis of total quality management concepts provides strong encouragement for process control in lieu of inspection. The implementation of automated fastening pro- cesses gives an excellent opportunity to employ this concept, but it must be considered up front during the initial planning and development phases. This paper will review how Grumman has taken this approach with some of our automated fastening pro- cesses with an emphasis on robotic assembly and automated riv- eting operations. The process control approaches that are discussed include sta- tistical process control (SPC), periodic verfication, and built-in sensors. The SPC techniques emphasize capability studies and the use of capability indexes. The periodic verification proce- dures include accuracy checks of the automated hole locating and drilling operations. In addition, the use of built-in sensors to monitor critical parameters are reviewed. Concluding remarks include a commentary on the problems relating to reducing inspection for automated processes and rec- ommendations for overcoming these problems. 1991 SAE Transactions Section 1 912644. An aerospace manufacturing improvement process. Thomas E. Endres, University of Dayton. The two basic methods of process improvement are discussed. The continuous and methodical Japanese system for improve- ment called Kaizen is presented along with the typical U.S. approach to improvement called innovation. The two contrast- ing methodologies are discussed individually and then are com- bined to form a strategy for improving the aerospace manufactur- ing process. The Kaizen of continuous improvements in part fix- turing and the innovations of new automatic riveting techniques are combined to provide a tool for survival in the ever increasing competitive aerospace fastening business. The process of transition from today to the future not only means changes in equipment and methods but also changes in people and management. An integrated approach to managing the elements of change is presented. The paper tries the "what is necessary" and the "how to implement" strategies into one com- prehensive concept called progress. 912645. K-fast auto nut feeder. William Sievers, Greg Harwell, John Fischer, and Derek Eimes, Microdot Aerospace Fastening Systems Group. Changes in fastener dimensions and envelop design combined with distance to send fasteners new update torque requirements added to hard copy torque computation and joint historical review has given us, Microdot Aerospace, the opportunity to design, build and sell a new and varied brand of automatic riveter nut running units. We started by changing some of our units from magazine to vibrating bowl feeding and in the process sending fastener up to 150 feet. After this original change we were asked to set up tools with electronic torque control and the ability to store and print each separate nut and hole torque. This machine also acts as its own quality control and gives an instant reading of an out of spec fastener combination. This machine has also been set up to shut off unit if nut is not in place. 912647. Project-5 axis CNC auto-riveting. James M. Sinn, Learjet Inc. In the last decade the field of auto riveting has appeared to have lagged behind in its application of computer technology. To move this process into the world referred to as CNC, many tradi- tional concepts need challenged. The manufacturing engineering environment must take the position that riveting can be a machine tool process capable of utilizing the latest in CNC tech- nology. The ability to assemble components with a wide range of tolerances via the accuracy of computers is a reality if proper con- cepts are employed. 912648. Update of composite fastener technology at BHTI. Joanne G. Hutchins, Bell Helicopter Textron, Inc. Composite fasteners are of great interest to the aircraft indus- try as an improved method for joining composite structure. Cur- rent metal-fastener technology does not adequately address all the relevant concerns, problems that contribute to increased costs, weight, and radar signature. Emerging composite fastener technology offers the potential of alleviating some of these prob- lems. Preliminary data on polyetheretherketone (PEEK) continu- ous carbon fiber fasteners were developed, coupons were tested, data were analyzed, and preliminary design criteria were estab- lished to facilitate application to design. These criteria were then utilized to select potential structural elements and components for fastener installation. A test element was identified, fasteners were installed, a static test performed, and fasteners evaluated in aircraft structure. A component was identified, the fasteners were installed in a secondary composite structure and flight tests were conducted. Results verified that composite fasteners provide an efficient means to lower costs and aircraft weight, and reduce radar signature. 1991 SAE Transactions Section 1 912650.

The AERAC installs the final rivets in the A330/A340 upper wing panel in the floor assembly jig. At Tex- tron for each wing the corresponding floor assembly jigs for each wing are lined up end to end. An operating procedure in which the formboards are removed in bays allows efficient operation of an in the jig riveter such as the AERAC. Specialized machine codes developed for the AERAC allows quick fully programmed stringer to stringer jumps of the stringer side offset tooling. The AERAC is programmed entirely from a CATIA drawing of the part. Of the 5 axes of rivet data available only two are retained for use by the AERAC. 912655. Improvements in performance of vermiculite- containing non asbestos organic brake friction materials. C. C. Ou and L. Bablouzian, W.R. Grace and Co.; and James T. Trainor, J. T. Trainor and Associates. The effects ofvermiculite on the structural properties and per- formance of a model non asbestos organic (NAO) dry brake fric- tion material have been evaluated. The incorporation of 8%, 12%, and 20% (volume percent, V%) vermiculite has been tested. Structural tests show an 18% improvement in flexural strength. Dynamometer performance shows a significant improvement in fade pressure stability and low temperature effectiveness. Pre- form strength, Gogan hardness, thermal compression, and ther- mal expansion have also been evaluated. 912656. Dynamical behaviour of the disc brake pad. Thomas Borchert, TEXTAŘ GmbH. High-frequency brake noise is generated by the contact inter- action between the friction surfaces of the brake pad and the brake disc during the braking act, and influenced by the topogra- phy, the tribological third body, pressure, temperature, sliding velocity, environmental conditions etc. The solution to this automobile comfort problem can be reached by defined chemical friction material formulations deter- mining the pad topography and therefore the time-dependent self-excited vibration force. With defined starting and boundary conditions this force has to be included into the macro- mechanical model described by analtyical and numerical meth- ods. 1991 SAE Transactions Section 6 912660. Freightliner "business class" truck program. Bjorn Klingenberg, Freightliner Corp. Producing a commercial vehicle in a single location to satisfy the needs fo multiple applications in a world market, cannot be realistically accomplished. Instead, Mercedes-Benz and its sub- sidiary, Freighliner Corporation, have adopted a strategy, charac- terized as multidomestic rather than multinational, which relies on production of trucks in many locations. In this way, qualities can be offered which are in unique demand in those markets while minimizing the development effort and capitalizing on worldwide component sourcing. Presently Mercedes-Benz, including Freightliner, operates 54 truck manufacturing and assembly plants throughout the world. As a part of, and following this strategy, Freightliner has recently launched an all new medium-duty truck program for the U.S. market, produced in an all new manufacturing plant in Cleveland, North Carolina. The present paper describes this pro- gram and its development. 912661. Application of a low emission methanol engine to a heavy-duty truck- Vehicle installation and operating experience. E. H.

This paper represents an overview of some basic issues faced by the chassis designer looking at alternate fuels for heavy-duty trucks. Specifically, vehicle modifications required to install a methanol fueled engine, based on the Navistar DT-466 diesel, equipped with an electronically controlled hot surface ignition (glow-plug) system and a catalytic converter. The engine, operating in a city of South Lake Tahoe truck, is part of an ongoing program sponsored by the California Energy Commission and the South Coast Air Quality Management Dis- trict to demonstrate clean fuel technology. 912662. Increasing heavy-duty truck fuel economy. James M. Ehlbeck and Michael von Mayenburg, Freightliner Corp. This paper derives a parametric equation for predicting the fuel economy of on-highway heavy-duty trucks. The accuracy of this equation is compared to actual vehicle MPG results. Based on this equation, the relative importance of the numerous param- eters which affect the fuel economy of on-highway heavy-duty vehicles are calculated and discussed. To illustrate the value of this methodology, the development of the newest Freightliner energy/saver package is described and the results from a cross- country fuel economy test on this package are presented. Using these same methods, the future for increasing on-highway heavy- duty truck fuel economy is explored. 1991 SAE Transactions Section 2 912665. Conceptual design of the south coast alternative motor fuels demonstration project. George Sverdrup, Rolland King, Michael Murphy, John Herridge, John Orban, and Todd Kre- nelka, Battelle. The conceptual design for a large scale, alternative motor fuels demonstration using delivery vans in the Los Angeles area is described. Vehicles built by Chrysler, Ford, and General Motors will be demonstrated on compressed natural gas, methanol (M-85), ethanol blend, reformulated gasoline, and liquefied petroleum gas. Control vehicles will run on unleaded gasoline. About 20 vehicles will run on each fuel. A smaller number of elec- tric vehicles from other sources will also be demonstrated. Data will be collected over a 24-month period on speciated emissions, safety, performance, reliability, maintenance, and durability. An economic assessment of the use of each of the fuels will be per- formed from a fleet operator's perspective. Federal Express Cor- poration will serve as the host fleet. 912666. (SP-891) The feeding habits of diesel engines: a review of alternate fuels for the fleet operator. Christopher IV. Ferrone, Americoach Systems, Inc. The subject of alternate fuels has been addressed for the past 20 years in an effort to solve emissions and world fuel supply con- cerns. A recent study of the available literature and technology to date pointed out a need for a single source of information for the fleet operator. This paper will be divided into discussions of emissions requirements, world fuel supplies, alternate fuel options and the technical concerns to the fleet operator. 912667. (SP-891) Real-time measurements of soot particles at the exhaust valve of a diesel engine. Hermann-Josef Klingen and Paul Roth, Universität Duisburg. Diesel particles are formed and also reduced during diffusion- controlled spray combustion in the chamber of a diesel engine. In earlier investigations it was found that the particles directly sampled near the exhaust valve were irregularly shaped, having a median diameter of 50 to 100 nm. The engine combustion pro- cess is cyclic and nonuniform and is imbedded in a highly nonsta- tionary flow. The soot particles formed during the combustion process were emitted during the opening period of the exhaust valve together with the burned gas. This results in strong time- dependent fluctuations of the particle mass density in the exhaust pipe. It is the aim of this study to measure the dynamic particle 285</page><page sequence="285">912667-912674 behavior during the exhaust gas flow. Laser light scattered by the diesel particles was measured very close to the exhaust valve. The light flux signals obtained under several fixed angles showed a periodic structure and were interpreted in terms of size parame- ters by applying the Mie theory. 1991 SAE Transactions Section 2 912668. (SP-891) The first transportable heavy duty vehicle emissions testing laboratory. R. Bata, N. Clark, M. Gautam , A. Howell, T. Long, J. Loth, D. Lyons, M. Palmer, J. Smith, and, W. Wang, Dept. of Mech. and Aerospace Engrg., West Virginia Univ. Growing concern about energy conservation and exhaust gas emissions from heavy duty engines of trucks and buses has increased the demand for the use of alternate fuels. A unique transportable testing laboratory designed to measure specific con- stituents of exhaust gas emissions from the engines of heavy duty vehicles operating on conventional or alternate fuels has been constructed by a team from West Virginia University. In this transportable facility, a special flat-bed trailer has been con- structed to accommodate drive train units, free-rotating rollers, power-absorbing units to simulate road load, and flywheels to simulate vehicle inertia. Four hydraulic jacks are used to lower it to the ground at the fleet site. This allows the tested vehicle to be driven onto rollers embedded in the flat-bed. Hub adapters are connected at the outboard wheel locations at each side of the drive shaft of the vehicle. A companion trailer has been con- structed to accommodate the exhaust gas analysis system which includes both full and auxiliary exhaust flow dilution tunnels, and exhaust gas analyzers for CO, CO2, NOx, and HC. Particulate emissions, methane, formaldehyde and methanol are also mea- sured. The instrument trailer also contains a computer-based data acquisition and control system, and other necessary accesso- ries to monitor such parameters as torque, speed, flow rate, and temperature. 1991 SAE Transactions Section 2 912669. (SP-891) Low mileage evaluation of an electrically regenerable diesel particulate trap. Robert I. Bruetsch and Rich- ard Bloom, U.S. Environmental Protection Agency. A woven fiber diesel particulate filter has been developed which demonstrates good low-mileage soot-trapping and regener- ation efficiencies. The fiber filters are wound around electric heating elements, which provide uniform energy in close proxim- ity to the soot-laden fiber during regeneration. The filters are loaded with particulate to a target backpressure and energized one at a time with intermittent particulate loading to the target backpressure between successive filter regenerations. These design features were utilized to help minimize regeneration power requirements, and maximize mileage accumulation between regenerations. Regenerations are performed with unby- passed exhaust flow and can be accomplished under high vehicle speed operation as well as under idle conditions. The passenger car system contains four filters which are approximately 20 inches long and 3.0 inches in diameter. EPA evaluation of this particulate regeneration system has included determination of cyclic and steady-state filter efficiency, regeneration efficiency, the affect on regeneration power requirements of various exhaust flow rates, and emissions and fuel economy characteristics of a test vehicle equipped system over standard Federal test proce- dures. 1991 SAE Transactions Section 2 912670.

In this study a detailed mathematical model for various design configurations of tractor-pole trailer combinations, incorporating a sliding drawbar, is developed. Furthermore, a kinematic and dynamic analysis for this vehicle combination is carried out and a computer simulation model is developed. Some results for kinematic performance and parameter variations of pole trailer- truck combinations are also presented. Additional results for dynamic and stability analysis are obtained through a transient and harmonic response analysis, and a parametric sensitivity study is carried out. 1991 SAE Transactions Section 2 912671. (SP-892) Electronically controlled air suspension (ECAS) for commercial vehicles. Karl H. Schönfeld, Hartmut Geiger, and Karl H. Hesse, WABCO Westinghouse Fahrzeug- bremsen. The leaf spring suspension - still widely applied in commer- cial vehicles - does not offer an optimum with regard to suspen- sion performance. Due to the possibility of the levelling adjust- ment, the careful cargo treatment and the better ride comfort, the air suspension is, therfore, more and more succeeding. To meet the requirements of higher performance of air suspen- sions in a cost favourable way and to take full benefit of the potential of air suspensions, an electronically controlled air sus- pension system (ECAS) for trucks and buses has been developed and introduced into the market. The functions of the entire system, its components as well as the advantages of the ECAS are described in comparison to the conventionally controlled air suspension systems. Moreover, the system is extended to a semi-active suspension control, i.e. the integration of the damping control into the air suspension control. The result is a further improvement of the ride properties. 912672. (SP-892) Semi-active heave and roll control for large off-road vehicles. Donald L. Margolis, University of California ; and Charles M. Nobles, Lord Corp. Semi-active suspension control deals principally with high bandwidth modulation of passively generated damper forces. When a properly designed semi-active damper is used in an oth- erwise conventional suspension there is much evidence that a superior overall system results. Large off-road vehicles, such as military transport vehicles, traveling at high speeds over rough terrain, possess suspension control requirements which are different from a road going vehi- cle. This paper develops these control requirements. 1991 SAE Transactions Section 2 912673. (SP-892) The optimum designing of riding comfort by application of "Taguchi methods". Tetsuya Sakai, Heavy Duty Vehicle Design Dept., Isuzu Motors Ltd.; and Yoshihiko Maruyama, Heavy Duty Vehicle Research and Experiment Dept., Isuzu Motors Ltd. About five years ago, the riding comfort was set after conduct- ing various types of tuning tests. These required considerable man powers and large scale improvement was impossible in wide frequency range. To get large scale improvement and reduce these man powers, an optimum design was needed in the initial stage of develop- ment. First, the simulation model of whole vehicle was made to ana- lyze the frequency response on cab floor and human body when an excited force was added to the front tire. Next, 25 parameters which effected the riding comfort were allocated to L36 (211 X 313) type orthogonal array and then 72 simulation analyses were conducted. Of the 25 parameters, 8 were finally selected to be the most effective, after comparing the results with many factorial effect charts. It was confirmed that the test results were well matched with the simulation and all acceleration levels at resonance points fell down over 50%. 912674. (SP-892) Inertial damping - A vehicle suspension design tool. Erik Wennerström, Royal Institute of Technology. 286</page><page sequence="286">912674-912680 In 1934 M. Olley suggested, in his paper "Independent Wheel Suspensions - Its Whys and Wherefores", that a rear axle stiff- ness slightly higer than proportional to rear axle load would give improved comfort. By the introduction of body fixed coordinates a velocity dependent damping factor occurs in the equations of motions. That factor has been named inertial damping. The linear study of the parameter space shows that a stiff front suspension will cause a separation of the damping of the body eigenfrequencies at increased vehicle velocity. On the other hand, and this was the conclusion of Olley, a soft front suspension will cause a separation of the frequencies at increased velocity. As the system dampings and the natural frequencies in most cases vary with the velocity of the vehicle the stability margin should be checked. The theoretical results indicate that good ride forwards can cause bad ride during reverse driving. The nonlinear study indicates that the linear study is conser- vative regarding the critical velocity. Introduction of the momentum of the vehicle in the dynamic analysis will deepen the understanding of vehicle dynamics and improve future suspensions. 912675. Development of a slow-acting active control pneumatic suspension system for heavy vehicle applications. /. M. Vogel, Dept. of Aerospace Engrg., Iowa State Univ.; and P. W. Claar, Dept. of Mech. Engrg., University of Wisconsin. A slow-acting active control pneumatic suspension system for heavy truck applications is described. The first part of the paper discusses the control law strategy for an active pneumatic damp- ing system concept. The second part describes the application of the concept to a pneumatic sleeper bunk suspension system for on-highway trucks. The pneumatic suspension improves the quality of the sleeping environment for over-the-road truck driv- ers. Also, this concept has further application to a chassis suspen- sion system to improve the truck's ride quality and handling characteristics. 912676. Analysis of torsional stiffness share rate of truck frame. Kazuo Ao, Junichi Niiyama, Toshiharu Matsui, and Kunio Hara, Mitsubishi Motors Corp.; and Masashi Nakamura, Mitsubishi Heavy Industries, Ltd. In order to design a well-balanced truck frame, optimization of not only the stiffness of the entire body and stress of each mem- ber, but also the internal force of each member is necessary, including the effect of a rear body mounted on the frame. This paper proposes a new parameter, "torsional stiffness share rate," that directly correlates the contribution of member torsional stiff- ness to frame torsional stiffness with the internal force of the members as to torsion of the truck frame. The merits of the tor- sional stiffness share rate are shown in comparison with the strain energy share rate and the stiffness contribution rate. The results of experimental and FEM analyses of the torsional stiffness share rate are also presented. 912677. Measurement of radial truck tire dry cornering char- acteristics. Pedro Yap, Goodyear Tire and Rubber Co. A study was conducted to quantify the cornering characteris- tics of radial truck tire rib and lug tread designs. A Calspan Tire Research Facility (TIRF) machine was used to measure tire force and moment responses to load inflation, slip angle, and camber. The study concluded that although tread design parameters are a factor, tire cornering characteristics are strongly dependent on load. The cornering performance of lug design tires was not nec- essarily different from rib tires; the key tread design parameter was non-skid depth. An empirical model was developed for cor- nering and self-aligning torque stiffness as a function of tread design parameters, load, and inflation. 912678. The handling characteristics of European intercity buses. John P. Whitehead, MIRA. From time to time, over many years, MIRA (the Motor Indus- try Research Association) has carried out surveys of the handling behaviours of various classes of road vehicles. The most recent investigation has concerned modern European intercity buses, or coaches as they are termed in Britain. The work was sponsored by the British government together with five vehicle manufacturers who each supplied one bus. The main aim of the work was to ascertain the handling characteris- tics of a sample of modern buses in terms of both absolute behaviour and relate behaviour compared to other classes of road vehicles. However, the manufacturers sponsoring the work were also very interested to discover any correlation between various features of layout of the vehicles and the handling characteristics. To quantify the vehicle behaviours, MIRA used the test and data analysis techniques it had developed with other classes of road vehicles, techniques which have been incorporated into ISO standard procedures. The paper presents the more important handling characteris- tics of the fully laded buses, together with some typical results for other classes of road vehicles. The findings of the work may be summarised as follows: 1) by using "state-of-the-art" bus design it has been possible to improve the handling characteristics of heavy vehicles; 2) in the context of heavy vehicle behaviour, the handling characteristics of the modern buses tested are good; and 3) it has been possible to correlate some features of bus design and layout to their handling responses. 912679. Field testing of a tank truck and study of fluid slosh. Subhash Rakheja, Dept. of Mech. Engrg., Concordia Univ.; S. Sankar, Concordia Univ.; R. Ranganathan, University of Mis- souri; and J. R. Billing and W. Mercer, Ontario Ministry of Trans- portation. Dynamic fluid slosh and its influence on the dynamic roll sta- bility of a partially filled tank truck has been investigated through a field test program undertaken jointly by the Concave Research Centre and Transportation Technology and Energy Branch of Ontario Ministry of Transportation. The paper describes the test methodology, instrumentation, data acquisition, fluid slosh behaviour, and its influence on the directional response of the tank truck. The data acquired during different directional maneu- vers is analyzed to highlight the fluid slosh and its impact on the dynamic load transfer and roll stability of the vehicle. The magni- tude of dynamic load transfer, derived from the video records of the dynamic fluid movement, is presented and discussed for vari- ous tank fill levels and directional maneuvers. The test results revealed that the magnitude of dynamic fluid slosh is strongly related to the vehicle speed, lateral and longitudinal acceleration, and the fill level. The field measured directional response data is compared to the results derived from the simulation software to demonstrate the validity of the analytical models. The fluid motion viewed during the test maneuvers revealed that the dynamic load transfer caused by fluid slosh can be estimated accurately using steady-state fluid dynamic analysis. 912680. Advanced interactive driveline control. Robin Sayce- Jones, Grau Ltd.; Simon D. L. Griffith, Lucas Automotive Ltd.; Keith Wright and Anthony Stasik, Eaton Ltd.; and Robert Cross, Lucas Automotive Ltd. This paper describes a research programme involving three companies working to integrate the driveline control on a 16 tonne two axle (4x2) vehicle using a high speed data link. The driveline is defined as incorporating three functions, engine man- agement, transmission control and anti-lock (ABS)/power induced wheel spin control, otherwise known as anti-slip regula- tion (ASR). Each function is controlled independently by appro- priate electronic control units (ECUs). 287</page><page sequence="287">912680-912687 In February 1989 a three company research project was launched to investigate and demonstrate the improvements in performance possible from the interaction of the three driveline functions referred to above. The first phase was to attain or better the performance cur- rently achievable with electro-mechanical links and also to indi- cate any performance benefits. This phase included investiga- tions into the physical layer and message structures required in the absence of any agreed formats at the time. Phase two of the project was to investigate the broader aspects of an intelligent interactive driveline and modify the message form in line with emerging standards. This paper describes the results from phase one of the project and some findings from phase two. 1991 SAE Transactions Section 2 912681.

The electronics jigsaw puzzle in the trucking industry. Salim A. Jaliwala, Cummins Electronic Co., Inc. High tech is permeating the trucking industry, which is now entering the electronics and information age. The trucks of today are becoming increasingly sophisticated with technical innova- tions occurring in many areas. Electronic engines, electronic service tools, onboard comput- ers real time communication utilities and computerized opera- tions represent a few key technical solutions that are finding increasing penetration in the market. These technical solutions complement and/or compete with one another as they strive to meet the needs of the trucking fleets. The extent to which they complement and/or compete with one another is not readily or widely understood. It will take skill and knowledge on the part of the customer and the supplier to know the difference. A quick glance at these solutions makes one simple fact clear: electronics is the technology that is common to all these solutions and is capable of weaving them together. Its ability to function as a common denominator has put electronics in a unique posi- tion. It has become the only technology that is forcing the truck- ing industry to change the way it does business. In this paper, the confusing aspect of how these electronic solutions interact is studied. The analysis is posed in the form of an electronics jigsaw puzzle which, when put together, matches solutions to needs. It outlines the techniques that the trucking industry can follow to find the 100-percent solution to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of trucking fleets. 1991 SAE Transactions Section 2 912683. Integrated diagnostics for the vehicle system. Janice M. Lukich and Wayne D. Brandt, Caterpillar, Inc. How will a mechanic troubleshoot the heavy duty vehicle of the future? Will he or she have to be both retriever and integrator of data collected from multiple black boxes on the vehicle? How many tools will it take? Is there a definition of a vehicle system "diagnostic environment" that needs to be developed in order to create a solution to this problem? This paper will attempt to create the system focus for vehicle diagnostics that is required if this industry is to successfully produce the integrated electronic vehicle of the future. Both the on-board and off-board require- ments of the diagnostic environment will be examined. 1991 SAE Transactions Section 2 912684. Electronic diesel engine controls for industrial appli- cations: a systems perspective. Richard C. Anderson, Cummins Electronics Co., Inc. This paper presents an overview of the design process used in the development of an electronic diesel engine control system for industrial, or off-highway applications. The product develop- ment process is presented from a systems engineering perspective with emphasis on the key systems engineering methods utilized. One of the major differences between onhighway and off-highway markets is the diversity of applications the off-highway market represents. The industrial controller strives to meet the needs of those diverse applications by employing a large degree of flexibil- ity not only in the way the individual features can be utilized but also in the way the whole system can be applied. Successful incor- poration of that flexibility can be attributed to establishing a clear understanding of both the common and unique aspects of the off- highway market and considering those aspects from a total sys- tem perspective throughout the development process. 1991 SAE Transactions Section 2 912685. The truck as a system: where are we, and where are we going. James V. Shannon, Independent Consultant. This paper postulates that the heavy truck industry is in a period of major technological change. It describes a five-step pro- gression for such changes, and suggests that the industry has reached the third stage characterized by a multiplicity of new approaches. This paper also suggests that there is effective demand for a "better product", and that the technology to support that product is capable and available. It holds that to obtain a commitment to apply that technology a compelling reason must be shown, and that a comprehensive, imaginative truck life cycle cost demon- stration might provide that reason. 1991 SAE Transactions Section 2 912686. (SP-892) Directional dynamics of a tractor-semitrailer with self-and forced-steering axles. Seshardri Sankar, Subhash Rakheja, and Alain Piché, Dept. of Mech. Engrg., Concordia Univ. The influence of self-and forced -steering axles on the direc- tional dynamics of a tractor-semitrailer is investigated through computer simulations. The dynamic characteristics of a self- steering axle are analytically modeled and integrated to a three- dimensional nonlinear directional dynamic model of the vehicle. Two forced-steering algorithms relating the vehicle speed and response quantities to the angle of the wheels of the steerable axle are formulated, and integrated to the nonlinear directional dynamic model of the vehicle. Computer simulations are per- formed to determine the directional response characteristics of a tractor-semitrailer with self-and forced-steering axles for low as well as high speed maneuvers. The directional response charac- teristics of the vehicles with self-and forced-steering axles are dis- cussed in view of the self-steering parameters and forced -steering gains, and compared to those of the vehicle with conventional axles. 1 991 SAE Transactions Section 2 912687.

(SP-892) Tractive torque steer for on-center stability/ handling augmentation with controlling differential gear for large-sized vehicles - A comparision with passive rear-axle steer. Fujio Momiyama, Kiyoto Hoshikawa, Junichi Kat ou, and Takashi Hosoda, Hino Motors, Ltd. The running direction of a vehicle can be controlled by not only wheel steer but also torque steer. This paper introduces the tractive torque steer effect produced by a newly developed elec- tropneumatic control system, the limited-slip differential for large-sized vehicles. This system enhances the vehicle's running stability and controllability by controlling the tractive force of the drive axle. The tractive force maintains a stable running course against disturbances such as road roughness and wind gusts, thereby enhancing the steering response and providing a better feeling of handling to the driver. The system also improves mobility, especially on low-0 roads. It is expected that a single axle equipped with this system will exhibit good performance comparable to that of tandem axle. 1991 SAE Transactions Section 2 912690. (SP-892) Steer-restoring torque controlled driving simulator for developing steering road feel. Takao Miyamoto and Fujio Momiyama, Hino Motors, Ltd.; and Takehiko Fujioka, University of Tokyo. A driving simulator system for developing steering road feel has been developed. A new steering gear box or an electronic steering system is installed on the simulator and its road feel and control algorithm are developed according to the characteristics of any vehicle which has been programed into the engineering work-station. The vehicle model programed into the engineering work station runs according to the driver's operations, which are fed through the new steering system to be tested. The steer- restoring torque of the vehicle programed into the engineering work-station is produced by an actuator, and gives the impres- sion through the new system of having been fed back from an actual road. 1991 SAE Transactions Section 2 912692. (SP-892) Contribution to the force transmission behavior of commercial vehicle tires. E. Göhring, Egon-Christian von Glasner, and H. C. Pflug, Mercedes-Benz. Tires of modem commercial vehicles must meet a specific requirement profile, containing the economic aspects, ride com- fort and driving safety, as well. These three primary critieria are discussed in this paper, whereby emphasis is placed on the force transmission behavior of commercial vehicle tires regarded as a variable directly associated to driving safety. At the same time, the influence of distinct parameters such as wheel load, road speed, tire inflation pressure, tread depth and coefficient of adhe- sion between tire and road on the lateral and braking force behav- ior is illustrated using steady state and dynamic measurements. They were carried out on real roads using a specially prepared mobile tire dynamometer, but on an indoor drum-type tire test stand, as well. In addition to the above mentioned parameter variations the differences of the results on account of the test method are analysed. 1991 SAE Transactions Section 2 912693. (SP-892) Optimum ackerman for improved steering axle tire wear on trucks. Gerald Miller, Robert Reed, and Fred Wheeler, Michelin Americas Research and Development Corp. It is generally accepted that steering axle tire wear rates are considerably higher in turns than in a straight ahead condition. Ackerman correction accounts for the different turning radii of the left and right steering axle tires in a turn but does not take into account slip angle. Slip angle is a significant factor in tire wear. "Optimum Ackerman" does take slip angle into account and should theoretically reduce tire wear. Theory, simulations, and field results are presented. 1991 SAE Transactions Section 2 912696. Allison world transmission developments. John R. Buttermore and Ted M.

The first of three models in the family has been intro- duced into production in September, 1991. Extensive efforts in assuring the reliability of the product and in meeting customer needs have resulted in several product modifications over the ini- tially concepted product. Exhaustive efforts in integrating the design and the factory are resulting in major returns on produci- bility and quality from the production floor reflecting the total ground up approach to design and manufacturing the new world transmission family of heavy duty automoatic transmissions. 1991 SAE Transactions Section 2 912697. (SP-893) Shiftability and shift quality issues in clutch - Transmission systems. Andrew Szadkowski, Spicer Clutch Div., Dana Corp. With synchronized transmissions, the problem of shift effort and corresponding shift time are complex ones. They deal with the proper function of both the clutch and transmission within the total drivetrain system, and relate to the dynamic behavior of this system. The present paper represents an engineering effort of rigor- ously defining clutch and transmission compatibility with respect to shift quality. A technically realistic, analytical description of shiftability for synchronized transmissions and corresponding design limitations for the clutch-transmission system are the spe- cific objectives of this paper. Design recommendations based on the modeling introduced in this paper point out a significant clutch contribution to shifting problems and the importance of the system approach itself. The mathematical model describing shift and synchronizing processes is analyzed to determine shift quality, clutch quality and transmission quality with respect to shifting. These three quality definitions are introduced to study the system perfor- mance and determine engineering compatibility criteria for sys- tem components. The clutch-transmission selection formula is derived and shiftability for both upshifts and downshifts is stud- ied. Some numerical examples are covered to demonstrate how the proposed approach works in specific applications. 1991 SAE Transactions Section 2 912698. A hydromechanical transmission optimized for auto- motive application. Lawrence R. Folsom, Advanced Power Tech- nology, Inc. The application of hydromechanical continuously variable transmission technology to a wide variety of automotive applica- tions is made feasible by a unique design approach. Analysis indi- cates that the basic design scales readily to accommodate power inputs of under 7.5 KW to over 750 KW. The first prototype has been targeted to compete in the mid-range truck and bus market segments with transmission input torques in the order of 850 N.m to 1300 N.m and a maximum torque multiplication of approximately 10:1. The problems of high cost, poor efficiency and excessive noise which prevented prior hydromechanical units from gaining acceptance for automotive applications have been eliminated or reduced to acceptable levels in the new design. 912699. (SP-893) Analysis of torsional vibration for a multi- branch drive-train in a chassis dynamometer. Wenguang G. Wang, R. Bata, and Donald W. Lyons, Dept. of Mech. and Aero- space Engrg., West Virginia Univ. Due to the rapid development in advanced complex machinery, the analysis of torsional vibrations for multi- junction, multi-branch systems is becoming a subject of increas- ing interest. Torsional vibration may occur within an operation range in a rotating system and cause a serious failure in the 289</page><page sequence="289">912699-912707 machine. This is the case when an excitating frequency gets close to the natural frequency of the system. In this paper, an efficient and accurate method has been devel- oped to calculate torsional natural frequencies of complex rotat- ing systems. The method is used in designing a drive-train of a chassis dynamometer simulating a multi-junction, multi-branch rotating system. Natural frequencies and mode shapes of the drive-train have been determined and used for further develop- ment in the components of the system. 1991 SAE Transactions Section 2 912700. (SP-893) Computer simulation of driveline vibration due to universal joints in heavy and medium duty trucks. Craig A. Birkett and Thomas C . Tecco, Automated Analysis Corp.; and Daniel A. Grohnke, Navistar International Transportation Corp. TORVIB is a general purpose program which provides a quick, complete torsional analysis of the many unique drive lines specified by truck customers. This program has been recently modified to include universal joint effects. In the updated pro- gram, finite element methods are used to calculate maximum vibration angles, maximum vibration torques, and secondary couples caused by dynamic engine torques and universal joints. The techniques of modeling universal joint effects which are described in this paper can also be used to analyze drivelines with commercial finite element software. Universal joint effects were added by first updating the mass and stiffness matrices to include degrees of freedom at each yoke on a universal joint. Rotational constraint equations were then written for each universal joint and applied using the large stiff- ness method. Finally, post-processing calculations were added to recover the secondary couples at each yoke. This method of modeling universal joints was compared with results obtained from general purpose dynamic simulation soft- ware. The results showed good agreement. 1991 SAE Transactions Section 2 912701. (SP-893) The research on quasi-three-dimensional flow design of hydrodynamic torque converter blades.

In addition, a new way that three-dimensional flow field calculation is added into traditional blade design is given and the judge rule of flow field is presented. The blade system of a Chinese made YB 300 torque converter has been redesigned with the aid of the new way, and its performance has been improved. The experiment shows that the maximum efficiency has been raised from original 84.7% to 86%, with other factors such as stall torque ratio and so on unchanged or a little better. 912702. (SP-893) Standardized manual transmission control/ shift patterns for trucks. Stephen C. Cochran, Dana Corp. A typical manual truck transmission can vary in complexity from the 3 speeds of a light pick-up to the 20 speeds of a class 8 tractor/trailer combination. A lack of shift pattern standards, increased transmission complexity, and design/manufacturing cost constraints has resulted in many shift pattern designs. This paper will detail most of the existing patterns, the variable com- ponents effecting the patterns and explore new pattern configura- tions and driver ergonomics which could become the standard for all future transmission and control designs. 912703.

Maintenance requirements for these systems have changed as they incorporate transistors in place of relays adding a new demand on the infra- structure in place to maintain these vehicles. Vehicle and product documentation includes circuit logic diagrams which succinctly describe electronic devices. These devices use solid state compo- nents sized for the design loads. Troubleshooting these systems requires new skills and equipment and fleet management must determine the level of skills necessary to maintain their electronic systems and provide adequate training for their personnel. This paper will describe the two basic types of solid state con- trollers, discrete logic and microprocessor, and options available to facilitate maintenance. It will discuss the fleet operator's role in improving maintainability by providing contract language that will require new diagnostic provisions. Finally, a sample evalua- tion test covering basic electronic knowledge and electrical theory which may help to identify areas where maintenance personnel need additional training. 912705. Large-area variable reflectance mirrors for trucks and buses. Dorothy J. Helder, Donnelly Corp. Glare from the headlights of following vehicles which is reflected in rearview mirrors can be a significant problem. Glare can cause driver discomfort, it can diminish the driver's ability to see, and it can cause driver fatigue, particularly during pro- longed night-time driving common for many professional driv- ers. Conventional rearview mirrors, such as silvered and chromed mirrors, offer only one reflectivity level. Variable reflec- tance mirrors, such as those utilizing electrochromic and liquid crystal technology, are capable of multiple reflectance levels. With variable reflectance, the driver can select a high reflectivity level during daytime driving or when reversing into loading docks, and can select a reduced dimmer reflectance level when driving during glaring conditions. This paper briefly reviews the principal technologies available for variable reflectance mirrors and outlines their performance as glare-reducing mirrors. 1 991 SAE Transactions Section 2 912706. The application of IVHS technology to hazardous material transportation. John C. Allen, Battelle Memorial Insti- tute. New communication and information processing technology is significantly changing the world of logistics and transportation. A new program established by the U.S. Department of Transpor- tation, known as the intelligent vehicle-highway system (IVHS) program, seeks to apply this technology to transportation in an organized fashion. The goal is to improve the efficiency and safety of the highway system. Many of the new technologies have the potential to allow the automation of the hazard communica- tion process during hazardous material transportation. This paper identifies and discusses some of the potential applications of IVHS technology to the hazardous material transportation environment. 912707. The truck driver in IVHS system development. F. Renae Bowers-Carnahan, PACCAR Technical Center. Currently, the truck industry does not systematically address driver issues in intelligent vehicle-highway system development. Because this industry is at the forefront of IVHS system and device development, it is imperative that the human factors issues are included in the research, development, design and eval- uation of IVHS systems. This will minimize the risk of inade- quate, unusable and unsafe devices that become a part of every truck drivers day. As IVHS technology is developed and more of these devices become available a new issue must be addressed: will the combi- nation of these new devices overwhelm the driver and result in a reduction of safety? Could the combination of certain systems counteract each other, resulting in an unused or unusable system? 290</page><page sequence="290">912707-912717 History indicates these problems, and many others are defi- nite possibilities. This paper will discuss some of the issues that have been identified and solved in other systems with the hope that the principles can be applied in this industry. 912709. (SP-891) U.S. vehicle noise regulations and the effects of vehicle condition. Thomas E. Reinhart , Cummins Engine Co. This paper reviews the history of heavy truck noise legislation in the U.S. Both legislative activity and the response of vehicle and engine manufacturers are described. The cost cycle experi- enced by manufacturers is also described. Over a period of time, the costs involved in meeting noise regulations are reduced with- out increasing truck noise levels. Data is presented which shows that public complaints about truck noise are often related to mod- ified vehicle exhaust systems. The data shows that modified exhaust systems have an especially severe effect on compression brake noise. Additional results suggest that some trucks with extensively modified exhaust systems may be able to pass the in- use noise standard. 1991 SAE Transactions Section 2 912710. (SP-891) Measurement of structural attenuation of a diesel engine and its applications for reduction of noise and vibra- tion. Kazuhiro Nakashima , Yuji Yajima, and Manabu Yama- moto, Mitsubishi Motors Corp. Structural attenuation of a running diesel engine measured by a new technique showed a constant value regardless of engine speeds. It was verified by this result that structural attenuation is a physical quantity unique to the structure of each engine and, therefore, a good indicator for evaluation of low noise engine structure. In addition, a hydraulic excitation test rig was devised to measure structural attenuation directly and to make effective use of it for noise reduction. Based on the accurate measurements by the excitation test rig, modal analysis and system simulation were conducted for implementation of countermeasures against noise. 1991 SAE Transactions Section 2 912711. A practical economic solution to weight reduction and increased performance in diesel engines. T. N. Louckes, Sinter- Cast, Inc. Compacted Graphite Iron (CGI) has been recognized for years as a unique material possessing a fortunate combination of prop- erties intermediate between gray iron and ductile iron. This mate- rial, for reasons outlined in this paper, is ideal for cylinder blocks, heads and other cast iron components for diesel engines. It makes possible casting weight savings of up to 1/3 and/or increased power output. This paper will outline reasons why this is now possible, whereas it has seldom been applied in volume produc- tion heretofore. Physical and mechanical properties of CGI, which provide the opportunity for weight reduction and increased power, are discussed. 912714. Non-linear FEM analysis of the trunnion suspension system. Naoshi Satoh, Design Dept., Suspension Spring Div., NHK Spring Co., Ltd.; Tetsuya Sakai, Heavy Duty Vehicle Design Dept., Isuzu Motors Ltd.; and Mamoru Aida, Heavy Duty Vehicle Drive Train Design Dept., Isuzu Motors Ltd. Basically, it is recommended that nonlinear analysis should be used with consideration for friction and etc., when engineers cal- culate to design the trunnion suspension system for heavy duty trucks. But nonlinear analysis was very difficult, so linear analy- sis per piece parts was conducted under assumed conditions. According to this method, it is difficult to obtain the calculated values matching with experimental values, thus "trial and error" must be repeated consuming much man hours. Recently, accuracy of nonlinear analysis has been improved by the progress of the super computer in conjunction with the development of soft-wear such as pre-post or solver. Now, nonlinear analysis of the total suspension system was conducted by taking contact and friction between each part into consideration, while at the same time divergence of the solution was prevented by optimum modeling. As a result, analysis values were well matched with experimental values successfully reduc- ing weight and stress. This analysis method made it possible to reduce development man hours as much as 70% when compared with the conventional method. 912715. Analysis on the hysteresis loop of the leaf spring. Ikuo Numazaki, Isuzu Advanced Engineering Center ; Eiji Yamamoto, NHK Spring; and Toshio Hamano, NHK Spring Research and Development Center Inc. This paper describes the results of experiments carried out for modifying the characteristics of leaf springs with a view to improving ride comfort in leaf spring suspension vehicles. In this study, the factors contributing to the hysteresis loop of leaf springs, especially to the inclination in the transition zone of the hysteresis loop, were analyzed experimentally. The results of analysis were used in designing leaf springs with smaller inclina- tion in the transition zone, and then the tests were carried out with these leaf springs. It is known that the dynamic spring characteristics of leaf springs is mainly related to the gradient of the diagonal of load- deflection hysteresis loop, that is diagonal spring rate. The diago- nal spring rate is inversely proportional to the amplitude, of the deflection approximately and consequently, at very small ampli- tude, it reaches to the maximum inclination in this transition zone. Thereupon, the authors decided to study and analyze the behavior of the transition zone of the hysteresis loop, as the repre- sentation of dynamic spring characteristic under the very small deflection amplitude, and to find out the contributing factors on the dynamic spring rate. These findings can be summed up as follows: 1) at the transi- tion zone of the hysteresis loop, the state of local elastic deforma- tion is developed in the leaf end under the action of inter-leaf fric- tional force; and 2) it is possible to set the dynamic spring charac- teristics, at a very small deflection, desirable value appropriately designing the local stiffness of the leaf end on the basis of eye diameter, leaf thickness and leaf length. 912716. Objectives of the New Zealand heavy vehicle brake code. G. David Malcolm, GDM Consultants. The brake performance envelope between heavy vehicles in combination on New Zealand roads is very large and the reasons are many. Recent legislative changes to allow 44 tonne gross combina- tion mass were accompained by a demand from the authorities for more uniform brake performance from vehicles in combina- tion. The 1991 NZHVBC is based on unprecedented control of brake threshold as one of two main constitutents to improve compatibility. 912717. A new radically different oil to water heat exchanger. Per Gillbrand and Richard Öhman, Laminova AB. Presenting a brand new approach to heat exchangers for engines, transmissions, hydraulic systems, etc. This new heat exchanger is made of only two pieces of circular extruded aluminum profiles: core and shell. No soldering: the core and the shell is assembled by a minimum of automated work. In an oil to water cooling application, the active surface on the oil side of the core is enlarged by fins 0.2 mm thick, 0.3 mm spac- ing, and 3 mm high. The fins are made in unique production machines and enlarge the active surface area approximately five times compared to a conventional heat exchanger of the same dimensions. 291</page><page sequence="291">912717-912736 The principle utilizes the low pressure drop at laminar flow and avoids the disadvantage of low heat transfer after a certain laminar flow length. The result is approximately three times higher oil heat dissipation, combined with very low oil pressure drop, compared to conventional technique. The inner surface of the core, the water side, is extremely toler- ant to dirty water and gives negligible pressure drop. This new heat exchanger is made of only one metal, alumi- num. The characteristics of corrosion are therefore easy to define. 912730. (P-253) An information structural model of vehicle navigation and its implications. Shuntiti Zhai, University of Toronto. This paper proposes a simple model to provide a framework for investigating human behaviour with vehicle navigation aids (VNA). The model consist of planning, decision making, control, and perception. Decisions are made by comparing perceived cues from the outside view with expected cues from planning. VNA assists mainly in dynamic planning, providing support and updating to the cognitive map navigators have of their environ- ment. Unlike other models of vehicle navigation systems that emphasize the driver-machine interaction in navigation, the pro- posed model presents navigation decisions as a dynamic process of comparing and integrating the very important outside view with information from VNA displays. The implications of the model for using multiple modal dis- plays, for timing and pacing of information, and for visual atten- tion competition are discussed. 912731. (P-253) A human factors simulation investigation of driver route diversion and alternate route selection using in- vehicle navigation systems. R. Wade Allen , Anthony C. Stein, Theodore J. Rosenthal, and David Ziedman, Systems Technol- ogy, Inc.; and Jaime F. Torres, and Abolhassan Halati, JFT Asso- ciates. This paper describes a human factors simulation study of the decision making behavior of drivers attempting to avoid nonre- curring congestion by diverting to alternate routes with the aid of in-vehicle navigation systems. This study is the first phase of a two part project in which the second phase will apply the driver behavior data to a simulation model analysis of traffic flow. The object of the driver behavior experiment was to compare the effect of various experimental navigation systems on driver route diversion and alternate route selection. The experimental naviga- tion system configurations included three map based systems with varying amounts of situation information and a non map based route guidance system. The overall study results indicated that navigation system characteristics can have a significant effect on driver diversion behavior, with better systems allowing more anticipation of traf- fic congestion. Subject route familiarity, commercial driving experience and gender did not significantly affect the results. Alternate route analysis tended to confirm the main route diver- sion results, and also showed that a majority of drivers were will- ing to accept alternate routes suggested by advanced navigation systems. These results were consistent over three significantly dif- ferent congestion conditions. Driver age was also a factor, with old drivers being more reluctant to divert from the main freeway route. The paper describes the simulation approach and summa- rize results on diversion decision behavior and alternate route selection. 912732. (P-253) Traffic control with variable message signs. Mark G. M. Brocken, Transportation and Traffic Research Div., Ministry of Transport and Public Wo; and M artie J. M. van der Vlist, Institute of Spatial Organization, Netherlands Organization for Applied Seien. One way to provide dynamic route information to travellers is by means of variable message signs (VMS). Owing to the avail- ability of reasonable alternative routes for several important traf- fic relations, the ring road around Amsterdam, which was com- pleted in September, 1990, offers an almost ideal situation for the use of VMS. The first VMS will be installed on this ring road by the end of 1991. In this paper results of research into the design and the effects of a VMS will be presented. The paper starts with the description of the general framework of a VMS-system. Several projects related to aspects of this framework are discussed in more detail: a simulator study into the effects of VMS on route choice and driving behavior; a stated preference investigation into route choice behavior; and simula- tion of traffic flows under provision of dynamic route informa- tion to travellers by means of VMS. 912733. (P-253) Driver compliance with route guidance advice: the evidence and its implications. Peter W. Bonsall and M. Joint, Institute for Transport Studies, University of Leeds. This paper will present results from two sources; question- naires conducted among drivers equipped with route guidance as part of the Berlin LISB trial and analysis of decisions made by users of the interactive route guidance simulator known as IGOR. The results from Berlin shown a high level of commitment by participants in the trial but nevertheless show a general reduction in usage of the equipment over time. Adherence to advice is not high on regular journeys and reflects a low opinion of the quality of routes recommended by the system for such journeys. For finding new destinations or travelling in unfamiliar areas, opin- ions and usage are much higher. Overall driver behaviour has not been much influenced by LISB. Our surveys provide useful infor- mation on drivers' reasons for ignoring advice and their sugges- tions for system enhancement. The IGOR results provide strong quantitative evidence that acceptance of an item of advice is closely correlated with objec- tive measures of its quality. It is also a function of the drivers' familiarity with the network, high previous experience of the reli- ability of advice and the degree of corroboration of advice route relative to the destination, the absence of congestion and the behaviour of other drivers. 912734. (P-253) The effects of different in-vehicle route infor- mation displays on driver behaviour. Andrew M. Parkes, Martin C. Ashby, and Steve H. Fairclough, HUSAT Research Institute. The paper reports two experiments conducted within the driver behaviour and traffic safety research strand of the Euro- pean DRIVE programme. Each experiment was conducted using members of the general public, driving specially adapted road vehicles, in real urban environments. The first experiment, con- ducted in Loughborough can be seen as a validation of a multi- level evaluation methodolody developed within the project as applied to two modes of route information presentation: paper map or text display on LCD screen. The second experiment used similar data collection techniques, but was conducted in Berlin with two real route information systems (LISB and Bosch Travel- pilot). Assessing the results of these two experiments shows that there is a greater degree of visual workload associated with draw- ing information off a map display. This is the result of analysing a combination of measures, including vehicle control data, physi- ological stress indices, visual attention data and a variety of sub- jective response measures. This form of information presentation may be less than compatible with the task of navigating a vehicle whilst interacting with the road infrastructures of today. 912736. (P-253) Data fusion in Pathfinder and Travtek. Roy Sumner, Farradyne Systems, Inc. 292</page><page sequence="292">912736-912741 Control centers for IVHS systems are the focal point for col- lecting data from a wide variety of sources. These data can be in electronic form, such as the output from traffic detectors and computer systems or in anecdotal form such as police and radio reports or maintenance activities. There are two basic problems with handling this data; the data ages at differential rates and the quality of information varies according to the source. A video image of an accident scene is much more reliable than the output of an incident detection algo- rithm. Within IVHS control systems such data needs to be accumu- lated, organized and disseminated. In such systems, decisions need to be made for several thousand links every minute, 24 hours per day. This process has been termed data fusion. This paper describes the data fusion process and the manner in which it is applied in the Pathfinder and TravTek projects. 912737. (P-253) Collection and dissemination of real-time travel time and incident information with in-vehicle communica- tion technologies. Kevin N. Balke and William R . McCasland, Texas Transportation Institute ; Steven Z. Levine , Texas Dept. of Transportation; and Conrad L. Dudek, Civil Engrg. Dept., Texas A&amp;M Univ. A unique public/private venture is underway in Houston, Texas, to improve the accuracy and timeliness of real-time traffic information available to motorists, commercial vehicle opera- tors, and transit agencies. A system is currently under develop- ment which utilizes the concepts and technologies of intelligent vehicle/highway systems (IVHS) to collect travel time and inci- dent data directly from commuters traveling in the 1-45 (north) freeway/US-59 (Eastex) freeway corridor. A fully automated sys- tem for collecting information is planned, but until the hardware can be selected and installed, a manual system using cellular tele- phones will be used. Traffic and incident information will be made available to motorists, commercial fleet operators, and transit agencies through a variety of communication mediums, including changeable message signs located at key diversion points in the corridor and direct line connections to dispatching centers of transit and commercial fleet operations. This paper describes the design of the system to obtain travel time and inci- dent data in real-time directly from commuters traveling in the corridor. 912738. (P-253) New techniques for data collection and inte- gration for RTI/IVHS. Richard Harris, Bob McQueen, and Ian Catling, Ian Catling Consultancy, Ltd.; and John Linsley, Don- caster Metropolitan Borough Council. Video surveys are being used in Doncaster to provide an up- to-date inventory of the highway network and street furniture. The techniques being used are closely related to those under development for the collection of network attribute data for advanced transport telematics (ATT)/intelligent vehicle highway systems (IVHS) systems, on particular for route guidance and navigation systems. The success of systems such as autoguide, Euro-Scout (for- merly called Li-Scout), CARIN, Travelpilot and dual-mode route guidance will be critically dependent upon the quality of the data on which navigation and computing recommendations are based. Experience, in London and Berlin in particular, has shown that the information presented to the driver throughout his journey needs to be accurate, precisely timed and in a large number of cases specifically tailored to the details of individual junction lay- outs. It is not possible to provide the quality of data necessary for system acceptance without detailed surveys of the roads on which guidance is to be given. Video survey techniques offer the flexibility to view road and junction layouts in a controlled office environment, minimising the need for mostly re-surveying, and significantly improving data quality and consistency. The system in use in Doncaster is providing the basis of an innovative methodology in which in- vehicle computers are interfaced with navigation systems and professional video techniques. This results in the integration of the digital map base with the information required to generate the vitally important turning recommendations for the driver and the accurate data necessary for successfully map-matching. The paper presents results and conclusions from Doncaster. It reviews the need for this type of accurate data, describes experi- ences in existing trials of ATT/IVHS systems, analyses develop- ments in digital map creation techniques and presents the context in which the new generation of data collection methodology will be integrated. 912739. (P-253) Integrating geographic information system (GIS) and automatic vehicle location (AVL) technologies for improving the emergency response capabilities of electric utilities. Kostas G. Zografos, Dept. of Civil and Arch. Engrg., University of Miami ; and Christos Douligeris, Dept. of Electrical and Computer Engrg., University of Miami. An integrated system combining automatic vehicle location (AVL) technology, geographic information systems (GIS), and analytical models is proposed for the improvement of the emer- gency response operations in the electric utility industry. The analytical models require real time accurate information related to the spatial distribution of the field units which is provided by the AVL system and information related to the underlying trans- portation network managed by the GIS. 912740. (P-253) AVI research for commercial vehicle opera- tions. Peter Davies, Chris Hill, and Jeremy Siviter, Castle Rock Consultants. This paper focuses on current research efforts in the field of automatic vehicle identification (AVI) within the heavy vehicle electronic license plate (HELP) program. HELP is developing a commercial vehicle monitoring and management system inte- grating AVI with weigh-in-motion, automatic vehicle classifica- tion and a computerized communications network. A primary emphasis to date in the HELP program has been technology research and development, with AVI being central to this effort. Initial research, undertaken by CRC, has led to the development of a radio frequency based, open specification for an AVI system representing the technological state-of-the-art. However, in parallel with the HELP AVI research, the Ameri- can Trucking Association (ATA) has recently adopted its own radio frequency identification (RFID) equipment standard. A new research effort is therefore being performed by CRC to develop compatible AVI standards meeting the requirements of both the ATA and HELP. A second additional area of research, currently being undertaken by CRC, is the development of a beacon-based AVI system, based on the existing HELP AVI specification. This AVI beacon will be placed on a state line and will broadcast a location, date and time marker message to a truck's onboard computer (OBC). This is just one in a broad range of possible IVHS applica- tions capable of utilizing such a roadside-to-vehicle communica- tions channel. This paper describes the earlier HELP AVI research efforts as a background to the current AVI initiatives. Each of these initia- tives is also discussed including project methodologies, results so far and expected results. 912741. (P-253) A methodological framework for evaluating on board computer technology in emergency dispatch operations. Kostas G. Zografos, Dept. of Civil and Arch. Engrg., University of Miami; Christos Douligeris, Dept. of Electrical and Computer Engrg., University of Miami; and John Haupt and Jim Jordan, Florida Power and Light. 293</page><page sequence="293">912741-912748 A methodological framework for evaluating on board com- puter technology in emergency dispatch operations is presented. The proposed framework evaluates the effectiveness of mobile data terminals (MDT) with regards to operational, human fac- tors, economic, and technical implications. A case study related to the introduction of MDTs in the service restoration operations of a large electric utility company is preserved. Preliminary results suggest that the proposed technology is technically feasible and operationally effective. 912743. (P-253) Highway environment information system interests and features survey. Joe Tsai, Ministry of Transporta- tion of Ontario. Following completion of the wide area vehicle monitoring (WAVM) project which resulted in the successful introduction of a Canadian satellite-based vehicle message communications and location system, known as road KIT commercially, for use by the trucking industry, a project was undertaken to investigate and plan for a highway environment information system for fleet management applications in Ontario. When real time highway information could be made available to the commercial fleets, fleet operators equipped with two-way communications and vehicle location system could then respond to adverse highway conditions by rescheduling the trip, or advis- ing drivers to take alternate routes to avoid being caught in a con- gestion queue. The benefits would be increased transportation industry productivity and reduced congestion and incidents on the highway. This paper will describe the project background, the trucking industry and inter-city bus industry interests in highway informa- tion service, the trucking industry needs for highway information service, the type, frequency, and coverage of highway informa- tion required, results of an industry focus group discussion, the marketability of the highway information to the trucking indus- try, and the study conclusion. 912744. (P-253) Taxi emergency and location system for met- ropolitan Toronto. Lamberto Gomes and Gabriel Heti, Ministry of Transportation of Ontario. Recent advances in computer and communications technolo- gies have fostered significant developments in mobile informa- tion systems, not only to locate vehicles in distress situations but also to permit central monitoring of their positions for manage- ment purposes. This paper will focus on investigations carried out by the Min- istry of Transportation of Ontario on emergency location systems with the prime objective to identify a functional and cost- effective solution for metropolitan Toronoto's taxi operations and other municipal fleets and to investigate as well, opportuni- ties to enhance vehicle dispatching and real-time traffic data col- lection, using the location system's communications infrastruc- ture. The approach taken was to investigate existing and upcoming commercial systems, evaluate them and recommend the appro- priate course of action. The outcome of the study is a list of sys- tems recommended for further investigations and small-scale demonstrations. 912745. (P-253) Concept of cooperative transport management for the greater Munich area. Hartmut Keller , Hans-Georg Schlichter , and Wilhelm Wolters , Technische Universität München, BMW AG. Transport problems in metropolitan areas, like the Greater Munich Area, can no more be solved via a demand oriented extension of the road network. The general objectives can best be met by an integrated approach of all modes of transport based on the cooperation of the partners involved. The paper reports on the generic design of a cooperative trans- port management based the application of advanced transport control systems and a more detailed approach proposed for the northern sector the Greater Munich Area. A demonstration field is planned for testing integrated transport control systems in a real metropolitan environment and of system introduction of advanced communication and control technologies at sites which require immediate relief of existing transport problems. 912746. (P-253) CARMINAT an integrated information and guidance system. Philippe Challe, RENAULT. CARMINAT is a European research program conducted under partnership and aimed at integrating a comprehensive information system into motor vehicles. The information may concern the vehicle itself or the traffic situation and other ser- vices. It is linked to a navigation and guidance system. Traffic information and services are broadcast by RDS. The route planner takes RDS messages into account to alter the route when necessary. Compatibility with the task of driving is ensured by ergonomie studies and testing. The research phase of Carminai will be followed by large scale pilot programs involving a fleet of vehicles on motorways and in large urban areas. 912747. (P-253) SOCRATES: System of cellular radio for traffic efficiency and safety. Ian Catling, Ian Catling Consul- tancy, Ltd.; and Frans Op de Beek, Philips. SOCRATES is the largest project in the European Communi- ties' research programme DRIVE. The objective is to investigate the use and feasibility of a road transport informatics (RTI) sys- tem based on cellular radio, and to make recommendations which could lead to the use of a pan-European cellular radio sys- tem such as GSM as the basis of the DRIVE "integrated road transport environment" (IRTE). The overall concept is based on the collection, storage and pro- cessing of road traffic information within traffic control centres, and on the two-way information flow between vehicles and road- side infrastructure: firstly to send information to drivers and their in-car units, secondly to cellect real-time traffic data and other messages from the vehicles. The paper presents an overview of the SOCRATES concept and its results and conclusions to data, including the implementa- tion of the major test site in Gothenburg. It concludes by describ- ing plans for pilot projets in several European countries as the next step toward the commercial implementation of SOCRATES in Europe during the 1990s. 912748. (P-253) Results of a field trial of the impacts image processing system for traffic monitoring. David Kelly, Wootton Jeffreys Consultants Ltd. IMPACTS is a system for automatically monitoring traffic conditions over a wide area using computer image processing techniques. The system was invented by Dr. Neil Hoose at Uni- versity College London (UCL) and is being commercially devel- oped by Wootton Jeffreys Consultants in the UK. This paper presents the results of a field trial was carried out on the M25 London orbital motorway in the UK using a live camera. The IMPACTS system is outlined briefly and the trial aims and methods are described. Results of the trial are presented showing the detection performance of the system under a range of lighting, weather and traffic conditions. The performance of the system is considered in practical terms in the context of its potential use for automatically switching warning signs. Finally a new measure of traffic conditions is presented and example data sets obtained during the trial are described. 294</page><page sequence="294">912749-912755 912749. (P-253) If information technology could save lives, improve productivity, help clean up the environment, and lower the budget deficit, would we use it should we use ii.Jim R. Woods, Federal Express Corp., Christian Brothers Univ. Research and development has presented society and business with tremendous potential. Intelligent vehicle highway systems are rich with opportunity. The vision of opportunity is currently out of focus to business and the average citizen. The intelligent vehicle highway enthusiast is faced with significant barriers to understanding. The technology enthusiast is likewise in jeopardy of being charged with a myopic focus by those less familiar with the technology. This paper is intended to present the position that an awareness of the multiple perspectives of the end user and technologist, must grow closer. A more risk free environment should be fostered to balance user readiness and technology prior to the rigors of competitive and legal issues. The reality is that these issues already exist. A bridge of understanding is needed to take advantage of the many possible benefits and to minimize the risks. 912750. (P-253) National spatial data infrastructure for IVHS in the USA. Donald F. Cooke, Geographic Data Technology, Inc. Practically all systems falling into the category of "IVHS" have a need for computerized spatial data, whether they be in-car navigation devices, dispatching or fleet management services or route guidance systems. System developers are faced with having to build customized spatial databases as an additional cost and headache beyond hardware, software and marketing challenges. Despite the wide range of functions that various types of IVHS systems perform, there is a large amount of overlap in database content required to support these systems. The author proposes an elemental definition of a generic database supporting most IVHS functions. Several federal agencies provide pieces of a generic IVHS spa- tial data infrastructure. The paper reviews these database resources from the standpoints of basic needs of various IVHS components, missions of database providers and of various IVHS and mapping committees and study groups. Models for provision of an IVHS database infrastructure are outlined. 912751. (P-253) Emerging requirements for digital maps for in-vehicle Pathfinding and other traveller assistance. Marvin White, Etak, Inc. As advanced traveller information systems (ATIS) technology matures, new in-vehicle applications are arising: pathfinding, business listings ("yellow pages"), cartographically attractive dis- plays, integration with global positioning system (GPS) technol- ogy, and communications with real-time traffic information ser- vices. Each of these impose new demands on digital maps sup- porting ATIS. We present examples of each and describe the nature of supporting map data. For pathfinding the following data are used: a topological database, driving restrictions, including complex multi-link turn restrictions, and street classifications used in computing imped- ance. More advanced and attractive graphics displays, e.g., color LCD and CRT screens, permit color fill for such areas as water bodies and parks. As a result, purely cartographic information, useful primarily for making the map display more attractive and recognizable, may become a significant portion of the map data. GPS is now widely available, and many manufacturers are including GPS receivers in their designs and prototypes. This requires, in most cases, a change in coordinate systems, for exam- ple in the US from NAD27 to WGS84. Finally, identifying partic- ular links for communication with real-time traffic information services imposes requirements for cooperation among develop- ers. Operating examples of these new requirements in use are pres- ented together with a brief review of earlier requirements, includ- ing positional accuracy, street classification and geocoding sup- port. These are needed for display, map matching navigation, as well as new applications, such as business listings searches. 912752. (P-253) Standards for navigable databases: a progress report .Richard J. Weiland, SEI Information Technology. SAE's database standards task group is addressing digital street map databases to support vehicle navigation. The initial work of the task group is to develop a descriptive "truth-in- labeling" standard to permit database vendors to consistently and accurately describe their products and to permit application developers to match available databases to their needs. The truth- in-labeling standard consists of definitions to identify database entities, metrics, to provide scales against which entity quality can measured, and tests to score the entities along metrics. The general classes of entities being considered are nodes (e.g., road- way intersections), links (e.g., roadway segments), and regions (e.g., cities, parks, shopping malls, etc.). Among the issues being considered are: how to facilitate broadcasts of traffic information to vehicles using navigable databases; approaches to dealing with roads with multiple names; roadway classifications; and coordi- nation with similar efforts in other parts of the world. 912753. (P-253) Traffic analysis including non-conforming behavior via image processing. Ishwar K. Sethi and Wayne L. Brillhart, Dept. of Computer Science, Wayne State Univ. In this paper an approach to traffic analysis is presented which employs image processing techniques to detect non-conforming behavior of vehicles on roadways in addition to providing the normal traffic statistics required for traffic monitoring. Traffic scenes recorded on video tape were used in the laboratory to test the approach. Binary images were obtained by subtracting each incoming sampled frame from a reference frame and threshold- ing the result. Centroids were calculated for each of the objects found in the binary images and were used to track the path of each vehicle on successive frames for its duration along the road- way in the region of interest. To minimize the computation time required to match objects from a given frame to the correspond- ing objects in the next frame, the velocity of each vehicle and inertial constraints on speed and angular deviation were used to predict each object's location in the next frame. The object near- est the target value was chosen as the appropriate match. The tra- jectory of each vehicle was checked for conformity. The imple- mentation of the approach has been able to identify non- conforming vehicle behavior and issue a message on the monitor describing the detected behavior. 912754. (P-253) Temporal analysis of stereo image sequences of traffic scenes. S. Chandrashekhar, Signal and Image Process- ing Institute, University of Southern California ; A. Meygret, McGill Univ Ř; and M. Thonnat, IN RI A Sophia-Antipolis. This paper deals with the temporal analysis of stereo image sequences taken from a road vehicle in a busy traffic environ- ment. The images are first processed to extract contours of signifi- cant intensity change. Points lying on these contours are used as primitives for stereo matching and optic flow computation, which yield the 3-D trajectories of the salient points in the scene. These point trajectories are processed by a Kaiman filter to deter- mine the relative motion of the points with respect to the vehicle. The 3-D output of the stereo algorithm is grouped by a segmenta- tion algorithm into different objects. A statistical analysis of the motion parameters is performed for each object. Experimental results with a real stereo sequence are presented. 912755. (P-253) Dynamic traffic information from remote video monitors. R. Kent Gilbert and Quentin Holmes, Environ- mental Research Institute of Michigan. Real-time video of traffic scenes contain a wealth of informa- tion not available from conventional point dectors. In addition to the instantaneous, wide-area coverage provided by image data, 295</page><page sequence="295">912755-912762 image sequences capture the dynamic aspects of the traffic. Ini- tially, researchers concentrated on minimizing hardware com- plexity, and thus cost, at the expense of sophisticated algorithms that could more fully exploit the information inherent in image data. If image data could be processed in real-time to produce a track file for each object of interest, then the traffic flow through the scene would be fully characterized for traffic management purposes. This paper presents the status of work in process at the Environmental Research Institute of Michigan (ERIM) to develop real-time image processing algorithms for detecting and tracking vehicles in actual traffic settings. The image processing techniques for detecting and tracking will be illustrated, the corre- sponding computational resources will be described, and prelimi- nary results on typical video sequences will be presented. 912757. (P-253) Japanese projects on automobile information and communication systems - Things aimed at and obtained in 20 years' experiences. Sadao Takaba, Institute of Industrial Science , University of Tokyo. In the early 1970's the CA CS project started concurrently with the introduction of traffic signal control systems in urban streets and of systems for presenting traffic information on freeways to solve the severe problems of traffic congestion, traffic safety and air pollution. The goal of CACS was broken down into many sub-projects and pursued in the ATICS project for advanced traffic manage- ment and in several small projects in the early 1980's. The planning for the well known RACS and AMTICS projects in the late 1980's was based on this accumulation of knowledge. The expectation of greater business opportunities stimulated the participants and led some large-scale of projects to success. Twenty years of continuous experience will be effectively used in planning the new IVHS projects for the early 1990's, including the next generation highway traffic systems and super smart vehi- cle system projects. 912758. (P-253) Automobile navigation system using individ- ual communication beacon. Hiroyuki Kanemitsu, Takaharu Saito , Junkoh Shima, and Yoshibumi Tanaka, Toyota Motor Corp. A communication system that uses roadside beacons to broad- cast road and traffic information and private messages to vehicles has been developed. The system, called road/automobile com- munication system (RACS), was the result of a joint research project involving the Public Works Research Institute and 25 pri- vate-sector corporations. This paper contains an outline of RACS and of an onboard system developed by Toyota and presents the results of field tests conducted in the Tokyo area. The results not only verify the capability of the RACS system and the effective- ness of the in-vehicle equipment but also indicate the potential of such a beacon based network to improve traffic jam and driv- ing safety whilst providing enhanced communication facilities without increasing radio-wave congestion. 912759. (P-253) Communication system design of RACS (road/automobile communication system). Tadao Iwadate, Road Traffic Control Div., Road Bureau, Ministry of Construction ; Tet - suo Matsumura, Public Works Research Institute, Ministry of Construction ; Takeshi Kaw a da, Communications Terminal Sys- tems Div., NEC Corp.; Yutaka Kanazaki, Systems and Electron- ics Div., Sumitomo Electric Industries Co., Ltd.; Hideto Ohura , Mobile Communications Div., Oki Electric Industry Co., Ltd.; and Tadashi Kinomura, Systems and Electronics Div., Sumitomo Electric Industries Co., Ltd. In Japan RACS standing for road/automobile communication system has been studied for eight years. RACS is composed of three kinds of elements; on-board computer, beacon, center com- puter. RACS communication is a kind of radio communication link which connects the beacon and the on-board computer. Research and development of RACS having been completed, the information service is selected among RACS services as the first step of practical use and realized as RACS information pro- viding system. The results of studying system design, making specifications, and executing experiments of RACS information providing sys- tem are described in this paper. After analyzing system function, and the characteristics of RACS communication, the specification is made. In the result of the experiment, the specification is testified feasible and reason- able. 912760. (P-253) Estimation and measurement of travel time by vehicle detectors and license plate readers. Sadao Takaba, Insti- tute of Industrial Science, University of Tokyo; Takeshi Monta, National Police Agency ; Takashi Hada, Japan Traffic Manage- ment Technology Association ; and Tsutomu Usami and Morie Yamaguchi, Sumitomo Electric Industnes, Ltd. In 1990, the Japanese National Police Agency (NPA) planned a nationwide two-year research project including field experi- ments, "travel time estimation and prediction" aimed at realiz- ing a reliable method of providing travel time information to drivers. The project was conducted by the Japan Traffic Manage- ment Technology Association and three system manufacturers (Sumitomo Electric, OMRON and Matsushita Communication) collaborated on research and experimental work. Several meth- ods of estimating and predicting travel time were developed and evaluated in three major cities (Tokyo, Yokohama and Osaka). Four models, Sandglass, Delay Time, Auto Regressive and Neu- ral Network Models were developed and evaluated using detector and license plate reader information, and field survey data in the three major cities. The first year evaluation results are described here. 912761. (P-253) Super smart vehicle system - Its concept and preliminary works. Sadayuki Tsugawa, Agency of Industry Sci- ence and Technology, Ministry of International Trade an; Nobuo Watanabe, JSK; and Haruki Fujii, Association of Electronic Technology for Automotive Traffic and Driving (JSK). The super smart vehicle system (SSVS) is information systems for drivers 20-30 years from now which are solutions to problems caused by automobiles and automobile traffic. The two year studies on the SSVS was begun in 1990 fiscal year under support by MITI. In this paper, first, present status and problems of auto- mobiles and automobile traffic in Japan are described, and then, histories of information systems for automobiles and automobile traffic in Japan, which were efforts for the solutions, are explained. Japan has long histories in the information systems, where the CACS and the intelligent vehicle with machine vision were developed. The SSVS, integrating driver information sys- tems and vheicle control systems, has been derived from a new concept of info-mobility and the SSVS is realization of the info- mobility. The SSVS consists of 4 fields: information systems for a single vehicle, information systems for inter-vehicles, informa- tion systems for vehicle-to-road relations, and studies on vehicle- to-driver relations. Some of system candidates proposed for the SSVS are introduced. 912762. (P-253) J2095: A proposed recommended practice for CDROM bootup in navigation systems. Michael Sheldrick and James Buxton, Etak, Inc. This paper describes J2095, a proposed "Recommended Prac- tice" now being developed by the CD-ROM Boot Task Group of the Society of Automotive Engineers' IVHS Division. J2095 would enable CD-ROMS containing map data and other geo- coded data to be run in any manufacturer's navigation hardware. Upon bootup, the hardware searches for its executable file among the multiple exécutables on the disk. Because publishers could make their products available for several vehicles, the 296</page><page sequence="296">912762-912776 accepted practice would have the salutary effect of opening cars up to a common base of data. At the same time, J2095 permits each manufacturer to design its own unique user interface. Manufacturers will also retain con- trol over which independently produced data and software, if any, they will allow to run in the vehicles they produce. 912763. (P-253) Path planning and evaluation in 1VHS data- bases. Toneluh A. Yang, Shashi Shekhar, and Babak Hamidza- deh, Computer Science Dept., University of Minnesota; and Peter A. Hancock, Human Factors Research Lab., University of Minne- sota. An IVHS (intelligent vehicle highway system) navigation sys- tem obtains information from road sensors, city maps and even schedules, and generates information for drivers. We address two aspects of navigation in IVHS: finding a path and evaluating a given path. Finding a path between a starting point and the desti- nation is based on heuristic search procedures. Evaluation of a given path is modeled as a path query. We use a new access method, called MoBiLe File (18), for efficient map storage and access. We propose a hierarchical path planning algorithm which is capable of finding optimal paths while avoiding obstacles. We contribute obstacle avoidance heuristics for faster computation of paths between two points. 912765. (P-253) Database accuracy effects on vehicle position- ing as measured by the certainty factory. R. Borcherts, Technol- ogy and Information Div., Zexel USA Corp.; C. Collier and E. Koch, SEI Information Technology ; and R. Bennett, Navigation Technologies Corp. Accurate vehicle positioning with respect to a geographical database is fundamental to successful use of in-vehicle navigation systems. In this paper, the authors examine known distortions in the database by their effect on vehicle positioning as measured by the certainty factor. The results are shown graphically as a function of distance as the vehicle traverses the distorted region of the database. Three cases are examined using two vehicle posi- tioning algorithms -one more heavily weighted with GPS than the other. A conclusion made is that the certainty factor concept is a valid measure for examining database distortions as well as vehicle positioning algorithms. 912767. (P-253) Incident detection algorithms for compass an advanced traffic management system. Philip H . Masters, Ministry of Transportation of Ontario; Joseph K. Lam, National Engineeirng Technology Corp.; and Kam Wong, National Engi- neering Technology Corp. Advanced traffic management system (ATMS) provide the means for local transportation officials to monitor traffic condi- tions, adjust traffic operations, and respond to accidents. By pro- viding early traffic incident detection and management, and by redistributing traffic to less congested portions of the highway network, ATMS can influence vehicle operators' route choices. COMPASS, a state-of-the-art advanced traffic management sys- tem implemented in the Metropolitan Toronto area, has adopted most of the intelligent vehicle-highway systems (IVHS) technolo- gies. This paper describes the logic and implementation of the auto- matic incident detection for COMPASS. The purpose of incident detection is to identify the potential occurrence of incidents in a traffic stream by analyzing the flow characteristics of the traffic stream. The output of the incident detection function will form the basis for incident verification by the operator and implemen- tation of traffic response plans. Two incident detection algo- rithms have been developed for the system, namely the all pur- pose incident detection (APID) algorithm and the double expo- nential smoothing (DES) algorithm. 912770. (P-253) In-tunnel traffic flow measuring system using ITV cameras. Kenichi Yoshino and Masahiro Miyahara, Japan Highway Public Corp.; and Kunio Sakai, Yoshiyuki Ito, and Takao Negishi, Sumitomo Electric Industries, Ltd. The image processing technology using ITV cameras has been developed as a new type of sensor which can be used for many purposes. Especially, it is hopeful that the improvement of the traffic flow measuring system applying this technology can increase safety in tunnels on expressways. In this paper, we describe about the results of the development of this technology until present. And, the prospect in the future. 912771. (P-253) Pricing road use to manage peak demand. Donald J. Howie, Don Howie and Associates. This paper reports an analysis of potential costs and revenues to apply road pricing in Melbourne. Objectives of road pricing are assumed to be reduced peak period congestion and raising of funds for transport infrastructure. The analysis provides a broad understanding of opportunities for intelligent vehicle highway systems (IVHS) to be applied to road pricing; using Melbourne as a test case. Road pricing can take many forms from simple flat annual charges with fuel consumption based variable charges through to systems which charge vehicle owners according to actual road use. IVHS developments will be the key to the implementation of socially acceptable systems which charge according to actual use -or a form of charging which partially meets this objective. As pressure on road funds increases over the next decade, there is likely to be greater emphasis on the use of IVHS technolo- gies to change the way in which road infrastructure is managed. 912772. (P-253) Highway automation: system modeling for impacts analysis. Anne Bresnock, Dept. of Economics, California State Polytechnic Univ.; Mark A. Miller, University of California, Berkeley; Edward H. Lechner, Systems Control Technology ; and Steven E. Shladover, University of California. Highway automation technologies have been proposed in an attempt to ameliorate the urban problem of congestion and, to a lesser extent, air pollution. The methodology developed to ana- lyze the impacts of an automated highway system in the Southern California region in 2025 is addressed in this paper. An auto- mated highway system scenario is selected from several alterna- tives based on sensitivity analyses that allow for variability in network location, total network miles, and market penetration of vehicles equipped with automation features. 912776. (P-253) A concept of IVHS in commercial vehicle operation: the HELP/crescent program. C. Michael Walton, Uni- versity of Texas at Austin. The HELP program and crescent demonstration project is a bi-national multi-jurisdictional cooperative research and demon- stration project involving the public and private sectors in an application of advancing technologies in the creation of an inte- grated heavy vehicle management system with applications to both highway and vehicle systems. This initiative is a leading example of the intelligent vehicle highway systems (IVHS) in commercial vehicle operations (CVO). The selected technologies are being integrated into a heavy vehicle management system. These technologies include: 1) auto- matic vehicle identification (AVI); 2) weigh-in-motion (WIM); 3) automatic vehicle classification (AVC); 4) data communication networks and systems integration. The program, initiated approximately eight years ago, consists of three phases which include assessing the feasibility of the concept, technical studies involving laboratory and field tests, and, lastly, the demonstra- tion phase. Perhaps the most significant activity of this project centers on the subject of institutional arrangements associated with the integration of emerging technologies with current opera- 297</page><page sequence="297">912776-912781 tional policies and practices, within both government and indus- try sectors. The demonstration element of the program, referred to as the crescent demonstration project, began in 1991 and involves six U.S. states and one Canadian province. The project will be phased into a full scale operation over the next three years. It is estimated that the cost of this program to date is approximately $20 million shared by both industry and government in testing this landmark program. This paper provides an overview of the program and the components of the implementation plan. 912777. (P-253) Implementing IVHS technology: the ADVANTAGE 1-75 approach. John A. Deacon, Dept. of Civil Engrg., University of Kentucky; Jerry G. Pigman, University of Kentucky ; and Thomas H. Jacobs, Kentucky Div., Federal High- way Administration. ADVANTAGE 1-75 focuses on implementation of invelligent vehicle/highway system (IVHS) technologies and on the pro- cesses whereby technological advancements are assimilated into the operational setting. ADVANTAGE 1-75 represents a partner- ship of public and private interests in the 1-75 corridor. Its goal is to reduce congestion, increase efficiency, and enhance safety of motorists and other users of 1-75 and its connections into Canada through the application of advanced highway and vehicle tech- nologies. Currently being considered as the inaugural project is an application of automatic vehicle identification (AVI) technol- ogy designed to facilitate motorcarrier operations by allowing transponder-equipped and properly documented trucks to travel any segment along the entire length of 1-75 at mainline speeds with minimal stopping at enforcement stations. 912778. (P-253) TravEIGuide - Ontario's route guidance con- cept. Gabriel Heti, Ministry of Transportation of Ontario. Automobile drivers are often faced with the need to drive in unfamiliar surroundings, find unknown destinations or select the best route on their travels. A variety of in-vehicle navigation and route guidance systems have been proposed, developed and demonstrated in the United States, Europe and Japan. Although the systems are certainly use- ful, sophisticated and attractive, they are also, at least at the moment, relatively expensive. The Ministry of Transportation of Ontario is actively pursu- ing the assessment and possible developed of TravEIGuide, a route guidance system that will offer most of the benefits of more advanced systems but at significantly lower cost. The present concept of the system includes a portable device that provides advice to the driver, based on real-time traffic infor- mation, on the route to take from his current position to his desti- nation. The system does not include an on-board navigation capability; it relies on the driver to act as the navigator, thus resulting in significant cost savings. This paper provides a brief overview of route guidance sys- tems, describes the TravEIGuide concept and compares it against route guidance systems in operation or under development else- where. 912779. (P-253) Impact of emerging semiconductor technology on transportation vehicles in the year 2000. S. Bansal, Alcoa Elec- tronic Packaging, Inc. We were requested to predict the future specification of the electronic materials, electronic packages and micro processors for high performance computer systems going as far out as the year 2000 and beyond. These were to be based on the emerging requirements of the end users. Literature and conferences yielded very little quantitative data. As a result, we understood to design and develop a deterministic and macroscopic model based on physics, math, VLSI design, architecture and integration level considerations. The resulting model transcended the electronic world from system performance to microprocessor description to packaging specifications and required material's specifications. Based on this model, it is likely that the world will see an integra- tion of 100 million transistors on a single chip providing clock frequencies approaching 213 MHz and CPU power near about 238 MIPS. Transportation is a major business for Alcoa. We have used our model to examine what architectural directions the Mobile 2000 would take for satisfying its command and control, navigational, entertainment, communication, engine, transmis- sion and body/cockpit control and management systems. A scenario is developed based on the current and emerging requirements for the above functions leading to the automobile of the year 2000. This is then translated to yield control and sys- tem requirements which then are converted to the total computa- tional requirements. The requirements are used to define the future system specifications based on our model's predictions. Alternative architectures are then presented. Cautions and cave- ats are discussed based on our experience on several large scale computer integrated manufacturing (CIM) networks', design development and implementation. It is imperative to bring the large scale systems thinking to Mobile 2000's automation and support systems so that the classical pitfalls of cost, performance, lack of planning, ad hoc and proliferation of incompatible sys- tems does not take place in this exiting arena. 912780. (P-253) IVHS- An automotive perspective. B. F. Heinrich, Chrysler Corp. IVHS is viewed as a marriage of the "smart vehicle" and "smart highway" into an integrated vehicle/highway system. Its ultimate success will be highly dependent upon the acceptance and continued use of in-vehicle IVHS equipment by the vehicle drivers. Electronics has been effectively used in today's vehicles to enhance its performance, reduce emissions, improve economy, and to increase driver and occupant safety, comfort and conve- nience. Its use has been primarily market driven, its implementa- tion has been evolutionary rather than revolutionary and in some cases its success has been very sensitive to driver acceptance. In- vehicle IVHS equipment is expected to follow the same trends. One objective of this paper is to review the automotive elec- tronic trends for the past 30 years to determine the forces behind the rapid expansion of electronics in our modern day vehicles. Some of the lessons learned that could benefit the implementa- tion of IVHS technologies will be highlighted. The paper will discuss the current trends in automotive elec- tronics, as viewd by the author, that may influence the future implementation of related in-vehicle IVHS equipment. A variety of in-vehicle IVHS offerings will be required to sat- isfy the different driver needs for traffic assistance. These offer- ings may span from simple highway advisory radios (HAR) to very sophisticated route guidance systems. To justify the billions of dollars required for the "smart" highways, affordable in- vehicle systems must be available to allow most, if not all, drivers to access the traffic advisory system. The paper will be concluded with a discussion of the issues that need to be addressed to insure driver acceptance which is felt necessary for the success of IVHS. 912781. (P-253) IVHS - Auto industry perspectives. Richard A. Place, Ford Motor Co., Retired. IVHS, or intelligent vehicle highway systems, is a concept rap- idly growing in momentum among government, industry, and academia for a variety of reasons. As a key component in the eventual deployment of I VHS technologies, the auto industry can be expected to support its contribution to reduced congestion, improved safety, energy conservation, environmental quality, and more pleasant car ownership. But a number of difficult prob- lems must be solved before the car companies jump in with both feet, including marketability, cost (and resultant price), national and international infrastructure compatibility, assurance that 298</page><page sequence="298">912781-912787 necessary infrastructure will be provided (essentially a govern- ment responsibility), product liability concerns, confirmation of benefits, inability to deal with time horizons beyond five to seven years, and depressed economic conditions. 912782. (P-253) The power of a personal computer for car information and communications systems. F. Phail Automotive Div., Intel Corp. Autonomous car navigation systems have been on the market since the mid-1980s. To date these systems have seen limited market acceptability due to high cost and lack of adequate map data bases and roadway infrastructure to make navigation sys- tems more useful to the consumer. Today, Japan, the US, and Europe all have programs which are beginning to address making our highways more intelligent, specifying the infrastructure necessary for successful implemen- tation. Many geographic areas are now being digitized and stored on CD ROM. Automakers are also now beginning to address the utility of these autonomous systems. One way to increase utility is to take advantage of the power of the personal computer to make a cost-effective car information and communication sys- tem which shares the navigation "computer", display and CD player. Some of the functions of the car information and communica- tion system could include: operation and/or display of the auto- matic temperature control, audio and video entertainment cen- ter, trip computer, navigation system, cellular telephone, and car diagnostics. Certain features could be incorporated by taking advantage of the "computer" in the car. These features might include: autodialing, maintenance logs, "yellow pages" directory, paging, route determination and electronic mail. This paper will discuss a conceptual car information and com- munication system that is based on a highly-integrated, two chip "PC", the Intel386(TM)SL, which could utilize a PC-like win- dows (TM) operating system, notebook PC memory cards and CD ROM based maps. 912783. (P-253) DIRECT: A comparison of alternative driver information systems. R. Kent Gilbert, Environmental Research Institute of Michigan; Steven E. Underwood, University of Michi- gan; and Leo E. DeFrain, Michigan Dept. of Transportation. The Michigan Department of Transportation (MDOT) recently initiated a three-year program named DIRECT, which stands for driver information radio experimenting with commu- nication technologies. The DIRECT project has been designed specifically to test, in an operational setting, alterantive driver- information systems. DIRECT is being undertaken as a national IVHS operational field test and is funded through a public/ private partnership between FHWA (50%), MDOT (25%), and several automobile and electronic component manufacturers (25%). This paper describes the system, starting from the initial decisions on the project concept through the physical and experi- mental design concepts. 912784. (P-253) Pathfinder status and implementation experi- ence. Frank J. M ammano, Federal Highway Administration; and Roy Sumner, Farradyne Systems, Inc. The paper will include a brief overview of the Pathfinder sys- tem which has been installed in Los Angeles. The system is undergoing evaluation at this time. Some implementation experi- ences will be included. For example, the paper will discuss some of the reasons for the changes from the presentation of congestion information in synthesized voice to all digital voice. The Path- finder experience with mixtures of digital and synthesized speech led to confusion, which can be avoided in other systems. The time taken for message presentation was excessive and led to a necessary reduction in the number of messages presented when the voice mode is selected by the driver. This significant limita- tion could alter the design of other systems which might rely on speech as a presentation mode to the driver. Also, will be included the experiences encountered in the presentation of con- gestion symbols on the in-vehicle map display which will allow the display to function as it was originally designed by the manu- facturer. One of the problems associated with superimposing symbols on a map is that as the driver "zoom" in, the symbols move away from the road. The map scaling factors must be adjusted. The design location of the symbol needs to convey both direction and intensity of the congested link. In addition, there will be a discussion on the communications testing and installa- tion issues. The Pathfinder base station communication system involves a phone line from the control center to a communica- tion hut owned by the city of Los Angeles. A conduit exists from the hut which is owned by the county. This conduit is terminated in another hut which is owned by the California Highway Patrol (CHP). The communication line goes from the hut to a tower where the antenna is mounted. The tower is owned by the CHP. In addition the transmitter in the hut had to be shock mounted for earthquakes. The paper concludes with a brief status of Path- finder and considerations used for the design of the system. 912786. (P-253) Design and implementation of advance: the Illinois dynamic navigation and route guidance demonstration program. David E. Boyce, University of Illinois at Chicago ; Allan Kirson, Motorola, Inc.; and Joseph L. Schofer, Northwestern Univ. A demonstration program to design, implement and evaluate an in-vehicle navigation and route guidance system with dynami- cally updated travel time information is being undertaken on a suburban arterial road system in Northeast Illinois. In July, 1991, the Illinois Department of Transportation, Federal Highway Admistration, Motorola, Inc., and Illinois Universities Transpor- tation Research Consortium agreed to proceed with the design and test phase of the demonstration program. This phase will design the route guidance system demonstration, implement the software design for the Traffic Information Center and conduct a system test. Detailed plans for monitoring and assessing the sys- tem's performance will also be prepared. These designs will guide the studies to be performed during the implementation phase of the demonstration program expected to commence in 1993. 912787. (P-253) Research on anticipatory route guidance. Kan Chen and Steven E. Underwood, University of Michigan. This paper describes the industry-relevant basic research focus of the Michigan IVHS program in the last two years, with an emphasis on the linkage among the various projects related to anticipatory route guidance. Future direction of this research focus will also be discussed. The critical test for advanced traveler information systems (ATIS) is whether an individual driver with an appropriately equipped vehicle will get intelligent and safe advice on traffic diversion from his originally chosen route after a congestion- causing incident is detected and verified. Such advice should take into account not only current traffic conditions but also antici- pated delay that may occur before the driver reaches his destina- tion. Therefore, the Michigan IVHS research on traffic modeling and route optimization has focused on anticipatory route guid- ance. The anticipatory guidance system routes the vehicles by minimizing time-dependent link costs incurred by the driver. A novel dynamic programming approach has been used to take advantage of the time-dependent characteristics of the minimal travel-time solution to reduce computation load. The computation of routes is accomplished in the vehicle so that the driver will have complete and private control of not only the objective function, but also the constraints, in the computa- tion for his optimum route. The information to be provided from the infrastructure is a set of anticipated link costs, updated peri- odically, to reflect current system demand and unexpected traffic incidents. Preliminary analysis has suggested that, to minimize communication load, under certain conditions, all link costs (not 299</page><page sequence="299">912787-912793 just exceptional ones) should be transmitted and appropriate data compression techniques should be used. Since diversion recommendations are generated within the vehicle, no matter where the vehicle happens to be, these recom- mendations may arise after the driver has passed the location for safe maneuver to divert. Human factors research has been con- ducted to assess the safe distance before the junction for recom- mended diversion that should be allowed for safe diversion. This safe distance would depend on the driver characteristics, as well as on the vehicle and road characteristics (including the lane loca- tion). The guidance system should be designed so that only safe diversion advice will be given to the driver. Extension of research on anticipatory route guidance includes 1) the projection of link costs through traffic modeling and simu- lation, 2) inclusion of multiple transportation modes, and 3) coordination with traffic light controls. The research strategy is to generate practical guidelines for ATIS product development, which can be upgraded incrementally as additional research results become available, and as component costs change. 912788. (P-253) Using variable reluctance sensors for differen- tial odometer applications. Mark S. Pikula and George Calvas , Ford Motor Co. Applying a variable reluctance sensor to a differential odome- ter application requires special considerations. Due to wide- spread use in anti-lock brake systems and the need for cost effec- tive designs, variable reluctance sensors have advantages over more expensive active sensors. Unfortunately, both mechanical and electrical parameters can adversely affect the output of a vari- able reluctance sensor. The output signal varies with the rate of change of the flux, mechanical spacing and magnetic source vari- ation. At low vehicle speeds the output signal, which is a function of the rate of change of the flux, tends to approach zero and sig- nal-to-noise ratios become significant. Since changes in vehicle direction typically occur at lower speeds, differential odometers require good low speed performance. In addition to speed, differ- ential odometers rely on two sensors, therefore sensor variation must also be compensated for. Consequently, using variable reluctance sensors to perform differential odometer calculations requires signal processing, special circuitry and pulse train pro- cessing to extract an acceptable level of information. This paper introduces a signal conditioning circuit that oper- ates over a wide frequency and amplitude range. The output of the circuit can be connected to the input of a microprocessor. Pas- sive components can be adjusted to work with different applica- tions. 912789. (P-253) Sumitomo electric's navigation systems for private automobiles. Hirosaka Ikeda, Automotive Electrical and Electronics Div., Sumitomo Electric Industries, Ltd; Yoshinobu Kobayashi, Vehicular Technology Lab., Sumitomo Electric Industries, Ltd.; and Seiji Kawamura, Automotive Electrical and Electronics Div., Sumitomo Electric Industries, Ltd. The recently developed navigation systems discussed in this paper include location detection using map-matching, map dis- play, and improved man-machine interface functions, and are contained in a stand-alone system installed in passenger cars. The newest system uses a fiber optic gyroscope as a rotation rate sen- sor, and improved map-matching method to get high accuracy. As to driving guide information, the system can display road information from road side radio beacons, and can play CD- ROM discs based on CDCRAFT which is proposed in Japan as a common standard of CD format and application program for navigation systems. 912790. (P-253) Map navigation software of the electro- multivision of the '91 Toyota soarer. Kunihiro Ishikawa and Michima Ogawa, Nippondenso Co., Ltd.; and Shigetoshi Azuma and Tooru Ito, Toyota Motor Corp. This paper describes the electro-multivision map navigation software mounted in the Toyota Soarer (1991). The following functions are required of on-board map navigation software: 1) indication of the exact position of the vehicle to the driver; 2) determination of the optimum path to the destination and pre- sentation of this route to the driver in the simplest way; and 3) accommodation of a wide variety of destinations and settings for different users. The following gives some examples of how these functions are achieved and outlines the associated technologies: 1) path finding and associated display technology path finding algorithm and technology for displaying the calculated on the map; construction of a data base on CD-ROM; 2) technology for dtermination of the current position utilizing map matching and the global position- ing system (GPS). A method with improved reliability based on two current position outputs obtained using map matching and the GPS and the mutual compensation method; 3) software ven- dor participation technology utilization of CDCRAFT and meth- ods of determining and setting the destination devised by soft- ware vendors. Finally, an outline is given of the course of future develop- ment of on-board navigation systems. 912791. (P-253) An application of artificial neural networks for autonomous ship navigation through a channel. Mikan Sta - menkovich, Naval Seal Combat Systems Engineering Station. A neural network model based on reinforcement learning is investigated for use as a shipboard autonomous channel naviga- tor. The model used consists of two neuron-like elements. The basic learning scheme involves learning with a critic. The net- work consists of an adaptive critic element (ACE) and an adap- tive search element (ASE). The ASE explores the channel region while the ACE criticizes the actions of the ASE and tries to predict failures of the ASE's attempt to navigate. The neural network model developed has been shown to be useful through software simulation with graphical feedback. A similar implementation could have applications in many elec- tronic mapping systems utilizing vector information. This paper investigates the performance of such a system and its adaptability to new channels. 912792. (P-253) What functions and features should be in driver information systems of the year 2000. Paul Green, Univer- sity of Michigan, Transportation Research Institute; Collen Sera- fin, Universtiy of Michigan, Transportation Research Institute; and Marie Williams and Gretchen Paelke, University of Michi- gan, Transportation Research Institute. This paper describes new driver-information systems that are suggested for cars of the 21st century and proposes a method for selecting them. This method will help government officials, prod- uct planners, engineers, designers, and scientists identify func- tions and features that will be most beneficial to drivers. The systems (functions) of interest were navigation, vehicle monitoring, traffic information, road-hazard warning, communi- cations, motorist services, in-car signing, office functions, and entertainment. Features and information elements of these sys- tems were identified and rated on three dimensions: effect on accidents, impact on traffic operations, and driver needs and wants. Based on the ranking of feature, information about slick roads, accidents, congestion, construction, blocked views, emergency vehicles, and tire and brake problems would be particularly bene- ficial. 912793. (P-253) In-vehicle navigation devices: effects on the safety of driver performance. Jonathan Walker, COMSIS Corp.; Elizabeth Alicandri, FHWA; Catherine Sedney, COMSIS Corp.; and King Roberts, FHWA. 300</page><page sequence="300">912793-912798 Seven navigational devices were tested in the Federal High- way Administration Highway Driving Simulator (HYSIM) for their effects on safe driving performance. Younger, middle-aged, and older drivers, 42 in each group, navigated a 26-mi (42-km) route through simulated streets of Detroit, MI, using one of seven devices. A control group used strip maps. The other six used either an auditory or visual device which was of either low, medium, or high complexity. The difficulty of the driving task (workload) was increased in three successive sections by adding crosswinds, another vehicle, gauge-monitoring, and mental arith- metic problems, and by narrowing the lanes. Measures included speed, average and variance of lateral placement, heart rate, and reaction time to gauge changes. Results indicate an interaction of age group and level of difficulty, such that higher levels of diffi- culty affected older drivers to a greater extent. Device differences suggest that auditory devices are somewhat safer than visual devices, and moderate levels of complexity are preferable to higher levels. The complex visual device had the longest reaction times and the slowest speeds in sections where navigation tasks were performed. 912794. (P-253) A usability evaluation of navigation and infor- mation system "pre-drive" functions. Thomas A. Dingus and Melissa C. Hülse , University of Idaho ; Mark K. Krage and Francis E. Szczublewski ', General Motors Research Labs.; and Paul Berry, TASC, Inc. Recent technological advancements have created the capabil- ity for functionally powerful vehicle navigation and information systems to become a reality in the near future. The wide variety of desirable and likely features, and the complexity of some of the required driver manipulations, will necessitate the division of most systems into "pre-drive" and "drive" subsystems. For both the pre-drive and drive cases, usability within the constraints of the automotive environment is extremely important to system success. This study tested a variety of pre-drive functions to determine if likely users could operate such a system effectively with little or no training. Although the simulated scenarios required no error recovery, the generally low incidence of errors indicates that many of the pre-drive functions could likely be performed by a wide variety of representative drivers with no training. 912795. (P-253) Design and validation of headup displays for navigation in IVHS. S. Shekhar ; M. S. Coyle, and M. Shargal, Computer Science Dept., University of Minnesota ; J. J. Kozak, Comptuer Science Dept., University of Minnesota ; and Peter A. Hancock, Human Factors Research Lab., University of Minne- sota. Intelligent vehicle highway systems (IVHS) are being devel- oped to facilitate safety and efficiency for roadway users. To avoid congestion and improve route guidance, information has to be presented to the driver in a timely and digestible format. Currently, there are few methods by which an increase in such information load can be presented safety and effectively. The present experiments examine headup displays as one method of presenting this navigational information. A vital facet of infor- mation presentation is synthesis and management, such that dis- plays do not overload drivers and create safety hazards in and of themselves. To evaluate displays in a controlled environment, the present experiments were conducted in a fixed-base simula- tion facility. The first experiment evaluated the differences in driver response to alpha-numeric versus iconic headup displays. The second experiment compared ego-centered against fixed- based map representations of geographical information. Results indicate the superiority of iconic headup displays and ego- centered maps. 912796. (P-253) User performance on typing tasks involving reduced -size, touch screen keyboards. Marilyn F. Coleman, Beth A. Loring, and Michael E. Wiklund, American Institutes for Research. The prospect of using a touch screen to interact with naviga- tion displays led us to develop and evaluate three reduced-size, touch screen keyboards. One keyboard had a standard QWERTY layout; another had a modified QWERTY layout with keys aligned in a matrix; the third had a matrix of keys arranged in alphabetical order. Twenty adults varying in age and typing ability participated in the evaluation. Test results showed that subjects typed 25-26% faster on the QWERTY keyboards than on the alphabetical key- board. The difference in typing speed between the two QWERTY keyboards was not significant. Additionally, differences in error rates among the three keyboards were not significantly different. Eleven out of 20 subjects preferred the standard QWERTY key- board; 6 preferred the modified QWERTY keyboard; 3 preferred the alphabetical keyboard. These test results suggest that a reduced-size keyboard should employ a standard QWERTY key arrangement to achieve maximum usability. 912797. (P-253) An object-oriented traffic simulation with IVHS applications. Michael F. McGurrin and Paul T. R. Wang, MITRE Corp. Many traffic simulation models have been developed over the years; however, most existing models are not well-suited for eval- uating intelligent vehicle/highway systems (IVHS) concepts. This paper describes a new model, the vehicular traffic analysis capa- bility (VTAC), specifically designed to model advanced traffic management and advanced traveler information systems. The model was developed using object-oriented analysis and design principles, and implemented in a relatively new, object-oriented, simulation language. VTAC is believed to be the first traffic model developed uisng the object-oriented paradigm. The princi- ples used in the new model's design and the preliminary results obtained to-date are described. The model can currently model arterial networks, and sufficient progress has been made to dem- onstrate the utility of the object-oriented approach to traffic mod- eling. 912798. (P-253) Incident management with advanced traveller information systems. Haitham Al-Deek and Adib Kana) ani, Insti- tute of Transportation Studies, University of California. Advanced traveller information systems (ATIS) can be used to collect and disseminate dynamic information about travel times on highway links. One of the potential uses of these systems is to manage incidents. The objective of this research is to show under what incident conditions is it relevant to provide real time traffic information to travellers. A model that uses graphical queueing techniques is utilized to define cases when ATIS is beneficial and cases when it is not, and to evaluate its benefits as measured by travel time savings. The model is applied to a simple road network with two parallel bot- tlenecks. We analyze an off-peak incident scenario where a user optimal strategy is implemented to disseminate information only to vehicles equipped with ATIS. The different cases of queue evo- lution that can result are described, benefits to guided and unguided travellers and the sensitivity of benefits to relevant parameters are also analyzed. It is found that once equilibrium is reached between alternate routes, the rate of diversion from one to the other has be decreased to maintain it. The implication is that during equilib- rium some guided travellers will be diverted to the alternate route while others will be asked to stay on the route where the incident has occurred. It is also found that as long as the fraction of vehi- cles equipped with ATIS is below a critical value, pc, then the ben- efits to a guided traveller are maximum and are not affected by the amount of guided traffic. However, benefits to a guided trav- 301</page><page sequence="301">912798-912805 eller decline when the fraction of guided traffic becomes larger than pc. The critical value, pc, does not depend on incident parameters but it is a function of capacity of the alternate route and corridor demand. System benefits also increase to a maxi- mum as the fraction of guided traffic approaches pc and become constant when this fraction is larger than pc. Therefore, under user optimal strategy, if the fraction of vehicles equipped with ATIS is equal to pc benefits to guided traffic and to the system are maximized simultaneousy. The research need is to develop a methodology which can find practical estimates of pc to be used in large scale simulations of real life networks. 912799. (P-253) Modelling distributed real-time route guid- ance strategies in a traffic network that exhibits the braess para- dox. Laurence R. Rilett and Michel W. Van Aer de, Queen 's Univ. This paper examines the operational characteristics of a sim- ple traffic network which produces a dynamic form of the Braess paradox when the in-vehicle link data base, that is used to guide vehicles in real-time through the network, is expanded to include a low capacity short cut link which was previously unknown to the drivers. The analysis focuses on the ways in which a route guidance system with distributed route selection logic, such as the TravTek system in Orlando, can be made to avoid the inefficien- cies associated with the paradox without a priori knowledge of the existence of the paradox and while allowing each vehicle's RGS computer to independently make routing decisions without the explicit knowledge of the concurrent routing decisions of other drivers. It is shown that this objective can be achieved by implementing a distributed form of a system optimum routing algorithm coupled with the use of a PROBIT type of error term to reduce some of the instabilities that are intrinsic in the travel time information feedback loop. 912800. (P-253) Design parameters of advanced driver infor- mation systems: the case of incident congestion and small market penetration. H aris N. Koutsopoulos, MIT; and Ann Yablonski, MITRE Corp. There has been a growing concern over the past few years both in the United States and abroad over the escalating problem of urban roadway congestion. It is a popular belief that better traffic management, through the application of advanced technologies, can increase the capacity of existing roadways. Numerous dem- onstration programs are already underway to evaluate the feasi- bility and effectiveness of various in-vehicle route guidane sys- tems. The objective of this study is to examine the effects of design aspects of in-vehicle route guidance systems when used by a small number of participating vehicles (early stages of develop- ment with small market penetration). Such systems are also appropriate for the operation of emergency vehicles, commercial vehicles and other similar service systems. The design parame- ters of interest are the frequency of information updating, loca- tion of information, and level of intelligence. The results from a case study indicate that there are significant trade-offs among the design parameters. Furthermore, benefits to equipped vehicles due to the availability of information on traffic conditions were small with respect to average travel time reductions but signifi- cant with respect to improvements in travel time reliability. The results also indicate that improved incident management (if pos- sible) with reduced response times could also be very effective in reducing the effects of accidents, especially when combined with ADIS. 912802. (P-253) The university of Michigan IVHS education program. Kan Chen, Bernard A. Galier, and Thomas B. Reed, University of Michigan. Rapidly increasing demand for transportation combined with limited ability for expansion of facilities has led to recent degra- dations in the quality of tranportation systems. Intelligent vehi- cle-highway systems (IVHS) represent a promising effort toward enabling more effective and efficient use of current capacity thus in essence expanding the roadway. As the concepts and technolo- gies utilized by IVHS are new to much of the transportation com- munity there is a need for an educational initiative in this area. In 1990 the University of Michigan (UM) responded to this need by creating the first, and to date the only, university pro- gram in IVHS education. The IVHS education program is receiv- ing initial multi-year support from the U.S. Department of Trans- portation with matching support from the University of Michi- gan. Significant assistance is also being provided by sponsors from industry, the Michigan Department of Transportation, Michigan State University (MSU), and Wayne State University (WSU). The program is structured as a cross-disciplinary cooperative effort to provide both traditional university and continuing edu- cation. Key new initiatives include; 1) a certificate in transporta- tion studies: IVHS which has been designed to complement the depth gained through a master's or Ph.D. degree in an established discipline by providing breadth in practical knowledge relevant to IVHS, 2) an engineering summer conference which is offered to expose practicing engineers and professionals to the latest developments in IVHS, and 3) an executive education seminar which is held for corporate and government executives and plan- ners interested in strategic issues in IVHS. The unconventional nature of the IVHS education program gave rise to a number of unique difficulties during development and implementation in a traditional university setting. It is hoped that the UM experience in over-coming these hindrances will prove beneficial to any institution seeking to provide similar edu- cation. 912804. (P-253) Toward a Canadian IVHS program. E. Ryer- son Case, Ministry of Transportation Ontario ; Pierre La Fon- taine, Ministère des Transports Québec ; R. Lewis Sabounghi, Transport Canada; and Touko A. Parviainen, Parviainen and Associates. In Canada, a national intelligent vehicle-highway system (IVHS) - or road transport informatics (RTI) or advanced tele- matics in road transport (ATRT) - program is under active development at present. To reach this stage, many parallel activi- ties had to be pursued, particularly over the past four years. These have included research and demonstration projects on freeway traffic management systems and commercial fleet applications, state-of-the-art reviews of mobile systems technologies - and two major conferences, one on vehicle navigation and information systems, the other on automatic vehicle identification. This paper recalls some of the main events and progress made over this period and outlines current work in identifying Canadian involvement in the IVHS field. It is an update on a paper pres- ented at the RTI/IVHS Conference of 24th ISATA (Florence, Italy, 20-24 May 1991) bringing into focus the most recent devel- opments. 912805.

The MTC services as a traffic operations service center and an IVHS test facility. The MTC facility now under construction and the functions to be performed within the MTC will be described. The infrastructure being developed to expand the existing traffic management in the Detroit Metropolitan area and the test-bed program will be described. Specific emphasis will be 302</page><page sequence="302">912805-912813 placed on describing the first project of the testbed in which both the public and private sectors will be able to participate in the evaluation of various surveillance technologies and in-car com- munications. Initial efforts will address the "low end" users com- munity by testing multiple incident detection and management techniques. The information learned will then be conveyed to the vehicles through several communications approaches, which also will be evaluated. 912806. (P-253) Federal radionavigation policy and the land transportation user. David L. Olsen , U.S. Dept. of Transportation. Intelligent vehicle/highway systems (IVHS) have been devel- oped using dead-reckoning map-matching navigators, but increasing consideration is being given to the use of radionaviga- tion systems such as Loran-C and the global positioning system (GPS). The use of GPS receivers in IVHS appications is becom- ing more attractive as the system nears its expected 1993 opera- tional status and as the cost of receivers continues to drop. Other terrestrial applications are beyond the development stage, partic- ularly in the area of automatic vehicle location and monitoring where the use of radionavigation systems has experienced tre- mendous growth. The federal radionavigation planning process could have sig- nificant impact upon IVHS development. The Department of Transportation's navigation council formulates radionavigation system policy recommendations in concert with the Department of Defense, and the resulting policy is published in biennial edi- tions of the federal radionavigation plan (FRP). Increasing emphasis is being given in the FRP to terrestrial applications, and the DOT navigation council is being expanded to afford full rep- resentation to the modal administrations having responsibility for land transportation. 912808. (P-253) Integration of GPS and dead-reckoning navi- gation systems. Wei-Wen Kao, Technology and Information Div., ZEXEL USA Corp. Recent developments of the second generation automotive navigation and route guidance systems have posed more restric- tive requirements for vehicle positioning accuracy. Only after accurate current vehicle locations are available can appropriate maneuver instructions be generated from the route guidance algorithm. Dead-reckoning systems and GPS are two commonly used techniques for vehicle navigation systems. While both methods suffer from different drawbacks, superior performance can be obtained by combining these two techniques. In this paper we present a vehicle positioning system that integrates both the GPS and the dead-reckoning method. This system uses the GPS signals to adaptively calibrate the dead-reckoning sensors as well as to "rescue" the system from unexpected position errors. On the other hand, the dead-reckoning method, through the use of map-matching algorithm, provides feedbacks for calibrating the GPS position errors. Experimental results using the Zexel Nav- Mate Navigation and Route Guidance System demonstrate the effectiveness of the integrated positioning system. 912809. (P-253) Evaluation of location system combining a GPS receiver with interial sensor. Hiroaki Tsuji, Hiroyuki Maeda, Akihito Shibata, and Fuminori Morisue, Matsushita Communication Industrial Co., Ltd. Of primary importance in vehicle navigation systems is the accurate determination of location. Through use of distance sen- sor, optical-fiber gyroscope, map-matching technique, and GPS receiver to reduce accumulated errors, we are improving location accuracy. The model we demonstrated in our March 1991 field test showed good results on three courses of the 10 recommended by the Public Works Research Institute (10km in an urban area, and 20 and 50km in the suburbs). Additionally, our model displayed two superior strengths: neither the initial location or direction of a vehicle needs to be set; and conventional map data (not 100% accurate) may be utilized. This paper describes the results of our experimental demon- stration and how to combine a GPS receiver and inertial sensor. 912810. (P-253) Development of advanced dynamic navigation system. Kunihiko Mitoh and Nobuo Yumoto, Sumitomo Electric Industries, Ltd. The dynamic navigation system is an information providing type navigation and route guidance system. Fundamentally the system is suited for phased implementation. Some measures, however, must be taken in advance to enhance it to the advanced phase. For these measures, information providing data formats, travel time collection methods and small-delay system architec- ture have been studied. As a result, the flexible data composition for information provision, the on-board travel time measure- ment for efficient and accurate data collection and the autono- mous communication network concept called 'HYPO NET' have been proposed. 912811. (P-253) Assessing the acceptability of IVHS: some preliminary results. Cyrus Yoakam and Robert W. Marans, Uni- versity of Michigan. While much of the current research on intelligent vehicle high- way systems (IVHS) focuses on its technological aspects and eco- nomic benefits, little consideration is being given to the potential non-economic benefits of IVHS to individuals and society and the related issue of acceptability of the system among various user groups. Three stages of research dealing with the non-economic bene- fits of IVHS and user acceptance are discussed. Next, the results of a recently completed survey exploring these topics are reviewed. Survey findings cover the potential usefulness of vari- ous traffic advisories and the willingness of drivers to pay for them. Sentiments of drivers experiencing varying degrees of traf- fic congestion and stress in their commuting are considered as are feelings about IVHS as a solution to traffic congestion. Finally, implications of findings and directions for future research on user acceptance and non-economic benefits are discussed. 912813. (P-253) Effect of traffic reports on commuters' route and departure time changes. Asad J. Khattak, Joseph L. Schofer, and Frank S. Koppelman, Northwestern Univ. Considerable public and private resources are devoted to the collection and dissemination of real-time traffic information in the Chicago area. Such information is intended to help drivers make more informed trip decisions, yet its effect on driver behav- ior remains largely unexplored. This study was conducted to eval- uate the effect of traffic reports on route and departure time changes. Downtown Chicago automobile commuters were surveyed during the AM peak period by giving them mail-back question- naires. Drivers indicated whether or not they had changed their route and departure time decisions based on traffic reports. Fur- ther, drivers indicated how they perceived the traffic information system in terms of key attributes. Respondents also evaluated suggested improvements to the traffic information system. A majority (more than 60%) of drivers reported that they used traffic reports for modifying their trip decisions. Drivers per- ceived radio traffic reports positively in terms of information sys- tem attributes. Commuters were more likely to use traffic reports for their route changes if they perceived traffic reports to be accu- rate and timely, frequently listened to traffic reports, perceived their regular route as congested, knew multiple alternate routes, were male and higher income. Drivers were more likely to change departure times if they perceived traffic reports to be accurate and relavant, frequently listened to traffic reports and perceived their regular route as congested. 303</page><page sequence="303">912813-912821 Drivers indicated a relatively lower level of overall satisfac- tion with traffic reports indicating the existence of opportunities for improvement. One promising improvement is near-term pre- diction of traffic conditions on congested and unreliable routes (where conditions may change rapidly). This is because: 1) driv- ers generally want to know the conditions at any given point (or link) along their route when they reach that point; 2) drivers would be able to make better and more informed judgements regarding their trip decisions due to reduced uncertainty of traffic conditions; and 3) the possibility that drivers may find traffic conditions significantly better or worse would be reduced. This would improve the credibility of radio traffic reports. 912814. (P-253) Supporting routines for modelling the traffic responsive features of the travtek system using integration. M. Vart Aer de, Dept. of Civil Engrg., Queen's Univ.; Mark K. Krage, General Motors Research Labs.; and E. R. Case, Ministry of Transportation of Ontario. The integration simulation model is being enhanced and applied at Queen's University, on behalf of General Motors Research Labs., as a tool to perform a dynamic traffic simulation study of the travtek route guidance experiment in Orlando, Flor- ida. While there were several different ways in which the integra- tion model itself was adapted, to be able to model the dynamic and route guidance features of the travtek system, this paper focuses specifically on describing the associated dynamic model- ling routines which needed to be modified and/or developed in order to generate the dynamic inputs to the integration model. The objective of this paper is to describe the need and role of these supporting routines and to illustrate that the quality of the travtek simulation study results are utlimately highly dependent on the capability of the supporting routines to properly generate the extensive dynamic input data that are required to properly utilize dynamic traffic simulation models such as integration. 912815. (P-253) An iterative routing/assignment method for anticipatory real-time route guidance. David E. Kaufman, Robert L. Smith, and Karl E. Wunderlich, Dept. of Industrial and Opera- tions Engrg., University of Michigan. Anticipatory route guidance in traffic networks is based on time-dependent fastest path calculation requiring forecasts of link travel time over a time horizon. These forecasts would be produced by a traffic assignment procedure, which must take into account the behavior of anticipatory vehicles seeking user- optimal route guidance. Thus a conceptual feedback loop occurs. We implement this feedback loop iteratively using simulation for the assignment phase. When the iteration terminates with a fixed- point assignment, user-optimality is achieved. We study the ben- efits accrued by individual anticipatory vehicles and the system as a whole, as a function of the proportion of vehicles which have anticipatory route guidance, i.e. the market penetration. We observe individual and system benefits at market penetrations up to 40% or higher. 912817. (P-253) A dynamical system model for traffic assign- ment in networks. Stéphane Lafortune and Raja Sengupta, Dept. of Electrical Engrg. and Computer Science, University of Michi- gan; and David E. Kaufman and Robert L. Smith, Dept. of Indus- trial and Operations Engrg., University of Michigan. We consider a traffic network subject to known time-varying demands between its origins and destinations. We model the net- work as a discrete-time dynamical system driven by these demands. The state of the system at each time epoch is defined in a way that avoids complete microscopic detail by grouping vehicles into platoons irrespective of origin node and time of entry to network. Moreover, the formulation contains no path enumeration. The control variables correspond to the assignment or routing of the platoons on downstream links at the nodes of the network. Impedance functions combined with link outflow functions are used to model link travel times in the state transi- tion function. This modeling approach allows for the study of the problem of dynamic traffic assignment in networks in the frame- work of the optimal control of dynamical systems. This work has applications to route guidance issues that arise in an intelligent vehicle highway systems (IVHS) environment. 912818. (P-253) A new route optimization algorithm for rapid decision support. James L. Bander, Tidewater Consultants, Inc.; and Chelsea C. White, University of Michigan. We describe a new heuristic search algorithm, interruptible A (IA), that we have implemented in a real-world decision aid for users of public transit. IA is appropriate for shortest path prob- lems where there is value to a suboptimal path returned quickly. We offer an example in which IA returns an optimal path in a sin- gle iteraction, and another where the algorithm finds a subopti- mal path quickly before converging to the optimal path. Two admissibility conditions are presented, along with empirical results indicating that IA is effective in both admissible and inad- missible cases. 912819. (P-253) TravTek . James H.

TravTek is a public sector -private sector program to demon- state an advanced driver information system in Orlando, Florida for a period of one year, beginning in January 1992. A total of one hundred rental and lease vehicles will be equipped with driver information systems, which will provide navigation, route selec- tion and guidance, real-time traffic information, local informa- tion, and cellular phone service. The vehicle electronics include a modified production color CRT with a 5x5 matrix touch screen for information display and entry; a combined dead reckoning and global positioning satellite (GPS) navigation system; a spe- cial mobile radio system for sending travel times and status infor- mation to the traffic management center (TMC) and receiving real-time traffic and event information from the TMC; a com- puter for computing shortest travel time routes based on real- time traffic information; and a synthesized voice system for pro- viding traffic and route guidance information. Existing software modules were modified to provide the navigation and route selection functions while other modules were developed to imple- ment the driver interface control functions, the interface menu and guidance displays (both visual and voice), etc. A significant design and test effort went into ensuring that the system is easy to use and understand and that attentional demand while driving is kept to a minimum. Also, special care was taken to retain the original appearance of the production vehicle without sacrificing existing vehicle functionality. Information on driver interactions with the system will be logged on a removable hard drive for later analysis. 912821. (P-253) Human factors engineering the travtek driver interface. Janeth T.

The three major elements of TravTek are the TravTek Infor- mation and Services Center (TISC), the TravTek vehicles and the Traffic Management Center (TMC). The Federal Highway Administration (FHWA) has issued a contract to design and implement the TMC and a network of agencies and companies that will supply traffic information and data. These sources of information and the TravTek vehicles are known as the Traffic Information Network (TIN). The TIN sends this information to the TMC which combines and processes it to generate reports in a process known as data fusion. Historical data and operator- entered information are also included in the data fusion process to generate the various status, incident, and link data reports. The TMC facilitates and pursues incident and congestion confirma- tion and clearance information from the TIN sources, fuses the information and provides it in the form of a computerized report to various users. Only data pertaining to link travel times and confirmed incidents or congestion are provided to the TravTek vehicles and to other end users. 912823. (P-253) TravTek information and services center.

The objectives of the TravTek project are to: 1) explore the feasiblity of ADIS and their acceptability to drivers; 2) determine whether advanced driver information system (ADIS) can improve utilization of the highway system, increase safety, improve travel time, and reduce fuel consumption; and 3) gain insights into how to build the next generation of ADIS. The TravTek vehicle equipment will be installed in 100 Gen- eral Motors 1992 Oldsmobile Toronados. Seventy-five or more of these automobiles will be dedicated for daily rental to travelers while the remaining vehicles will be leased to high mileage local drivers. The TravTek demonstration projects consists of three princi- pal subsystems: 1) in-vehicle system -the system in the vehicle which provides the driver with routing and other travel informa- tion. The in -vehicle system development is the responsibility of General Motors; 2) traffic management center (TMC) -collects data concerning traffic conditions from various state and munici- pal agencies, including TravTek vehicles, and then transmits this information back to the car's in-vehicle system. The TMC is the responsibility of the FHWA, Florida DOT, and the City of Orlando; and 3) TravTek information and services center (TISC) -the TravTek information and services center will support day- to-day operations of the TravTek experiment. The TISC is the responsibility of AAA. 912824. (P-253) Simulating the travtek route guidance logic using the integration traffic model. L. R. Rilett, M. Van Aerde, and G. MacKinnon, Dept. of Civil Engrg., Queen's Univ.; and Mark K. Krage, General Motors Research Labs. The first phase of the travtek IVHS experiment will involve the use of in-vehicle route guidance systems (RGS) to determine the best routes through the greater Orlando area. These routes will be computed in a distributive fashion based on minute-to- minute travel time updates that are provided by a central traffic management center (TMC). This paper describes the most important traffic engineering aspects of the data fusion, dissemi- nation, and in-vehicle processing of the travtek system with the intent of demonstrating how the features of each of these steps can be modelled within the travtek version of the integration traf- fic simulation model. The simulation of these system features is initially intended to assist in developing appropriate TMC and in-vehicle unit sys- tem control settings, and to determine the sensitivity of the bene- fit estimates to alternate parameter settings or system configura- tions. The integration simulation model will subsequently also be utilized to simulate and explore any level of market penetration traffic effects, as well as the transferability of the travtek results to other networks and/or different demand patterns. 912825. (P-253) Datatrak automatic vehicle location system in operational use in the UK. K. M. Banks, Datatrak Ltd. The Datatrak AVLS and position reporting system has now been in commercial use in the United Kingdom for over two years and now covers virtually the whole of England and the industrial areas of Wales and Scotland. All aspects of the system have proved to be extremely reliable and the provision of a high degree of redundancy has contributed to virtually 100% availabil- ity at all times. The system utilises a dedicated low frequency hyperbolic radio system for location and a unique data network for position reporting. Special software has been written to make full use of the position data received. The demand for the system is growing rapidly in the UK; there is now a wide range of users and several thousand vehicles have been euqipped. Some principle applications are described and these show that the cost savings resulting from the use of the sys- tem have become an important and significant selling factor. 912826. (P-253) Fleet management trials in western Canada. James F. McLellan, Edward J. Krakiwsky, David R. Huff, Ellen L. Kitagawa, and Michael R. Gervais, Div. of Nowsco, Pulsearch Navigation Systems. The purpose of this paper is to describe the components of a fleet management system and the preliminary findings of two demonstration projects. Being Canadian based, the paper opens with an overview of the Canadian road-vehicle system. Statistics are given for the road network and the estimated numbers of vari- ous types of vehicles. The Canadian vision 2000 initiative, which is being spear headed by communications Canada, and cosists of approximately 50 communications related companies working in various consortiums, is briefly described. A western Canadian consortia, consisting of a communications manufacturer, a sys- tems integrator and two carriers, are carrying out various demon- stration projects over the next three years. The first project dis- cussed is an assessment of current Canadian digital mapping data for the application of vehicle navigation systems and the second is a test with the Calgary Police Department using Pulsearch's NavTrax™ fleet management system in five vehicles. Some con- clusions based on experience to date conclude the paper. 912828. (P-253) IVHS applications in Australia. Donald J. Howie, Don Howie and Associates ; and Andrew N. Garrett, Vicroads. This paper briefly describes some IVHS initiatives in Austra- lia and assesses the prospects for further developments. Two major activities in the IVHS area are reviewed: 1) a tech- nology agreement between the state road authority (VicRoads) and the national telecommunications (telecom) provider to develop vehicle location monitoring technologies for road man- agement in Melbourne called transport information and manage- ment system (TRIMS); and 2) the application of a low cost tech- nology, which is complementary to ATC systems, to capture data about the performance of public buses on arterial roads in Syd- ney. The technology is called the arterial network travel time sys- tem (ANTTS). 305</page><page sequence="305">912828-912835 These projects promise to deliver cost effective systems for the capture and management of road use data which can help to improve the operation of traffic control systems, introduce selec- tive vehicle priority strategies such as signal preemption for buses, provide passenger information displays and collect infor- mation for planning purposes. 912829. (P-253) Recent progress for intelligent vehicle/ highway system development in Taiwan. Huey-Kuo Chen , National Central Univ.; and Chi-Hong Ho and Chi-Kang Lee, National Cheng-Kung Univ. As one of the newly industrialized countries, Taiwan is mov- ing rapidly toward modernization. Accompanying this high eco- nomic growth rate are serious traffic problems. Unfortunately, traditional TSM strategies do not help a lot, and a more advanced traffic management system, which is referred to as IVHS, is thus necessitated. A general description about recent progress for IVHS development in Taiwan is presented. Seven relevant research areas and/or significant on-going transportation projects are included. Based on the understanding of our research capabil- ity, four intercorrelated IVHS projects are suggested in the future research directions. 912830. (P-253) Savety evaluation of TravTek .August L. Bur - gett, National Highway Traffic Safety Administration. The statement of national transportation policy issued by President Bush and Secretary Skinner last year points out that "innovation and technological advances within the transporta- tion field will be vital to ensure that the system can meet the Nation's transportation requirements for the 21st century." Travtek, a major intelligent vehicle/highway system (IVHS) advanced motorist information demonstration program in the United States, provides an example of just such innovation. The travtek program focuses on the navigation and route-guidance needs of out-of-town visitors and utilizes a fleet of specially equipped rental cars as the test bed for the advanced technologies to be evaluated. One of the goals of the travtek program is to eval- uate the potential for, and identify needed enhancements for, increased safety of advanced route-guidance projects. This paper discusses the tools that will be used and the meth- odologies that will be developed to provide the safety component of the evaluation of travtek. The evaluation will include the development and application of methodologies for addressing driver/vehicle interaction considerations, collision experience, and the relationship between congestion and collisions. 912831. (P-253) Research and evaluation plans for the Trav- Tek IVHS operational field test .Rebecca N. Fleischman, General Motors Research Labs. Travtek is a joint public sector/private sector operational field test of an advanced driver information and traffic management system. The year-long project will be operational in the greater Orlando area in 1992. In addition to the demonstration of navi- gation and traffic management technology, a major goal of trav- tek is to evaluate project objectives and answer questions about driver behavior. The data collected will be used to examine sys- tem benefits and cost in a fully deployed system. The foci of this paper are 1) the concept of travtek as a person-machine system; 2) the process of planning a comprehensive research program; and 3) an overview of the planned evaluation approaches. Although the travtek evaluation will not be completed until after 1992, it is hoped that this status report will assist in the research planning efforts of future intelligent vehicle highway system (IVHS)/advanced driver information system (ADIS) demonstra- tions. 912832. (P-253) Benefits of dynamic route guidance systems as part of a future oriented city traffic management system. JiirgM. Sparmann, S NV Studiengesellschaft Nahverkerh. In order to better cope with the future needs of traffic manage- ment systems an advanced route guidance and information sys- tem called LISB has been introduced and tested in the city of Ber- lin (west). Infrared transmitters and receivers (beacons) are located at intersections of the main road network transmitting route recommendations to specially equipped vehicles. These vehicles measure their travel times per road section and transmit them via beacons to a central route guidance computer. Based on actual travel times, the central computer calculates the quickest routes in the network. These routes are indicated visually and audibly to the drivers, guiding them to their destinations, taking into account the actual and short-term predicted traffic situation. Within a large-scale field experiment the system's perfor- mance, acceptance by the drivers, and benefits for the users as well as for the municipality have been investigated. The final results and a way of incorporating indivudal traffic control sys- tems into traffic management systems will be presented in the fol- lowing paper. 912833. (P-253) Reliability of real-time information systems for route choice decisions in a congested traffic network: some simulation experiments. Peter Shen-Te Chen and Hani S. Mah- massoni, Dept. of Civil Engrg., University of Texas at Austin. This paper investigates the reliability of information on pre- vailing trip times on the links of a network as a basis for route choice decisions by individual drivers. It considers a type of information strategy where no attempt is shade by some central controller or coordinating entity to predict what the travel times on each link would be by the time it is reached by a driver that is presently at a given location. A specially modified model com- bining traffic simulation and path assignment capabilities is used to analyze the reliability of the real-time information supplied to the drivers. This is accomplished by comparing the supplied travel times (at the link and path levels) to the actual trip times experienced in the network after the information has been given. Results of a series of simulation experiments under recurrent congestion conditions are discussed, illustrating the interactions between information reliability and user response. 912834. (P-253) Dynamic network modelling of travel guid- ance impacts. Bruce N. Janson, Dept. of Civil Engrg., University of Colorado at Denver. This paper describes network modelling of travel guidance impacts using combined dynamic distribution and assignment (CDDA) in which a subset of area motorists are provided real- time directives as to destination, route, and departure time deci- sions. Examples illustrate potential magnitudes of system-wide impacts, including travel time and fuel consumption, achieved by different percentages of motorists given directives aimed at improving user equalibrium conditions. Travel guidance regard- ing modal choice is not included in this paper, although that extension is similar to other network models. Results are given for a Pittsburgh network in which freeway lanes are partially blocked during rush hour due to a truck accident. Indications are that significant reductions in system-wide impacts can be achieved by guiding a subset of area motorists to specific travel choices based on real-time information. Future research issues are types, amounts, and locations of real-time data needed to pro- vide reliable travel guidance, and the relative impacts of in- vehicle versus point-of-departure travel guidance systems. 912835. (P-253) Effectiveness of in-vehicle navigation systems in alleviating non-recurring congestion. David E. Boyce, Univer- sity of Illinois at Chicago ; and Abolhassan Halati, California State Polytechnic Univ. The effectiveness of in-vehicle navigation systems in alleviat- ing non-recurrent congestions is examined. Computer simulation modeling is used to assess the effectiveness of four different types of navigation systems consisting of static map, dynamic map, route guidance and advanced route guidance systems. The study 306</page><page sequence="306">912835-912841 is conducted for the Irvine network, Orange County, California. The results of the study shows that the performance of descriptive in-vehicle navigation systems (static map and dynamic map) is dependent on the initial network flow conditions and could lead to severe worsening of traffic condition. The prescriptive systems (route guidance and advanced route guidance) could substan- tially improve the traffic situation; the performance of these sys- tems is depenent on the level of market penetration, i.e. the frac- tion of drivers equipped with the navigation system. The appro- priate level for the Irvin network is shown to be 30% or more. 912836. (P-253) The generation of synthetic O-D demands from real-time vehicle probe data: potential and limitations. M. VanAerde, G. MacKinnon , andB. Hellinga, Dept. of Civil Engrg., Queen's Univ. The provision of two-way communications betwen the central traffic control center and all vehicles, which are equipped with route guidance systems (RGS), makes it possible to assemble very efficiently a continuous estimate of the prevailing dynamic or time-varying O-D (origin-destination) matrix. This paper describes the mathematics of a four step procedure for developing such a time varying O-D matrix from vehicle probe data and dis- cusses the important statistical limitations of the final O-D esti- mates. It is shown that, unless there is a very high level of market pen- etration in the network, the resulting O-D estimate will contain such a high level of statistical uncertainty as to render it of limited practical value. Consequently, it is anticipated that the resulting O-D estimate will even in the long term not be unsuitable to be utilized on its own, and that instead this estimate will always need to be further processed as a seed solution matrix for a subse- quent dynamic synthetic O-D generation analysis. 912837. (P-253) Scenarios and communications system archi- tectures for integrated RTI/IVHS applications. Ian Catling and Michael Bell, Ian Catling Consultancy, Ltd.; Chris Lohfink, Dor • nier; and Jurgen Kossack, Siemens. The drive project TARDIS (traffic and roads -drive inte- grated systems) has as its main objective the specification of func- tional requirements of an integrated road transport environment (IRTE), in order to provide a common framework for technical developments in which the different system operating philoso- phies in different countries can still be embodied. A framework has been developed for assessing various com- munication system architectures into which the following IRTE/ IVHS applications can be integrated: dynamic route guidance; advanced traffic control; parking management and information; public transport management and information; fleet manage- ment; tourist information; and automatic debiting. Within this framework a simulation model has been devel- oped which allows the analysis of the communications infrastruc- ture necessary to support a particular scenario for integration. The broadly-based TARDIS consortium, which includes national highway authorities, government research organisa- tions, automotive manufacturers, electronics industry and con- sultancies, developed a number of integration scenarios for anal- ysis, taking into account the administrative, commercial, practi- cal and technical viability of their implementation. The scenarios have been developed in liaison with prelimi- nary work on the pilot projects expected to form the base of the successor programme to drive, as the results of the scenario anal- ysis as anticipated to form a major input to the development of the pilot projects. The paper describes the simulation techniques developed within TARDIS and presents the scenarios being analysed, together with some results of the analysis and conclusions about the concept of the IRTE. 912838. (P-253) Sketch of an IVHS systems architecture. Pravin Varaiya, University of California, Berkeley ; and Steven E. Shladover, University of California. The development of a robust, unified systems architecture is an important problem in IVHS technology. This paper presents a sketch of a general architectural framework within which IVHS systems can carry out a wide range of management and control functions. The most important aspect of the work reported here is the definition of two parallel and compatible architectures suit- able in the first case for ATMS and ATIS functions, where the driver controls the vehicle, and in the second case for AVCS func- tions, where the vehicle is under automatic control. 912839. (P-253) Integrated communications architecture for road transport informatics. Ghassan Freij, Philips Brussels; Carl Rokitansky, RWTH University Aachen Germany ; Nigel Wall, BT Labs. Ipswich ; and Fred Zijderhand, Philips Research Labs. Eind- hoven. The field of road transport informatics (RTI) has spurred a substantial interest in the development and adaptation of a diverse range of technologies for vehicle-infrastructure commu- nications. Candidate technologies for early implementation include FM RDS-TMC, short-range beacons and cellular mobile radio GSM. This paper reviews some of the major characteristics of these systems and debates some of the issues influencing the design and integration of communications technologies for RTI. Next, a possible integration framework which essentially acts to decouple RTI applications from communications networks is described. The aim is to facilitate end-to-end communications between any two application systems which need to communi- cate, regardless of the network to which each is attached. This concept leads to the notion of a virtual RTI network and is cur- rently under investigation to determine its viability and applica- bility. 912840. (P-253) European cooperation on dual mode route guidance - Perspectives for advanced research partners. Michel Muffat, Peter Geen, and Sabine Crosnier, Advanced Research Partners. Dual mode route guidance (DMRG) is a concept which aims to combine "individual" route guidance (i.e. using on-board route calculation) and "collective" route guidance (i.e. using infrastructure-based route calculation) into one single system. Because these two kinds of systems are based on competing philosophies addressing different social issues (individual control versus collective control), tremendous work has to be carried out before integration. The European automotive industry, in coop- eration with E&amp;S, has decided to concentrate efforts - within the frame of the PROMETHEUS programme and the DRIVE initiative -in order to turn the DMRG concept into a product before the end of the century. 912841. (P-253) A report on the TRB IVHS communication standards workshop. E. Ryerson Case, Ministry of Transporta- tion Ontario; Min I. Chung, AT&amp;T Bell Labs.; Robert L. French, R.L. French and Associates; and Philip J. Tarnoff Farradyne Sys- tems. A major impediment to the widespread implementation of intelligent vehicle highway systems (IVHS) is the absence of com- munications standards, particularly for mobile applications. The communications committee of the Transportation Research Board (TRB) sponsored a communications workshop in June 1990 to address this problem. The workshop was attended by rep- resentatives from all levels of government, consultants, universi- ties and industry from the United States, Canada, Europe, and Japan. Working groups were established to address specific issues, including research requirements, international compati- bility, commonality and interoperability, content and format, and processes for developing standards. Problem statements gen- 307</page><page sequence="307">912841-912854 erated by the working groups formed the basis for recommended action. This paper presents a report on the workshop by the editors of TRB Transportation Research circular "recommendations for establishing intelligent vehicle highway systems (IVHS) commu- nications standards" to be published in the near future which contains a comprehensive record of the entire proceedings. 912843. (P-253) Multiservice communications plants for long tunnels. Alessandro Coraiola and Giorgio Brambilla, SIRTI S.p.A. The present paper describes telecommunication plants for tunnels, which can support multiple services in a wide frequency range of VHF and UHF bands. The illustrated systems have a structure employing such tech- niques as "grading" and signal optical transport, in order to reduce the number of line amplifiers per unit of tunnel length and the amplifier powers. 912844. (P-253) A communications architecture concept for ATIS. Marlin P. Ristenbatt, University of Michigan. Three recent developments suggest cost-beneficial approaches to communications for advanced traveler information systems (ATIS): 1) the use of FM subcarrier for efficient paging-type (digi- tal) one-way broadcast, along with the upcoming introduction of radio data system (RDS) vehicle receivers, 2) the rapidly growing use of RF "tags" for automatic tolling, which have recently been upgraded for discrete zone two-way communication, and 3) the "signal processing gain" and "demand access" capability of spread -spectrum-type coding, which together make event-driven communications more feasible and cost-beneficial. An architecture concept exploiting these thrusts is outlined in terms of a "baseline" and a higher level ATIS. The baseline emphasizes basic traffic exception and safety messages and sup- ports higher level (optional) services such as navigators and in- vehicle route guidance computers. The baseline portion empha- sizes minimum cost; overall the level-of-service choices of both the consumer and the traffic manager are maximized. 912846. (P-253) The enhanced AVI and its CVO applications. R. Lewis Sabounghi, Transport Canada. When the automatic vehicle identification concept (AVI) started it was simply an electronic tag. Today with a two-way communication capability, program m ability and intelligence it has graduated to a full fledged close-range road/vehicle commu- nication system (CRCS). Its applications are numerous: from vehicle identification and location, two-way vehicle communica- tion, to fleet management. This paper is one of a series of comple- mentary papers that cover the enhanced AVI system/CRCS con- cept and describe a number of the different applications of this low cost, high impact technology that is revolutionizing the road transportation system. Certain sections are common to all papers and form the background to the core of each of the papers. This paper in particular gives an overall view of the CRCS concept and concentrates on applications to the commercial vehicle operations. 912847. (P-253) Advances in praticai implementation of AVI systems. Alfred R. Koelle, Technology Div., Amtech Systems Corp. Electronic toll collection with reflective automatic vehicle identification (AVI) tags in the vehicle windshield is a commer- cial reality, with proven reliability and cost effectiveness. Reflec- tive tag technology enhances the selectivity for reading only the closest of several tags in the reader's field, as well as reducing tag complexity and cost. The advantages of reflective tag technology can be retained for the vehicle-to-roadside radio link of IVHS with a simple ASK radio link used for roadside-to-vehicle transmissions. System capability and reliability could be improved with the IVHS antenna designed into the vehicle structure. Usable vehicle speed and required RF power trade off against message lenght, making it necessary to use message data bits as efficiently as possible. 912848. (P-253) IVHS applications of smart cards. Mark R. Komanecky and David M. Claus, AT&amp;T Bell Labs. The smart card, which is commonly understood to be an inte- grated circuit-based, credit card -sized portable data carrier, is fast becoming a preferred medium for present and future intelligent vehicle/highway system (IVHS) applications. Its compact size and computer functionality make it appealing for driver informa- tion, fleet management, and traffic management applications. Smart Cars are currently used in an IVHS application, namely, in an electronic toll and traffic management (ETTM) system with automatic vehicle identification (AVI). This system utilizies the smart car for secure automated payment of tolls via a two-way RF link between a toll plaza and an in-vehicle unit which con- tains the card. As a result of surging customer interest, additional ETTM vendors are considering the use of the smart cards for their systems. Other applications of a smart card-based AVI system include vehicle speed calculation for measuring traffic flow, fleet manage- ment (i.e., rental car entry/exit), and various traveler information services. A smart card may also be used for logging of vehicle maintenance records, thus providing a higher level of customer service for vehicle owners. Another application is advanced vehi- cle diagnostics, where critical data could be stored on the card at the touch of a fingertip in order to more easily diagnose intermit- tent vehicle problems. Further, a smart card could be used for data storage in tracking and measuring driver and vehicle behav- ior for fleet management applications. Undoubtedly, new IVHS applications of smart cards will continue to evolve into the 21st century. 912850. (P-253) Automatic vehicle identification on busy multi-lane city roads. M. A. Do, J. T. Ong, C. H. Chang, T. H. Ooi, and D. Mital, School of Electrical and Electronic Engrg., Nany- ang Technological Univ. The problems of using existing automatic vehicle identifica- tion (AVI) systems for detection of vehicles on the busy city roads arise because physical barriers between lanes in the city toll sites are not desirable, while the traffic does not always comply with the lane disciplines. A new AVI system is described in this paper using the randomised time division multiplexing (TDM) tech- nique for detecting several vehicles simultaneously entering the detection zone. Laboratory experiments carried out for up to 8 identification tags at the same time showed that all replies were detected for 900 interrogations. The collision of replying signals did not occur. The high speed transmission of serial data has, however, an error rate of 3%-7%. Under the laboratory condi- tions, the detection errors were eliminated simply by allowing the tags to reply twice. 912852. (P-253) Intelligent driving - Prometheus approaches to longitudinal traffic flow control. Xiwen Zhang, Steierwald Schönharting und Partner. In the main phase of the European research program Prome- theus, a series of innovative traffic information and control sys- tems has been defined and specified. The present paper deals with Prometheus systems supporting longitudinal traffic flow control. The traffic control strategies of these systems are described and their effects on the overall traffic conditions are depicted based on an ad-hoc assessment and a simulation case study. 912854. (P-253) Quantitative characterization of the vehicle motion environment (VME). Robert D. Ervin and C. C. Mac - Adam, University of Michigan, Transportation Research Insti - 308</page><page sequence="308">912854-912862 tute; and R. Kent Gilbert and Peter T chory k} Jr., Environmental Research Institute of Michigan. A concept is presented for creating a measurement system that can quantify the specific motions which vehicles exhibit as they move in traffic, under the full array of traffic operations. Such quantification is seen as crucial to the development of automatic collision prevention systems and has spin-off utility for the study of many other issues in human factors and vehicle and highway engineering. This study has addressed the experimental and ana- lytical challenges involved in wide-area sensing, large-volume data processing, and both deterministic and statistical analyses of the data which will characterize this so-called, "vehicle motion environment" (VME). The basic concept which appears to be fea- sible for such measurements involves a remote sensor which is installed at the roadside, probably on a tall pole, and which pro- duces electro-optic images of the traffic stream and converts them into a permanent data file of the quantified trajectory for each motor vehicle passing through the field of view. The paper covers the performance specifications for the VME measurement system plus considerations for the measurement package and the subsequent processing needed for deriving the variables of interest. Various applications of the VME system are also addressed. 912855. (P-253) Can road transport informatics help vulnera- ble road users. O. M. J. Carsten, Institute for Transport Studies, University of Leeds. Road transport informatics (RTI) systems for improving the vehicular traffic situation are often aimed at increasing capacities and reducing travel times on urban roads. Such measures may well have severe disbenefits for vulnerable road users in that they are likely to increase vehicle speeds. A small increase in average vehicle speed would result in quite large increases in fatalities and injuries to vulnerable road users. It would also have the effect of making walking and cycling more difficult -for example pedestri- ans would face increased crossing delays. There remains the alterantive of designing RTI systems specif- ically to enhance the mobility and safety of vulnerable road users. Yet even here there are a number of difficulties. In particular, it is difficult to conceive of applying systems to confront the prob- lem directly, e.g. by equipping cars with vulnerable road user (VRU) detection devices or to equip VRUs with devices that pro- vide advice in difficult situations. The in-car devices have the problem of predicting VRU behaviour (for example, when a pedestrian standing at the kerbs actually going to cross) and the VRU-carried devices are unlikely to be used on a wide scale in the foreseeable future. It therefore seems more fruitful to use RTI in a more indirect manner to enhance VRU safety and mobility. 912856. (P-253) Driver information systems: what's next. Christopher Querée, MVA Systematica. The paper provides an overview of some of the key technolog- ical issues and market constraints affecting the growth of driver information and navigation systems in the short to medium term. It covers trends in relevant technologies, generic markets for driver information systems, technical constraints on product development, issues affecting user demand, directions of growth, and identifies some key aspects for further analysis. Two particular issues are raised. The first relates to the need to treat driver information systems as subscriber services, and the other notes the expected entry of hand-held navigation and com- munication products to the market. 912857. (P-253) Surveying commuters to obtain functional requirements for the design of a graphics-based traffic informa- tion system. Woodrow Barfield, Mark Haselkorn, and Jan Spyri- dakis, University of Washington. The results of three studies, each designed to obtain functional requirements for the design of a graphics-based traveler informa- tion system, are reported. In the first study, the results of a survey are reviewed in which four commuter groups are identified with regard to the impact of traffic information on mode choice, departure time, and alternate route decisions. In the second study, the usability of five prototype traffic information screens are reported. In the last study, the results of a phone interview designed to provide an in-depth understanding of commuter traf- fic information needs is discussed. 912858. (P-253) Designing and implementing a PC-based, graphical, interactive, real-time advanced traveler information system that meets commuter needs. Mark Haselkorn, Woodrow Barfield, Jan Spyridakis, Brian Goble, and Margaret Garner, Uni- versity of Washington. We discuss the design and implementation of Traffic Reporter, a PC-based, graphical, interactive, real-time advanced traveler information system created to meet the information needs of Puget Sound area commuters. Traffic Reporter's goal is to influence commuter behavior and decision making so as to improve the efficiency with which commuters use available transportation facilities. This project began by studying commuter behavior and traffic needs in the Puget Sound area. We conducted extensive on-road surveys of Seattle motorists, with smaller, in-depth follow-up sur- veys. We identified four types of commuters, three of which are likely to respond to various types of traveler information. We then used this understanding of commuter behavior to design and develop a working prototype of Traffic Reporter. This paper describes the design and development of Traffic Reporter, how the current system works, and plans for future development. 912859. (P-253) An advanced traveler information system pro- viding real-time, location-specific on-demand traffic information. John P. Liebesny, SmartRoute Systems. A new, advanced driver information system, which provides real-time, location-specific, on-demand traffic information, has been developed and is in operation in Boston. It addresses all three areas of traffic data collection, data management and data dissemination in a fully vertically integrated system. Both "static data" (information about traffic that is known ahead of time such as construction projects) and real-time data are fed to an opera- tions center in Cambridge, Massachusetts. At this traffic informa- tion center, traffic managers, with the aid of computerized data- bases and mapping software, determine what information should be disseminated to the company's clients. Various automated mechanisms, such as interactive audiotext and broadcast fax, have been developed to disseminate efficiently the information to a wide variety of business clients and radio stations. Access to the information may be obtained via landline or cellular phone, corporate voice mail or E mail systems, direct fax or computer/ modem link. This system has been in development for the last three years, and will initially service the Boston metropolitan area. 912862. (P-253) An automatic network travel time system - ANTTS. John E. Longfoot, Traffic Control Section, Roads and Traffic Authority. Organizations responsible for road systems and the manage- ment of traffic, require comprehensive information concerning the traffic carrying performance of their networks. Link travel time is an essential parameter required to effectively pin-point trouble spots both for immediate use and for planning and report- ing purposes. Until recently, travel time has been measured on an ad hoc basis, usually manually by measuring travel time from a moving vehicle. 309</page><page sequence="309">912862-912869 The roads and traffic authority of New South Wales, Australia (RTA), decided that more reliable and comprehensive data was needed to fulfill its minimum requirements. A design and devel- opment program was put in place to evolve a system to provide the required data in the most economical way. The paper describes the alternatives considered and details the reasons for selection of the chosen technology. The ANTTS system elements are described and some results of a pilot study are presented. While ANTTS was designed primarily to do its main function well, its communication capability allows easy enhancement to cover other I VHS functions such as position specific incident and congestion information broadcasting. These proposed enhance- ments to the system are described. 912863. (P-253) Implementation of new traffic control systems - Problems and approaches to solutions. Heinz Zackor, Steierwald Schönharting und Partner. As a basis for understanding the technical and nontechnical problems of implementing new technology, some sets of systems have been developed. The main features are the level of interven- tion (information - recommendation - automatic intervention - automated driving) and the communciation link between roadside infrastructure and vehicle. An implementation checklist and a general implementation strategy have been derived and explained based on the discussion of problems. There is a noteworthy example demonstrating this develop- ment path: the project STORM - Stuttgart Transport Operation by Regional Management. 912864. (P-253) Development of a functional specification for an in-vehicle safety advisory and warning system (IVSAWS). Gregory L. May hew, Jason Erlichman, and Keith L. Shirley, Hughes Aircraft Co.; and Fritz Streff, University of Michigan, Transportation Research Institute. Intelligent vehicle highway system (IVHS) represents the application of information technology to improve the effective- ness of the existing road transportation system resulting in increased safety and better traffic management. In-vehicle safety advisory and warning systems (IVAWS) program is a Federal Highway Administration project to develop a system that pro- vides drivers with advance notification of roadway hazards. IVSAWS units will provide supplemental warnings in order to ameliorate hazardous scenarios (e.g., railroad grade crossings, slow moving vehicles) which are particularly hazardous and have remained hazardous despite traditional crash reduction tech- niques such as additional mechanical signing. Program aspects include hazard scenario identification, sys- tem architecture design, driver alert warning subsystem design, communication subsystem design, and proof of concept field testing. Highway safety data has been examined to determine which scenarios IVSAWS could benefit. Human factors issues and system cost goals determined system architecture. This paper discusses system architecture design to date. Development and evaluation of the driver interface is proceeding using simulators at General Motors Simulation Lab. 912865. (P-253) Signal preemption as a priority treatment tool for transit demand management. Snehamay Khasnabis, Gangula V. Reddy, and Bharat B. Chaudry, Wayne State Univ. The purpose of this paper is to present an analytic procedure for testing the feasibility of using signal pre-emption as a tool for transit demand management. Signal pre-emption is designed to reduce delays, thus resulting in reduced cycle time, reduced fleet size and reduced operating cost. Further, reduced travel time is likely to make the transit system more attractive, thus generating more ridership and higher revenue. A software PREEMPT was developed that can estimate driving times based upon higher speeds and can calculate the fleet size, operating costs, revenue, and revised demand. Using the data base from a recently com- pleted UMTA sponsored study, 3 transit sectors in the Detroit area were analyzed for base condition and various pre-emption scenarios, and the results are presented in this paper. 912866. (P-253) A role for VNIS in real-time control of signal- ized networks. S. Yagar, University of Waterloo ; and E. R. Case, Ministry of Transportation of Ontario. This paper discusses what signal control can do for VNIS as well as what VNIS can do for signal control, with emphasis on the latter. It discusses the implications of VNIS information for signal optimization. Specifically it evaluates VNIS as a catalyst for traffic control, estimating the contribution to real-time signal optimization provided by various levels of VNIS-equipped driv- ers. It recommends that studies be conducted to provide quantita- tive estimates of the practical utility of lead time in predicting time of arrival to a signalized intersection, and of contributions provided by a VNIS system as a function of density of VNIS bea- cons and percent of VNIS-equipped drivers. The value of VNIS information to traffic control, in conjunction with and as a replacement for fixed -location traffic detection can aid in the design of an utlimate VNIS system, and helps to justify costs that can be related and allocated to the various benefits that VNIS provides to the traffic control element. 912867. (P-253) A roadway information system for vehicle guidance/control. Wei Bin Zhang, Institute of Transportation Studies, University of California at Berkeley. This paper describes the principle of an intelligent roadway reference system (IRRS). It discusses both the sensing and com- munication capabilities of an IRRS. It then assesses the informa- tion capability of an IRRS, focusing on the ability for providing static information for an intelligent vehicle highway system (IVHS). This paper also investigates the information representa- tion methods and indicates that some of the static information needed for IVHS can be conveyed by an IRRS. 912868.

Engrg., University of California at Berkeley; and J. Olds, VORAD Systems, Inc. This paper presents results and analysis of experiments carried out on a vehicle platoon control system developed in the PATH program. The objective of this project is to assess the feasibility of applying currently available technology to the concept of vehi- cle platoon control. It is estimated that the vehicle platoon system could increase highway traffic capacity by a factor of two or three. The integrated platoon control system (IPCS) includes a control system, communication system, data acquisition system, and various sensors including a radar system. The initial experiments using two Ford cars showed successful results. In the field tests, the automated following vehicle successfully followed the manu- ally driven lead vehicle through several different kinds of maneu- vers. This project is a joint effort by U.C.Berkeley, Caltrans and VORAD, with vehicles provided by Ford. 912869. (P-253) Probability-based decision making for auto- mated highway driving. Axel Niehaus and Robert F. Stengel, Dept. of Mech. and Aerospace Engrg., Princeton Univ. Real-time, rule-based guidance systems for autonomous vehi- cles on limited-access highways are investigated. The goal of these systems is to plan trajectories that are safe while satisfying the driver's requests based on stochastic information about the 310</page><page sequence="310">912869-912894 vehicle state and the surrounding traffic. A rule-based system is used for high-level planning. Given a stochastic model of the traf- fic situation driven by current measurements, the probable evo- lution of traffic and the best trajectory to follow are predicted. Simulation results assess the impact of uncertain knowledge of traffic on the performance of the guidance system, showing that uncertainty can and must be taken into account. 912870. (P-253) The development of autonomously controlled vehicle, PVS. Akio Hosaka , Akira Takei, and Masaaki Taniguchi, Nissan Motor Co. Ltd.; and Kunihiko Kurami , Nissan Research and Development Inc. This paper describes an autonomously controlled vehicles which is equipped with two sensing modes, one employing cam- eras and the other ultrasonic detectors. In either mode the vehicle can move smoothly, along a white line on the road (camera mode) or along a guard rail (ultrasonic mode), avoiding obstacles on straightaways and turning corners at intersections. In the cam- era mode, the vehicle can travel at 60km/h along a straight road. 912871. (P-253) Neural network approaches for lateral control of autonomous highway vehicles. Alain L. Kornhauser, Princeton Univ. The research reported in this paper focuses on the automated steering aspects of intelligent highway vehicles. Proposed is a machine vision system for capturing driver views of the on- coming highway environment. The objective is to investigate various designs of artificial neural networks for processing the resulting images and generating acceptable steering commands for the vehicle. The research effort has involved the construction of a computer graphical simulation system, called the road machine, which is used as the experimental environment for ana- lyzing, through simulation, alternative neural network approaches for controlling autonomous highway vehicles. The road machine serves as both the training environment and the experimental testing environment for the autonomous highway vehicle. It is composed of five major modules: highway design, driver view simulation, image processing, neural network design and training, and autonomous driving simulation. Two types of neural network control structures are under active research, back- propagation and adaptive resonance. The road machine is writ- ten in C and operates on silicon graphics workstations using unix and the SGI graphics language. 912890. (P-251) History of safety research and development on the General Motors energy-absorbing steering system. John H. Horsch, David C. Viano, and James DeCou, Biomedical Science Dept., General Motors Research Labs. This paper covers the development of the General Motors energy absorbing steering system beginning with the work of the early crash injury pioneers Hugh DeHaven and Colonel John P. Stapp through developments and introduction of the General Motors energy absorbing steering system in 1966, evaluations of crash performance of the system, and further improvement in protective function of the steering assembly. The contributions of GM Research Laboratories are highlighted, including its safety research program, safety car, invertube, the biomechanic projects at Wayne State University, and the thoracic and abdominal toler- ance studies that lead to the development of the viscous injury criterion and self-aligning steering wheel. Also discussed are engi- neering efforts of the Saginaw Steering Gear and Oldsmobile Divisions, the extensive testing program at the GM Proving Ground, government interactions and regulations, and the field accident reports of the many lives saved by energy absorbing steering systems. 199 1 SAE Transactions Section 6 912891. (P-251) Thoracic deformation contours in frontal impact. Narayan Yoganandan and David Skrade, Dept. of Neuro- surgery, Medical College of Wisconsin ; Frank Pintar, Same; and John Reinartz, Frank A. Pintar, and Anthony Sanees, Jr., Dept. of Neurosurgery, Medical College of Wisconsin. The objective of the study was to document the thoracic defor- mation contours in a simulated frontal impact. Unembalmed human cadavers and the hybrid III anthropomorphic manikins were tested. Data from the newly developed external peripheral instrument for deformation measurement (EPIDM) was used to derive deformation patterns at upper and lower thoracic levels. Deceleration sled tests were conducted on three-point belt restrained surrogates positioned in the driver's seat (no steering assebmly) using a horizontal impact test sled at velocities of approximately 14.0 m/s. Lap and shoulder belt forces were recorded with seat belt transducers. The experimental protocol included a hybrid III manikin experiment followed by the human cadaver test. Both surrogates were studied under similar input and instrumentation conditions, and identical data acquisition and analysis procedures were used. All six tested cadavers demonstrated multiple bilateral rib fractures. In addition, clavicle and sternum fractures were found. In one case, lung and liver lacerations occurred in the region of rib fracture. The location, magnitude, and time of occurrence of the maximum chest deflection demonstrated differences between the two surrogates; the patterns of the thoracic deformation con- tour were also different. Regions of high local curvature/ deformation were identified in the human cadaver tissue. Maxi- mum chest deflections ranged from 2.7 to 13.0 cm at the upper level (ribs 2-4) and 2.5 to 12.3 cm at the lower level (ribs 6-8) in the cadaver. The corresponding chest deflections in the hybrid III manikin ranged from 3.3 to 6.7 cm and 2.9 to 5.7 cm at the upper and lower levels, respectively. The deflections recorded using the internal potentiometer ranged from 2.7 to 4.0 cm in the manikin. It can be concluded that the human cadavers in these tests exhibit greater regional differences and are more compliant in their tho- racic deformation characteristics than the hybrid III anthropo- morphic manikin. 912892. (P-251) Mathematical modeling of the hybrid III dummy chest with chest foam. King H. Yang, Dept. of Mech. Engrg., Wayne State Univ.; Hong Pan, Wayne State Univ.; and David Lasry and Rainer Hoffmann, Engineering Systems Inter- national. A nonlinear foam was added to a previously created three- dimensional finite element model of the hybrid III dummy chest which consisted of six steel ribs, rib damping material, the ster- num, a spine box and a pendulum. Two standard calibration pen- dulum impact tests for a hybrid III dummy chest were used to validate the new model. An explicit finite element analysis code PAM -CRASH was utilized to simulate the dynamic process. At impact velocities of 6.7 m/s and 4.3 m/s, the force and deflection time history as well as the force-deflection plots showed good agreement between model predictions and calibration data. Peak strains also agreed well with experimental data. 912894. (P-251) Hybrid III thoracic impact on self-aligning steering wheel by finite element analysis and mini-sled experi- ment. Tawfik B. Khalil and Kuang-Huei Lin, Engrg. Mechs. Dept., General Motors Research Labs. Current mathematical simulation of occupant impact and interactions with the vehicle interior, in the event of crash, is based on lumped mass-spring formulations. These models lack the fidelity to simulate structural deformations and to capture the detailed contact and interactions between the occupant and the impact targets. As a first step in improving the technology, we have developed a detailed three-dimensional finite element (FE) model which simulated thoracic impact on the steering wheel. The model con- 311</page><page sequence="311">912894-912900 sisted of hybrid III thorax, lumbar spine and self-aligning steering wheel. The model was developed using DYNA3D and repre- sented the dynamic large deformation response of the system by a combination of solid, beam and shell elements. Both elastic and viscoelastic material properties of various system components were experimentally identified and implemented in the model. Initially, the accuracy of the individual component was ascer- tained by comparisons with corresponding experimental data. The predicted midsagittal force-deformation response of the tho- rax from an impactor with initial velocities: 4.3 and 6.7 m/s, respectively followed closely corresponding corridors derived from dummy and human cadaver tests. Also, the elastic-plastic response of the self-aligning structure in the steering wheel was accurately captured, and compared favorably with test results. Then, the thoracic impact on the steering wheel was computed for three initial velocities: 6.9, 7.9 and 8.8 m/s. The predicted sys- tem kinematics and thoracic and wheel deformation and associ- ated force histories compared well with corresponding mini-sled tests. In addition, the model provided a unique capability for pre- dicting the evolution of the contact force between the thorax and the steering wheel. 1991 SAE Transactions Section 6 912895. (P-251) Thoracic injury assessment of belt restraint systems based on hybrid III chest compression. John H. Horsch, John W. M e lv in, and David C. Viano , Biomedical Science Dept., General Motors Research Labs.; and Harold J. Mertz, General Motors Corp. Measurement of chest compression is vital to properly assess- ing injury risk for restraint systems. It directly relates chest load- ing to the risk of serious or fatal compression injury for the vital organs protected by the rib cage. Other measures of loading such as spinal acceleration or total restraint load do not separate how much of the force is applied to the rib cage, shoulders, or lumbar and cervical spines. Hybrid III chest compression is biofidelic for blunt impact of the sternum, but is "stiff" for belt loading. In this study, an analysis was conducted of two published crash recon- struction studies involving belted occupants. This provides a basis for comparing occupant injury risks with hybrid III chest compression in similar exposures. Results from both data sources were similar and indicate that belt loading resulting in 40 mm hybrid III chest compression represents a 20-25% risk of an AIS^ 3 thoracic injury. 1991 SAE Transactions Section 6 912896. (P-251) A comparison of frontal and side impact: crash dynamics, co un te riti ea sure s and subsystem tests. Ian V. Lau , Biomedical Science Dept., General Motors Research Labs.; and John P. Capp and James A. Obermeyer, General Motors Corp. Frontal crashes and near-side crashes were compared and found to be significantly different events. In a frontal crash, the energy to be dissipated from the occupant is constant for a given speed. In a side crash, the energy transferred to a struck-side occu- pant depends highly on his interaction with the door. That differ- ence has important implications on the choice of countermea- sures, injury criteria, and subsystem tests. In a front crash, chest and abdominal injuries occur in the "second" impact when the occupant, acting like a free-flight mass, strikes the interior. Pad- ding can absorb some of the free-flight energy, reduce the impact force, and provide earlier and longer contact of the occupant with the interior. The earlier contact decreases the differential velocity of the occupant to the interior, and the longer contact allows more time and greater distance to dissipate the kinetic energy. These improved energy management effects are reflected by lower deflection-based and acceleration-based chest injury criteria in a frontal crash test when padding is added. In a side impact, chest and abdominal injuries occur when the stationary occupant is "punched" by the enroaching door. Padding also pro- vides an earlier and a longer contact of the occupant with the encroaching door, which prolongs the side impact punch. The prolonged punch can actually increase the net energy transferred from the door to the occupant, which may be reflected by higher deflection-based chest injury criteria. Despite the greater energy transfer, padding actually reduces acceleration-based injury criti- era, such as TTI(d), in the same side impact crash test. Tradi- tional subsystem tests, such as sled or pendulum tests, can mimic most effects on an occupant of a frontal crash, but they cannot mimic many essential characteristics of a side crash. 1991 SAE Transactions Section 6 912897. (P-251) About the threshold for fatal or potentially fatal injuries in car-to-car side collisions - A comparison between real accidents and PMHS-tests. E. Miltner, Dimitrios Kallieris, K. P. Wiedmann, B. Leutwein, H. P. Hepp, R. Fischer, and H. J. Salwender, University of Heidelberg. This analysis is part of a retrospective real accident study of 670 occupants in 428 cars. In most cases the real accidents were reconstructed from police reports by means of photographs, acci- dent drawings and descriptions of the damaged cars. In fatal crashes the cars, and in most cases the sites of the accidents were examined. Among 272 occupants involved in car side collisions, we found 41 belt protected near side front passengers, whose cars were impacted by another car with main impact points at the front passengers' doors and B-pillars. The analysis of the correla- tion between technical parameters of the real accidents and inju- ries of the passengers showed a high significant discrimination between MAIS and some regional AIS0 0-3 on one hand, and MAIS and some regionais AIS 4-6 on the other hand already for each of the technical variables EES, delta v and maximum defor- mation. The comparison between these 41 real accident cases and 57 PMHS (postmortem human subjects) tests proved a signifi- cant difference between the thresholds for fatal injuries in respect to maximum deformation. The mean values of maximum defor- mation for fatal injuries in the real accidents were significantly higher than in the PMHS-tests. The possible causes of the differ- ences are discussed. 912899. (P-251) Evaluation of armrest loading in side impacts. David C. Viano, Biomedical Science Dept., General Motors Research Labs. Door armrests of different crush properties and placement were evaluated in a series of side impact sled tests. Three armrest designs were fabricated with an identical shape but different crush force. The crush properties covered a range in occupant protection systems based on knowledge of human tolerance in side impacts. With BioSID, the softest armrest produced the low- est compression and viscous responses, and the probability of AIS 4ł injury was below 1%. The compression -based responses increased significantly in tests with armrests of a higher crush force. The profile of the stiffer armrests clearly protruded into the dummy, and the probability of serious injury was 86%-100% based on compression. With SID, the lowest TTI(d) was with the intermediate stiffness armrest. The SID dummy and TTI(d) crite- rion indicated a 4%-8% probability of AIS 4ł injury for all test conditions and armrest designs. Spearman's rank correlation coefficient was rs = 0.09 indicating a difference in sorting designs with VC (or C) in BioSID and TTI(d) in SID. In companion tests, AIS 4 injuries occurred in anesthetized animals exposed to simi- lar side impact loadings from the intermediate stiffness armrest, whereas AIS 2 injuries occurred with the softest design. These data confirm the appropriateness of VC (or C) in BioSID and insenstivity of TTI(d) in SID for side impact injury assessment. 1 991 SAE Transactions Section 6 912900.

Joseph Wagner, Automated Sciences Group, Inc.; and Joseph W. Kanianthra, NHTSA. 312</page><page sequence="312">912900-912905 The National Highway Traffic Safety Aministration (NHTSA) has developed a lumped mass computer model which simulates the interaction of a struck car door and an adjacent two dimen- sional seated dummy in side impacts. This model was used to investigate the effect of various vehicle design parameters on occupant responses and to define various methods to improve vehicle safety performance. This paper discusses the effectiveness of door padding and side structral stiffness to minimize potential for occupant tho- racic injuries in 90° side impacts. Occupant response data were obtained with the aid of the computer model for a moving deformable barrier striking a car at lateral velocities of 25, 30 and 35 mph. To determine the optimal padding and structure needed to minimize potential occupant injury, the thoracic trauma index (TTI) was mapped in terms of different levels of struck car side stiffness and padding characteristics. 1991 SAE Transactions Section 6 912901. (P-251) The nature and cause of lower limb injuries in car crashes. Dan Pattimore, Edmund Ward, Pete Thomas, and Mo Bradford, Loughborough Univ. This paper addresses the nature and cause of lower limb inju- ries received by car occupants in road traffic accidents. Although such injuries in themselves are rarely life threatening they can lead to long term disability and impairment. The UK CCIS data- base which describes both the injuries to car occupants and the damage to the vehicle was used to determine the related impor- tance and frequency of these injuries. The contact points within the car were examined together with the effect of intrusion on injury severity. It was found that a serious injury to the lower limb was often an occupant's most severe injury and so work to mitigate these injuries would have both long term benefits to accident victims as well as reducing the cost to society. Lower limb injuries are very dependent on the type of impact sustained. With restrained front seat occupants in frontal impacts 68% of skeletal injuries occurred below the knee while in side impacts where the same occupants were seated on the struck-side of the vehicle 51% of skeletal injuries involved in the pelvis. In both cases intrusion was found to be a contributory factor. 1991 SAE Transactions Section 6 912902. (P-251) Ankle joint injury mechanism for adults in frontal automotive impact. Richard M. Morgan and Rolf H. Eppinger, NHTSA; and Barbara C. Hennessey, Chi Associates, Inc. Accident cases are examined to determine the injury mecha- nism for foot/ankle moderate and greater injuries in vehicle crashes. The authors examine 480 in-depth cases from the National Accident Sampling System for the years 1979 through 1987. An injury mechanism -a description of how the foot/ankle physically interacted with the interior of the vehicle -is assigned to each of the injured occupants. For the accidents in which the 480 occupants were injured, the more prominent types of vehi- cles collisions are characterized. 1991 SAE Transactions Section 6 912903. (P-251) Heavy truck cab safety study. Kenneth L. Campbell and Kathleen P. Sullivan, University of Michigan Transportation Research Institute. Nearly 1000 occupants of large trucks die each year in traffic accidents. Examination of yearly trends shows about a 25% decline in tractor-driver fatalities from 674 in 1984 to 508 in 1987. Over that same period of time, reported restraint use by tractor drivers involved in fatal accidents increased from 9.6% to 37.3%. The primary factors associated with tractor driver fatali- ties remain the same as indentified in earlier studies. About 80% are single vehicle accidents. Rollover is identified as the most harmful event in 41.4% and frontal impact is the most harful event in 40.3%. Thirty-four percent of the fatally injured tractor drivers were ejected and 21.5% required extrication. Fire on the truck was assoicated with 16.2% of the tractor driver fatalities. The recent TIFA data on restrained truck drivers indicates that restraint use reduces the probability of fatality by about 77%. However, this estimate must be tempered by the evidence of over-reporting of restraint use on police accident reports. Infor- mation obtained through a review of 186 National Transporta- tion Safety Board (NTSB) reports on truck driver fatalities in eight states indicated that there was not sufficient occupant sur- vival space in about 65% of the collisions examined. Forty-two percent were judged to be not survivable because of the severity of the impact. Restraint use alone appears sufficient to alter the outcome of only about 27%. Cab structural modifications suffi- cient to maintain adequate survival space, particulary in rollover, will be required in order to address an additional 23% that appeared survivable. 1991 SAE Transactions Section 2 912904. (P-251) Finite element simulation of driver folded air bag deployment. V. Lakshminarayan, Ford Motor Co.; and David Lasry, Engineering Systems International. Finite element simulation of air bags as part of the automotive occupant restraint system is rapidly evolving as a new CAE tool in support of car product development. The majority of occupant computer simulations are concentrated around the study of occu- pant impact into the air bag when the air bag is substantially inflated. Further, the initial air bag representation in the simula- tion prior to deployment is of an unfolded configuration. These simplifications do not compromise simulation of crashes wherein the dummy comes in contact with the air bag after it is substan- tially full. The situation wherein the dummy interacts with the air bag early during the inflation is of interest when the occupant is located close to the air bag prior to deployment. In such cases the predeployment geometry of the air bag in the model needs to be representative of the actual air bag folded configuration and the unfolding of the air bag needs to be simulated. This paper includes simulations of interactions between a hemispherical solid object and an air bag under different conditions with an increasing order of complexity. Finite element simulation of the events was performed to compute the accelerations and velocities of the impacting objects and the air bag pressure. Laboratory experiments of analogous events were done independently to val- idate the simulation. The answers predicted by finite element simulation correlated to the experimental results with sufficient accuracy therefore, can be a useful design tool for most driver air bag crash applications. 1 991 SAE Transactions Section 6 912905. (P-251) Investigation of inflatable restraints. John H. Horsch, Gerald Horn, and Joseph D. McCleary, Biomedical Sci- ence Dept., General Motors Research Labs. Studies conducted in the 1970's suggested that inflatable belt restraints might provide a high level of occupant protection based on experiments with dummies, cadavers and volunteers. Although inflating the belt was one factor which contributed to achieving these experimental results, much of the reported per- formance was associated with other features in the restraint sys- tem. Exploratory experiments with the hybrid III dummy indi- cated similar trends to previous studies, belt inflation reducing dummy response amplitudes by pretensioning and energy absorption while reducing displacement. The potential advan- tage of an increased loaded area by an inflatable belt could not be objectively demonstrated from previous studies or from dummy responses. Clearly, belt inflation can be one component of a belt restraint system which tends to reduce test response amplitudes. However, other belt system configurations have demonstrated similar test response amplitudes. Additionally, packaging and comfort issues for inflatable belts have not been completely resolved. Thus 313</page><page sequence="313">912905-912911 inflatable belts do not appear competitive with other approaches to achieve belt restraint system performance. 1991 SAE Transactions Section 6 912906. (P-251) Development of a 3-dimensional finite ele- ment model of air bag deployment and interactions with an occu- pant using DYNA3D. Tawfik B. Khalil, Engrg. Mechs. Dept., General Motors Research Labs.; Ronald J. Wasko, Motor Vehicle Manufacturers Association; and John O. Hallquist and Douglas W. Stillman, Livermore Software Technology Corp. In recent years supplemental inflatable restraint systems (air- bags) have been installed in motor vehicles to mitigate driver/ front passenger harm in vehicle frontal crashes. The performance of the airbag and the level of protection it provides the occupant can be evaluated by a combination of experimental and analytical techniques. Analytical modeling of airbag inflation is desirable in automotive design, particularly when the technique encompasses the airbag, occupant and vehicle structure in an integrated sys- tem. This paper is concerned with the development of nonlinear finite element (FE) technology to simulate airbag deployment and its interaction with an articulated occupant model. This tech- nology is being developed in the dynamic large deformation lagrangian based DYNA3D code which has been successfully used in vehicle crashworthiness simulations. The airbag material was simulated by an orthotropic "wrinkle free" membrane elastic model. A simplified gas model based on assuming uniform ther- modynamic properties (pressure, density, temperature and inter- nal energy) throughout the airbag was coupled to the airbag struc- ture. New developments included inflation of an unfolded airbag and predicting its deployment kinematics and identifying its con- tact and interactions with several spherical and flat surfaces. The predicted bag deformations and contact forces compared favor- ably with corresponding experimental data. In addition, an attempt was made to simulate the deployment and interactions of a folded airbag with a hybrid III dummy model. 1991 SAE Transactions Section 6 912907. (P-251) Force/deflection and fracture characteristics of the temporor-parietal region of the human head. Douglas L. Allsop, Thomas R. Perl, and Charles Y. Warner, Collision Safety Engrg., Inc. Impact tests were conducted on thirty-one unembalmed human cadaver heads. Impacts were delivered to the temporo- parietal region of fixed cadavers by two, different sized, flat-rigid impactors. Yield fracture force and stiffness data for this region of the head are presented. Impactor surfaces consisted of a 5 cm2 circular plate and a 52 cm2 rectangular plate. The average stiff- ness value observed using the circular impactor was 1800 N/mm, with an average bone-fracture-force level of 5000 N. Skull stiff- ness for the rectangular impactor was 4200 N/mm, and the aver- age fracture-force level was 12,500 N. 1991 SAE Transactions Section 6 912908. (P-251) Lateral load sensing hybrid III head. Brent R. Benson and Thomas R. Perl, Collision Safety Engrg., Inc.; Ingrid Planath, Volvo Car Corp.; and Gregory C. Smith, Collision Safety Engrg., Inc. Recent cadaver studies have provided data for the develop- ment of force and stiffness characteristics of the side of the human head. A hybrid III anthropomorphic test dummy (ATD) head was modified to allow direct measurement of impact forces on the parietal and temporal regions by recasting the upper lest half of the skull and installing triaxial piezoelectric force trans- ducers. Dynamic impact tests of this modified head were con- ducted and force/stiffness characteristics for the temporal and parietal areas were compared to existing data on cadaver subjects. It was found that the existing hybrid III vinyl skin satisfactorily represents the force/stiffness characteristics of the human head in these areas. This modified hybrid III dummy head was also impacted against typical interior components likley to be con- tacted during a side impact. The force and acceleration test results are presented. 912909. (P-251) Development of a featureless free-motion headform./. Gavin Howe, Transportation Research Center ; Inc.; Donald T. Willke, HHTSA; and J. A. Collins, Ohio State Univ. The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) is currently conducting research at the Vehicle Research and Test Center (VRTC) aimed at reducing the number of serious and fatal head injuries due to impact with vehicle upper interior structures. A modified hybrid III dummy head is currently used to test head injury potential from impacts with vehicle upper interior structures. This headform is propelled into vehicle upper interior structures with the front of the head facing the structure. Head impacts with A-pillars, side roof rails and B-pillars may occur without the vehicle occupant facing directly into the structure. Since this is the case, it was decided that a featureless free-motion headform should be developed. This headform would not give the appearance of a forehead impacting the side structures of the vehicle. This paper will present the design, development, and testing of a featureless free-motion headform. Biomechanical parame- ters considered for the design of the headform will be presented. The development of the headform will also be shown. Results presented include those from headform certification standard tests, correlation tests between the featureless free-motion head- form and the full hybrid III dummy, and a repeatability study. 912910. (P-251) A detailed evaluation of the ATA angular motion sensor in realistic simulated crash environments. Gilbert C. Willems and David R. Knouse, Naval Biodynamics Lab. A recently developed angular motion sensor, based on the laws of magnetohydrodynamics, has potential application in bio- dynamic research and was tested on the Naval Biodynamics Lab- oratory's (NBDL) horizontal accelerator, using the hybrid III manikin as the test subject. The sensors in question were used to measure the manikin's head motion in three dimensions. Experi- ments were conducted at levels up to 25g in the frontal and oblique impact configurations, and included both indirect impact (no head contact) and direct impact of the head into a simulated windshield. Data collection was performed utilizing both narrow- band (125 Hz) and wideband (1000 Hz) channels. The analyses of the tests show that the new sensor compared very well with two different configurations of the 9-accelerometer arrays commonly used in impact testing. The comparisons were made at both the acceleration and velocity levels. Additional findings were that: 1) wideband channels appear to be unneces- sary for this type of testing; 2) the two linear accelerometer arrays yield equivalent results; and 3) the new sensors are insensitive to linear acceleration. 912911. (P-251) Technical demands on safety in the design of crash helmets for biomechanical analysis of real accident situa- tions. Dietman Otte, Medical Univeristy of Hannover. Crash helmets for motorcyclists are subject to certain test specifications by national and international règlements. For the European community the ECE-R 22 is valid, in America the tests are made according to SNELL as well as FMVSS 218. In all test procedures the protruding stability, the form stability of the car- rier device and the shock absorption is tested. This study investi- gate impact situations in real accidents. The impact situation of 598 analysed crash helmets reveals that only 57.5% of all impact points are situated within the protection region of helmets defined by ECE, 14.1% in the marginal region and 28.2% clarly outside this protected region. The highest percentage of impacts occurres in the chin region, which is not taken into consideration in test definitions ECE as well as FMVSS. The so-called 'double- 314</page><page sequence="314">912911-912916 impacť, which is a base of test procedures and induce therefore, is not confirmed in accident reality. The most frequent impact for the chin region is an impact placed 4 to 6cm away from the mid- dle of the chin-bar. Biomechanically regarded, two typical force directions were defined, on the one hand oblique from below, with subsequent injuries to the lower jaw and other indirect inju- ries to the top of the scull, and on the other hand a more sagittal rectangular force direction, causing fractures to the lower jaw as well as extensive facial fractures. The fracture of the scull base appears to be a frequent secondary effect. In an oblique force direction from below it is valuated as an indirect injury, in a rec- tangular impact, however, it is regarded as a direct injury. Within the respective framework of this study, optimum helmet test con- ditions can be defined by this analysis. 912912. (P-251) Dummy models for crash simulation in finite element programs. Djamal E. Midoun, Mike K. Rao, and Bhi- maraju Kalidindi, Ford Motor Co. The development of combined finite element and spring/rigid mass crash simulation dummy models for automotive applica- tions is described. In order to better understand the crash phe- nomena and occupant kinematics during vehicle crashes, recent developments have been focused on the use of finite element techniques in the simulation of both structure and structure/ dummy interactions. The combination of spring/rigid mass modeling and finite ele- ment technique is used to develop models of fiftieth percentile hybrid III and side impact dummies in a finite element program (RADIOSS). In general, the dummies are modeled with rigid masses and joints with techniques similar to those used in crash victim simulation programs like MADYMO and CAL3D. Only selected components, like the hydrid III dummy thorax and the SID pelvis and jacket, are modeled with finite element shell and brick elements to improve dummy/restraint system and dummy/ structure interaction responses. Special attention is given to dummy model size, so that when integrated with the vehicle structure finite element model, the integrated system model will run with minimal increase in CPU run time. Several examples of hybrid III dummy with air bag and belt restraint systems, and SID dummy against rigid wall sled tests are presented to illustrate this approach. The correlation of analytical predictions with the test data is presented. 912913. (P-251) Occupant protection in rear-end collisions: I. safety priorities and seat belt effectiveness. Charles Y. Warner ; Charles E. Strother ; Michael B . James , Thomas R. Perl, and Robin L. Decker, Collision Safety Engrg., Inc. Recent detailed field accident data are examined with regard to injuries associated with rear impacts. The distribution of "soci- etal harm" associated with various injury mechanisms is pres- ented, and used to evaluate the performance of current seat back and restraint system designs. Deformation associated with seat back yield is shown to be beneficial in reducing overall societal harm in rear impacts. The societal harm associated with ejection and contact with the vehicle rear interior (the two injury mecha- nisms addressed by a rigid seat approach), is shown to be mini- mal. The field accident data also confirm that restraint usage in rear impacts has a substantial injury-reducing effect. Laboratory tests and computer simulations were run to investigate the mech- anism by which seat belts protect occupants in rear impacts. 1991 SAE Transactions Section 6 912914. (P-251) Occupant protection in rear-end collisions: II. the role of seat back deformation in injury reduction. Charles Y. Warner, Charles E. Strother, Michael B. James, and Robin L. Decker, Collision Safety Engrg., Inc. The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) has recently opened a rulemaking docket seeking com- ments on the design of automobile seats and their performance in rear impacts. There are two philosophies of seat design: one advocates rigid seats, the other advocates seats which yield in a controlled manner. A review of the legislative history of seat back design standards indicates that yielding seats have historically been considered a better approach for passenger cars. The design characteristics of current production automobile seats are evalu- ated and show no signficant changes over the past three decades. Concerns about the performance of rigid seat backs in real world rear impacts are discussed, specifically increased injury exposure due to ramping, rebound and out-of-position occupants. 1991 SAE Transactions Section 6 912915. (P-251) The influence of end condition on human cer- vical spine injury mechanisms. Barry S. Myers, James H. McEl - haney, Roger W. Nightingale, and William J. Richardson, Duke Univ.; and Brian J. Doherty, Baylor Univ. The passive combined flexion and axial loading response of the unembalmed human cervical spine were measured in a dynamic test environment. The influence of end condition (the degree of constraint imposed on the head by the contact surface) was varied to determine its effect on observed column stiffness and on failure modes of the cervical spine. Multi-axis load cells were used to completely describe the forces and moments devel- oped in the specimen. Twenty three specimens were studied. The hybrid III neckform performance was assessed to determine its suitability as a mechanical simulator of the neck during head impact. Changes in end condition produced significant changes in axial stiffness in both the hybrid III neckform and the cadaver neck. The mode of injury also varied as a function of end condi- tion in a repeatable fashion. Separation of injuries based upon imposed end condition identified groups with significantly differ- ent axial load to failure. These results also suggest that the risk of cervical injury may be strongly dependent on the degree of head constraint imposed by the contact surface, and that injury environments should be designed to minimize this constraint. 1991 SAE Transactions Section 6 912916. (P-251) Considerations for a neck injury criterion. D. Kallieris, R. Mattern, E. Miltner, Gg. Schmidt, and K. Stein, Uni- versity of Heidelberg. A kinematic analysis of the head-neck unit has been con- ducted in 37 simulated traffic accidents in order to investigate correlations between neck response and injuries. Belted fresh human cadavers in the age range 18 to 74 years have been used as front and rear-seat passengers. The analysed data included 23 frontal collisions, impact veloc- ity 30 km/h, 50 km/h and 60 km/h, barrier impact and 14 90°-car to car lateral collisions with near-side passengers (6 cases) as well as far-side rear-seat passengers with an in-board upper anchoring point for the shoulder belt (8 cases). The head bending angle depended on the type of the collision. At the frontal collision, the mean head bending maxima amounted 79°, the evaluated mean angular velocity maxima and angular acceleration maxima corresponded to 41 rad/s and 2208 rad/s2, the mean maximum velocity in trajectory of the head was 10 m/s, the mean maximum acceleration along the path amounted 23 g. With the same collision velocity of 50 km/h in the 90°-car to car lateral collision higher mean values of head bending angle maxima were observed in the near-side front passengers (62°) than in the far-side rear-seat passengers (57°). The evaluated angular velocity maxima and angular acceleration maxima amounted in the mean for the near-side passengers 43 rad/s and 2887 rad/s2, the mean maximum velocity in trajectory of the head amounted 8 m/s, the mean maximum acceleration along the path was 33 g; for the far-side passengers the mean angular veloc- ity maxima of 26 rad/s were evaluated, for the angular accelera- tion it was 1345 rad/s2, for the head velocity in trajectory 10 m/s and for the acceleration along the path 18 g. 315</page><page sequence="315">912916-912919 Injuries of AIS 1 (hemorrhage = strain) already occurred at an angular acceleration of 560 rad/s2 or a head acceleration of 13 g along the path, whereas the cervical spine may remain uninjured at an angular acceleration of still 2470 rad/s2 or head acceleration of 23 g along the path. On the other hand, an AIS 3 was observed at an angular acceleration of 1320 rad/s2 or a head acceleration of 22 g along the path, and an AIS 4 of 4910 rad/s2 or a head accel- eration of 39 g along the path. 1991 SAE Transactions Section 6 912917. (P-251) A quasi-static analytical sagittal plane model of the cervical spine in extension and compression. Yue Li, Pat- rick J. Bishop, Richard P. Wells, and Stuart M. McGill, Biome- chanics Impact Lab., Dept. of Kinesiology, University of Water- loo. Axial loading of the head-neck complex in a head first colli- sion is a major cuase of traumatic cervical spine and spinal cord injuries. It has been suggested (McElhaney, 1989) that cervical spine fracture is not observed when the head and neck are forced into extension. To evaluate this posture as an injury risk reducing strategy and to estimate the loading imposed on the structures of each cervical segment a quasi-static analytical sagittal plane model of the cervical spine in extension and compression was developed in conjunctin with an instrumented physical test model. The modeled structures included the anterior longitudi- nal ligament (ALL) the longus colli (Leo) and longus capitis (Lea) muscles, the anterior musculature of the neck (Ma), the inver- vertebral discs (IVD) and the spinous processes (Sp). Input parameters included the compressive and shear forces and the moment of force obtained from the altanto-occipital junction of a hybrid III anthropometric test dummy (ATD) subjected to face first collisions against a fixed barrier with the neck in extension. MRI scans of human subjects were used to determine muscle cross sectional areas, appropriate geometric scaling between the ATD neck and the human cervical spine, and appropriate moment arm lengths for the modeled structures. Moments were taken about the facet joint at each cervical level considered the mechanical fulcrum in full extension. Stress-strain relationships obtained from the literature were used to predict the passive mus- cle forces that occurred under impact and well before the possibil- ity of modulating myoelectric activity. Model output included the load at each cervical spine segment level and the loads on each of the structures noted above. Based on a bareheaded ATD travelling at 1.8 m.s*1 the model output suggests that the ALL and neck musculature support only small percentage of the compres- sive force (2.5-5%) while the spinous processes that are in contact are loaded to a significant proportion of their failure tolerance. 1991 SAE Transactions Section 6 912918. (P-251) Development of an improved multi-directional neck prototype. Kathleen DeSantis, Transportation Research Center, Inc. A prototype multi-directional neck (MDN) which exhibits improved kinematic biofidelity in both frontal and lateral impacts has been developed. This prototype's primary goal was to reproduce the kinematics illustrated by volunteers in the Naval Biodynamics Laboratory tests, because current dummy necks were developed before these results were acquired. The prototype achieves this motion with ball-and-socket joints at the head and thorax connecting a rigid link. Rubber bumpers control the neck linkage's range of motion at the joints. Two posterior springs connecting the head and thorax improve head position throughout the impact. Anatomically, the joints correspond to the occipital condyle (OC) and T1 vertebra. The torques mea- sured at the MDN joints approximated the observed human joint response. The MDN can be adapted for use on the hybrid III dummy and the advanced dummy, and incorporates angular motion sensors (AMS) to measure the kinematic performance. MADYMO models were used to determine desgin parameters. The prototype's behavior was evaluated in pendulum and sled tests. The head and neck kinematics of the multi-directional neck, the hybrid III neck, and volunteers are compared to show the prototype's improved frontal and lateral kinematic responses. 1991 SAE Transactions Section 6 912919. (P-251) Cervical spine loads induced in restrained child dummies. E. G. Janssen, TNO Crash Safety Research Centre Institute ; J. J. Nieboer, TNO Road-Vehicles Research Institute ; andR. Verschutand C. G. Huijskens, TNO Crash Safety Research Centre Institute. The cervical spine of young children is normally very mobile. Consequently, relatively little force is required to cause subluxa- tion of the cervical vertebrae. In this respect, the incidence of cer- vical spine injuries in children involved in car accidents seems to be surprisingly low. However, recent European data seem to indicate that serious cervical spine injuries occur more frequently than had previously been thought. In particular, small children seated in forward facing restraint systems with a harness belt appear to be at risk from tetraplegia in moderate frontal impacts. To investigate the significance of these findings, TNO has undertaken a research programme to measure the neck loads induced in TNO-P3/4 child cummies seated in various types of restraint system. A series of dynamic sled tests has been per- formed in which the neck loads induced in a TNO dummy have been measured using a special transducer, which replaces the atlas-axis block of the dummy. The design of this transducer and the test results that have been obtained to date are discussed in detail in the present paper. Special attention is focused on how the misuse of restraint systems can affect neck loads, and on the influence of different seating positions. In addition, consider- ation is given to the significance of free flexural/extensional motions of the P3/4 head. Finally, forward facing and rearward facing systems are compared with each other and child dummy neck loads contrasted with proposed adult tolerance limits. In parallel with the experimental work, a series of mathemati- cal simulations has been performed, using the MADYMO CVS programme. These analyses have been aimed at studying the effect of chin-to-chest contacts and assessing the impact of head/ neck joint characteristics on neck loads. A "design of experi- ments" programme allowing systematic parameter variations has been used to analyse the significance of various test and design parameters. 1991 SAE Transactions Section 6 316</page></plain_text>
