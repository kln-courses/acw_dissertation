<plain_text><page sequence="1">Biological Bases of Human Social Behavior. Robert A. Hinde. 462 pp. McGraw-Hall, 1974. $7.95. This is a scholarly project written in a gentlemanly style by a scientist who is obviously both a scholar and a gentle man. Hinde properly warns about the dangers of generalizing from animals to man, but he also points out the values of generalizing from man to animals if proper controls and constraints are fol lowed. He is obviously aware of the dire dangers of anthropomorphism but is not frozen by fear of this forbidding fal lacy. One of the many merits of Hinde's book lies in the fact that the author is thoroughly conversant with both the language and the literature of multiple animal forms. The behavior of no bio logical form is spared in Hinde's defini tive treatise, but in spite of his electi cism he has behavioral preferences even if they are not passionate preferences. He has studied intensively and con ducted researches on both birds and subhuman primates. These are diverse forms in both fancy and fact, but Hinde properly points out that there is com monality in the role and ritualization of their visual responses. The two forms may not see eye to eye, but with their eyes they see much in common. As Hinde approaches the develop ment and analysis of animal social be havior, increasing interest is devoted to primate peragration?or self-motion play?responses in the total phyletic communicative systems. By accident or design, this chapter in the book is the bridge Ito the following sections on the development of social behavior in birds. ^Hinde accepts affection both as a useful behavioral measure and as a useful so cial tool, and I am pleased since I am too old to rescind two decades of mon key researches. Detailed and critical ap praisal is made of the behavior and be havioral mechanisms in the operation of early infant-mother interactions. Ade quate attention is given to the multiple learned and unlearned affiliati ve vari ables. The interrelationships among these factors are far from simple. Oddly enough, the early avian imprinting studies by Spaulding are not reported. The reader is presented with a very modern, up-to-date human infant, com plete with the visual and perceptual ca pacities which have just within the past few years been recognized and experi</page><page sequence="2">mentally verified by scientific investiga tion. Until the past decade or so the mother was the only person to insist that her baby was in reality quite an in telligent being for her age, and the mother was, of course, considered quite prejudiced. Hinde has clearly re searched his babies well up to the very last moment prior to publication. The wealth of data concerning attention, perception, and communication during the first year is constantly and rapidly increasing. The baby who could barely focus on a mother figure at the time a book was edited was visually following her out of the room by the time of pub lication. Variables influencing early maternal behavior have been described and ana lyzed in detail. Monkey mothers must support and feed the baby and clean and protect it. Even nursing is in large part learning and may be impaired by inadequate breast form and flexibility. Infants behave differently to mothers and to other females depending on the species and the presumed maturational status. The role of exploratory behavior and fear is discussed in detail. Maturation and the significance of a specific fear in monkeys is enormously influenced by the quality and intensity of the stimu lus. As these characteristics are them selves changeable, the behavioral time of the onset of the fear is not constant. Hinde describes in determined detail and quantitative detail maternal con tacts and maternal rejections of her in fant and the masterful motivation in volved. With increasing age the infant mother contacts decrease. Both mater nal and infantile mechanisms influence mother-infant proximity. The nature and role of monkey peers is treated in a relatively cursory fashion in view of its enormous social signifi cance. Hinde describes peer relation ships in macaque and human infants but regards the behavior as "impossible to define." Compared to the difficulty in describing maternal behavior, play should be relatively easy to define. Un fortunately, Hinde's interests in play are the species-specific play forms, not the personal and social functions of play. There is nothing lacking in Hinde's description of play until one puts proper importance on play itself. The data on the development of so cial-sexual behavior are factual and de velopmental. They clearly show that many primate and subprimate forms develop sex behaviors. Sex behavior is influenced by the hormones, but other variables are also important. Early so cial experiences are influential and iso lated variables become integrated. Ex perience is more important in primates than with birds, and experience is more important to the male than to the fe male. All of these facts hold for man as well as for the subhuman forms. Hinde includes an interesting and in formative chapter on aggression and points out that there are genetic vari ables and hormonal factors. He dis cusses the energy theories of aggression and finds them not corroborated by the weight of evidence. To aid the taxonomically naive read er, Hinde concludes his encyclopedic volume with a comprehensive taxonomy of his animal subjects. The birds and the primates appear with overwhelming frequency even though the mosquito, the crocodile, the whale, and the ura cyon cinereoargentatus are recognized for the contribution which they have made to this book.?Harry F.
