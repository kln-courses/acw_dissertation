<plain_text> <page sequence="1"> Robert Moore Reinventing Ethnopoetics Abstract: Ethnopoetics in its Hymesian mode has primarily been an  intervention into the printed form of texts, a way of (re)arranging the  transcript of an event of oral narration so as to recover “the literary form  in which the native words had their being” (Hymes 1981, 384). Building  on Hymes’s legacy, I seek to develop new analytic tools and transcription  practices that are useful for studying contemporary transformations of  narrative in multilingual speech communities undergoing language shift  and obsolescence. This alternative approach, which originated in my at- tempts to capture an elderly narrator’s frequent switching back and forth  between narration in Kiksht (Wasco- Wishram Chinookan) and English,  seeks to re- orient ethno poetics from a recuperative focus on past narra- tive practices to a conceptual framework that enables field researchers to  take into consideration the shifting linguistic environment(s) in which  narration continues to take place in the present. A commentary to this  essay by Richard Bauman appears later in this special issue. Assessing the legacy of Dell Hymes (1927–2009) in ethno poetics  should entail assessing ethno poetics more broadly, as a ‘legacy’ in its  own right within Ameri can cultural and linguistic anthropology since  the 1960s. For indeed, ethno poetics in the broad sense emerged more  as a movement than as another subfield of (linguistic) anthropology,  and it emerged at the same time and among the same generational  cohort that produced Reinventing Anthropology (Hymes 1972), “the ‘anti-  textbook’ of anthropology’s then mid- career po liti cal Left” (Silverstein  2010, 935). Like Reinventing Anthropology, ethno poetics—the term was  coined in 1968 by Jerome Rothenberg (Quasha 1976, 65)—emerged in  the context of a generational struggle between practitioners working in  a number of different but overlapping fields of inquiry and expressive  Journal of Folklore Research, Vol. 50, Nos. 1–3, 2013 Copyright © 2013 Department of Folklore and Ethnomusicology, Indiana University 13 </page> <page sequence="2"> 14 Journal of Folklore Research Vol. 50, Nos. 1–3 practice: academic anthropology, folklore, literary criticism, poetry,  and what we now call performance art. Today we are separated from  this period by at least two (demographic) generations, hence the need  to ask, in the conclusion below, what parts of this legacy are still usable  and active for students of narrative and other discourse practices today. As a set of activities centered on verbal genres mostly of non-  Western, non- literate peoples, ethno poetics is rather unlike the other  anthropological specializations whose names likewise begin with ethno-  and which used to be grouped under the heading of ‘ethnoscience’:  ethnobotany, ethnozoology, ethnoastronomy, ethnomedicine, and so  forth. Most of these take as their subject matter (lexically) explicit,  formal knowledge about domains of human activity and/or perceptual  experience (plants, animals, celestial bodies, etc.), the nomenclature  of which had already been formalized within West ern, unprefixed  ‘science’ when the anthropologists came a- calling. But at least in its Hymesian mode, as verse analy sis, ethno poetics  has not primarily involved the ethno graphic study of nonliterate  peoples’ explicit ideas about narrative, as reflected, perhaps, in native  terminologies. It has, rather, been an intervention into the presen- tational (printed) form of texts, a way of arranging the transcript of  an event of oral narration so as to reflect or recuperate the true rhe- torical architecture of denotational text, and in so doing to recover  “the literary form in which the native words had their being” (Hymes  1981, 384; see Blommaert 2009, 271). There are two implicit claims here: one is that it is possible to arrive  at a single final arrangement of a transcript that reflects on the page  the rhetorical or poetic structure of an(y) oral performance; another is  the idea that in doing so, a scholar has restored or recovered a native  voice. Whatever one thinks about the validity of these claims, there  is no doubt that Hymes was committed to both of them. Indeed, one  can observe a fundamental shift in Hymes’s own work on materials in  Chinookan (and an increasing number of other languages): from a  focus on the event- bound interactional dynamics of narrative as perfor- mance (e.g., Hymes [1975] 1981), he moved to a focus on the rhetorical  architecture of denotational text. To clarify matters, it might help to  identify two distinct senses of the term: ethno poetics1 ethno graphic investigation of ideas about and evalua- tions of in di vidual narrative performances and/or nar- ration in general in the community from which the  </page> <page sequence="3"> Moore     Reinventing Ethnopoetics 15 source texts emerge, in clud ing native vocabulary per- taining to parts of narratives (e.g., titles) and acts of  narration (e.g., verba dicendi), and especially in clud ing  information on (named) speech genres, their perfor- mance conditions, etc.; ethno poetics2 “the recuperative restudy of the textual organization of  origi nally oral literary forms of Native Ameri can and  other peoples so as to make patent and to explicate their  rhetorical power as verbal art.” (Silverstein 2010, 933) Ethnopoetics1, then, fits more easily into the set containing ethno- botany, ethnozoology, and similar (sub)fields; it also overlaps with  another field of which Hymes was a founding fig ure, the ethnography  of speaking (or of communication; see Hymes 1962, 1964). Ethnopoet- ics2 is focused on texts themselves, their rhetorical architecture and  presentational form. Hymes made signal contributions to ethno poetics1 in his work  from the 1950s into the 1970s (e.g., Hymes 1959, 1966, [1975] 1981),  but concentrated almost exclusively on ethno poetics2 after his discov- ery in the mid- to late 1970s of the principles of what he called “verse  analy sis.” More succinctly: ethno poetics1 “study of the oral poetics of indigenous peoples and  ethno poetics2 their literary monuments.” (Silverstein 2010, 936n3) As will become clear, I think this dichotomy is a false one; it is never- theless helpful in organizing the discussion, partly because it was, as I  also hope to suggest, never adequately resolved in Hymes’s own work. My purpose in this paper is to build upon Hymes’s contributions to  ethno poetics, and to propose a set of transcription and text- formatting  practices for capturing on the page dimensions of the poetic structure  of oral narration that are not reflected adequately or systematically in  Hymesian verse analy sis. My broader aim is to contribute to the devel- opment of an analytic framework that can enable field researchers to  take into consideration the shifting linguistic environment in which  narration takes place. The material comes from my own fieldwork with  speakers of Kiksht (Wasco- Wishram Chinookan), the language and  the textual tradition that absorbed so much of Hymes’s prodigious  scholarly and creative energies. In the conclusion I take a brief look  at ethno poetics conceived in broadly cultural terms and try to place  Hymes’s work within it. </page> <page sequence="4"> 16 Journal of Folklore Research Vol. 50, Nos. 1–3 Contrapuntal Coyote Stories During the 1980s, over several summers of fieldwork at Warm Springs  Reservation in central Oregon, I became acquainted with Mrs. Lucinda  Smith (née Scott), a fluent Wasco speaker then in her eighties; the cir- cumstances of our first meeting are described elsewhere (Moore 1993,  213ff). With her late husband Alfred Smith, she had raised a large  family and helped to run a cattle- ranching operation of considerable  size located on an allotment of high sagebrush prairie about twenty  miles to the west of “the Agency,” as the reservation’s main population  center is known. In 1983 I found her living with a recently divorced grown son in a  small, detached house on “the Senior Citizens’ loop,” a cul- de- sac of  1970s- era federal housing built atop a small hill a stone’s throw from  the Agency. Attached to the house was a carport beneath whose roof  sat a large, gleaming late- model Buick sedan, which she had recently  bought at a dealership in the nearby off- reservation town of Madras,  Oregon, paying for it with wads of cash retrieved from a beaded bag.  She didn’t drive; the Buick was there so that one or another of her  adult children could drive her, in regal fashion, to Portland or Yakima  to visit relatives or go shopping. Her son worked for a tribally owned  timber company and was away (“in the woods,” as she put it) from be- fore dawn until late afternoon each day. I would come to her house  once or twice each week in the early afternoon, usually bearing some  small gift of fresh fruit or other edibles. We would sit at her kitchen  table or side by side on her sofa; she knew I was interested in her lan- guage, and sometimes we engaged in the standard kind of linguistic  elicitation or related activities. Since she had spontaneously narrated (in English) an episode  about Coyote the first time we met, I knew that she was not only con- versant in the mythology, but also willing and able to assume respon- sibility for narrating it (Bauman 1977; Hymes [1975] 1981), and so  between 1983 and the time of her death in 1986 I recorded her narrat- ing the Wasco Coyote cycle in full on four separate occasions. Later,  I discovered that Michael Silverstein had recorded another complete  (and quite long) version of her Coyote cycle in 1972, when she still  lived “up the ranch.”  Coyote cycles—loosely connected series of episodes centering on  the trickster- transformer fig ure Coyote and “telling how [he] traveled  all the way up the Columbia river, transforming monsters and instruct- </page> <page sequence="5"> Moore     Reinventing Ethnopoetics 17 ing the people in the vari ous arts of life” (Sapir 1907, 542)—will be  familiar to students of Ameri can Indian mythologies of the region  (cognate episodes are attested for nearby Sahaptin- and Salishan-  speaking groups), and familiar as well to readers of Hymes’s many  studies of Chinookan narrative traditions (e.g., Hymes [1975] 1981).  Though not cosmogonic in the strict sense, Coyote cycles recount  how the world as we know it took its current shape. The setting of the  episodes is a time antedating the present one when animals walked about as men,  though having approximately the same mental and, to a large extent,  physical characteristics as now. At that time, when there were no Indians,  properly speaking, in the country, but only anthropomorphic animals,  many things were not as they should be, and, in order to make the country  fit for habitation by the Indians destined to hold it, it was necessary for  a culture- hero or transformer to rectify the weak points in creation.  (Sapir 1907, 542) If Coyote in the guise of culture- hero or transformer “is distinctly  the benefactor of mankind,” Coyote in trickster mode is “of ten . . .  conceived of as cunning, deceitful, and gluttonous,” an “insufferable  marplot” who is “at the same time . . . indescribably obscene” (543). Mrs. Smith’s renditions of the Coyote cycle turned out to be dif- ferent in a number of ways from the texts I had encountered in the  canon—for that is the proper word—of Chinookan mythology as rep- resented in the work of Franz Boas (1891, 1901), Edward Sapir (1909),  Melville Jacobs (1958), David French (1958), and others, to say nothing  of the then- recent work of Hymes in ethno poetics (e.g., 1981). In Mrs.  Smith’s tellings, for instance, Coyote the culture- hero or transformer  was nowhere to be found. Rather, the deceitful, gluttonous, insuffer- able marplot was everywhere, and many of the episodes featured deeds  that might well qualify as “indescribably obscene,” were they not in fact  described in fairly direct terms (and of ten, in two languages) by my  interlocutor—an octogenarian, matriarch, and staunch Presbyterian. In addition, Mrs. Smith did not localize the vari ous episodes in her  Coyote cycles to specific, named sites along the Columbia River. Such  localizations are common in the Wishram Coyote cycle recorded by  Sapir (1909) and in the closely cognate Clackamas cycle recorded by  Jacobs (1958). But Mrs. Smith belonged to one of the first generations  of people who were born and raised on the Warm Springs Reserva- tion, one hundred miles south of the Columbia River; unlike many  </page> <page sequence="6"> 18 Journal of Folklore Research Vol. 50, Nos. 1–3 men, who might have spent part of every year on the river (during  fishing season), she remained on the reservation virtually all of her  life, as she explained in response to a direct question from Michael  Silverstein in 1972: MS: Last summer you were telling me that qanučk [‘myth’] about isk’úlia  kwadau ik’wálali [‘Coyote and the Dangerous Being’] LS: ik’wálali?  [The Dangerous Being?] MS: Yeah. Where wás that on the ríver, do you know that? LS: Huh- uh. I don’t éven know. The people that used to líve ‘long the ríver, I  guess théy know about thát. But I never live around thére, my folks, well,  they all moved out hére and we [were] raised here. MS: Oh, so when they used to tell you a qanučk, they didn’t téll you where  that wás. LS: No, they never tell me where, they just sáy it, ‘n that’s áll. Well, wé never  think nothing like that would éver be ásked, where they wére, or where.1 The third—and most obvious—difference between these narra- tives and those in published collections was the fact that in all four  versions of the cycle she recounted for me, Mrs. Smith alternated  between narration in Kiksht and English. My facility and fluency in  Kiksht improved over time, and there is much less English in the two  versions from 1984—and still less in the 1985 version—than there is  in the 1983 telling. However, when I brought a (non- Kiksht speaking)  female friend along to visit Mrs. Smith in 1986, the story was almost  entirely in English again (with many of the more risqué incidents  glossed over quickly, if not eliminated). The version she recounted  for Silverstein in 1972—perhaps not surprisingly, given the season  (winter) and Silverstein’s obviously high level of fluency in Kiksht—was  almost entirely in Kiksht, though not without a number of English-  coded asides. Close examination of the full corpus of Mrs. Smith’s Coyote cycles  reveals that her narrative code- switching follows a general pattern: pre- sentation of the direct speech of characters (in clud ing Coyote) is given  in Kiksht, with or without a directly quoted English equivalent; narration  of characters’ movements and non- speech behaviors may be in Kiksht  or in English; metanarrative asides and other out- of- frame remarks are  most of ten in English (see Moore 1993 for a detailed analy sis). </page> <page sequence="7"> Moore     Reinventing Ethnopoetics 19 In all—and I think the corpus of Mrs. Smith’s narrations, spanning  a fourteen- year period, provides a basis for assessing her narrative  style—we can see that her Coyote cycles were presented in a man- ner that we might call contrapuntal. The musical analogy is far from  perfect, but it is meant in part to recall Karl Reisman’s discussion of  “contrapuntal conversation” in the West Indies: In a brief conversation with me, a girl called to someone on the street,  made a remark to a small boy, sang a little, told a child to go buy bread,  etc., all the while continuing the thread of her conversation about her  sister. (Reisman 1974, 114) Is it possible to reconcile such a contrapuntal style of narration with  the requirements of Hymesian verse analy sis? Verse analy sis, it will be  recalled, focuses on uncovering in a monologic text lineaments of verse  structure whose “recurrence at all levels of organization . . . makes the  pattern seemingly inescapable and convincing,” with the result that “at  each level at which the pattern applies, it segments and organizes the  material without discontinuity, without leftovers” (Hymes 1977, 440). Consider the following brief episode from the first time Mrs. Smith  narrated the Coyote cycle for me, on August 25, 1983. The passage is  reproduced below in (1a) more or less as it appears in my field note- book (with errors corrected, of course). (1) From Lucinda Smith, “Raccoon and Coyote,” August 25, 1983 (1a) As “prose” a:ġ[a]+aštúy[a]+aštúya, they’d come to—what was it first? Oh!

Hungry! [Now Coyote stopped there.] Right away one notices much elision of adjacent identical vowel seg- ments across word boundaries (marked here with square brackets and  a plus- sign in superscript); one also notes the rapidity and apparent  seamlessness of Mrs. Smith’s alternation between languages. Now consider the same passage, presented in the style of D ennis  Tedlock (e.g., 1983). In (1b) below, line breaks are determined solely  on the basis of pauses and/or breath groups. I have employed capitali- zation to indicate relatively louder utterances (or syllables) in English,  and a larger font size for relatively louder syllables in Kiksht; mark- edly quieter utterances are given in a smaller font, and one fleeting  bit of allegro narration in near- falsetto is presented in superscript;  to signal rhetorically lengthened (i.e., non- phonemic) vowels here I  use multiple alphabetic symbols rather than a mark for length. All  the lines are positioned flush left, in part to emphasize the relent- less linearity of this mode of ethno poetic presentation. In (1b), then,  I try to represent what Mrs. Smith sounded like as she narrated the  passage.

Several features leap out from this presentation: first, many of the  poetic ‘lines’ here—determined on the basis of prosody alone—  feature more than one verb. The discourse particle aġa ‘now’ appears  in line- initial position (as one would expect on the basis of Hymesian  principles), but in one case (in the fifth line) it bears a marked stress  on its first syllable. Finally, what should be done about the discourse  particle au ‘yes’ that begins the fifteenth line? In (1c) below I present the same passage, now as the output of  Hymesian verse analy sis. The reader will notice first that all of Mrs.  Smith’s English has been quietly excised (and one line of Kiksht has  been supplied, inside square brackets). Rhetorical vowel length is  marked (now with a colon), but Mrs. Smith’s frequent elisions of ad- jacent identical vowels across word boundaries are not, creating the  appearance of a text carefully enunciated at dictation speed. In keep- ing with the methods of Hymesian verse analy sis, lines are divided  according to the principle of one verb (or predicate) per line, despite  the fact that a majority of Mrs. Smith’s prosodic lines in this section  contain more than one verb. (1c) As Hymesian measured verse a:ġa aštúya, Now the two would go,      aštúya,     they’d go,                        [aštúgwaqwam itkádaqi].

Now Coyote stopped there. Notice how perfectly the textual arrangement exemplifies the three-  and five- line verse patterns discovered by Hymes in his work on Chi- nookan narratives: two verses of three lines each, both with aġa in  line- and verse- initial position, and a final verse of five lines, with the  pivotal middle line serving both as ‘outcome’ of the first triad and  ‘onset’ of the sec ond. Finally, below in (1d) is the same passage one more time, now in  the format I eventually devised to cope with Mrs. Smith’s contrapun- tal style of narration. The transcription format used below (and in  other publications, e.g., Moore 1993, 2009) arranges the discourse  into three tiers or columns of indented type in an attempt to render  visually patent the fact that there seem to be (minimally) three dis- tinct speech- event modalities constantly in play in the transcript: (1)  a bilingual conversation between Mrs. Smith and me about linguistic  and other details of the story at hand; (2) Mrs. Smith’s narration of  the plot events of “Raccoon and Coyote” in the third person; and (3)  her use of directly quoted speech to present the utterances of the  characters in the story. The leftmost column or tier of transcription represents interlocu- tory speech deictically grounded in the immediate event of speaking  (Es in the notation of Jakobson [1957] 1990); included here are my  own responses and reactions, along with the audience- like reactions  provided by the narrator herself and vari ous asides, excurses, and  metanarrative comments directed to me as Mrs. Smith’s interlocutor  and co- conversationalist. The sec ond column represents narrative  discourse given in the third person (and usually in the past tense):  description of characters’ movements, actions, and behaviors, and so  on, in clud ing verba dicendi and other methods used by the narrator  to frame the directly quoted utterances of the story’s characters (Es/ En). The third column from the left contains only the directly quoted  speech of characters (Es/En/Ens). Line breaks roughly represent pauses  in speech, though no systematic attempt has been made to capture  subtle differences in pause length. </page> <page sequence="11"> Moore     Reinventing Ethnopoetics 23 In Goffman’s (1981) terms, Mrs. Smith is the Animator, Author,  and Principal of all interlocutory speech given in the first (left- most) column; she is the Animator and Principal of (non- quoted  narrative) speech given in the sec ond (middle) column; but in the  third (rightmost) column of directly quoted character speech, Mrs.  Smith functions only as the Animator—the character whose speech  is presented is the Author and Principal.

These three footings or speech- event modalities are kept  formally distinct at some points, and formally merge with one another  at other points, but in an orderly way. Rather than offering a final and definitive representation of the  true rhetorical architecture of textual form, the format adopted here  is designed explicitly to foreground those points in a narrative perfor- mance where its own categories break down, bringing our attention  to those places where the boundary between a narrating voice and  the voice of a character becomes hard to draw (Bakhtin [1934–1935]  1981). In line 98 above, for example, the framing line Coyote says is given  in English, suggesting that it could belong to interlocutory speech  addressed to me in the event. I have, however, assigned it here to the  narrative speech column. In a similar way, we notice that in line 105  Mrs. Smith seems to preface a passage of narrative description with  au, ‘yes’. Here, the availability of multiple versions of the same story by  the same narrator provides clarification: every time she narrated this  incident, Mrs. Smith had trouble retrieving the Kiksht verb meaning  </page> <page sequence="13"> Moore     Reinventing Ethnopoetics 25 ‘crawl’ ([]3- √k’iɬẋi); here she slows down noticeably in line 103, after  kinwa (‘in vain’), pausing for an instant, then inserting the English he  tried to / sneak up. After a sec ond very brief pause she has retrieved the  word, says (to herself) au (‘yes!’), and proceeds. Even more important, this format allows us to see how speech in  each of the three modalities can serve as a metadiscourse with respect  to speech in the others. It is possible, for example, to step out of the  narrative modality (Es/En) and back into the conversation (Es) to com- ment on the story and/or the characters, perhaps in a language like  English that one shares with one’s interlocutor—indeed, this practice  is common and ever- present in many if not all storytelling traditions,  and it is centrally involved in on- the- spot translations, glossing of par- ticular words, and so on; it also fig ures when narrators are filling in  ‘background information’ and doing speech repair (see Başgöz 1986  for a Turkish case). Mrs. Smith’s metanarrative coda to the passage  presented above, for example—his guts rattlin’ / Hungry!—provides a  nuanced gloss of the complexly interrelated senses of the Kiksht par- ticle p’ala in the immediately preceding narrative discourse, which can  mean ‘he stopped, came to rest; relented; gave up; quit’. The next example (2), taken from the sec ond episode of Mrs.  Smith’s 1983 Coyote cycle, shows that it is also possible to ‘translate’ a  directly quoted passage and simultaneously to comment on it in a way  that makes clear that the narrator qua co- conversationalist (in Es) is  merely the Goffmanian Animator of character speech (in Es/En/Ens).  In this episode of the Coyote cycle (as Mrs. Smith told it), Raccoon  and Coyote come upon five girls—five sisters—jumping in and out of  the water on the opposite bank of the Columbia River. The girls are  scantily clad in buckskin: (2) From Lucinda Smith, “Coyote and   the Five Sisters,” August 25, 1983  [interlocutory (Es)]      [narrative (Es/En)]   [quotational (Es/En/Ens)]   “ank’iɬẋiyá:: alma kwaba anɬ- ktyɛna- 195   [“I’ll crawl over there, and I’ll whatchacall]   “ƛ’mànƛ’mán anƛuẋwa iɬnǝmškš ɬaxiaič!” 196   [“I’ll finger the genitals of those women!”] </page> <page sequence="14"> 26 Journal of Folklore Research Vol. 50, Nos. 1–3 RM: mhm, mhm  197 LS: He mean he’ll, 198  uh, féel them ‘róund. 199 Mrs. Smith’s translation in lines 198–199 here—glossing a particle-  verb construction (ƛ’mànƛ’mán []2- []3- u6- √ẋ7 ‘[]2 finger the genitals of  []3’)—achieves by a kind of inversion of indirect free style (style indirect  libre) a perfect insulation of the two speech- event roles: when Coyote  is being directly quoted, it is he, not Mrs. Smith, who is speaking (and  ‘meaning’) vari ous indescribably (almost) obscene things. It is also possible to comment on the conversational matrix (Es)  of the storytelling event from within the world inhabited by the  characters, treating that event and its participant alignments as an  object- language to be regimented, as it were, by the characters as  co- conversationalists. A clear example of this emerged the following  summer (1984), when I persuaded Mrs. Smith to narrate the Coyote  cycle again for me, starting from the beginning. This time the opening  episode, “Raccoon and Coyote,” contained a new element: (3) From Lucinda Smith, “Raccoon and Coyote,” July 10, 1984  [interlocutory (Es)]      [narrative (Es/En)]   [quotational (Es/En/Ens)] LS:     galiẋčúix.

[Ye:s!] As can be seen from this small (but representative) sample, Mrs.  Smith’s July 1984 version of the cycle was narrated much more densely— and rapidly—in Kiksht than the 1983 version we have been sampling  so far. It is also narrated in the Kiksht ‘remote past’ tense (verbs pre- fixed with ga- before consonants, gal- before vowels), the normatively  appropriate tense for myth narration. The 1983 telling, by contrast,  was narrated in the ‘future- conditional’ (a- before consonants, al- be- </page> <page sequence="16"> 28 Journal of Folklore Research Vol. 50, Nos. 1–3 fore vowels)—hence my translations: not ‘they went’, but ‘they’d go’;  not ‘he jumped’, but ‘he’d jump’, etc. The future- conditional is the  appropriate tense to use when telling about a myth, summarizing the  plot, as opposed to telling it; it’s a way of telling someone what would  be happening in a story, were one to tell it. Wanting to check my transcription, and needing help with trans la- tion, the day after Mrs. Smith recounted the cycle from which item (3)  above is taken, I played the tape recording for another of my colleagues  and teachers on the reservation, Mrs. Alice Florendo (see Moore 2009  for a text from her). When we reached the passage quoted above I had  to shut off the tape recorder so that she could recover from an almost  convulsive fit of laughter: “She’s talking about you, you know!” Mrs.  Florendo explained, as soon as she was able to regain her composure  (lines 82–83 above). Though not terminologized (so far as I know) in Kiksht ethno- poetics1, the passage here recalls an Arizona Tewa narrative technique  discussed by Paul V. Kroskrity (1985) and termed ‘carrying it hither’  (- ma:di- ma’a): a set of techniques for “situating the narratives for the  present audience,” by, for example, “situating the narratives in known  geographical locales, elaborating or editing episodes as part of recipi- ent designing, and other details that contribute to the audience’s sense  of immediacy by virtue of the narrator’s reshaping of old texts to new  contexts” (Kroskrity 1985, 196). Discussion Clearly, these narrations from Mrs. Smith—replete with code-  switching and all manner of ‘extraneous’ metanarrative asides to her  interlocutor—represent something other than “full performance”  (Bauman 1977; Hymes [1975] 1981). These are not transcripts of ritual  speech acts performed over winter nights to an audience of adults  who already knew the plots of all the stories, or to children who were  made to “bathe in ice water” if they fell asleep, as they inevitably did  (Silverstein 1996); this is talk between Mrs. Smith and me, sitting at  her kitchen table or side by side on the “daveno” (sofa) with the tape-  recorder between us, in her senior citizen’s house at Warm Springs,  on long summer afternoons. In situations like these, the boundary  between performer and ‘audience’—so central to folklore study (e.g.,  </page> <page sequence="17"> Moore     Reinventing Ethnopoetics 29 Bauman 1977)—turns out to be permeable and up for negotiation,  as Mrs. Smith frequently breaches ‘the fourth wall’ and addresses me  directly. Jacobs, writing about his fieldwork with the Clackamas Chinook  narrator Victoria Howard, opined that [t]he change in emphasis from a meticulously correct presentation  for a wholly native audience to informing an outsider about a story  which he had never heard tied in with acculturative disintegration. . . .  [Mrs. Howard’s] task with me was to tell a story, not to tell it with all its   trappings. . . . In Mrs. Howard’s time, stories were stories rather than  plays which everyone present also knew. (Jacobs 1959, 223) Jacobs’s point here about “acculturative disintegration” could be  rephrased in more reflexive language: what we observe in these tran- scripts is the transformation of a narrative speech genre in the context  of community- wide conditions of language shift and replacement, and  in more specific conditions that partly reflect long- term interactions  between Mrs. Smith (and other Chinookan elders) and a succession of  anthropological linguists, most notably in the present instance Hymes  himself (starting in the 1950s) and Silverstein (starting in the 1960s). To review: Mrs. Smith’s Coyote cycles present a number of new  or anomalous features when viewed against the background of what  is known about ‘traditional’ Chinookan myths of this type: episodes  featuring Coyote as culture- hero or transformer are notably absent— the Rabelaisian trickster is dominant; the episodes are not localized  to specific sites (in clud ing geologic formations) along the Columbia  River, though they are presented as having taken place there; finally,  and most obviously, Mrs. Smith’s distinctive narrative style emerges  in the complex but orderly intertwining of quoted and non- quoted  speech, narrative and metanarrative discourse, English and Kiksht.  What is more, it is clear that from Mrs. Smith’s point of view, they are  not myths at all, but “stories.” Below in (4) are the native- language labels for major narrative  genres in Kiksht. The term for ‘myth’—a genre for which the Coyote  cycle would be the exemplar—is the un- prefixed and unanalyzable  noun stem qánučk, shown in (4a), which takes a masculine- singular  cross- referencing pronominal (- i- ) in the verb. The verbum dicendi that  goes with this noun is built on the semantically ‘light’ verb root √ẋ  </page> <page sequence="18"> 30 Journal of Folklore Research Vol. 50, Nos. 1–3 ‘be, make, do’, in a ditransitive construction, so that, to translate the  Kiksht idiom, one “does” a myth (for someone). The term roughly translatable as ‘tale’ (4b) is an invariably plural  noun (with it3- ‘plural’ prefix) that is transparently a deverbal nomi- nalization, made from a verb construction that denotes the act of  ‘bringing (an object) forth from an enclosure’—hence my literal gloss  ‘recollection’. The speech act involved in the telling of a tale or recol- lection would be denoted by the verb given in (4b), with absolutive3  inflection for speaker, and dative4 inflection for hearer. But Mrs. Smith’s narrations belong to neither of these categories— they are, as can be seen from the passage quoted above in (3), stories:  the noun is id- wáča, an invariably plural form that has broad semantic  range, taking in ‘stories’ as things one has heard, as well as gossip, in- formation, and, perhaps most saliently, ‘news.’ Etymologically the noun  is related to the body- part term for ‘ear’—hence, to gloss the noun  etymologically, one might offer ‘hearsay’ as a rough English equivalent.  The Wishram lexical files (begun by Sapir, and massively expanded  by his student Walter Dyk) contain a neologism for ‘telegraph wires’  that is built on this noun, structurally glossable as ‘news- carriers’.  Qanučkmaẋ can only be told on winter nights, before an audience of  children and adults (who would already know the plots); idwáča can  be imparted by anyone, to anyone, at any time.

In July of 1984, for example, as  I was gently coaxing her to re- tell the Coyote cycle for me, this is  </page> <page sequence="19"> Moore     Reinventing Ethnopoetics 31 how she responded, just before launching into the beginning of the  narrative: (5) Before beginning narration, July 10, 1984 LS: Talk Wasco?

Like all heuristic devices, it  should be evaluated for what it allows the reader to see, or whether  it enables the reader to learn more. But because the transcription  format proposed here is superficially so similar to that of Hymes in  its appearance on the page, it may be useful to sharpen the contrast  between the intentions, and the effects, of the two approaches. Introducing his analy sis of a Hopi text, Hymes remarked, “Expe- rience of a number of Native Ameri can traditions, and of narrative  traditions in some other languages, in clud ing English, has led to a  conception of a narrator as weaving together two threads. One is a  thread of incident, what is going to happen, and the other is a thread  of form, how what happens is to be given shape” (1992, 47). The dia- lectic between narratable content and rhetorical form that Hymes puts  front and center here has certainly been central to the development  of European and modernist (ethno)poetics and literary culture, as  has been the concern with what is going on in the mind of the nar- rator or literary artist. The relevance of this to the verbal traditions  of other peoples, however, has not so much been argued for as it has  been taken for granted. One cannot help but notice in Hymes’s later ethno poetic work an  increasing sense of certainty: “Again and again, an analy sis of form  leads to recognition of larger relationships, to deployment in the ser- vice of balance and point. One is able to recognize with some degree  of accuracy just what parts a narrative has” (Hymes 1992, 50). At the  same time, there is a move toward universalism, deploying a notion  of narrative competence that is clearly modeled on the Chomskyan  notion of linguistic competence: [T]he principles of narrative performance are not limited to any lan- guage, cultural tradition or area, but rather are universally human.  We must imagine children as being born with the capacity to acquire  mastery of such form. Local circumstance will determine the particular  groupings acquired—two and four, three and five, or some other. Local  circumstances will also condition the degree of mastery acquired. As  with grammar, so with discourse: not everyone has access to all that  </page> <page sequence="21"> Moore     Reinventing Ethnopoetics 33 has come to be done with it, or is given encouragement to extend its  range. . . . When texts come from a culture grounded in oral tradition  and a narrative view of life, it is not surprising to find text after text that  shows rewarding artistry. (Hymes 1982, iii) Indeed, Hymes explicitly claims that the formal structures revealed by  verse analy sis “involve competence. It is a competence that probably  is largely out of awareness, like the competence that enables us to de- ploy complexities of syntax we could not ourselves analyze” (1992, 50). As a heuristic, the format I propose may prove useful as a research  tool because it deals not in abstractions of narratable content (onset,  ongoing, outcome) arranged in a numerically regimented rhetorical  scaffolding (i.e., verse structures based on pattern numbers). Rather,  it highlights explicit distinctions between speech- event modalities  grounded in language- universal principles: mechanisms enabling  direct and indirect quotation exist in every language, along with  verba dicendi. In speech communities undergoing language shift and  other forms of sociolinguistic transformation, quotation can become  a crucially important resource in negotiating the interpersonal poli- tics of language ‘choice’ (see Moore 1988, 1993, for development of  this point). To segment or re- segment a narrative into lines, the smallest unit  of narrative verse analy sis, Hymes relied heavily on particles translat- able into English as ‘now’, ‘and then’, etc., and on the principle of  one verb (or predicate) per line; thus, narrative structure at the level  of the (Hymesian) line devolves upon a chunk of language exactly  coextensive with a proposition—the foundation of truth- functional  semantics in a long European (and classical) tradition of philosophical  discussion of language. For the grouping of lines into verses and stan- zas, Hymesian verse analy sis relies on summaries of narratable con- tent, employing a technique clearly inspired by the modernist literary  theories of Cleanth Brooks and Robert Penn Warren—“exposition,  complication, climax, denouement” (Brooks and Warrren 1949)—a  debt that Hymes acknowledges in many places and creatively explores  (e.g., Hymes 1981, 106, 225).3 The larger units that Hymes calls scenes  are clearly determined on the basis of the classical (European) ideal  of unity of time, place, and participants. Rendering the denotational content of a narrative text as a repeat- ing pattern or (to use a visual metaphor) an all- over design akin to a  Navajo rug or a Klikitat basket captures one dimension of aesthetic  </page> <page sequence="22"> 34 Journal of Folklore Research Vol. 50, Nos. 1–3 form;4 my argument here is that this view, while grounded in verbal  structures that are perfectly patent, turns out to be incomplete. Insofar  as we wish to move beyond the idea that we are dealing with a literature  realized in oral performance, we need to see how poetic structures in  discourse not only emerge in contexts of verbal interaction, but also  help to (re)shape those contexts in particular ways. We need, in other  words, a transcription format that enables us to represent on the page  these situated aspects of poetic form that unfold in “the interaction  order” (Goffman 1983). The positive proposal is that we should, as a first approximation,  attempt to organize our presentations of the texts ‘on the page’ to  reflect the way that narrators and their interlocutors deftly shift their  footings (Goffman 1981) during a storytelling encounter, both with  respect to each other and with respect to the story being told. We  need to capture these indexical dimensions of the event- bound func- tionality of speech, because they reveal another dimension of poetic  patterning. The ethical and po liti cal entailments of this alternative  proposal include a sustained attention to the ethno graphic encoun- ter as a cultural episode in its own right—an orientation articulated  early on (before “verse analy sis”) by Hymes himself, most notably in  “Breakthrough into Performance” (Hymes [1975] 1981), and explored  further by Tedlock (1983), Richard Bauman and Charles L. Briggs  (2003), and many others. Finally, what of ethno poetics as a literary and cultural movement?  If, as seems to be the case, it was at least in part an effort to destabilize  or subvert certain conventional pieties of the literary establishment  through the introduction of the verbal arts of ethnic and racial ‘oth- ers’ (in translation), then perhaps it should be studied alongside the  development of World Music (Feld 2000) and the emergence into the  global art market of Australian Aborigi nal painting (Myers 2002). Jerome Rothenberg, the coiner of the term ethno poetics, explains  in a 2009 interview his own view that ethno poetics is not a way of making poetry, but rather a way of talking about poetry,  both the practice and the theory of poetry, as it exists in different cul- tures, with a certain emphasis on cultures without writing or in which  oral poetry and poetics seemed to be dominant. And all of this was as  much of a challenge to a conservative poetics as was the work of the most radical  experimenters among us. It also tied to the quest for “a primary human poten- </page> <page sequence="23"> Moore     Reinventing Ethnopoetics 35 tial” by allowing us to start with a serious search across the spectrum of cultures.  (Rothenberg 2009) The time may be ripe for the kind of reconsideration and criti cal  analy sis proposed here for ethno poetics as an intellectual, po liti cal,  and poetic project. Ethnobotany, for example, has assumed a new kind  of importance in the contemporary moment, especially insofar as it  now aims not only to offer an account of how the natives (incorrectly)  interpret the natural world, but also to demonstrate how such “Tradi- tional Environmental Knowledge” (TEK) can help ‘us’ make discov- eries that may lead to scientific (or pharmaceutical) breakthroughs. And so the prefix ethno - is not merely a mark of irreducible cultural  difference, but a positive source of value for a whole set of rather differ- ently positioned observers and experts: linguists, poets, musicians—  and now, biologists. A long West ern artistic and now scientific tradition  of finding (or creating) value in the ethno - seems to emerge again and  again at the intersection of similar cultural concerns, albeit at differ- ent social and cultural ‘sites.’ Many of these concerns, for example,  coalesce in the discourse of language endangerment (e.g., Hill 2002;  Moore 2006; Moore et al. 2011)—a term that again cuts across the  linguistic- cultural- biological divide. Reinventing ethno poetics along the lines suggested here entails  recognizing that we are dealing with verbal genres that are being  transformed under conditions of language shift—and that we have  been all along (as the quote from Jacobs above suggests). Lucinda  Smith wasn’t “doing” (performing) myths for me, she was telling me  stories (idwáča). Ethnopoetics reinvented would recognize that there  is another layer or modality of poetic patterning beyond the level of  denotational text, one that inheres in the kind of recurring yet orderly  shifts of footing that characterize Mrs. Smith’s narrative style. We  need an approach to speech genres in transformation that allows us  to represent on the page the way that narrators and their interlocutors  navigate among speech- event modalities and role- fractions in story- telling events. This alternation of footings, grounded in three distinct  but overlapping participation frameworks, is crossed or overlain by an  alternation between two languages: one language on its way out, the  other on its way in. Lucinda Smith was bracingly unsentimental about all of this.  Untouched by the identity politics that was just then reshaping local  </page> <page sequence="24"> 36 Journal of Folklore Research Vol. 50, Nos. 1–3 consciousness of ancestral languages at Warm Springs, placing them  in a regime of value mediated by culture and heritage, she simply said  that she stopped speaking Wasco when she realized that there was no- body left to talk to. “I’m the Last of the Mohicans, I guess,” she once  remarked with a sardonic grin.

The literary critic Kenneth Burke (e.g., Burke 1925) loomed much larger in  Hymes’s intellectual (and personal) life than did Brooks and Warren, as is well  known. A fuller treatment would address the impact of Burke’s ideas on Hymes’s  ethno poetics more generally, and on his development of the “onset/ongoing/ outcome” scheme in particular. 4.

Published twice  a year, it includes insightful research, theory, commentary, and other  scholarly works that document or facilitate investigations of teaching  and learning in higher education. TLI values quality and variety  in its vision of the scholarship of teaching and learning. Its pages  showcase the breadth of the interdisciplinary field of SoTL in its explicit  methodological pluralism, its call for traditional and new genres, and  its international authorship from across career stages. The journal  regularly features articles documenting SoTL projects, theoretical  assertions, literature syntheses, or reports on the field; dialogues  responding to previous issues; innovative but systematic reflections  through creative products; and reviews of books, external articles, web  resources, or conferences. Teaching and Learning Inquiry is a benefit of  membership of the ISSOTL.
