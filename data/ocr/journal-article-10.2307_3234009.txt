Glendon Schubert, University of Hawaii It has been more than twenty-three centuries since Aristotle proclaimed that man is by nature a political animal;1 and students of politics are just 1. Politica, I, 2. The emphasis is mine, and seems necessary only because we have become habituated to indulge in professional egocentrism by giving the sentence a somewhat different reading, throwing greater emphasis upon the adjective "political" than upon the noun "animal." (As I discovered after having written the above, a third, and possibly mediating, parsing has been suggested by Lionel Tiger: "... typically, the emphasis is on the adjective 'political' rather than on the key uncer- tainty in the statement-what 'by nature' means." See his "Dominance in Human Societies," Annual Review of Ecology and Systematics, I [1970], 291.) But the anthropomorphic fancy that the study of mankind can and should be divorced from the study of the rest of life and from the remainder of nature is as alien to Aris- totle's outlook as it ought to be from our own-particularly in the light of the burgeoning ecological evidence to the effect that the niche of humankind in nature must be redefined, or else nature will redefine humankind out of existence. (Cf. Lynton K. Caldwell, In Defense of Earth: International Protection of the Biosphere [Bloomington: Indiana University Press, 1972].) Aristotle thought our animal na- ture to be more fundamental than our political nature; he believed that any under- standing of nature must be based on the premise that the soul is the principle of all animal life (De Anima, I:1); and that human behavior must be understood as a</page><page sequence="2">Review-Articles 241 beginning to get around, at long last, to taking seriously the possibility that the study of animal behavior may be relevant to political analysis. Even within the more limiting frame of reference provided by American politi- cal science, it has been a full half century since "the Chief" of the Chicago school issued his call for a new science of politics, which for Charles Mer- riam involved an explicit concern for "the new insights into human nature offered by modern science working in psychology and biology" to support "the development of scientific method in the observation, measurement, and comparison of political relations," 2 as well as for the sociological and sociopsychological components that have figured so prominently in the work that came to typify political behavioralism during the fifties and sixties. But until a very few years ago, only in the work of Harold Lasswell -our discipline's longtime enfant terrible and Merriam's best known stu- dent-do we find a balanced, sustained, and continuing preoccupation with both the somatic and the psychic, as well as the social, aspects of pol- itical behavior. Instead our profession's predilection has been to perform analyses (including those purporting explicitly to be "behavioral") that have permitted human nature itself to enter into our calculations only as a constant,3 if by "human nature" we mean empirical events and relation- ships within individual humans (as distinguished from the phenomeno- logical-the observed interactions among them). Clearly, our long-standing disdain for investigating the biological roots of political behavior cannot be attributed to our unfamiliarity with the idea that we should do so. We have, rather, been inhibited from acting upon the idea by a variety of considerations: these include the lack of edu- cation in modern biology, on the part of virtually all contemporary politi- cal scientists; the persistence among us of ideological hang-ups which con- fuse twentieth-century evolutionary biology with nineteenth-century social Darwinism, and population genetics with eugenics; and the anachronistic belief, which we inherited from nineteenth-century sociology, that natural, inherent, and absolutely fundamental differences separate-and presum- ably, for all time-the "natural" from the "social" sciences. The more generally accepted contemporary classification system distinguishes, in- stead, among mathematics and logic; the physical sciences; the biological special case of animal behavior (Historia Animalium; De Partibus Animalium; De Generatione Animalium). 2.

Those who now favor a closer integration between biology and political science are advocating that political scientists (or at least, some of us) extend their competence into other subfields of psy- chology (beyond social psychology); that they acquire a better knowledge of at least the major research findings of contemporary paleontology (and hence extend their knowledge of human, primate, and animal evolution); and that they become familiar with comparative political behavior not only across cultures, but across species as well. To this we may add the wide- spread and accelerating concerns for the interrelationships between social ecology and the ecology of earth, which impel many to the conviction that the time is at hand for a union between the science of politics, and politics of science-and that the latter demands that political scientists acquire a better substantive understanding of the basic issues at stake. Political scientists enter the seventies with an eclectic natural history and heritage; and depending upon when and where we were socialized into the profession, most of us will doubtless continue to do our accus- tomed thing, so that many will remain social scientist humanists of the now classical pre-behavioral variety, others will remain behavioralists wedded to a social science of politics, and of those socialized by behavior- alists4 during the sixties many will be radical humanists of the "post- behavioral" variety.5 But there are also a growing number of political scientists who, particularly during the past five years, have sought to study the biology of political behavior.6 This is a movement that can well be de- scribed as a return to first principles, although it represents also a major step in the direction of making the study of politics both more humanistic and more scientific. The study of politics necessarily will become more humanistic, because a major focus of biopolitical behavior is upon the in- frastructure of the human body-and if the soul can be operationalized only in terms of genetic grammar, and the mind only as a function of elec- trical transactions within and between the cerebral cortex and limbic sys- tem of the brain, then the study of neurophysiology will bring us closer to both a better understanding of humanity in general and of what is distinc- 4.

Biopolitics will at the same time bring us closer to Merriam's goal of a science of politics because we shall have no choice but to come to grips with the "hard" as well as the "soft" side of psychology, with the laboratory techniques and experimental methods of the other life sciences, and with a detailed knowledge of phys- ical science that far surpasses our present requirements.7 Those of our students (and of our profession) who drift into political science because they could not pass freshman-level undergraduate courses in calculus or inorganic chemistry will have to settle for other subfields of political sci- ence than biopolitics. Any demarcation of the beginning of biopolitical analysis is, of course, arbitrary in several respects. If we are willing to accept metaphorical para- digms as a relevant mode of analysis, then biological theory has influenced the study of politics at least since Woodrow Wilson's academic work and the founding of the American Political Science Association.8 If we posit the criterion that there must be an explicit concern for the implications of the findings of biological research for political analysis-or, conversely, of the findings of political research for the further development of the bio- logical sciences-then our benchmarks will be less than a decade old: Davies' book on the psychology of political behavior,9 and Caldwell's article on the public policy implications of bioscience problems.10 But the thrust of the contemporary biopolitics movement, at least from a publica- 7. It is instructive to learn how equivalent developments have occurred in other of the life sciences: see, for example, Richard H. Shyrock, "The History of Quan- tification in Medical Science," and Edwin G. Boring, "The Beginning and Growth of Measurement in Psychology," both in Harry Woolf, ed., Quantification (Indianap- olis: Bobbs-Merrill, 1961), pp. 85-127. Even more instructive, perhaps, is the dis- cussion of research strategies in the physical sciences when those disciplines were at a stage of scientific development not seemingly too dissimilar from that of political science today: A. C. Crombie, "Quantification in Medieval Physics," in Woolf, ibid., pp. 13-30. 8. As Martin Landau has remarked, "Function and integration are suggestive of another language-that of biology. And those who speak it are legion." See his "Due Process of Inquiry," American Behavioral Scientist, 9:2 (October, 1965), 5.

None of these four books was written by a political scientist; none is about politics-as that subject has come to be conventionally defined by our profession; and of the five authors, four were born and reared as for- eigners (one Canadian, one Frenchman, and two Englishmen) while the fifth is a virtual expatriate who divides his time between an apartment in Rome and safaris into what little remains "natural" in the game park en- claves of eastern and of southern Africa. So it is not likely that, in the ordinary course of events, many political scientists would read most of these books. Whether they ought to do so is, of course, the subject to which I must address myself in this essay. Table I indicates, in a summary way, three of the parameters in terms of which we can characterize these works. Two of the authors are biolo- gists; two are social anthropologists; and one is a humanist. The dimen- sion on which the most communality is apparent is that of the authors' standpoints: all are concerned with human evolution, and all except Monod draw extensively upon the ethological research of the past four decades and discuss human behavior in the explicit context of comparative animal behavior. But their subjects vary, and there is evident in the table a scalar progression from the microcosmic concerns of biochemistry, through the middle ranges of the behavior of humans as individuals and in relatively small groups, to the macrocosmic concerns of political theory. And there is a corresponding scalar difference in the rigor and complexity of these books. Monod is by far the most rigorous, in both form and con- tent, entailing four appendixes (of which the first three are even more technical than most of the text), and with illustrations consisting princi- pally of diagrams of macromolecular atomic structures. Ardrey, to the contrary, is at least in form a literary book, replete with anecdotes reflec- ting the author's travels, discussions, observations, and reading; appropri- ately-in the light of the author's earlier career-dramatic in style; and illustrated by his wife with drawings (which are excellently done) mostly of animals. It seems to me prudent to begin with Ardrey, after which we 11.

I. The Politics of Inequality Like James Davies' explicit identification of his own book with the Wallas classic, Robert Ardrey quite deliberately borrowed his title from Rous- seau; but unlike Davies-Wallas, between whom there is certainly no ideo- logical conflict, Ardrey has set out to prove how wrong Rousseau was and is. It is not so much liberty and fraternity that bothers Ardrey; it is, rather, in its justification of egilite as a basic postulate of political society that Le Contrat Social fundamentally errs. Ardrey makes his initial sentence read: "A society is a group of unequal beings organized to meet common needs" -which sounds like sociological jargon and compares not too favorably with the poetic invocation to Rousseau's version of the social contract.'3 But Rousseau is, in Ardrey's view, an authoritarian who has prescribed "the total surrender of disorder to order" (p. 101), and the reason for their irreconcilable differences lies in their opposite conceptions of the nature of humankind: Rousseau is a pessimist whereas Ardrey is an opti- mist: "Rousseau's was an agreement between fallen angels, while mine 13. Notwithstanding such occasional-and in context, invariably annoying-pe- danticisms, Ardrey's writing style is almost unspeakably superior to that of virtually all political science writing on the subject of biopolitics. Given Ardrey's chaotic dis- organization of subject matter and episodic content, we should expect him to pro- vide more titillating reading than persons confined by, say, the format rules of the American Psychological Association.</page><page sequence="7">246 Review-Articles [says Ardrey] is one between risen apes" (p. 101). Rousseau was com- pletely wrong, of course, about the nature of primitive society, with the consequence that his "vision of asocial primal man became his founding fallacy" (p. 97). Ardrey writes a century after Darwin (unlike Rousseau, who wrote a century before The Descent of Man) and, moreover, at the close of a decade that has been unrivaled for its progress in the recon- struction of the history of earth, hominids, and humankind, pushing the origin of the species backwards in time to the extent of ten millions of years. The missing link had been found, and to Robert Ardrey had been revealed the clue to the riddle of man's existence. (It did not turn out to be a single alif.) An initial statement of Ardrey's views on the evolution of human nature had appeared a decade earlier in African Genesis,14 to be followed by The Territorial Imperative15 which supported the thesis that the basis of social order in animals generally (and in humankind in particular) is the estab- lishment and defense of the geographical space required (by species- specific definition) for breeding and reproduction. Both of these earlier themes are repeated in counterpoint throughout the present book, which is intended (as I infer) to develop the topic of social structure among humans and other animals. And the model of social structure which evolu- tionary adaptation bequeathed to modern-even contemporary-political society is that of the hunting band. This model-which is explicitly accepted also by Tiger, Fox, Morris, and presumably by Monod as well-is derived from the following ex- tremely summary narrative. It has been at least fourteen and a half mil- lion years since the hominid Ramapithecus (discovered in both India and east Africa) had left the forests (and arboreal vegetarianism) to become one of a line of increasingly erect, omnivorous, hunting competitors with the other (largely, carnivore) predators of the plains. Ardrey infers from the hominid's (already, then) reduced canine teeth that he must have em- ployed weapons, and that he must have hunted in groups, in order to have persisted as a species for a period much longer than has homo sapiens to date, and in environments that certainly were no more auspicious for species survival. The same characteristics are attributed to the (thus far, exclusively African) hominid Australopithicus Africanus and also to homo erectus, dating from four and two millions of years ago respectively. Homo sapiens can be traced for a quarter of a million years (and may extend as 14.

Robert Ardrey, The Territorial Imperative: A Personal Inquiry into the Ani- mal Origins of Property and Nations (London: Collins, 1966).</page><page sequence="8">Review-Articles 247 far back as 700,000 B.P.); and the principal distinguishing characteristic between our own species and homo erectus, at that early time, and the pre- cedent hominid species, is found in the sudden and great expansion that occurred in the size of the cortex of the human brain. The survival of our species was strictly dependent upon the competitive success of the human hunting band; and that demanded an authoritarian social structure in which "order was all, and the capacity to conform the supreme selective value" (p. 346). The human hunting band differed from that of virtually all other primates (such as baboons today) because the females and young remained in a camp while the adult males went off to- gether in search of food for all. (There was little problem of caring for the aged; of a sample of almost four hundred Pleistocene hominid fossils, less than three percent had attained the age of fifty years [p. 303].) So in addition to the fourteen-odd million years of hominid hunting band exis- tence, there probably has been at least 500,000 years of similar experience for our own species; but it is only during the relatively brief interval of the past 10,000 years that farming came to supplant hunting, while industriali- zation has displaced farming only within the last 200 years. Neither two centuries nor a hundred centuries is a sufficiently long period to support any really fundamental changes in the physiological characteristics (ge- netic inheritance, the gene pool) of the species; hence, humans who fly to the moon, or who merely dwell in urban megalopoli in industrialized soci- eties, do so with the same basic psychophysiological needs, abilities, and limitations as did their forebears of the hunting band at a time that was, by the slow clock of evolutionary change, only yesterday. Since the survival of the hunting band required a high degree of order and conformity, there must be a hierarchy of roles, with a few dominant males ("alphas," to employ one of Ardrey's favorite terms) asserting their dominance over younger, smaller, and weaker males ("omegas") and, of course, over all females. "Any society has as its basic structure a hierarchy of members unequally disposed" (p. 109). In any case, "equality among sexually reproducing beings is a natural impossibility" (p. 41). In part this is because sexual differences (between individual genetic contribu- tions, not in the sense of "between the sexes") make possible continuing changes in the species, which enhance adaptability (p. 29). Ardrey believes that his model, buttressed by his own field observations plus a miscellany of findings from reports of ethological research, supports a considerable number of observations about contemporary Western cul- ture. He has not presented these opinions in any particular order, but I can at least indicate the gist of his thinking about several matters. The over-all impression conveyed by this, as well as his earlier books, is of a tough-minded, authoritarian, conservative. Of course he is a male</page><page sequence="9">248 Review-Articles chauvinist, and his books are replete with the idee fixe that an adult female's place is in the home (territory), reproducing or rearing offspring so that the species can continue. He is also passionately opposed to the liberation of youth, who certainly challenge, and bode likely to destroy, the natural social order of human society. (All juveniles are by nature omegas, because they are dominated by adults [p. 143].) But not only are individual adult males, the sexes, and the generations unequal; so too are the subspecies populations that we refer to as races: "We must," says Ardrey, "discard as fallacious the proposition that all human populations, even in relation to their own environment, have equal potential" (p. 56; and cf. pp. 64-65). And his ardor for the group mystique verges, at times, upon that fascist ideology that predominated only thirty years ago in the city where he now maintains his most fixed residence: "The authority and responsibility of the few, the loyalty and obedience of the many, have through group selection perfected a social contract that works" (p. 168). He is speaking here, as it happens, of baboons; but that does not mean that the assertion does not apply also to the ideal of the hunting band, because "primate students are coming more and more unanimously to the conclu- sion that terrestrial life has commanded increased aggressiveness in the primate individual and tighter organization in the primate society" (p. 167). In any case, "security is that of the group.... [A] baboon without a troop is a dead baboon" (p. 168). It is the nature of humans to be violent, and considerably more so than baboons. "The youth with a paving block in his hand is enjoying himself," says Ardrey. "We enjoy the violent" (p. 286). Furthermore, "to deny its incidence in all human groups-male, female, old, young, the immature- is the most flagrant of discriminatory attitudes." But soon we can antici- pate further breakdown of our social order, so that "violence will take place on your doorstep" and "the equalitarian dispensation of civil dis- order will present you with equal opportunity to enjoy the excitement of violent dispositions" (p. 279). Evidently, it has always been like this. Ardrey tells the story of the response of Raymond Dart, formerly Profes- sor of Anatomy at the University of Witswatersrand and the discoverer of dozens of specimens of africanus, to the query how many of his Austral- opithecines had met violent ends. Dart's reply was "all" (p. 338). Consistent with his totalitarian concept of social order is his notion that evolution produced social order, while the individual is a "human" (cul- tural) invention. Ardrey indicates a high regard for the ethic of individual- ism-at least for alpha males. But in his view it is egalitarianism, not authoritarianism, that is the enemy of individuality. Ardrey is anti- humanitarianism, anti-behavioralism in general, and anti-cultural anthro- pology in particular (because it foolishly preoccupies itself with the obser-</page><page sequence="10">Review-Articles 249 vation of "the few marginal hunting peoples remaining today [who] are human evolution's losers" (p. 304). He is even, not inappropriately, anti- union. Ardrey has no comprehension of scientific method: his idea of research is to formulate a hypothesis, then look for evidence to support it so that one can demonstrate (thereby) that his hypothesis is valid. Evidently his frequently mentioned conversations with leading scientists did not con- descend to a concern for methodological problems-and Ardrey is an in- veterate name-dropper: he refers, for example, to "Konrad Lorenz and myself" (p. 195) and to "Konrad Lorenz and I" (p. 255) as the co- sponsors of the theory of aggression that he favors; but this is evidently a one-sided view of the relationship, because Lorenz himself nowhere cites or mentions Ardrey in Lorenz' book on aggression where one would naturally expect to find such recriprocity acknowledged.16 Of course, one does not expect such mutuality in the instance of the reference to Rous- seau-and-I (p. 96). Like the Swiss romantic radical Rousseau, with whom he deems him- self to be in such fundamental disagreement, ethological dilettante Ardrey is a natural law thinker,l7 as he himself acknowledges. There may be a niche for Ardrey in biopolitics, but if so it must be the same as the one recently staked out by Thorson in a book entitled Biopolitics,8l in regard to which Somit appropriately commented that he wished "the book had been given some other title, as the actual subject matter has relatively little in common with the other biopolitical writings." 19 II. The Politics of Sexuality If Robert Ardrey is the dramatist-in-residence of ethopolitics, Lionel Tiger is its poet laureate. Tiger is a social anthropologist with professional roots in Canada and ties to England at least as strong as those of his recent placement at Rutgers. He is the co-author (together with English social anthropologist Robin Fox, now also at Rutgers) of a work entitled The Imperial Animal; and there has been much (however simple-minded) guf- 16.

Ardrey argues, for example, that private property is the kind of cultural in- stitution which is likely to succeed, because it "accords with natural law"-by which, apparently, he means the territorial imperative (p. 210). 18.

Somit adds that "there is, moreover, the danger that the term 'biopolitics' will be identified with Thorson's philosophic position, one hardly shared by most of those working in this area." Op cit., p. 212.</page><page sequence="11">250 Review-Articles fawing, in certain academic circles, about books about animals having been written by a medley of fox, lion, robin, and tiger.20 This book is ad- dressed to the same theme Ardrey pursued: what are the zoological limits to the range of political adaptation possible for an animal that so recently has learned so well how to exploit for short-range satisfactions the very environment that now appears insufficient, even in the short-range (geo- logically speaking) future, to support the survival of the human species? The evidence upon which Tiger and Fox rely does not differ, in any impor- tant way, from that which Ardrey selected; but their conclusions frequently vary from his, often for ideological reasons. They differ, for example, not only on the major thesis of the Ardrey book (concerning the implications of ethology for political equality), but also in regard to such perhaps lesser matters as their attitudes towards male juveniles in contemporary society. True to his model, Ardrey articulates the old grayback feeling that young males are trouble-making competitors for dominant status, who fail to appreciate how much their superiors have done in order for them to have been able to survive at all. Tiger and Fox, to the contrary, express very empathetic views toward young men (and are equivalently unsympathetic toward the different phenotypic type that is composed of post-reproductive females). A more conspicuous but possibly related distinction lies in that Ardrey is hung up on the spook of "territoriality," whereas Tiger and (as his co-author in this book) Fox are hung up with masculinity-almost to the same extent as Betty Friedan, but in the opposite direction: for them male chauvinism is not merely a matter of social ethics, but rather it is genetically determined by the basic biogrammar. They opine, for example, that the rituals of male dominance in politics appear to be as necessary and inevitable as the tail of the peacock or the dance of the fruit fly" (p. 101). As for the extent to which their tone is "male chauvinist," I'm going to assert flatly that the book is full of it, frequently in connection with dis- cussions of "male bonding" (=sex=politics=dominance =various other things, as discussed below). Indeed, all-male grouping and male "bond- ing" are homosexual by definition. Let me first present a few examples of Tiger-Fox male chauvinism, to suggest the flavor of their argument, then discuss the bonding issue. "The philosophy of the human primate male ... is to get to the top of the male hierarchy and so control the females of his own group in order to exchange them for females of another group-thus achieving sexual satisfaction and 20. One's amusement is enhanced by the observation, however ad hominem, that from a phenotypic point of view the pair consists of a somewhat little tiger and a rather big fox. Moreover, we find represented, from an ethological point of view, both of the surviving species of great feline carnivores, plus a bird well known for his aggressive defense of that bit of territory that he deems his own.</page><page sequence="12">Review-Articles 251 political advantage" (p. 86, emphasis in the original). Alternatively, "the primeval liquid asset [is] women" (p. 124). "War and fighting and the hunt have always been the business of human males, just as the protection of the troop is the business of male primates. Women are always a poten- tial source of disruption to the unity, loyalty, and trust necessary to com- rades in arms" (p. 57). (The next sentence is: "Far from belittling the strength and importance of women, this affirms it"; but I don't see how.) "No woman is as important to any man as men are to one another" (p. 93). In business, "women, usually seen as disruptive to its enterprise, are there only to serve in some way" (p. 137). And "for every woman who claims that politics (or war) is as much her game as any man's, there are a thousand women who would feel much more comfortable with a man at the helm" (p. 99). "There is no particular reason why females must be part of formal politics" (p. 144)-and here the authors must be referring to biological reasons, in view of the evident constitutional reasons for women's suffrage in Canada, England, and the United States alike (to take only the three countries that the authors know best). But at least, however sexist Tiger and Fox may seem to be, they are not also racist, because "sex differences are important biologically and tangible behaviorally, whereas racial ones are unimportant biologically and meaningless behaviorally" (p. 146). Except for the hard-nosed line on sex of a book that might better have been called The Imperial MALE Animal, the posture of these authors is (unlike that of Ardrey) tender rather than tough-minded, col- lectivist rather than individualist, and liberal rather than conservative. The ideological dimension on which Fox and Tiger are positively correlated with Ardrey is that of authoritarianism. Because this is a literary more than a scientific book, one thinks of liter- ary criteria in terms of which to appraise its merits. The model that comes ineluctably to mind is the social philosophy, propounded in his writing as in his life-style, of Ernest "Papa" Hemingway, America's most cele- brated writer during most of the middle decades of this century until his ritual suicide-in emulation of the example that had been set by his own father-a decade ago. In Hemingway we find most stridently glorified, as the symbols most meet for depicting twentieth century American culture: hunting, war, and blatant masculinity (frequently associated with male sexual impotence).21 Tiger and Fox project a similar, and correspondingly romantic, image of human nature. Their fundamental biological postulate is by now quite familiar to us: 21. Max Eastman has said that Hemingway's style of writing reminded one of the wearing of "false hair on the chest": see Eastman's "Bull in the Afternoon," The New Republic. 75 (June 7, 1933), 96.</page><page sequence="13">252 Review-Articles "we still have the old primate body molded into a hunting machine by the savanna experience .... [and] there has not been time for an agricultural or an industrial brain or body to evolve" (p. 127, emphasis added). And they ride the metaphor of the hunting band sufficiently hard that, in appar- ent rejection of both Jefferson and Marx, Tiger and Fox suggest that Her- bert Spencer's ideal is not only savage but noble as well: "In the capitalist, or free-enterprise, economy the entrepreneur is given free play for his predatory tendencies. His small-farmer cousin may be nearer the soil but the urban businessman is nearer his own biology. Outside the teen-age gang, the outlaw band, or the military platoon, that delight of the theo- retical economist's dream of perfect competition, the small firm, is the nearest thing we have today to the hunting band" (p. 136). Of course such a surrogate scene has its limitations; as the authors make clear, "the only possible Utopia, in our perspective, would lie in a return to a simple hunting existence" (p. 238). They concede, although with regret, that that is impossible; but the consistency of their point of view is confirmed only two pages later by their proffering a defense of feudalism, on grounds of scale as well as those that it was "almost primate in its certainty." We know that concepts such as "gene pool" must be operationalized in population genetics in order for statistical measurements and predictions to become possible; but in Tiger and Fox statements of relationships are at the level of assertations such as: "The most democratic communities are those based on the commonality of the human gene pool" (p. 135). Perhaps, in this context, "gene pool" is a misprint for "genie pool"; but in either case it is non sequitur as a generalization about political behavior. There is evidently substantial evidence to support such an hypothesis as that genotypic heterogeneity is positively correlated with the probability of adaptation for a species confronting escalation in the rate and direction of ecological change. The (statistical) proof rests on the presumption that, because it is not possible to specify in advance precisely which character- istics and potential mutations may prove to be most critical to species sur- vival under conditions that cannot be predicted in detail, the best genetic strategy is diversification of the population universe within which selec- tive choice can operate. But it makes no sense to speak of any extant com- munity of human phenotypes-with the possible exception of a few iso- lated primitive tribes in New Guinea mountain or Amazon headwater en- claves-as being "based on the human [which, if it means anything, must mean the species] gene pool"; the remark comes at least eighty-to-ninety thousand, probably half a million, and possibly several million years too late. And so far as concerns the causal relationship between demes (at least, in the biological sense) and democracy, it is perhaps sufficient for present purposes to point out that Tiger and Fox suggest neither relevant</page><page sequence="14">Review-Articles 253 evidence nor even a plausible argument. Certainly Tiger and Fox do not define anywhere in this book what they mean by "gene pool" (or by "de- mocracy" either, for that matter); so how either can affect the other, other than as an aspect of linquistic (not bio) grammar, is left up to the reader's imagination. Much of the discussion about the imperial animal is based upon his so- cial "bonds," among the most important of which are said to be mother- child, male-male(s), and male-female. But neither the maternal, the male, nor the mating bond is anywhere defined, other than in loose verbal terms, and then mostly by exemplification. The closest the authors come to a gen- eral definition is the following: "All social acts are patterned. They are as nonrandom as our physical structures. The patterns of social relationships into which they are formed can be predicted and explained. They are major regularities of the species-of any species. They can be called bonds" (p. 58). But what a bond is, and how it operates biologically, remains a mystery. Certain of the authors' examples are less than helpful in clarifying the innate nature of the bonding process: for example, "have soldiers around, and they will quickly bond with entrepreneurs and politicians" (p. 219). "Bonds" seem to have something to do with "blocks"; but in view of the circumstance that "blocks" also are left un- defined, we are left with the not very helpful assertion that among humans as among other primates, "the major division is into three 'blocks'-the male block, the female-with-young block, and the adolescent-male block" (p. 114). Tiger's earlier book, Men in Groups,22 dwells at considerable length upon the male bond. Therein one encounters (p. xiii) what is called the hypothesis "that the behaviour of men in groups in part reflects an under- lying biologically transmitted 'propensity' with roots in human evolution- ary history (or phylogeny)," or in other words, that the male bond is a "predetermined or biological factor." And in his concluding remarks he states that a logical theoretical consequence of the acceptance of his hy- pothesis would be the addition of the male bond to the list of other univer- sal human needs (such as sex, food, shelter, and social interactions). He does provide what he calls a definition (pp. 19-21) but it remains at a slippery verbal level: "Male bonding among primates is defined here as a particular relationship between two or more males such that they react differently to members of their bonding unit as compared to individuals outside of it.... [B]onding is a process the outcome of which involves specific individuals recognizing other individuals as directly and distinctly relevant to themselves." Tiger seems to put himself into contradiction with 22. Lionel Tiger, Men in Groups (New York: Random House, 1969).</page><page sequence="15">254 Review-Articles Ardrey's theory of primate leadership (in which the alphas are the largest, strongest, and most aggressive mature males, who therefore dominate the group), when he remarks (pp. 46-47) that "whatever it is that distin- guishes bond from non-bond males-and neither size nor strength them- selves provide that distinction-bonding among most primates is a clear correlate of productive copulation." 23 But eventually he admits (p. 152) that: "I do not know what kind of biological mechanisms would operate should there in fact be a biological basis for [all-male human groups]. It is difficult to specify the central constituent of the bonding process. That is, of course, the critical gap in the argument." The anthropologist who reviewed this book for Science concluded that "male bonding, it would seem, is some kind of behavioral phlogiston." 24 Politics itself is understood by Tiger and Fox to be a crucial-and a pe- culiarly human-adaptation. In one sense, it is very much like sexual ardor, gathering its "primitive energy from the same evolutionary source" because "both are products of that blind, persistent struggle for dominance and reproductive advantage that is the primal energy of evolution in the animal world" (pp. 47-48), and "sex and politics are two sides of the same evolutionary coin" (p. 55). However, when Tiger and Fox speak of sexual ardor and blind passion, they are really talking not about sex but about genetics: "politics is about genetics, not sex per se" (p. 28). Consequently, "The political process ... is, in evolutionary terms, a breeding process" (pp. 24-25). Breeding produced progeny which could, from the point of view of a dominant male, supply juvenile males for recruitment to his group, and females for purposes of exchange as, among humans at some stage, "a new phenomenon of cooperation between groups came into play for the exploitation of larger hunting territories" or to protect vested inter- ests in those already possessed (p. 88, emphasis in the original). Tiger and Fox think that the origins of the political process lie in this bartering pro- cess (with females as the unit of exchange) together with the very much older human practice of cooperation among the (bonded [sic]) members of the hunting band. Dominant males could thereby "control the future ... by peopling it with their own offspring" (p. 37). When politics is defined thus broadly in terms of sexual reproduction, it does indeed become inti- mately related to the evolutionary process. But it also, and regrettably 23. In an intervening article, Tiger defines dominance as "the pattern of biological differentiation related to reproductive success." Op. cit. fn. 1, supra, at p. 295. Ard- rey agrees: subordinant male primates fornicate, but they do not reproduce. Evi- dently, in this regard there is a direct contradiction between the behavior of other primates and that of humans in contemporary industrialized societies. 24. Morton Fried, "Mankind Excluding Woman," Science (N.S.) (August 29, 1969), 165: 884.</page><page sequence="16">Review-Articles 255 from the point of view of conceptual clarity, becomes virtually indistin- guishable from what Tiger described in Men in Groups as "productive copulation." As humans withdrew from the hunting way of life in favor of more sed- entary occupations, power as status began to displace, at least in part, power as the capacity to reproduce. The authors deplore, but they have no biological explanation for, this "new version of the old game" (p. 36). Consequently, they can provide no biological explanation for the political process as it operates in contemporary political societies. They do indicate, repetitiously, their personal preference for what they call "a true democ- racy, not because it renders all men equal, but because it gives them an equal chance to become unequal" (p. 43). But the logic with which their preference is justified impresses me as less than compelling. "Human political systems," they tell us, "are based on hierarchy and competition for status ... [and] the process which gives rise to empire is the very same process that primates engage in simply in order to exist and persist" (pp. 32-33). And it is easy to see how ones who make that pre- sumption can indulge in such metaphors as "votes are the canine teeth and threat display of democratic politics" (p. 42), even if this does seem to be a rather pale manifestation of "nature red in tooth and claw." What is less obvious is how the authors justify, in exactly two pages, the inclusion of egalitarianism, in what they call the "basic political biogrammar" (p. 44), as "a statement about the [human] animal and the conditions of its evolu- tion" to which "any political system is going to have to face up." The rele- vant statement (that organisms "should have a roughly equal chance to compete") is normative rather than empirical and seems to be premised on the patently cultural (and unsupported) remark that "what true demo- cratic theory advocates is simply that the basis for ... striving should not be arbitrary, that the criteria for being a competitor should not be fixed at birth by class, sex, or color; that people should be allowed to dominate other people on their merits and not on the basis of factors beyond their control." 25 I have emphasized "on their merits" because I wish to ask: what are their merits, in a biological sense, other than precisely these arbi- trary phenotypic characteristics (of parentage, sex, and race) that have been determined, invariably, by their biogrammar? If "the merits" are not to be found in inherited characteristics, then they must result from environ- mental influences, such as those that certain zoologists and psychologists 25. This statement, which is unsupported, follows on the heels of the evidently empirical generalization that "a political society... is a system that allows orga- nisms to strive for inequality-a system rooted in the evolutionary process"; and for this they do cite Ardrey, with apparent approval.</page><page sequence="17">256 Review-Articles study under the rubric of "learning." But why is there any greater virtue- and particularly from a biological point of view-in acquired characteris- tics (which, generally speaking, cannot be transmitted) over those charac- teristics which have been selected by evolution precisely because of their adaptive value for the preservation of the species? Tiger and Fox get their biological premises all mixed up with their humanistic sympathies. For example, this claim near the end of their book that they have documented, in their discussion of the human hunting evolution, how what were earlier simply human needs subsequently became, in postcivilized conditions, human rights; and among these they list "a chance to rise in status through merit" (p. 238). They did mention cooperative behavior within the band; but that of course concerns the substitution of submissive (subdominant) for competitive behaviors, and we are here dealing with ascendant changes within the status hierarchy. Otherwise what they showed about the hunting band suggests that merit consisted of happening to be older (or, in certain circumstances, younger), or male (or again, in other circumstances, fe- male), or stronger, or faster, or more aggressive, or having been born without significant physiological defects, or in not becoming injured. No other criterion of merit for rising in status in the hunting band is mentioned by the authors; and none is obvious to me. But I think it is clear that Tiger and Fox have attempted to palm off one of their own value preferences as though these were genetically programmed for our entire species. The only legitimate criterion of merit, from the point of view of biologi- cal (evolutionary) theory, is the facilitation of species adaptability. And quite apart from the animistic notions that abound in (and confound) so much of the Tiger and Fox book (to say nothing of the Ardrey books), statistical probability, neither more nor less, is the cold, dispassionate ar- biter of both ecological change and the adaptation (or failure to do so) of various species in relation thereto. Contrary to the opinion of these authors, "Nature" has no "scheme for making sure that animals do what is neces- sary for their survival" (p. 32); and there is no "biological necessity ... that every effort be made to preserve every member" of the human species (p. 182), either now or in the past. Over ninety-nine percent of all the animal species that have ever evolved are no longer extant; and Nature takes no interest in whether any particular species-to say nothing of any particular individual phenotype!-happens to die sooner, or later. As for humans, it suffices to observe that cannibalism has apparently been prac- ticed widely throughout much of our existence as a species, usually as the only certain method of population control in the face of scarce resources. It is tautologically true that what "Nature" does assure is that, on the aver- age, in the long run, with rare exceptions, et cetera, animals that do not do what is necessary for their survival do not survive; hence most propagation</page><page sequence="18">Review-Articles 257 is done by, and hence genetic preferment is given to, those animals that do do what is necessary-not necessarily for them as individual phenotypes, but rather for the deme unit of the species-to survive. Humanistic ideol- ogy has indeed, and during relatively quite recent times, expounded the ethic that human life should be preserved as much as possible, not because of any biological necessity, but because many articulate humans who were products of a particular cultural heritage and social experience agreed with this value as a tenet of public policy. Bertrand Russell pointed out seventy years ago that the world science presents for our belief is purposeless and void of meaning; but "amid such a world, if anywhere, our ideals hencefor- ward must find a home." 26 And "merit" in the form of egalitarian relation- ships among humans is a consequence of our ideals, not of our genetic heritage from the hunting band. Nor does it advance the cause of egalitari- anism to indulge in romantic fancies that God, Nature, or our genes will take care of the matter-thereby relieving us of the responsibility to choose and act effectively within the limits that have been biologically de- termined. There are seeming differences in the attitudes towards animism and vitalism; that is, towards the scientific posture as this was articulated by Lord Russell, manifested by Tiger and Fox, on the one hand, and however ambiguously (as we shall soon observe) by Monod. It may come as some- thing of a surprise, therefore, to discover that Tiger and Fox chose to sym- bolize their argument by beginning with a frontis quotation from Jacques Monod ("Every living being is also a fossil" [Monod, p. 160, emphasis in the original]); while Monod himself begins-advertising his ambivalence -with Democritus and Albert Camus. But it is Tiger who has pointed out to us that Karl Marx offered to dedicate Das Kapital to Charles Darwin.27 III. The Politics of Zoociology Desmond Morris' Naked Ape is a zoociological analysis of human behav- ior from the point of view of the comparative primatology of contemporary species. Morris is a professional zoologist with a doctorate in ethology from Oxford, where he worked with Niko Tinbergen. The approach of his book is straightforward as he discusses seriatim, human evolution (in a single 26.

Lionel Tiger, "Biology, Rhetoric, Reform: The Allure of Low-Born High Ideals" (Washington, D.C.: American Political Science Association, paper presented to Panel 12-10, September 5, 1972), p. 4.</page><page sequence="19">258 Review-Articles chapter in which he tells the story in much simpler, more direct, better inte- grated, and more complete terms than either Ardrey or Tiger and Fox), and then human mating, rearing, playing, fighting and fleeing, feeding, grooming (including healing), and finally human behavior toward other animals. What he presents in considerable (though highly selective) detail is a description of how humans, to some extent as compared with other primates, behave in carrying out the largely genetically-determined psy- cho-physiological functions listed above. Much of what he has to say and much of this book, therefore, are less directly and obviously relevant to the study of politics, both in the style of his presentation and in its substance, than what we found to be true of either the political dramatist or the political anthropologists whom we have considered thus far; Morris, like Monod (below), is concerned with human social behavior writ large, and only incidentally with its political implications or forms. Indeed, Morris has begun to emerge as England's Vance Packard as he has become in- creasingly preoccupied during the past decade and a half with the popu- larization of zoological knowledge, for a mass lay audience. Thus he has written several books for children; his subsequent book on human social behavior in modern industrialized, urbanized environments28 has-and as I think, surprisingly-less to contribute to biopolitics than does Naked Ape; while a more recent book focuses exclusively upon human sexual behavior.29 His title reflects the circumstance that of 193 extant primate species, humans are unique in their relative hairlessness. Morris attributes this condition, together with a good many other peculiarities (in relation to other primates) of human structure, to neoteny-the life-long retention by genetic adaptation of certain characteristics which in other primates are present only during embryonic or infantile stages of development; such characteristics were selected because of their survival value for earlier hominids and for humans, whose functions and behavior were forced to change (during recent epochs) by adverse changes in the environment. "The fact," says Morris, "that so many separate embryonic characteristics were potentially valuable to the hunting ape in his new role was the evolu- tionary breakthrough he needed" (p. 34). Among other human char- acteristics that are not shared with other primates are predation, and the establishment of relatively fixed residence (which entails, incidentally, a human pest not shared by other primates: fleas). Morris' objective is the same, in general, as we found to be true of Ardrey and of Tiger and Fox. "Many exciting species have become extinct 28. The Human Zoo (New York: McGraw-Hill, 1969). 29. Intimate Behavior (New York: Random House, 1971).</page><page sequence="20">Review-Articles 259 in the past," he tells us, "and we are no exception. Sooner or later we shall go, and make way for something else." This puts him in Russell's camp, but-and in perfect accord with that position-there remains some scope for human choice, and influence: "If it is to be later rather than sooner, then we must take a long, hard look at ourselves as biological specimens and gain some understanding of our limitations.... [B] y recog- nizing them clearly and submitting to them, we shall stand a much better chance of survival.... [W]e should tailor our intelligent opportunist advances to our basic behavioral requirements" (pp. 240-241). The evolutionary model that he invokes is the one that we have been consid- ering: from our primate ancestry we derive our competitiveness and our need for dominance relationships, while from our half million years of socialization in the hunting band we inherit our capacity for cooperation. In relation to the ethological research data, Tiger and Fox worked at second hand, of course, whereas Morris (like Ardrey) has had a fair amount of firsthand research experience-with the difference that Morris (unlike Ardrey) is a trained observer. However, while Ardrey's observa- tions are of animals in more-or-less natural environments,30 Morris is an aquarium and zoo-watcher.31 Nevertheless, Morris shares Ardrey's dis- dain for findings based on the field observations of cultural anthropolo- gists: "The work done by these investigators was, of course, extremely interesting and most valuable in showing us what can happen when a group of naked apes becomes side-tracked into a cultural blind alley.... The simple tribal groups that are living today are not primitive, they arc stultified" (p. 10). Morris wrote his doctoral dissertation on the sex life of fish, and more particularly his laboratory experiments on pseudofemale behavior on the part of subdominant male ten-spined sticklebacks during the act of mating.32 With this kind of start, it was perhaps inevitable that when he turned to human behavior he would retain a lively interest in sex. But there is a sharp difference between Tiger and Fox' preoccupation with 30. Viz., in game parks. As one who has had somewhat similar experiences in several South African game parks (Kruger, Umfolozi, Hluhluwe, and Mkuze, among others) I can attest that animal life there cannot be the same as remaining "Born Free," although it still of course resembles a wild habitat far more closely in most respects than it resembles a zoo. 31. Perhaps this explains why he chose to call his next book, about the strains of the modern urban environment, on the old naked ape's biological heritage, The Human Zoo-a phrase that he thinks far more apt than such more common alter- natives as "concrete jungle." (In Morris' opinion, any kind of jungle would be far less stressing to us than our zoo is! Op. cit. fn. 28, supra, p. 8.) 32. Cf. Desmond Morris, "Homosexuality in the ten-spined stickleback," Be- haviour, 4 (1952), 233-261.</page><page sequence="21">260 Review-Articles masculinity (and the social aspects of sex), and Morris' much more inti- mate focus on heterosexual transactions in the behavior of human mating pairs, whom Morris refers to, incidentally, as sharing a "bond" relation- ship. Morris is generally enthusiastic about whatever comes naturally to what he calls "the sexiest primate alive" (p. 63), and his principal effort is to encourage contemporary humans to escape the still-frequent cultural restraints which wrongly (from the point of the mental and physical health of the organism) discourage human phenotypes from indulging their pri- mate inclinations. But there is one aspect of this that obviously troubles him: the all-too-frequent (nowadays) outcome of heterosexual activity between humans: overpopulation. He does at one point say that under conditions of population over-crowding, the rule of biological morality (which he states to be that "no sexual practice ... can be criticized bio- logically providing it does not hinder general reproductive success") must be reversed (p. 99); but regrettably, he lets the matter drop at that, and apart from occasional further (and lamenting) references to the problem of world overpopulation, he continues to praise the virtues of the human sex act. Unless I have completely misunderstood him, uninhibited copu- lation for keeps-that is to say, effective reproduction-is precisely the rule of the old biological morality; and if that rule were to be reversed, I should think that this logically would involve a discussion of those cultural constraints which would be most compatible with the biological heritage and yet still facilitate the goal of unproductive copulation. Such a discus- sion might at least have provided political scientists with some raw material (for the political process) upon which they might begin to work. But Morris has nothing to offer. He suggests that the limitation (apparently voluntary) of offspring to an average of no more than 2+ per mating pair would result in a stabilization of the species population at its present level. Certainly this advice amounts to nothing new; and I think it is apparent to anyone, with even a rudimentary familiarity with the socioeconomic and political dynamics of world population growth and their projections, that it amounts also to nothing much. He does speak of other methods of de-population, such as war and the colonization of other planets; and he does state that "the best solution for ensuring world peace is the widespread promotion of contraception or abortion" (p. 178); but neither political scientists nor the lay public need a zoologist to tell them such things. It is, of course, pertinent for him as a zoologist to tell us that when fighting actually occurs among animals in a primate group, it "is used not only to sort out dominance disputes, but also to increase the spacing-out of the members of a species" (p. 126), especially since this entails the im- plication that "if our populations go on increasing at their present terrify- ing rate, uncontrolled aggressiveness will become dramatically increased"</page><page sequence="22">Review-Articles 261 (p. 177). It is also relevant for him to point out in regard to other species of animals, both wild and domestic, "any species which competes with us for food or space, or interferes with the efficient running of our lives, is ruthlessly eliminated.... Virtually any animal that is either inedible or symbiotically useless is attacked and exterminated.... In the past our closest primate relatives have been our most threatening rivals and it is no accident that today we are the only species surviving in our entire family" (pp. 222-223). Furthermore, "if our numbers continue to increase at the present frightening rate, it will eventually become a matter of choosing between us and them... [and] when our own species density reaches a certain pitch, there will be no space left for other animals" (p. 239, em- phasis added). Of course this is precisely what is in rapid process of happening to African wild life, and particularly big game, which is already crowded into enclaves that within another generation will have become what they already inchoately are: outdoor zoos. As for domestic animals, the horse has disappeared in rural areas, and only a token population survives now for sport use; while dogs are rapidly being exterminated from urban areas that can afford them space for neither exercise nor the elimina- tion of their bodily wastes. Morris deflates also the romantic notion that at least a few animals will be kept around as a protein source of human food: it is much more efficient to consume vegetables directly rather than in the form of animal flesh, but even the former luxury will have to be foregone, in his opinion, because population pressures will force a shift to exclusive reliance upon the even more efficient synthetic foods as the only feasible socialized answer to Malthus' problem. It is unlikely, however, that we shall ever universalize, for an earth population of some 400 billion (a population density of 11,000 humans per square mile of land earth sur- face) by about the year 2222, even the present technology for moon- rocket food preparation (including the recycling of human excretions), because "long before our populations reach the levels envisaged above we shall have broken so many of the rules that govern our biological nature that we shall have collapsed as a dominant species" (p. 240). Otherwise what he has to say that is relevant here concerns either aggression or dominance. He confirms that most "primate species are violently dictatorial in their social organization" (p. 147). However, "the proper business of intra-specific aggression ... is [at the biological level] the subduing and not the killing of the enemy" p. 175). Dominators are appeased and submission is evidenced, among primates, by genetically- not merely culturally-approved postures, gestures, and sounds; and this helps to explain why intra-specific aggression produces such ghastly (and uninhibited) consequences in modern warfare: "attacking is done from such a distance that the appeasement signals of the losers cannot be read</page><page sequence="23">262 Review-Articles by the winners, [and] then violent aggression is going to go raging on... and the result is wholesale slaughter on a scale unheard of in any other species" (p. 175). Apt examples will no doubt come readily to mind. His detailed knowledge of appeasement behaviors leads Morris to ven- ture a biological interpretation of human interactions with postulated supernatural beings: "in a behavioral sense, religious activities consist of the coming together of large groups of people to perform repeated and prolonged submissive displays to appease a dominant individual.... The submissive responses to it may consist of closing the eyes, lowering the head, clasping the hands together in a begging gesture, kneeling, kissing the ground, or even extreme prostration, with the frequent accompaniment of wailing or chanting vocalizations.... Because the dominant figure's powers are so great, the appeasement ceremonies have to be performed at frequent intervals, to prevent its anger from rising again" (p. 179). Both fundamentalists, who have presumed a rather different implication for religion of "descent from monkeys," and free thinkers, to say nothing of those concerned with the functioning of political societies that contain both groups and points of view, may be shocked by Morris' suggestion that religious behavior results directly from "our fundamental biological tendency, inherited directly from our monkey and ape ancestors, to submit ourselves to an all-powerful, dominant member [real or fancied] of the group" (p. 180). IV. The Politics of the Genetic Code33 Monod's book is by far the most difficult to read-and in some respects to appreciate-of the four under review in this essay. In part this reflects the complexity of his subject matter, which deals not with the interactions among organisms but rather with the structure and processes of life within a living cell, thereby making it necessary for him to rely upon a technical (and to most political scientists, a somewhat unfamiliar) vocabulary. But in part it reflects also the precision of his style (in contrast to the more free-wheeling modes of writing customary to Ardrey and to Tiger and Fox, and evidently congenial to Morris) plus the circumstance that I am commenting upon the English translation of what he wrote in French. In 1965 he received a Nobel prize for his work on the replication of genes and the synthesis of protein macromolecules, and the bulk of this 33. For a very different kind of "politics of the genetic code" than that discussed herein, see the autobiographic account of the politics of scientific discovery in- volved in the decoding of DNA: James D. Watson, The Double Helix (New York: Atheneum, 1968).</page><page sequence="24">Review-Articles 263 book is on precisely the same subject(s). The author's intended political contribution-and he most avowedly has one-is normative rather than (like the bulk of his book) empirical. To at least his American publisher, Alfred A. Knopf, should go the 1971 prize for Perverse Parsimony for having brought out a two-hundred-page book, patently complex enough to require no less than four technical appendices, with no index. Monod tells us that he wrote his book because of his belief that the molecular theory of the genetic code now constitutes a general theory of living systems, which ought to be brought affirmatively to public notice. Even a generation ago, it remained true that the theory of evolution, although long since generally accepted as phenomenologically valid, was plateaued in development by the lack of a physical theory of heredity (that is, "concepts relevant to the chemical structure of hereditary material and the information it conveys [and] also the molecular mechanisms for expressing this information morphogenetically and physiologically") (p. xii). His thesis is that the biosphere, as it has evolved historically and as it is understood to be empirically today, is unpredictable, consisting of par- ticular events that are compatible with the new genetic theory of evolution but not deductible from it, for statistical reasons relating to genetic structures and processes. "The universe," as he remarks, "was not preg- nant with life nor the biosphere with man" (pp. 145-146). Three general properties characterize living beings: teleonomy, auton- omus morphogenesis, and reproductive invariance. (Inanimate objects lack all three of these properties; crystals lack only the first, teleonomy.) Teleonomy, which depends chemically upon the activity of proteins, is defined by Monod to mean having some (viz., a particular) purpose (characteristic to its species), which living beings "exhibit in their struc- ture and carry out through their performances" (p. 9). By "autonomous morphogenesis" Monod means a precise, rigorous determinism "implying a virtually total 'freedom' with respect to outside agents or conditions- which are capable, to be sure, of impeding this development, but not of governing or guiding it, not of prescribing its organizational scheme to the living object" (pp. 10-11). Whereas at one point Monod states that spontaneous structuration (one of several pseudonyms for autonomous morphogenesis) ought really "to be considered a mechanism"-of which more later-rather than, indeed, a characteristic property (like teleonomy and reproductive invariance) of living beings (pp. 16-17), he remarks later that (as is also true of teleonomy) "the molecules involved are essentially if not uniquely proteins" (p. 46). Reproductive invariance, which he refers to also as "genetic invariance," is linked exclusively to nucleic acids (rather than to proteins), and he defines it to mean the ability</page><page sequence="25">264 Review-Articles of living beings "to reproduce and to transmit ne varietur the information corresponding to their own structure" (p. 12). The three properties are said to be "closely interconnected in all living beings" (p. 16), indeed to such an extent that the "fundamental teleonomic project" is "invariant reproduction" (p. 15). Although it is the subject of chapter five, the second property (autonomous morphogenesis) is frequently left out of discussions of the elements of evolution, reliance instead being placed upon what Monod tends to refer to as "the two properties characteristic of living beings: invariance and teleonomy" (p. 23, emphasis added, cf. p. 139) which, to add somewhat to the seeming terminological complexity (if not confusion), also both turn out to be-like autonomous morpho- genesis, as it was initially stigmatized-"mechanical" in character (p. 139, Monod's quotes). In any case invariance necessarily precedes teleonomy, because "the initial appearance, evolution, and steady refinement of ever more intensely teleonomic structures are due to perturbations occurring in a structure which already possesses the property of invariance-hence is capable of preserving the effects of chance and thereby submitting them to the play of natural selection" (pp. 23-24). So, what goes on at the macromolecular level of life? Spontaneous and autonomous morphogenesis depends "upon the stereospecific recognition properties of proteins," although "it remains uncertain whether the recog- nition is of individual molecular shapes or of multimolecular surface patterns" (pp. 81, 88). Proteins are linear sequences of amino acid residues (of which there are only twenty different such), linked by covalent bonds (which means that they do share electronic orbitals); but every globular protein folds into the maximally compact three-dimensional structure due to noncovalent bonds34 between the amino acid residues, which determine the folding pattern "including the exact shape of the stereospecific binding sites by which the molecule performs its recognition activity" (p. 91). Although there is as yet no working theory of macro- scopic phenomena (ranging from cells through tissues and organs to organisms), these are "viewed as integrated results of multiple micro- scopic interactions due to proteins, and as deriving from the stereospecific 34. We are back to "bonding," but unlike the previous authors whom we have considered, Monod does provide quite explicit operational definitions. Covalent bonds are much the more stable and durable; whereas noncovalent bonds-several classes of interactions that do not entail the sharing of electron orbitals-occur "spontaneously and very rapidly, at low temperature, and in the absence of cata- lysts" (p. 57, emphasis in the original). Initial conditions (of aqueous phase, tem- perature range, ionic composition, etc.) also contribute to the determination of the unique shape of each globular protein.</page><page sequence="26">Review-Articles 265 recognition properties belonging to those proteins, by way of the spontan- eous forming of noncovalent complexes" (p. 88). Now the "genetic determinism of certain polynucleotides (DNA, RNA) exclusively specifies the sequence of amino acid residues that define a given protein;35 and although whatever that sequence may be it is strictly determined by the genetic code, nevertheless all such sequences are equally strictly random in structure. That is to say, "every primary protein structure looks like the product of a random choosing from among the twenty available residues," but "the very same order it contains is reproduced, practically without error, in all the molecules of the pro- tein under consideration" so that the consequence is "invariance of the structure" (p. 97). Monod tells us that we learn what each protein is by observing its function (that is, by learning what it does); we cannot learn its "nature" from its structure because that was originally chosen in a completely arbitrary, purposeless, random manner. Hence, in the origin and development "of a functional protein are reflected the origin and descent of the whole biosphere" (p. 98). And by this he means explicitly that because not only of our origins-either at the macroscopic level of organisms, or at the level of protein synthesis-but also half a million years of species experience, and half a billion years of experience as an animal, plus two to three billion years experience of development from (and now including) the modern cell: both our origin and our evolution must be attributed to pure chance, and therefore also whatever changes we may undergo as a species in the future will also be due to the same dumb luck to which we owe our present being. At least, I infer this to be the only prognosis consistent with his analysis and argument, including his statement that "chance alone is at the source of every innovation, of all creation in the biosphere. Pure chance, absolutely free but blind, at the very root of the stupendous edifice of evolution... is today the sole conceivable hypothesis, the only one that squares with observed and tested fact. And nothing warrants the supposition-or the hope-that on this score our position is likely ever to be revised." To which he adds, entirely appropriately, that "there is no scientific concept, in any of the sciences, more destructive of anthropocentrism than this .. ." (pp. 112-113). Monod points out that the logic of biological regulatory systems is analogous to that of computers, and therefore to the propositional algebra of George Boole. In the stereochemical language of the genetic code, each 35. Of some million different kinds of proteins-and of course there are a large quantity of each kind-in any human organism (p. 48), "to date we have a thor- oughly detailed knowledge of the three-dimensional structure of only some fifteen" (p. 47).</page><page sequence="27">266 Review-Articles DNA triplet (that is, a particular combination of three nucleic acids) specifies which amino acid is to be added at a particular point in the con- struction of the polypeptide chain of a protein molecule. But certain coding errors inevitably occur-again, by chance-because, as modern physics informs us, "no microscopic entity can fail to undergo quantum perturbations, whose accumulation within a macroscopic system will slowly but surely alter its structure" (p. 111). There are two types of such errors. In one sense every organism is a self-destructing enterprise, because "aging and death in pluricellular organisms is accounted for, at least in part, by the piling up of accidental errors of translation" (p. 111). But an even more radical source of uncertainty is found in the replication of the genetic material itself, because "A mutation is in itself... a quantum event, to which the principle of uncertainty applies" (p. 114)-and of course it also results from chance. Repeatedly he emphasizes that the genetic code system of protein synthesis makes living beings "intensely conservative"; and he remarks that "any mutation, considered individually, is a very rare event" (p. 120). But he also estimates that at the conception of each new generation of humans nowadays, from a hundred to a thousand billion mutations occur; and it is out of this "vast reservoir of fortuitous variability" that genetic change in our species is selected. But no such single mutation is necessarily decisive for a cell or for an organism; thus it has been established, both in theory and by laboratory experiment, that a simple mutation such as the substitution of one letter in the DNA code for another is reversible. "But any appreciable evolution, like the differentiation of two even very nearly related species, reflects a great many independent mutations successively accumulated in the parent species and then, still at random, recombined thanks to the 'gene flow' promoted by sexuality. Because of the number of independent events that produce it, such a phenomenon is for statistical reasons irreversible" (p. 123, em- phasis added). Monod's treatment of evolution at the level of human organisms is rela- tively brief and conventional. He agrees with Ardrey and Morris on the importance of cooperation as an adaptive characteristic in the hunting band (p. 162); and he emphasizes that intraspecific aggression in the form of tribal (or racial) warfare has been a principal (and unique to our species) evolutionary factor. He laments selection-in-reverse as a definite (though not very immediate) peril to the species, instead of making the argument that one might think flows logically from his macromolecular premises: that by increasing the diversity of the gene pool now, species survival in the future may (however unwittingly) be made more probable because there is no assurance that characteristics deemed to have high adaptative value in the present environment (or that of the recent past)</page><page sequence="28">Review-Articles 267 will remain so in the future, when the environment seems likely to be very different from today. Speaking historically, he remarks that it was our behavior that oriented selective pressures, and that "cultural traits themselves inevitably exerted their pressure upon the evolution of the genome." But cultural evolution no longer has any effect upon the genome because "selection has been done away with" (p. 162). This conclusion impresses me as utterly incom- patible with his micro-level premises, and patently wrong at the macro- scopic level to boot. Surely the "social ethic" that permits "genetic cripples [to] live long enough to reproduce" is itself "cultural" rather than "natural"; and if this is true, then the very "selection-in-reverse" that agitates Monod is an aspect of "cultural evolution." So if the species is in for some "degeneration" (as Monod puts it), this must be because of the effect of cultural evolution upon human evolution. One would think that Monod would be the first, not the last, to remember that evolution (whether described as "human" or as "cultural") is not simply a one-way street but is also a network of paths; it does not necessarily result in better- ment (except when that is defined in terms of the exclusive criterion of species survival); and it is by no means self-evident that such former cul- tural traits as infanticide and cannibalism (back in the days when natural selection really worked, by God) were of greater value to the species than are the contemporary humanitarian traits that trouble him. What really bothers him, however, is neither species degeneration, nor the population explosion, nor the destruction of the natural environment, nor even the "stock pile of megatons of nuclear power" (p. 164); and he never even mentions the Viet Nam War. The "much more deep-seated evil" is "one that besets the spirit" (p. 164). Monod is worried about the human soul. And the last dozen or so pages of his book turn into what is, in my opinion, a monstrous cop-out-although it is one that was fore- shadowed throughout his book. The emphasis upon teleonomy was not for nought; neither was the distinction, drawn initially in his opening para- graph, between the "objectivity" of physical nature and the "projectivity" of living beings, which he sees as a "paradox"-although it is, of course, only teleonomy in one of its many guises. The book is a cop-out in a double sense: the resurrection of the soul to grace the anxieties of a creature spawned by a biosphere that obeys, at virtually every level examined in this book, only the laws of chance, tends to convert the whole joke from a pointless one into a shaggy dog story: and this is a betrayal of the spirit of the reader. Also throughout the book there are reiterated references to the subcellular life processes, of molecular con- struction and reproduction, as "mechanistic" and machine-like; and this, in my opinion, is a betrayal of the intellect of the reader. It is disillusioning</page><page sequence="29">268 Review-Articles to swallow the not-too-easily ingested bait of autonomous morphogenesis and reproductive invariance, and then end up wallowing in a sea of Gallic mystique. Monod recognizes that "nature is objective," as he frequently puts it; and among several alternative definitions that he offers, I prefer the first: that objective means "molded by the free play of physical forces to which we cannot attribute any design" (p. 3). One might think that anyone who could accept that life itself, to say nothing of humankind, was an accident, would have no superordinate difficulty in assimilating the random motiva- tions and selection criteria of the biosphere to nature thus defined as objec- tive; but not Monod. He sees life as projective, by which he explicitly means that it does have a purpose. He is caustically critical of both vitalists (who draw a radical distinction between living beings and the inanimate world) and animists (who posit a primal cause to rule the cosmos in addition to the biosphere), and various examples (including Bergson, Teilhard de Chardin, and Marx-Engels) are exposed. But he is also against logical positivism, on grounds not likely to impress political scientist readers as very sophisticated. He relies upon an extensive array of conceptual mysteries, or better said, of mysterious congeptions. Certain of these (adapt, select, evolve) are terms of art within the field of biology, and may well be no more ca- pable of being defined by biologists than it is possible for political scientists to define "power." But other of Monod's key concepts appear to have no particular biological content or associations; and it is these latter that crop up increasingly as we work our way through the legerdemain near the end of the book. I would argue that even "selective pressure" (p. 130) is, in context, what Bentley would have called a spook; but I have no doubts whatsoever about "the power of simulation" (p. 157), "soul" in "the modern soul's distress" (p. 169), " 'true' knowledge" (p. 173), "authen- ticity" ("the common ground where ethics and knowledge meet" [p. 175] ), and the "ethic of knowledge" (p. 138). Among various other con- siderations, that recommend what he calls its "transcendent" knowledge, is his statement that the ethic of knowledge is "the one at once rational and resolutely idealistic attitude upon which a real socialism might be built" (p. 179); indeed, such a "really scientific socialist humanism" stems from "the sources of science itself" and therefore ought to be accepted "as the foundation for social and political institutions" (p. 180, emphasis in the original). He also believes that objective experience must be tested against what he calls "the facts of subjective experience" (p. 146) rather than, as one might have expected, vice versa; and he argues that there is a genetic need for an explanation of the meaning of existence, "that this imperious need</page><page sequence="30">Review-Articles 269 develops spontaneously, that it is inborn, inscribed somewhere in the genetic code, strikes me as beyond doubt" (p. 167). For "how else," he argues, can we "account for the fact that in our species the religious phenomenon is invariably at the base of social structure?" (p. 168). The obvious reply is, of course, the same one that he himself provides in his discussion of human language: that it is rooted quite early in our experi- ence as a species, which invokes for us Morris' description of religious behavior as the appeasement gestures of subdominant primates. In regard to the mechanical metaphor that permeates the book, I pro- vide only two examples: "living beings, as we have seen, are closely com- parable to machines" (p. 8), and "the cell is indeed a machine" (p. 111). I believe this particular metaphor, clearly not essential to his explanation of genetic code processes, is most unfortunately chosen, for reasons well explained by Landau.36 But mechanism to Monod conveys a rather special meaning, because he equates it (p. 40) with being "objectively idealist" as well as with "vulgar materialism." Indeed, he states that the very genetic theory that he propounds in this book "is by definition an idealist theory, since it rests upon a postulate of invariance" (p. 40). Once I realized that he drew no distinction between mechanism and idealism, I could better un- derstand how it was possible for a microbiologist, professionally committed to the study of molecular interactions in a biosphere and a cosmos operat- ing through the throw of dice both great and small, to take refuge in an- thropomorphic vitalism37 for his social ethic and political philosophy. V. The Study of Biopolitical Behavior Whatever may be innate in human nature, there are certain customs that we tend to observe as we ritualize in our academic culture the growing pains that we experience as we involve ourselves in the stresses-including both the joys of discovery and the frustrations accompanying our inevitable sense of incompetence-that attend upon the birth of a new approach to the study of our discipline. Consequently it is quite normal that the initial stage of the emergence of biopolitical study should have been-as it cer- tainly was-marked by a not inconsiderable body of writing of a basically 36.

The American College Dictionary (New York: Random House, 1964), p. 1244, defines teleology as "the doctrine in vitalism that phenomena are guided not only by mechanical forces but they also move forward toward certain actualities."

Of course, that point of view does not apply to the authors-none of whom is, in any case, a political scientist-of the books under review in this essay; but I do wish to denote the perspective explicitly, so that I can the more clearly disassociate myself from it, in the remarks with which I intend to bring this discussion to a close. I presume that the time for exhortation should be about over; and instead, what I shall attempt to do now is to summarize the researchable ideas and hypotheses that are di- rectly deducible from my review of these books. I shall proceed by stating one general finding, and then turn to the consideration of three foci of research interest: the animal nature of primitive man; the animal nature of contemporary humans; and the political nature of genetics.38 The general finding concerns the kind of education that political scien- tists receive, in relation to available knowledge concerning the animal whose behavior constitutes the subject of their special study. Notwith- standing my criticism of these four books in fulfillment of the requirements of both my role and intellectual honesty, the recent research that they dis- cuss and cite39 points to the conclusion that there is now at hand a scientific theory of the state of nature (as well as of human nature), the acceptance of which necessarily will lead to the displacement of the myths about human origins that have adorned western culture through the efforts of such creative thinkers as Plato, the anonymous folk historians of Genesis, Hobbes, Rousseau, and such twentieth-century cultural anthropologists as Malinowski and Levi-Strauss.40 Of course, it is the responsibility of indi- vidual political scientists to choose whether they are persuaded that they 38. At the time when private foundation funds to support general research in political behavior are drying up, it is worth noting the availability of substantial public foundation monies to support research in the "Political Aspects of Popula- tion, Family Planning, and Reproduction Research." See the explicit invitation to political scientists, in the six-page single-spaced specification of "Research Problem Areas and Research Ideas," in the memorandum (titled as above) accompanying a broadcast letter, dated July 1972, and signed by Sidney H. Newman, Ph.D., Behav- ioral Scientist Administrator, Population and Reproduction Grants Branch, Center for Population Research, National Institute of Child Health and Human Develop- ment, of the Public Health Service, Department of Health, Education, and Welfare, Bethesda, Maryland, 20014. 39. In addition to footnote references (which are sparse except in Tiger and Fox), three of the books include more-or-less extensive bibliographies: Morris, 78 items; Ardrey, 322; and Tiger and Fox, an estimated 840; so after discounting for prob- able duplication of references, they still provide jointly a bibliography of what is probably more than a thousand items. 40. At least, Hobbes' description of the phenotypical existence of primitive man was right on target of the mark postulated by modern science: that the life of early humankind was "nasty, brutish, and short."'</page><page sequence="32">Review-Articles 271 ought to accept the new empirical view of human biology (both laterally through space and longitudinally through time) in preference to the fables about human nature that populate their present cognitive frames of refer- ence. But political scientists can have no option to make such a choice un- less they are motivated to examine the evidence on the other side of the question than that with which they already are familiar; and virtually all political scientists today were educated too soon to be more than tangen- tially privy to the view of human nature that is posited by modern paleon- tology, ethology, and microbiology. What we confront in these four books is in no sense a reincarnation of either social Darwinism or the kind of evolutionary thinking about politics that was shared by many of the politi- cal scientists who participated in the founding of our national association some two-thirds of a century ago. Many of the most important finds of hominoid (including both hominid and pongid) fossils occurred only dur- ing the past quarter of a century, and in any case methods of carbon four- teen and of argon dating-to say nothing of more powerful contemporary techniques-were not available before then; and as with paleontology, so with microbiology, primatology, and ethology: all are sciences that have undergone revolutionary changes during the last two decades-or else have evolved during that time. (We can always trace forebears and proto- types, of course, but I am speaking of the emergence of organized, acces- sible bodies of scientific knowledge: virtually nothing by Konrad Lorenz was available in English, for example, twenty years ago; and the bulk of his research, spanning the period 1931-1963, has appeared in translation only within the past couple of years.41) As we have seen, both Ardrey and Morris went out of their way to express disdain for the relevance of cultural anthropology as a source of insight into the nature of early man, on the grounds that analogies drawn from the behavior of contemporary primitives is foursquare with efforts to understand the psychology of normal humans on the basis of observations by clinical psychologists.42 But the shift in focus from ethnology to ethol- 41.

The compliment has been returned by an English anthropologist (pres- ently an associate curator of the Peabody Museum at Yale) who criticizes the "naked-ape syndrome" of human beastliness as a pseudo-ethological view of natural man's "aggressive, status-oriented, territorial and sexual behavior." "I would de- scribe these general arguments," he says, "as rubbish, and pernicious rubbish; they are based upon misrepresentation of ethological studies and a total ignorance of the rich variety of human behavior documented by anthropologists."

An</page><page sequence="33">272 Review-Articles ogy involves far more than the change from horizontal to longitudinal analysis of human behavior: study of the animal nature of primitive (or contemporary) humans requires that we learn something about animal be- havior. At least four possibilities are suggested by the ethological data that we have discussed. Both Ardrey and Morris emphasize the importance of face-to-face (or back-to-face) appeasement gestures in placating intraspecific aggression; this is a response-pattern which, although common among primates, is by no means confined to them. The neurophysiological etiology is too com- plicated to have been specified as yet, but it is agreed that the response is genetically determined. Clearly the question of the extent to which, if at all, normal humans are born with such an inhibition today is relevant to the analysis of aggression which, in turn, figures prominently in much con- ventional political analysis; consider, for example, the implications of the appeasement response (assuming that it applies to humans) upon our un- derstanding of the equanimity with which millions of Americans coun- tenanced-a verb that may seem (although it is not) inept, in view of the more primitive meaning retained by its nounal form-Hiroshima, or the bombing of North Viet Nam, or My Lai. The recurrence of Richard Specks and Charles Mansons assures us that such a (postulated) inhibi- tion is overridden by other response systems in psychopaths; and it is at least possible that normal humans learn how to repress the appeasement inhibitor of aggression. In any case political scientists concerned about aggression can profitably start to reconsider their subject from the point of view of the extreme rarity of intraspecific aggression among nonhuman animal species, and the physiological reasons therefore. Another aspect of aggression emphasized by both Ardrey and Morris concerns what Ardrey calls "the territorial response," a genetically-deter- mined set of species-specific behaviors relating to the occupation and de- fense of breeding grounds (or, in the case of ten-spined sticklebacks, zones) by dominant males. Humans are unique among primates in their tendency to establish a fixed, rather than a transitory, place of residence; and many primate species, like certain other animals, have socialized terri- torial defense so that it is a function of an oligarchy of dominant males, rather than of a single one. Clearly there is a relationship between aggres- sive defense of a space that an (human) animal defines as his own to pro- tect, psychological concepts of personal space, and western cultural legal concepts of property (particularly that which is, in the relevant vernacular, designated as "real").

Another aspect of aggression is evoked by the hierarchical model of dominance behaviors in primate groups, which is discussed at length by Tiger-Fox as well as by Ardrey and Morris. Evidently Morris' interpreta- tion of religious behavior invites an interpretation of political behavior using the same model. Ardrey and Tiger-Fox sharply distinguish between the above model of the primate group and the alternative model of the human hunting band in which, all five of our authors agree, the emphasis must have been upon cooperation and coordinated social behavior. Tiger and Fox have provided us with the suggestion that the hunting band provides an appropriate model for analysis of entrepreneurship activities (at least on the scale of small firms) ;44 and the question obviously arises whether the same model can be employed fruitfully to study behaviors within, and in competition between, small political groups (such as, for example, competing precinct organizations)? My own hunch is that a social paradigm so passionately rooted in the life (or after-life?) of the face-to-face group of no more than about fifty persons has some, but obviously limited, potential for guiding analysis of the characteristically very much larger social groupings with which most of our most pressing issues of public policy are concerned. On the other hand, many of those larger populations differentiate into sub- groups of the specified size; and investigation of the "hunting band" hy- pothesis may well help to clarify some aspects of social communication in large organizations. We can also turn the relationship around: instead of asking what polit- ical scientists can learn by testing hypotheses derived from ethological theory, we can ask also whether political scientists should consider becom- ing involved at first hand in both field and laboratory studies of animal behavior; and although the political behavior of other primates is one ob- 43.

This is a clearly researchable subject, and one that has very far-reaching political implications. One discrete but challenging task would lie in the endeavor to operationalize-and along several dimensions, including certainly age and race and aggressiveness (in the sense of Ar- drey's alpha/omega variable) as well as sex-the Tiger-Fox notion of an "equal chance to compete" in political decision-making processes, for per- sons who are biologically unequal in terms of the specified dimensions. All five of our authors express alarm about the present as well as future implications of worldwide overpopulation of the human species; and all of them discuss various feedback loops that involve such other biological variables as aggression and other types of stress behavior, threats to the survival prospects of other species (both fauna and flora), and the esca- lated destruction generally of the ecological conditions (including those of physical environment) presently deemed indispensable to the support of human existence. The memorandum cited in footnote 38 specifies in considerable detail many facets of this question that are deemed not only researchable by political scientists but even suitable for research funding with public money, so I shall suggest here a different aspect of the political nature of genetics. The model of the gene pool, as the genotype for a par- ticular deme, and in relation to the theory of evolutionary adaptation and the incorporated subtheory of mutational change, has never been rigor- ously applied to the analysis of political change and the evolution of polit- ical characteristics: do the fittest (and in what sense) survive? The model might also be usefully applied to competition among political candidates, and no doubt to other political arenas as well. A zoologist graduate student in a seminar of mine recently inquired, with a certain amount of impatience, why political scientists generally- actually, the way he put it was "political science"-and myself in par- ticular have not already stated, or do not in any case proceed forthwith to state, the fundamental questions about biopolitics for which we seek "an- swers" from biologists. I found it impossible adequately to explain to him -he had completed seven years of university course work majoring in zoology, and our seminar was the first social science course to which he 45.

I suggested that not only did such questions remain unformulated, but I could not imagine how it would have been possible for such a relatively clear and settled professional point of view to have emerged in our discipline by this time. The student was utterly oblivious to the smugness implicit in his presumption that "biol- ogy" has readily available answers to any questions about political be- havior or public policy, involving biological relationships, that political scientists could ask. Only after some finite but critical mass of political scientists becomes sufficiently well-educated in zoology to know their way comfortably around the biological literature (including empirical research, modes of thinking, and theory) can we anticipate-possibly in another decade or so-that "political science" will learn enough about biology to begin to ask important and relevant questions about biopolitics. That may happen; but I am less sanguine about the other side of the equation. Only after some substantial number of biologists become educated to an equivalent level of sophistication in the social domain of the life sciences will " bi- ology" understand the questions well enough to start thinking about how to supply some "answers" (viz., how to acquire the kind of information and knowledge necessary to the formulation of solutions to the problems raised). For reasons that are quite adequately supported by sociopsycho- logical findings on social class and mobility, to say nothing of the now classical ethological research on dominance hierarchies in barnyard fowls, we may hypothesize that such downward movement in status orientation can not be anticipated as a natural expression of the sociobiological nature of biologists. Zoology is, however, much closer to vertebrate paleontology and phys- ical anthropology than biology is to political science; and I do know one important question about human behavior, which an anthropologist has asked of ethologists. It is Pilbeam's plaintive query: Is beastliness really inevitable?</page></plain_text>
