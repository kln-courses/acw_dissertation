<plain_text><page sequence="1">Spinoza - Jewish Philosopher or Heretic? SPINOZA Jewish Philosopher or Heretic? Tirzah Ben-David * Any attempt to consider the question of Spinoza's status vis-à-vis the Jewish intellectual and religious establishment must necessarily begin by seeking to define the terms 'Jewish philosophy' and 'heresy': these must then be measured against what Spinoza actually did and said. Yet from whose viewpoint are the questions to be asked, our own or the seventeenth-century Amsterdam Jewish community in which Spinoza lived? Their concept of Jewish philosophy (and indeed of philosophy in general) and of heresy, must have been substantially different from ours; both perspectives will therefore need to bp addressed. Further ambiguities arise as soon as the term 'Jewish philosophy' is exam- ined. Philosophy may be broadly defined as an attempt to understand the nature of being, of Man's place and purpose in the universe, without an a pri- ori postulation of the existence of God, although, in specific systems, the lat- ter may be inferred as a necessary cause or moral imperative.1 Conversely, Judaism begins with an a priori assumption of God's existence and bases all its perceptions of our place in the universe on divine revelation: we know who, what and why we are because God has told us, through direct and prophetic revelation, embodied in Torah. Jewish philosophy had, throughout the Middle Ages, juggled uneasily with these two very differently shaped balls, trying to keep both in the air at the same time. It was to a certain extent a contradiction in terms, an attempt to reconcile biblical and rabbinic modes of thought with the classical Greek models of Plato and Aristotle. Somehow, in intellectual terms, the latter were felt by Jewish philosophers, from Philo onwards, to be superior, so that Judaism needed to be reconciled with, or jus- tified against, them. Maimonides' concept of God (described in The Guide to the Perplexed) with which Spinoza's has often been compared,2 is a classic example of this approach. By the seventeenth century, still reeling from the impact of Copernican astronomy, and either dazzled or scandalised by New- tonian physics, the mediaeval world view was finally disintegrating in Western Europe, and nowhere more rapidly than in the Netherlands, the most econom- ically and politically advanced nation of its day. It had very astutely opened its doors to Portuguese and Spanish Jews and Marranos in the wake of the expul- sions from the Iberian Peninsula at the end of the fifteenth century, and Spin- * Rabbi Tirzah Ben-David is a graduate of Leo Baeck College.

Despite its outward prosperity, however, the Sephardic Jewish community was still spiritually fragile, traumatised not only by the expulsions themselves but, perhaps more insidiously, by the conversion and subsequent reconversion of so many Jewish families to and from Catholicism. Yirmiyahu Yovel3 has made much of Spinoza's Marrano heritage, and the profound effect which he believes this had on the philosopher's life and thought. What must be beyond doubt is the effect that it had on the goals and attitudes of the Rabbis and other communal leaders: they were faced with rebuilding and reaffirming a world of orthodox Jewish belief and practice among people whose immediate antecedents had often been outwardly devout Catholics. However fervently they may have kept their Jewish faith burning in secret, Christian cultural val- ues and habits of mind undoubtedly became engrained, while knowledge of Rabbinic Judaism was inevitably attenuated. There are perhaps some parallels here with the emerging Jewish communities of the former Soviet Union in our own time, after seventy years in spiritual limbo. More relevant to our present concerns, however, are the similarities between Spinoza's Amsterdam com- munity and the Tannaitic era in Palestine, similarities which lead us directly to the consideration of heresy, and its punishment, cherem. The similarity first of all seems to lie in a spirit of reconstruction in the aftermath of trauma, occasioned in Palestine by the simultaneous loss of the Temple and political autonomy, and the accompanying tendency to turn inwards, to close ranks. This was coupled, both in the Tannaitic period and in the seventeenth century, by an acute political sensitivity vis-à-vis the dominant secular power (although in the case of Holland this was unusually benign), a desire not to rock the boat, to render Caesar his due whilst concentrating all available spiritual energies on religious renewal. The need to systematise belief and practice and to discourage 'subversive' speculation which might weaken the belief, particularly of the unlearned, led, in Tannaitic times, to the introduction of niddui , a sixty-day ban inflicted, often on great scholars, who refused to comply with the decision or ruling of the majority. Cherem was an aggravated form of niddui for particularly recalcitrant cases, which could take effect on the expiry of the sixty-day period, and rendered its subject excom- municate, a lifelong outcast from Jewish society, unless a specific act of repen- tance was made. Niddui could be imposed, according to the Shulchan Arukh for 'disobedience to Torah precepts on the strength of spurious analogies or arguments'.4 The application of such measures to Spinoza's case was clearly irresistible. It is also very interesting to note that the original biblical definition of cherem is 'the status of that which is separated from common use or contact, either because it is proscribed as an abomination to God or because it is con- EUROPEAN JUDAISM VOLUME 30 No. 2 AUTUMN '97 113</page><page sequence="3">Spinoza - Jewish Philosopher or Heretic? secrated to him'.5 This seems to sum up very neatly the two perspectives from which Spinoza has successively been viewed. Over the intervening centuries the threat of total ostracism from the Jewish community as a weapon against religious non-conformity became a potent one. In a non-secular society such banishment meant virtual death, often phys- ical as well as spiritual - the world outside the ghetto walls was alien and merciless. However, what is heresy in Jewish terms? The lack of a dogmatic framework, such as existed in Christianity, made it difficult to define, and indeed its boundaries were elastic, depending to some extent on the current political and social climate; periods of relative Jewish security and prosperity encouraged a more tolerant attitude, while insecurity or external threat tended to provoke paranoia and a narrowing of intellectual horizons. Spinoza was to a certain extent a victim of the latter mentality: the Amsterdam Rabbis were dismayed, not only by the potential effect of Spinoza's radical ideas on his fel- low Jews, but also by the hostility and controversy they were already arous- ing among Christian theologians. Nevertheless, it seems that outward conformity was still the major issue, a pragmatic disciplining of actions rather than thought, as evidenced by the Rabbis' offer, in effect a bribe, of one thou- sand florins, if Spinoza would continue to behave like a good Jew and think his heretical thoughts in private. He of course refused, leaving them little choice but to excommunicate him, as they had Uriel da Costa and Juan de Prado before him. So, if the parameters of heresy were both flexible and to a certain extent contingent (figures as revered as Maimonides and Hasdai Cresças were both strong influences on Spinoza, yet the ideas that he inherited from them were not deemed heretical in their own time),6 by what criteria can Spinoza's status as a Jewish heretic be measured? At the most basic level of religious obser- vance, and heresy was often interpreted in terms of unacceptable behaviour, whether ethical or halakhic, Spinoza definitely qualified as a Grade 'A' heretic. A child prodigy, marked out at an early age for a distinguished rabbinic career, he totally abandoned all Jewish ritual and observance, thus automatically plac- ing himself beyond the pale of Jewish communal life, almost without the need for a formal excommunication. It is, however, in the realm of his thought that the interesting area of debate lies. The two major works that Spinoza produced were the Tractatus Theologico Politicus ('ITP), published in 1670, and the Ethica More Geometrico Demon- strata (Ethics), completed in 1665 but published posthumously in 1677 because he dared not have it printed during his lifetime. It is interesting to note that Spinoza had published nothing at the time of his ban in 1656; everything was rumour and word-of-mouth. Ironically, it was the cherem which, in irrev- ocably severing him from the Jewish community, set him free to pursue his 114 EUROPEAN JUDAISM VOLUME 30 No. 2 AUTUMN '97</page><page sequence="4">Tirzah Ben-David own intellectual and spiritual path: yet its wording, prescribed and ritualistic though it may have been, is manifestly unjust, referring as it does to his 'evil opinions and acts' and 'the monstrous acts committed by him'. All contempo- rary testimony agrees that Spinoza led a completely blameless, if not posi- tively saintly, personal and moral life, in direct contrast to the lurid picture suggested by the anathema; but again, it is a question of viewpoint. Most of us instinctively sympathise with Spinoza because we are the heirs of the modern rationalistic world-view which he helped to create. To Menasseh ben Israel and his colleagues the need for spiritual cohesion and continuity, a stable framework in which traditional Jewish life and values could be rebuilt after the disasters of the preceding centuries, was of paramount importance, and on that basis they were undoubtedly right to act as they did. It is indeed a debate that is far from dead in the Jewish world today; we speak glibly of the miracle of Jewish survival over the past two millennia, perhaps forgetting that this sort of price has often had to be paid for it. So what were Spinoza's 'abominable heresies', and to what extent are they an inevitable corollary of his philosophical conclusions and political views? Let us first consider the TTP, the very title of which indicates the inextricable link which Spinoza perceived to exist between politics, in the general sense of the ordering and government of society, and religion. Spinoza was a rabbini- cally-trained biblical and talmudic scholar, and a very competent Hebraist; he brought these peculiarly Jewish talents to bear on the task of divesting Scrip- ture, and particularly the Mosaic law, of its divine authority. Spinoza's anticipation, by two centuries, of modern biblical criticism, is dazzling: there had been doubts in the past about Moses' authorship of the entire Pentateuch, but he went much further, noting other source material men- tioned in the Bible itself, and speculating that Ezra might have been the final redactor of several heterogenous texts, an attribution that still has adherents today. This, from an orthodox religious viewpoint, was bad enough, but it was Spinoza's conclusions concerning the validity of divine revelation itself that induced ecclesiastical apoplexy and genuinely undermined the foundations of traditional Judaism. Like Moses Mendelssohn after him, Spinoza considered the Torah to be revealed legislation rather than revealed religion in the theological or meta- physical sense. Unlike his German successor however, he did not see that leg- islation as eternally binding on the Jewish people in a historico-spiritual continuum. He regarded it, on the contrary, as a pragmatic, purely political code, moulded specifically to the needs of ancient Israelite society, and reflect- ing all the barbarities and inconsistencies one would expect from such a gen- esis. The covenant, which had formed both the basis and vehicle for that code, was therefore destroyed along with the ancient Jewish state that it had been EUROPEAN JUDAISM VOLUME 30 No. 2 AUTUMN '97 115</page><page sequence="5">Spinoza - Jewish Philosopher or Heretic? designed to serve. Diaspora Judaism (to all intents and purposes synonymous with Rabbinic Judaism) was a conspiracy of vested interests, a fraud devoted to '... defending human commentaries, so that religion is no longer identified with charity, but with spreading discord and propagating insensate hatred dis- guised under the name of zeal for the Lord and eager ardour'.7 Only those uni- versal moral truths which shine through both the Old and New Testaments 4 . . . not in ceremonies but in charity and a true heart',8 unclouded by textual incon- sistencies or exegetical bias, can be validly conceived as reflecting anything of the nature of God; and that very nature, as soon becomes clear in the 'Ethics', is itself the most heretical of all Spinoza's ideas. Spinoza's inclusion of the New Testament in his critique of biblical authority is not an indication of any inclination on his part to embrace Chris- tianity; that would have been as absurd as re-embracing Judaism. He was however deeply impressed by the figure of Jesus, whom he regarded as the greatest of the prophets, in touch with universal truth, indeed with the mind of God himself. His reservations concerning the Old Testament prophets' intellectual perception of the nature of God were already expressed else- where in TTP. As he remarks, '... it is one thing to understand the meaning of Scripture and the prophets, and quite another thing to understand the meaning of God, or the actual truth'.9 This passion to comprehend 'actual truth' resulted in Spinoza's most monumental and, in places, least accessible work, the 'Ethics', where, employing the inexorable logic of Euclidean geometry, he constructs a rational, deterministic theorem of the universe in which, to quote Leo Strauss, 'speculation on God's essence is ... entirely lib- erated from any tutelage to theology'.10 Spinoza conceives God as infinite substance, perhaps better expressed as 'reality' or 'essence', who, 'consisting of infinite attributes, each one of which expresses eternal and infinite essence, necessarily exists'.11 In simplified terms, God is the world; he is identified with an eternal, integrated cosmic sys- tem of regenerative existence, whose mechanism of cause and effect is a man- ifestation of his necessary will. 'In nature there is nothing contingent, but all things are determined from the necessity of the divine nature to exist and act in a certain manner.' 12 God is immanent yet impersonal; nothing is good or bad in itself; but 'only in relation to our imagination can things be called beautiful or ugly, well-ordered or confused.'13 Such ideas are obviously inconsistent with Judaism's view of a transcendent but interactive God who chose Israel for a special mission, who has a plan for history, yet has given mankind free will to infinitely frustrate its implementation. Spinoza's own definition of freedom is the wisdom to perceive that it does not exist, thus repudiating anxiety and frustration and similar wasteful emotions, and attaining the only true free- dom; the tranquil acceptance of necessity. 116 EUROPEAN JUDAISM VOLUME 30 No. 2 AUTUMN '97</page><page sequence="6">Tîrzah Ben-David Spinoza's monistic view of the universe has often been called pantheistic, but he is at pains elsewhere to refute this: ' it is however a complete mistake on the part of those who say that my purpose ... is to show that God and nature, under which last term they understand a certain mass of corporeal mat- ter, are one and the same. I had no such intention'.14 God is manifested as Will, as the Cause underlying the laws of nature; as such he can be apprehended and loved on a plane no less passionate for being intellectual rather than emotional. Indeed, Amor Dei is the ultimate goal of Spinoza's entire philosophy, a serene yet exalted state attained through the supra-rational 'third kind of knowledge', an intuitive intellectual leap which grasps the totality of being, the interaction between natura naturans (in effect, God) and natura naturata (the created world), and henceforward views all human activity from an exalted spiritual plane, sub specie aeternitatis, i.e., from the aspect of eternity. To be a detached observer, however wise and tolerant, of a human drama in which '... there is nothing contingent, but all things are determined from the necessity of the divine nature to exist and act in a certain manner'15 must, I think, be deemed heretical in Jewish terms, not only theologically, but cultur- ally and morally too. The whole concept of Tikkun Olam, of humanity's responsibility to strive for perfection in the world, and God's need, or at least desire, for a partnership with mankind; all this, so crucial to the spiritual dynamics of Judaism, is banished from Spinoza's universe. It also involves him in a basic inconsistency, which never seems to be resolved, between the concept of God propounded in the 'Ethics' and that inferred from the premises of TTP. How can the former, of whose essence we are all a part, be concerned with divine revelation, in however attenuated a form? Even if the purpose of revealed Scripture was merely, as Spinoza sug- gests, to provide a framework of law, obedience and piety in ancient Israel, and even if the prophets were men of acute imagination rather than superior intel- lect, this nevertheless still presupposes a kind of separation between the human and the divine, and some level of communication between the two, which the 'Ethics' seeks to deny. Perhaps had Spinoza lived longer (he died at the relatively young age of forty five in 1677), this apparent contradiction would have been resolved. The answer to our original question would therefore seem to be that Spin- oza was undoubtedly a heretic, both according to the narrower criteria of his own religious milieu, and perhaps, as I have suggested, in a broader sense as well. Whether the term itself has any real validity in the minds of many twen- tieth-century Jews is of course another matter; the concept of heresy is to some extent a relative one, presupposing an authority whose tenets the heretic flouts. It has become a truism to refer to Spinoza as the first secular Jew, born before his time, and certainly the world of modern Jewish secular scholarship EUROPEAN JUDAISM VOLUME 30 No. 2 AUTUMN '97 117</page><page sequence="7">Spinoza - Jewish Philosopher or Heretic? would welcome such a figure with open arms; but that world would also deprive him of both his tragedy and his glory. It is precisely because he was a man, not out of step with his time - his was the age of Descartes and New- ton - but rather one step ahead of it, that his courage and vision still move us more than three hundred years later, whatever reservations we may have about his philosophy. For there seems to be no question here of an 'either - or' : Spinoza was cer- tainly a philosopher, and a peculiarly Jewish one in some respects, despite his own determined efforts to the contrary. His central concerns with truth, moral- ity, justice and the unity of God all reflect his origins, while the very tenets of his philosophical system, and his independence in both thinking and uttering them, automatically rendered him a heretic in his own day. Yet the fabric of Jewish belief has proved tougher than either Spinoza hoped or his antagonists feared: many of the basic propositions of the TTP are accepted today by schol- ars and laymen, both Jewish and Christian, without destroying a deeper stra- tum of faith whose lack of 'rationality' Spinoza would doubtless deplore, and whose mysteries escape the bounds of his particular intellectual universe. Therein perhaps lies the irony inherent in any attempt to formulate an all- embracing metaphysical system which assumes that all questions can be answered and total truth apprehended. It leaves no room for doubt, speculation or any of the other troublesome and creative pursuits that make intellectual, and indeed spiritual life, worth living. Heretic, rationalist, upsetter of theolog- ical applecarts, freethinker in the purest sense of the term, Spinoza devoted his latter years to erecting a lucid cosmos of Euclidean inevitability which would still forever those very passions of mind and imagination which drove him so remorselessly, and so fruitfully, all his life.

Although clearly devoid of any hint of pantheism, Maimonides' 'unknowable' God, whose attributes can only be expressed negatively and who is the 'unmoved mover' of the universe, has certain aspects in common with the strictly non-anthropomorphic, impersonal deity of Spinoza. The greatest similarity however lies in their common stress on the role of the intellect in attaining true knowledge and perception of God.
