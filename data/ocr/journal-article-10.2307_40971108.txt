Certain it is, that few marked characters in history have suffered more from the malign inventions of prejudice (Goodrich and Winchell, 1885, p. 283). Hyenas: To Know Them is to Love Them 1 he situation that Goodrich and Winchell described in 1885 did not improve during the next century. Hyenas have a * I am grateful to my wife, Krista, for helping me in all the phases of research and writing involved in this paper. I am also indebted to Laurence G. Frank, my friend and collaborator, who introduced me to hyenas; and to Kay Holekamp and Laura Smale who have taught me a great deal about these animals from their own field studies. In that regard, I thank the Office of the President, the Wildlife Conservation and Management Department, and the Narok County Council, Republic of Kenya, for facilitating our hyena research. Finally, I am appreciative of the efforts of many friends and colleagues who called my attention to relevant material that I otherwise might have missed. These include Carol Christ, Carol Clover, Helen Ettlinger, Don Friedman, Sam Gosling (and his parents), Diane and Fred Leavitt, Roger Short, and, particularly, Nicholas Howe. The material may not have been included in this article, but I am still thankful for their interest.

However, scientists who study these animals at close range have a different view. Hans Kruuk (1972), whose field studies of the 1960s completely changed our understanding of the life of the spotted hyena, has written: . . . there is a magic about hyaenas which can only be understood by those of us who have watched them, for some time. There is now a growing band of us, who came to the African bush with all our prejudices, with all that 'common knowledge' about hyaenas which proved so totally wrong, and who just fell for the spell of animals which were so totally different" (Kruuk, 1990, p. xiii). This chapter had its origins in an effort to understand this discrepancy: why the positive attitudes and feelings about hyenas, held by the scientists who knew them best, were so at odds with the general culture? This, in turn, led to other questions. First, what are the essential elements of the hyena reputation in contemporary Anglo-American culture? Second, has that reputation changed across time or from one cultural setting to the next? And, finally, how do reputations relate to biological realities? The family Hyenidae contains four extant species: striped hyenas {Hyaena hyaena), brown hyenas (Parahyaena brunnea), spotted hyenas (Crocuta crocuta), and a small, termite-eating animal, the aardwolf (Proteles cristatus). As we shall see, the public image of hyenas has largely been created on the basis of real, exaggerated, or imagined traits of striped and spotted hyenas. It is the latter species, the "laughing hyena" of popular lore, which forms a primary focus of this article, although we shall also be drawn to its somewhat smaller relative, the striped hyena. By virtue of their size and abundance, spotted hyenas are among the most significant predators on the African Savan- nah.1 In terms of tonnage of meat consumed, they are, perhaps, the most significant terrestrial carnivore on the</page><page sequence="3">THE SPOTTED HYENA 503 planet. Often living in large female-dominated social groups, or "clans," they display intriguing behavioral complexities that parallel those of many venerated old-world primates. Every adult female spotted hyena breeds and the clan is organized in terms of subgroups of mothers, daughters, and their off- spring. Long-lasting dominance hierarchies exist among these clan families. Adult males appear in the group as immigrants from other clans. They are totally subservient to the resident females and their older offspring. Spotted hyenas defend their kills against much larger marauding lions and their hunting territories against other clans. They are remarkable animals. However, spotted hyenas, or their immediate relatives, the brown and striped hyenas, are rarely found in zoological parks in this country, despite a self-conscious shift among contempo- rary zoos from functioning as entertainment parks to institutions dedicated to public education and preservation of endangered species. According to one recent count, spotted hyenas were to be found in but 11 of 164 North American zoological parks.2 One major American zoo that I visited several years ago had Asiatic tigers housed within the boundries of an African savannah exhibit but no spotted hyenas. I believe that this serious miscarraige of biological justice can be traced to the poor public reputation of the hyena. There are no "save-the-hyenas" committees, and their persistant public relations problems could have very serious consequences for the preservation of hyena habitats and the long-term prospects for these species. This has been an issue of concern to the scientists who study these animals. Mills concludes his monograph: "If this book has helped in any way to convince people that hyaenas are worth conserving, not only because of their intrinsic value, but because of their beauty and fascinating behaviour, it will have been worth the many hours of toil that it has taken me to try to convert the</page><page sequence="4">504 SOCIAL RESEARCH wonderful experiences of watching them, into some sort of coherent and scientifically meaningful form" (Mills, 1990, p. 273). We may begin with a brief survey of the portrayal of hyenas in twentieth-century American culture and then consider the shaping of the hyena image over a span of several thousand years, contrasting European views with those of contemporary Africans. Along the way, I will occasionally digress to compare views of the hyena with those of other animals, particularly the lion. It is one of the great ironies of spotted hyena existence that, over a span of several million years, they have held their own in direct competition with lions, only to lose (what may be their most critical battle) in the court of public esteem. Hyenas and Anglo-American Culture in the Twentieth Century A trio of spotted hyenas appear in the recent Disney movie, The Lion King. Several artists from the Disney studios spent two days in the hills above the Berkeley campus of the University of California observing and sketching hyenas maintained in our colony at the Field Station for Behavioral Research. Their visit was arranged by Dr. Laurence Frank, who has followed a clan of hyenas in the Masai Mara Reserve in Kenya for more than 15 years, and who was instrumental in establishing the Berkeley colony. Frank, and other scientists working at the colony, asked how hyenas were to be portrayed in the film and expressed a strong request that it be positive. The artists explained that the script was written and that a trio of hyenas (Banzai, Shenzi, and Ed) were to be the allies of an evil older lion, who would eventually lose to the hero, a noble young lion. However, they seemed very appreciative of the animals and said they would do their best to make them appear comical instead of evil. It is difficult for me to judge how successful the artists</page><page sequence="5">THE SPOTTED HYENA 505 were in their efforts. Banzai and Shenzi are not particularly appealing, at least in the ordinary sense of the term. They are portrayed as evil, gluttonous characters who would do anything for food. Ed is the the third member of the trio. According to one text accompanying a childrens' computer game based on The Lion King, Banzai and Shenzi are "relatively intelligent," but Ed is "a little slow" and is u ... known for his maniacal laughter. He's been known to gnaw on his own leg by mistake" (The Lion King . . . , 1994, p. 91). These are not new images of hyenas. Their portrayal in contemporary media as weird, dangerous, repulsive animals, with a few recent exceptions, has been quite consistant. The world of cartoons is particularly relevant to understand- ing attitudes toward hyenas, since their appreciation depends upon shared perspectives in the audience. Consider this cartoon from the New Scientist, in which we find an array of the more serious prejudices wrapped in a single caption [Fig. 1]: "We're scavengers, we're ugly and we smell bad, if we didn't laugh we'd crack." Hyenas have fared no better in serious literature. In his account of travelling on safari in Africa, Hemingway claimed that his African guide M'Cola found Hemingway's killing of many animals humorous, hyenas most of all: It was funny to M'Cola to see a hyena shot at close range. There was that comic slap of the bullet and the hyena's agitated surprise to find death inside of him. It was funnier to see a hyena shot at a great distance, in the heat shimmer of the plain, to see him go over backwards, to see him start that frantic circle, to see that electric speed that meant he was racing the nickelled death inside him. But . . . the pinnacle of hyenic humor, was the hyena, the classic hyena, that hit too far back while running, would circle madly, snapping and tearing at himself until he pulled his own intestines out, and then stood there, jerking them out and eating with relish. Fisi, the hyena, hermaphroditic self-eating devourer of the dead, trailer of calving cows, ham-stringer, potential biter-off of your face at night while you slept, sad yowler, camp-follower, stinking, fowl, with jaws that crack the bones that the lion leaves,</page><page sequence="6">506 SOCIAL RESEARCH Fig. 1. Cartoon from the New Scientist. belly dragging, loping away on the brown plain, looking back, mongrel dog-smart in the face; wack from the little Mannlicher and then the horrid circle starting (Hemingway, 1935, pp. 37-8). In this painful passage, Hemingway raises many of the myths that have followed hyenas and contributed to their sorry reputation: hermaphrodites, scavengers, singers of sad songs, smelly, ugly, and, ultimately, comical in their failure to comprehend the "realities" of our perceptions. Perhaps Hemingway was following in the footsteps of another Great White Hunter, Theodore Roosevelt, who had made a similar trek to Africa several decades before Hemingway. According to Roosevelt and Heller: "... the hyena is a singular mixture of abject cowardice and the utmost</page><page sequence="7">THE SPOTTED HYENA 507 ferocity. Usually feeding on carrion, and often hesitating to attack even the weakest animal if it is unhurt and on its guard, the ravenous beast will, on occasions, even when single but especially when in troops, assail very formidable creatures" (Roosevelt and Heller, 1915, p. 259). Roosevelt and Heller add accounts of hyenas attacking sheep, goats, donkeys, mules, cattle, dogs, men, women, and especially children. But perhaps most surprising to these authors was that " . . . under certain circumstances they do attack lions. ..." To appreciate their surprise, one has to realize the extraordinary reverence that Roosevelt and Heller display toward lions as brave, powerful killers and predators and their conviction that hyenas are lowly scavengers. They write that: "Ordinarily the hyenas merely attend the lion at a respectful distance, eager to get whatever he leaves, and they occasionally pay with their lives if they grow too impatient" (Roosevelt and Heller, 1915, p. 260). However, Roosevelt and Heller then describe a number of incidents, which they find very puzzling, in which hyenas confronted healthy lions and even killed old or crippled lions. Some Biological Realty Zoologist Hans Kruuk, following hyenas in the Serengeti, reports that in cases where lions and hyenas were "sharing" a carcass, 53 percent had been killed by hyenas and 33 percent by lions. He reports that George Shaller, following lions in the same ecosystem, found that 54 percent of the prey involved in "shared" feeding had been killed by hyenas and 34 percent by lions (Kruuk, 1972, p. 129). It is clear that the noble, much-admired king of beasts scavenges more often on hyena kills than hyenas scavenge on lion kills. It should be added that from a biologist's perspective, scavenging is an extremely honorable, essential profession. I doubt that the affection of biologists for brown and striped hyenas is lessened by the</page><page sequence="8">508 SOCIAL RESEARCH greater reliance of these latter species on food killed by others. However, it seems likely that the image of spotted hyenas as "cowardly scavengers" is fundamental to their reputational problems, as it has been for vultures and jackals- other favorite subjects for human metaphor. It is also of particular interest that the prejudice was so powerful it clouded the perception of otherwise knowledgeable people (like Roosevelt and Heller) to what was happening in front of their eyes. When they came upon hyenas feeding at a carcass, they merely assumed that the animal had originally been killed by lions or other predators. When they found a cluster of distressed hyenas surrounding some feeding lions, they assumed that the prey had been dispatched by lions and that the hyenas were awaiting their turn to scavenge. When they actually witnessed kills, or observed hyenas fighting to hold their prey against intruding lions, these were assumed to be exceptions, and the reputation of hyenas as cowardly scavengers was maintained. As we shall see, these charges have a long history. In the 1990s, several decades after Kruuk's and Schaller's studies, the educated public and many scientists have been slow to recognize the complexity of feeding among hyenids. There was another problem that has caused endless difficulties for the hyena reputation: the charges of sexual ambiguity noted by Hemingway. As all of these issues were discussed by Aristotle, his writing becomes a logical place to search for the origins of the hyena reputation. Aristotle More than 2300 years ago, Aristotle considered almost all of the major contemporary charges against hyenas: first, that they are hermaphrodites; second, that they are scavengers; third, that they are naturally cowardly or, at least, "timorous"; and, fourth, that they are potentially treacherous and threatening for people. We may begin where Aristotle begins,</page><page sequence="9">THE SPOTTED HYENA 509 in his History of Animals (HA) with a consideration of their presumptive hermaphroditism.3 What is recounted concerning its genital organs, to the effect that every hyena is furnished with the organ both of the male and the female, is untrue. The fact is that the sexual organ of the male hyena resembles the same organ in the wolf and in the dog; the part resembling the female genital organ lies underneath the tail, and does to some extent resemble the female organ, but it is unprovided with duct or passage, and the passage for the residuum comes underneath it. The female hyena has the part that resembles the organ of the male, and, as in the case of the male, has it underneath her tail, unprovided with duct or passage; and after it the passage for the residuum, and underneath this the true female genital organ. The female hyena has a womb, like all other female mammals of the same kind (HA, VI, 32, 579b, 16ff). The topic reappears in the text of Aristotle's Generation of Animals (GA), at the conclusion of a section dealing with various reports of fish and certain birds being fertilized via their mouths. He castigates other natural scientists promoting such ideas for "... speaking too superficially and without consideration" (GA, III, 6, 756b, 18), noting that orally ingested semen could not reach the uterus and, in any case, would be destroyed in the intestine. Aristotle then returns to rumors of hyena hermaphroditism: Much deceived also are those who make a foolish statement about the trochus and the hyena. Many say that the hyena, and Herodorus the Heracleot says that the trochus, has two pudenda, those of the male and of the female, and that the trochus impregnates itself but the hyena mounts and is mounted in alternate years. This is untrue, for the hyena has been seen to have only one pudendum, there being no lack of opportunity for observation in some districts, but hyenas have under the tail a line like the pudendum of the female. Both male and female have such a mark, but the males are taken more frequently; this casual observation has given rise to this opinion (GA, III, 6, 757a, 2ff ).4</page><page sequence="10">510 SOCIAL RESEARCH He then concludes, almost irritably, "But enough has been said of this." Aristotle obviously believed that he had disposed of the hyenas-as-hermaphrodites rumor by observation and had even been able to provide a logical explanation for the false belief, namely, the line under the tail that concealed a duct, albeit that the duct had a blind ending. Aristotle was correct; hyenas are not hermaphrodites. (In this regard, he was ahead of Hemingway.) However, there was a problem. As has been noted by a number of biologists (Watson, 1878; Platt, 1958; Matthews, 1939), Aristotle was surely dealing with striped hyenas, when the rumor must have originated with spotted hyenas. In his initial general description of the hyena, Aristotle writes, "The hyena in colour resembles the wolf, but is more shaggy, and is furnished with a mane running all along the spine" {HA, VI, 30, 579b, 15).5 Such a mane is characteristic of the striped hyena, not the spotted hyena. From this single anatomical characteristic, it is clear that Aristotle was not considering the species on which the original rumor was based. The description of a "line beneath the tail" might also fit the striped hyena better than the spotted. Although all hyenids have anal scent glands in this position, both brown and striped hyenas "... possess a large glandular pouch below the tail which largely obscures the external genitalia ..." (Walker, 1968, p. 1267). Finally, in Aristotle's time, striped hyenas would have been common in North Africa and the Middle East, while the range of the spotted hyena had largely, if not completely, retreated to sub-Saharan Africa. D'Arcy Thompson concluded that Aristotle did much of his writing on biological subjects while residing on the Isle of Lesbos, off the coast of Turkey, and did some travelling on the mainland as well (Thompson, 1916). Turkey could have been prime striped hyena habitat in those times, and, as recently as 1877, British naturalists reported that striped hyenas "were not uncommon near Smyrna and in the southern districts" (Danford and Alston, 1877, p. 270). Smyrna is less than 75 miles southeast of Lesbos. It is likely that the hunters that</page><page sequence="11">THE SPOTTED HYENA 511 Aristotle consulted would have been familiar with striped hyenas, and, perhaps, he even had the opportunity for direct examination of this animal. His anatomical descriptions are certainly quite precise. If Aristotle had only examined a spotted hyena, he would have appreciated the source of the rumor; for in this species the external genitalia of the female are virtually identical to those of the male. The vaginal labia have fused to form a pseudoscrotum, containing two pads of fatty tissue which appear superficially to be testes; there is no external vagina. The clitoris, which is traversed by a central urogenital canal, has developed until it is the size and approximate shape of the male penis, and female hyenas display erections similar to those of the male. Female spotted hyenas urinate, copulate, and give birth through this organ [Figure 2]. Internally, they are ordinary female mammals. It is only within the last few years that scientists have been able to distinguish between males and females without internal examination or very close inspection (Neaves, Griffin, and Wilson, 1980; Frank, Glickman, and Pouch, 1990; Frank and Glickman, 1994). The anomalous "masculinization" of the female spotted hyena promoted the maintenance of hermaphroditic rumors well into the present century, and their ambiguous sexual anatomy has contributed substantially to the bad reputation of this species, although it was more troubling in some eras than others. In another section of his History of Animals, Aristotle discusses threats posed by the hyena: "It will lie in wait for a man and chase him, and will inveigle a dog within its reach by making a noise that resembles the retching noise of a man vomiting. It is exceedingly fond of putrefied flesh, and will burrow in a graveyard to gratify this propensity" {HA, VIII, 5, 594b, 2). Included within this brief passage are four separable concerns that people have had of hyenas: (a) they are active predators of particular danger to us; (b) they are crafty or deceitful and capable of using their vocal skills to lure an</page><page sequence="12">512 SOCIAL RESEARCH Fig. 2. Drawing of a female hyena by Dr. Christine Drea. The drawing depicts a female spotted hyena with an erect clitoris. animal into trouble; (c) they are scavengers who prefer rotting meat; and (d) they will disturb human gravesites. All of these themes were troubling, and all would be picked up by later writers. At several points in the Parts of Animals (PA), Aristotle advanced a general theory of bravery and cowardice. Courage was viewed as proportional to the heat of the blood, and he believed that there was a negative correlation between the relative size of the heart and qualities of bravery among various species of mammals. "The heart is of large size in the</page><page sequence="13">THE SPOTTED HYENA 513 hare, the deer, the mouse, the hyena, the ass, the leopard, the weasel, and in pretty nearly all other animals that either are manifestly timorous, or betray their cowardice by their spitefulness" (PA, III, 4, 667a, 20ff).6 He moved on to explain this correlation with an interesting analogy, noting that "... a fire of equal size gives less heat in a large room than in a small one" (PA, III, 4, 667a, 25). Therefore, since the heart is the source of heat, the blood of cowardly animals would be cooler than the blood of brave ones as the result of being heated in a larger chamber. Aristotle's inclusion of the hyena in his list of timorous/cowardly animals again did little to enhance their reputation. The final mention of hyenas is contained in a section of On Marvellous Things Heard (OMTH). According to Barnes (1984), although this material is traditionally included in Aristotle's works, it is almost surely not written by Aristotle. Here we get the taste of magic and power which will appear in much more expanded form in Pliny the Elder. "In Arabia they say there is a certain kind of hyaena, which, when it sees some wild beast, before itself being seen, or steps on the shadow of a man, produces speechlessness, and fixes them to the spot in such a way that they cannot move their body; and it is said that they do this in the case of dogs also" (OMTH, 145, 845a, 24-8). From Natural History to Morality and Religion: Pliny the Elder, and the Author of Physiologus The next stop in our journey occurs approximately 400 years after Aristotle's biological works. It involves a man whose books on natural history were to influence peoples' attitudes toward animals for at least the next 1600 years: Gaius Plinius Secondus, also known as Pliny the Elder.7 He claimed that his Natural History dealt with 20,000 matters of importance, drawn from 100 selected authors, among whom Aristotle figures prominently. However, as Rackham has observed, "In</page><page sequence="14">514 SOCIAL RESEARCH selecting from these he has shown scanty judgment and discrimination, including the false with the true at random; his selection is coloured by his love of the marvellous, by his low estimate of human ability and his consciousness of human wickedness, and by his mistrust of Providence" (NH, Volume I, p. ix). Rackham concludes that: "Nevertheless it is a mistake to underrate the value of his work. He is diligent, accurate, and free from prejudice." Pliny's writings about the hyena fall into two categories: the first dealing with "traditional" natural history, the second with accounts of practical results to be gained by using fractions of hyenas for medical purposes. As a natural historian, Pliny recounts Aristotle's description of the hyena's neck and mane, his denial of hyena hermaphroditism, and the magical powers of hyenas to freeze other animals in place. However, after repeating Aristotle's account of hyenas using vomiting sounds to attract dogs, he elaborates on the possibilities of hyena vocalization, observing that "... among the shepherds homesteads it simulates human speech, and picks up the name of one of them so as to call him to come out of doors and tear him in pieces, ..." (NH, Volume 3, Book 8, Paragraph 45, 107-9). We then come upon one of the few semi-positive references to hyenas in 2300 years: "The Magi have held in the highest admiration the hyaena of all animals, seeing that they have attributed even to an animal; magical skill and power, by which it takes away the senses and entices men to itself" (NH, Volume 8, Book 28, Paragraph 25, 92). He then devotes five pages (of the English translation) to describing the hyena as a walking pharmacopoeia, including the "fact" that a person carrying anything made of hyaena leather is not attacked, while the skin of the hyena head, when tied on, cures headaches; their teeth (when touched to the corresponding human tooth) relieve toothaches, and the gall, if applied to the forehead, cures opthalmia. Among other cures, Pliny observes "... that barrenness in women is cured by an eye taken in food with liquorice and dill, conception</page><page sequence="15">THE SPOTTED HYENA 515 being guaranteed in three days" (NH, Volume 8, Book 28, Paragraph 27, 98-9). Finally, in a somewhat confusing passage, Pliny notes that, "A hyaena's genitals taken in honey stimulate desire . . . , even when men hate intercourse with women ..." and adds that "... the peace of the whole household is assured by keeping in the home these genitals and a vertebra with the hide still adhering to them" (NH, Volume 8, Book 28, Paragraph 27, 99). The Physiologus is generally attributed to a single author, who lived somewhere between the second and fifth centuries AD. Curley has observed that Pliny transmitted Indian, Hebrew, and Egyptian legends that had reached him through varied routes to the early Christian world. He then adds that: "The anonymous author of Physiologus infused these venerable pagan tales with the spirit of Christian moral and mystical teaching, and thereafter they occupied a place of special importance in the symbolism of the Christian world" (Curley, 1979, p. xi). Whereas Aristotle and Pliny had presented their work in a secular context, Physiologus draws Christian moral implications from these animal stories, occasionally making drastic changes in the story to accommodate the moral lesson. Some species, particularly the panther or leopard, were the beneficiaries of such changes. Hyenas did not benefit from the new perspective. Their ambiguous sexuality, rejected by Aristotle and Pliny, was reactivated and became the focus in the Physiologus. "There is an animal which is called the hyena in Greek and the brute in Latin. The Law said, 'Thou shalt not eat the brute, nor anything similar to it' [cf Lev. 11:27]. This animal is an arenotelicon, that is, an alternating male-female. At one time it becomes male, at another female, and it is unclean because it has two natures, Therefore, Jeremiah said, 'Never will my heritage be to me like the cave of the brute' [cf Jer. 12:9]" (Curley, 1979, pp. 52-3). Physiologus, adds that "double-minded men are compared to the brute . . . being men at the signal for gathering the congregation" but taking on a "womanly nature" when the</page><page sequence="16">516 SOCIAL RESEARCH congregation is dismissed. He then adds an anti-Semitic twist to the story of the hyena which would persist throughout the bestiaries of the middle ages: "The sons of Israel are like this animal since in the beginning they served the living God but later, given over to pleasure and lust, they adored idols. For this reason, the Prophet likens the synagogue to an unclean animal. Whoever among us is eager for pleasure and greed is compared to this unclean brute since he is neither man nor woman, that is, neither faithful nor unfaithful" (Curley, 1979, p. 53). Hyenas in Medieval Times: The Bestiaries In the Middle Ages, bestiaries appeared which were heavily influenced by Physiologns. A twelfth-century Latin bestiary translated by T. H. White begins with a variant of the portrait presented in the Physiologus. "This is an animal called the YENA, which is accustomed to live in the sepulchres of the dead and to devour their bodies. Its nature is that at one moment it is masculine and at another moment feminine, and hence it is a dirty brute" (White, 1960, pp. 30-1). The compiler of this bestiary then adds the now familiar tales of hyaenas imitating human voices or the sounds of human vomiting with the goal of luring prey to their death, and reasserts that hyaenas dig up graves in quest of buried corpses. The bestiary then turns to the analogy between the Sons of Israel and the brute, concluding that: "Since they are neither male nor female, they are neither faithful nor pagan, but are obviously the people whom Solomon said: 'A man of double mind is inconstant in all his ways.' About whom also the Lord said: Thou canst not serve God and Mammon.'" The final passage in this bestiary repeats selected magical tales from Pliny and others about using the stone from a hyaena's eye, placed under the tongue, to forsee the future and the ability of hyenas to freeze animals in place by circling them three times.</page><page sequence="17">THE SPOTTED HYENA 517 Several later bestiaries I have examined appear to follow this text fairly closely in terms of content (Porion, 1988; Barber, 1993). There is also a common theme to the illustrations. The hyena is always portrayed in the act of devouring a human corpse; most commonly the body is in a coffin, often with a church in the background [Fig. 3]. This form of scavenging involves the disturbance of the peaceful rest of the interred body, and any such disturbance by external agents has been a subject of concern in human societies.8 The hyenas are all portrayed with a highly exaggerated mane running the length of the spine- as described originally by Aristotle. With the passage of time, the illustrations grow more elaborate, moving, as Barber observes, from simple line drawings to beautifully Fig. 3. Drawing from twelfth-century Latin bestiary portraying hyenas scavenging on human corpses.</page><page sequence="18">518 SOCIAL RESEARCH colored portrayals of animals in some English thirteenth- century bestiaries (Barber, 1993, pp. 11-12). However, there are no stripes or spots on the hyenas in these bestiaries. The bodies are uniformly colored, and it seems doubtful that the artists had ever seen a hyena. Thoughts of Hyenas in Britain: Sixteenth-Seventeenth Centuries In the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries, travelers to Africa and the Middle East provided new eyewitness (and second- hand) accounts of animals in remote areas, stimulating intense interest in Europe (Lloyd, 1971)]. Of particular relevance were the travels of a Moor, born in Granada but raised in Morocco, who ultimately converted to Christianity. Best known by the name of Leo Africanus, he wrote about his travels in Arabic and then contributed to the translation of that manuscript into Italian in approximately 1526 A.D. (Brown, 1896, V. 92-94).9 John Pory, in turn, translated Africanus' History and Description of Africa into English in 1600. New, somewhat fanciful material on hyenas was brought to the attention of the English public, and some old stories were repeated:. This beast ... in bignes and shape resembleth a woolfe, saving that his legges and feete are like to the legs and fee te of a man. It is not hurtful to any other beast, but will rake the carkeises of men out of their graves, and will devour them, being other wise an abject and silly creature. The hunters being acquainted with his denne, come befoire it singing and playing upon a drum, by which melodie being allured foorth, his legs are intrapped in a strong rope and so he is drawn out and slaine (Brown, 1986, V. 94, p. 947). The writings of these travelers presaged the return of a new, more secular natural history. In 1551, the Swiss naturalist Conrad Gesner compiled material on natural history from many sources and devoted particular attention to providing the best possible illustrations in the published work (Gesneri,</page><page sequence="19">THE SPOTTED HYENA 519 1551). Portions of this work, with associated illustrations, were translated from Latin and edited by Edward Topsell early in the seventeenth century. The material on hyenas was both interesting and influential. "The first and vulgar kind of Hyaena is bred in Affricke and Arabia, being in quantity of body like a wolfe, but much rougher haird, for it hath bristles like a horsses mane all along his back, and the middle of his backe is a little crooked or dented, the colour yellowish, but bespeckled on the sides with blew spots, which make him looke more terrible, as if it had so many eies" (Topsell, 1608, p. 340). The preceding description combines the mane of the striped hyena with the spots of Crocuta in an account calculated to inspire fear. Confusion still reigned over the existence of multiple species of hyena. The drawing that Gesner presented of the "firste" kind of hyena reflected that confusion, containing spots composed of parallel stripes [Fig. 4]. However, merely filling in the details of the body was an "advance" over the mediaeval bestiaries. There were also Fig. 4. Drawing from Gesner s Natural Histon (1551), portraying a hyena eating a dog.</page><page sequence="20">520 SOCIAL RESEARCH important changes in attitude reflected in text. Following Aristotle, Gesner/Topsell now denies the hermaphroditism of hyenas but adds some new and interesting details (describing ". . . in the femal a bunch like the stones of the male," which could refer to the fatty tissues found in the pseudoscrotum of the spotted hyena) (Topsell, 1608, p. 340). He then goes on to suggest that confusion over hyena sexuality might have arisen from observations of fish with the same name, " . . . which turneth sexe, and peradventure some men hearing so much of the fish, might mistake it more easilye for the four-footed beast, and applye it thereunto" (Topsell, 1608, p. 340). An extensive recital of familiar and unfamiliar magical properties of hyenas is then described. Finally, Topsell concludes the discussion of the "firste" hyena: "Such is the folly of the Magitians, that they beleeve the transmigration of soûles, not only of one man into another, but also of man into Beasts. And therefore they affirm, that their men Symis and religous votaries departing life send their souls into Lyons, and their religous women into Hyaenaes" (Topsell, 1608, p. 342). Topsell adds three other animals within the category of hyenas: the Papio or Dabuh (which is clearly a baboon), the Crocuta, "... an Aethiopian four-footed beast . . . ingendered betwixt a Lyoness and an Hyaena," and the Mantichora, a fanciful monster with the body of a lion and a human head (Topsell, 1608, p. 342-45).10 A new skepticism was emphasized in the writings of Sir Thomas Browne, a bit later in the seventeenth century. In his Pseudodoxia Epidemica he dismisses the "annual mutation of the sexes in the hyaena"11 and provides a rational explanation for the supposedly hypnotic powers of the hyena over dogs, attributing a variety of such effects to "... a vehement fear which naturally produce th obmutescence; and sometimes irrevocable silence (PE, V. 1, p. 339). It was well for the hyena reputation that their sexual "double-mindedness" was rejected at this time. The very rational and liberal Browne makes clear that animals, as well as people, were to follow a single "Law of</page><page sequence="21">THE SPOTTED HYENA 521 their Coition," that " . . . they observe and transgress not . . . "; it is only man that "... hath in his own kind run thorow the Anomalies of venery; and been so bold, not only to act, but represent to view, the irregular ways of lust" (PE, V. 2, p. 41). Species were obligated to follow their particular law of coition, and a beast that changed sex from year-to-year would surely have transgressed. Hyenas also occupied the attention of writers whose major focus was not on natural history. Sir Walter Raleigh, in his History of the World (1614, Book I), dealt with hyenas in the context of Noah's Ark.12 In a delightfully "rational" passage, he grapples with the problem of fitting all of the existent animal species within the limited space provided by the ark. Detailed calculations are provided encompassing the space required by both sexes of each species and the requisite animal food, as well as space to house Noah, his family, and necessary supplies. Space is tight, and Raleigh relieves some of the pressure by noting that: "For those Beasts which are of mixt natures ... it was not needful to preserve them, seeing that they might be generated again by others: as the Mules, the Hyaena's, &amp; the like; the one begotten by Asses and Mares, and the other by Foxes and Wolves" (Raleigh, 1614, Book I, pp. 94-5). References to hyenas also appear with some frequency in English literature of the time. Although these writers were not clear about the various species of hyena, the focus was on vocalizations, and this means the spotted hyena (striped and brown hyenas have a much more limited vocal repertoire). In As You Like It, Shakespeare has Rosalind telling Orlando how she will change after they are wed, using a number of animal analogies: "I will be more jealous of thee than a Barbary cock-pigeon over his hen; more clamorous than a parrot against rain; more new-fangled than an ape; more giddy in my desires than a monkey: I will weep for nothing like Diana in the fountain, and I will do that when you are supposed to be</page><page sequence="22">522 SOCIAL RESEARCH merry; I will laugh like a hyen, and that when thou are inclined to sleep" (Act IV, Scene One).13 Hyena vocalizations are also the focus of metaphor in George Chapman's Eastward Ho ("I will neither yield to the song of the siren nor the voice of the hyena" [Act V, Scene 1]) and, much less directly, in Milton's Samson Agonistes, as Samson speaks of Dehlila: "Out, out hyaena; these are thy wonted arts, and arts of every women false like thee" (Milton, 1971, p. 369). John Carey attributes the latter reference to the stories in Pliny concerning the deceitful nature of hyena vocalizations used to lure innocents to their death. He also calls attention to Ben Jonson's reference to hyenas in Volpone ("Now, thine eies / Vie teares with the hyaena" [IV vi 3]) as continuing this use of hyenas to represent deceit (Milton, 1971, pp. 369-70). Toward the end of the seventeenth century, John Dryden translated selections from Ovid's Metamorphosis, written be- tween A.D. 2 and A.D. 8, into rhymed English verse. The bisexuality of the hyena was resurrected: "A wonder more amazing wou'd we find? / Th' Hyaena shows it, of a double kind, / Varying the sexes in alternate years, / In one begets, and in another bears" (Dryden, 1961, Book XV, p. 502). Modern Natural Histories: Eighteenth-Nineteenth- Twentieth Centuries In the eighteenth and nineteenth century there was a notable advance in the biological accuracy of books concerned with natural history. Travelling was sufficiently frequent, and communication was common enough so that an author could compare recent accounts of wildlife in remote areas, examine specimens, and perhaps even observe wild animals from far-away places in European zoological parks. This both constrained the more fabulous tales of earlier centuries and provided a personal perspective that had often been lacking since the times of ancient Greece and Rome. The three species</page><page sequence="23">THE SPOTTED HYENA 523 of hyena were finally recognized and named. Scientist-writers had already rejected stories of hermaphroditism, but the publication of a set of papers by Watson (1877, 1878) provided the actual anatomical details of spotted hyena genitalia and settled (or should have settled) that issue. Natural historians continued to focus on the scavenging habits of the hyenids and their potential as grave-robbers, even though there was obvious awareness of the predatory possibilities of spotted hyenas. In addition, one old theme was resurrected, and a new dimension emerged. The old theme was bravery and cowardice; the new dimension involved the possibility of "taming" hyenas as pets. Bravery and Cowardice Natural historians of the eighteenth and nineteenth century as well as a number of writers in the present century appear to have been preoccupied with the dimensions of bravery and cowardice as applied to animals. Moreover, the criterion was not how the animals related to one another within their habitat, but how they related to us, and particularly how they related to hunters with guns. Lions are generally much admired: "Accustomed to measure their strength with that of every animal they meet, the habit of conquering renders them terrible and intrepid. . . . Wounds enrage, without terrifying them. They are not disconcerted even by the appearance of numbers. A single lion of the desert often attacks a whole caravan; and if ... he finds himself fatigued, instead of flying, he retreats fighting, always opposing his face to the enemy" (Buffon, 1830, pp. 3-4). The contrast with views of the hyena is clear and to the latter's disadvantage. For example, Nott stated that, "All writers agree that the hyaena lacks courage, and is only ferocious when he himself is free from harm" (Nott, 1886, p. 106). He goes on to note that hunting hyaenas is not</page><page sequence="24">524 SOCIAL RESEARCH considered good sport, and relates an incident in which a "well-known Indian sportsman" by the name of McMaster found himself face to face with a terrified hyaena. Previously, he had not "wished to waste a shot," but now "... although I had spared it before, I could not resist taking his worthless life as he stood" (Nott, 1886, p. 106). Flower and Lyddeker characterize the striped hyena as "essentialy a cowardly animal," although they do distinguish it from the spotted hyena, which is described as "larger and bolder . . . hunting in packs, and uttering very frequently its unearthly cry" (Flower and Lydekker, 1891, pp. 542-43). Mention of the "cowardice" of striped hyenas emerges in the otherwise sedate passages of the eleventh edition of the Encyclopaedia Britannica (1910-1911, V. 13, p. 174), is repeated as part of a more general commentary on hyenids in the fifteenth edition published in 1976 (V. 3, p. 935), and is even found in Walker's authoritative Mammals of the World. There it is asserted that spotted hyenas " . . . are cowardly and will not fight if their prospective victim defends itself" (Walker et al., 1968, V. 11, p. 1265). What have hyenas done to earn such human scorn? First, as regards the striped hyena, there are many older stories suggesting that striped hyenas could be captured alive by human beings, by hand, without resistance (for example, Leo Africanus); second, that even spotted hyenas, as predators, select the sick and the weak as their natural prey. By extension, when attacking people, their targets would be the smaller, weaker humans, particulary children. That this is still an issue is indicated by a recent report in the journal, Tropical Doctor, identifying snake and hyena bites as a significant cause of amputations among the children of Senegal (Loro, Franceschi, Dal Lago, 1994, p. 99). Finally, spotted hyenas are very wary animals, whose style when hunting large, dangerous prey involves a great deal of "testing," that is, of approach and withdrawal. This would fit well with our notions of human cowardice, that is, they do not come out and fight-like-real- men, face-to-face.</page><page sequence="25">THE SPOTTED HYENA 525 Hyenas as Pets There is evidence from paintings and bas-reliefs in tombs that in ancient Egypt hyenas were tamed and kept as pets, as well as being artificially fattened as food (Zeuner, 1963). That striped hyenas could be tamed and kept as pets was a matter of fascination for authors in the eighteenth (Buffon, 1830, p. 95), nineteenth (Nott, 1886, p. 114), and twentieth (Ognev, 1962, p. 317; Roosevelt and Heller, 1915, p. 260) centuries. In earlier editions of his Natural History, Buffon denied the possibility of taming hyenas: "His disposition is extremely ferocious and, though taken young, can never be tamed" (Buffon, 1830, p. 94). He corrects this in a supplement inserted in later editions, describing personal observation of a male hyena who, "... having been tamed when young, was remarkably gentle; for though his master often provoked him with a cudgel, in order to erect his mane, . . . instantly afterwards seemed to forget the affront" (Buffon, 1830, p. 95). I will return to the question of humans forming reciprocal, affectionate relationships with hyenas toward the conclusion of this paper. African Attitudes It is apparent that the reputation of hyenas in Africa is no better than their reputation in Anglo-American culture. Beidelman (1975, p. 183) states that the Kaguru of Tanzania, East Africa, speak of spotted hyenas with a combination of disgust, fear, and derision but also as funny or comical. They are viewed as "incredibly greedy," with "boundless appetites," and as being "so stupid or perverse that they even prefer bones to good meat." The Kaguru believe that hyenas are hermaph- rodites, and "were horrified" when Biedelman asked whether they would eat hyena flesh. The Kaguru also believe that hyenas dig up the graves of the dead and attribute the "exceedingly unpleasant odour" of hyenas to their disgusting</page><page sequence="26">526 SOCIAL RESEARCH diet. In Kaguru folklore, tales of hyenas are generally associated with anti-social behavior. Sapir, discussing the attitudes of the Kujamaat Diola of Southern Senegal in West Africa, notes that in their folktales "... the Hyena becomes a vehicle for a very definite character type which combines the perceived characteristics of greediness (especially with food), aggressiveness, trickiness of a particularly crude sort . . . and often plain stupidness." He concludes that: "The characteris- tics that Beidelman . . . has inferred for Hyena in Kaguru folklore are essentially those developed in Kujamaat tales. In fact, one can safely say that its role is fairly uniform across Africa" (Sapir, 1981, pp. 532-33). Allen F. Roberts is the author of a new book on Animals in African Art (1995).14 Roberts reviews African attitudes toward hyenas in the context of correlated artistic productions. I recently received a postcard printed in Benin from Professor Roberts. He noted that to the best of his knowledge, this is the only representation of a "whole" hyena in African Art. It depicts a hyena regurgitating a stolen goat, certainly a portrayal of gluttony and anti-social behavior. There is also the stupidity of trying to swallow something so outsized, and, as in many of the folk tales recounted by Beidelman, there may be a moral lesson regarding the futility of theft. Although full-body depictions of hyenas may be rare in Africa, Roberts decribes and offers photographs of hyena masks that are comonly worn by dancers in a number of African cultures. He observes that through wearing such masks, "... people can "become" hyenas to play dramatic roles that usually run counter to social harmony or the tenets of human civilization" (Roberts, 1995, p. 75). African and Western Attitudes Over the years, African and Western attitudes have converged on a negative vision of hyenas. Similar characteris-</page><page sequence="27">THE SPOTTED HYENA 527 tics, that is, sexual ambiguity, scavenging, disturbing gravesites, and eating the bones of our dead, have been the focus of disapproval in widely different cultural settings. However, there are also significant cultural differences. The judgement that hyenas are ugly and cowardly is much more prominent in our culture, while the greed, gluttony, stupidity, and comical foolishness of hyenas is a more integrated part of African lore, as is an appreciation of these animals as powerful and potentially dangerous. Although these cultural differences reflect the closer contact that Africans have had with hyenas, the quote from Hemingway presented earlier in this paper and the general portrayal of hyenas in The Lion King are much more closely tied to the African view of hyenas than traditional Western views. In both Hemingway and The Lion King there is an emphasis on greed, gluttony, and stupidity that is ultimately designed to be comical. This reaches its "pinnacle" when a hyena feeds on its own body, as described in The Green Hills of Africa and in the American children's computer game based on the movie {The Lion King . . ., 1994) Hyena Reputations Across Time in Western Culture Most of the negative characteristics associated with hyenas can be found in Aristotle but in relatively non-judgemental form: the animals are what they are. Pliny, with his jumble of stories both true and fabulous, is also relatively unjudge- mental, although there is certainly an element of wonder. It is in the Physiologus that we first come upon explicit, negative judgements. Early in the Christian era and continuing through the middle ages, two themes emerged: that hyenas changed sex from year to year- a morally unacceptable practice- and that they preyed upon human corpses, digging up graves. The former was linked metaphorically to the Jews and reflected the anti-semitism of this extended period, while the latter was</page><page sequence="28">528 SOCIAL RESEARCH threatening to many human traditions and persists to the present day. In the post medieval world, the hyena reputation was reexamined. After an early period of uncritical enthusiasm for animal stories, a set of new, somewhat more reality-based attitudes gradually emerged, and hyenas were "appreciated" for characteristics, such as their vocalizations, in seventeenth- century English literature. Finally, as we move into the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries, writers come to under- stand hyena speciation. However, this did not help the hyena reputation. Their ambiguous sexuality has receded as a moral concern in Europe, but several old concerns moved to center stage: in particular, that they were cowardly, but dangerous, scavengers. The Biology of Reputation Reputation is related to biology, but it is clearly not a simple relationship. The fact that spotted hyenas were misperceived as scavengers undoubtedly contributed directly to their poor reputation. Perhaps there is some aspect of their eating food that is unappetizing, or would even be unhealthy for us, that encourages us to reject the "ingestors" of such items. Possibly, there is even a lapse of the work ethic that we find offensive. Why are they not out there working hard and "earning" their food, like an admirable predator? The fact that hyenas are dangerous to humans, to the peaceful rest of our buried friends and relatives and to pets and livestock, must also have contributed to their persistently negative image, as has the misperception of their sexual ambiguity and the strange perception of their "cowardice." However, it is important to recognize the extent of cultural variation. The Kaguru may have been horrified by the thought of eating hyena flesh (Beidelman, 1975), but the Kujamaat "may eat hyena" (Sapir, 1981, p. 53 1)15 and ancient Egyptians</page><page sequence="29">THE SPOTTED HYENA 529 evidently found hyenas to be worth fattening in captivity and eating (Zeuner, 1963). People in Western Europe were often preoccupied with thoughts of hyenas disturbing human gravesites, but others, in Africa, were taking the ecologically reasonable step of deliberately setting their dead in the open, to be disposed of by hyenas (Schwabe, 1978). The European Natural Histories of the eighteenth-twentieth centuries are filled with admiration for predators, but as Beidelman observes, "When selecting animals to use metaphorically, Kaguru choose carnivores for negative qualities and herbivores for more positive ones. All larger carnivores (lions, leopards, hyenas, pythons) are described negatively and are a threat to man and his livestock" (Beidelman, 1975, p. 192). The European admiration for predators may depend on distance and weaponry. As to the supposed sexual ambiguity of hyenas, it is clear that this was much more disturbing to Europeans during medieval times than before or since. Just as there has been great cultural variation in human response to sexual variations in our own species, so there has been variation in attitudes toward presumptive sexual variation in animals. We have seen similar fluctuations across time in European views of coward- ice, and this trait has not been a prominent aspect of the African portrait of hyenas described above. Finally, hyenas have also been castigated for their vocaliza- tions, supposedly foul odors, and ugly appearance. Spotted hyenas do have an incredible array of vocalizations, as one might expect in a social, nocturnal predator (Kruuk, 1972, pp. 220-22; Mills, 1990, pp. 179-87). They are not particularly "smelly," certainly not in the class of a lion. They do have anal scent glands which produce a somewhat soapy/musky smelling paste. However, as the surgeon-anatomist John Hunter observed in the late eighteenth century, in the course of dissecting a striped hyena, these glands "... contain a yellow substance somewhat harder than common butter, which smells like musk. They are always distended with this matter, and but</page><page sequence="30">530 SOCIAL RESEARCH very little of it can escape in substance. I would seem as if it was only meant as smelling in a bottle" (Hunter, 1861, p. 58). It is unfortunate that Dr. Hunter never had the opportunity of observing the scent-marking behavior of this species or of the other hyenas. They do extrude these anal glands and deposit paste on stones, tree trunks, grass, or other objects (Reiger, 1981). However, in the ordinary course of events, you are not likely to come upon any concentrated scent-marking site. Visitors to our colony often comment on the lack of odor. In regard to their "ugly" appearance, they do have large heads and short hindlegs, in comparison with a generalized mammal. Perhaps their appearance does touch some primitive aesthetic template. However, bears also have short hindlegs and that has not prevented them from being adopted as positive cultural icons in the form of childrens' toys. In addition, large heads are characteristic of babies and presumed to be one aspect of their charm (Tinbergen, 1951). This is an area where the media portrayal of hyenas has clearly contributed to the general view. After spending a great deal of time with spotted hyenas during the past decade, I have come to the conclusion that peoples attitudes often tell us little about hyenas but reveal a great deal about our own needs and anxieties, as well as our readiness to perceive the natural world from a very personal perspective and to make our ideas and images cohere. In the long run, it is important to understand the routes through which we have constructed these cohesive views. What are the essential elements that initiated the process, and what are the conditioned qualities that complete the picture? Learning to Love Hyenas: A Personal Journey I believe that there is a special attraction of dangerous carnivores that invites the attention of other animals, including humans. In part, this is just practical fear reduction.</page><page sequence="31">THE SPOTTED HYENA 531 Thompson's gazelles gather on the African savannah, cluster- ing about their primary predator, the cheetah (Kruuk, 1972). Presumably, they are attempting to deal with the danger presented by this predator by gathering information about its location, behavior, and intentions. Our species also has a set of mechanisms for dealing with dangerous predators. We gather information and learn about them, a bit like gazelles. We also attempt to conquer and control them, as in circus acts, or, sometimes, we denigrate them as vile, repulsive, ugly, comical creatures. There is another strategy. On occasion, we attempt to bond with them. I believe that my own view positive of hyenas has been constructed, in part, intellectually, by studying them. Know- ing the nuances of their lifestyle and the difficulties that they face on a daily basis and being familiar with sights and sounds of hyenas changes my view of them. They begin to look attractive and appealing. I hear their vocalizations, not as eerie, but as a remarkable and necessary trait of a nocturnal mammal with a rich social life. And I find that their foul smell is truly mythical. But something else has «happened that is less cognitive and more emotional; my colleagues and I have bonded with these animals, as Hans Kruuk did with a pet hyena (Kruuk, 1972). lb As the result of rearing them and watching their individual lives and personalities unfold, we have formed attachments [Fig. 5]. It is a potentially dangerous process for the scientist, although it may be inevitable and can be beneficial to all involved (Davis and Balfour, 1992). It is important to make sure we are aware of what has occurred and try to utilize our familiarity and comfort with the animals to enrich our understanding of their life. Hyena researchers are not alone. Gordon Burghardt, an ethologist at the University of Tennessee who has worked with bears, has recently written an article describing the bonds between humans and bears and the consequences for his research</page><page sequence="32">532 SOCIAL RESEARCH Fig. 5. Krista Glickman with an adult female hyena. (Burghardt, 1992). The people I know who work with wolves have certainly had to grapple with similar problems (Fen- tress, 1992). At the beginning of this paper, I raised the question of why we were so out of step with the rest of Western culture in our attitudes toward hyenas. I think these are the reasons: a combination of knowledge, familiarity, and bonding. The animals look and sound different to us then they do to others, particularly as hyenas are portrayed in the popular media. We carry a different set of images in our heads. Hopefully, we will be able to communicate our understand- ing of these animals beyond the traditional scientific community. I think we owe them that much. And there are some encouraging signs. More and better documenter- ies have appeared that reveal the complexities of hyena life (for example, The Sisterhood', Lions and Hyenas: Eternal Enemies). Articles have been published that increase public familiarity and convey a more appealing visual image (Stevens, 1993), and, in a recent edition of Road and Track</page><page sequence="33">THE SPOTTED HYENA 533 (47, October 1995, p. 40), it was announced that a new high performance Italian sports car has been built: the Lancia Hyena Zagato. There is even an alternative rock group called "The Laughing Hyenas," and a newsgroup on USENET devoted to people who are fans of hyenas (address: alt.fan. hyena). Hyenas on MTV and the information super- highway! Now there would have been a thought with which Aristotle could grapple. Notes 1 Information about the behavior of spotted hyenas in nature can be found in the books by Kruuk and Mills, the field reports of Frank (1986a, p. 1500; 1986b, p. 1510), Hofer and East (1993), and Holekamo and Smale Ü991. d. 306). 2 Personal communication from Mr. Gary Noble of the St. Louis Zoo, who has undertaken to develop a "studbook" of all spotted and striped hyenas in North American zoological parks. 3 Throughout this paper, references to Aristotle's History of Animals, Parts of Animals, and Generation of Animals are based on the 1912 Oxford edition, which has extensive footnotes for these biological works (Smith and Ross, 1958). References to On Marvellous Things Heard are from the most recent Oxford compilation (Barnes, 1984V 4 In a footnote to this section, the translator (A. Platt) observes that it is impossible to guess what the "Trochus" might have been. This feature is also described in HA, VIII, 5, 594b, 1-2, with the hyena having "... a mane like a horse, only that the hair is stiffer and longer and extends over the entire length of the chine." By spitefulness, Aristotle may be referring to the phenomenon of "surplus killing," that is, killing in excess of what can be consumed. Lions were much admired for their supposed restraint in not killing more than could be eaten. 7 All references to Pliny's Natural History (NH) contained in this article refer to the Loeb Classical Library edition (Rackham, 1958). 8 See Richardson (1987) for a discussion of the dread of dismemberment in a very different context.</page><page sequence="34">534 SOCIAL RESEARCH 9 Facts of the life of Leo Africanus are considered in the introduction to the first volume, written by Dr. Brown. 10 The critical distinction between spotted and striped hyenas was still causing confusion. Spotted hyenas, in the modern genus Crocuta, were probably present in Ethiopia in those times as they are today. In the next century, the great French naturalist, George Louis LeClerc, Comte de Buffon (1707-1788), would begin his consideration of hyenas with an extensive discourse on the many names that had been applied to these species, but he still did not appreciate the nature of their speciation. 11 Pseudodoxia Epidemica (PE) was first published in 1646. The quotations provided in this article are from the sixth edition, published in 1672 (Savie, 1904, V. 1, p. 174). 12 Sir Walter Raleigh's The History of the World was originally published in 1614, while Raleigh was in prison. Quotations provided in this article are taken from an edition printed in London in 1652. 13 The "laugh" of the hyena is not a joyous sound. At best it is associated with excitement, at worst with a very negative event. For example, hyenas would commonly "laugh" when displaced from a kill by lions. Shakespeare's use is raw anthropomorphism. Professor Roberts was curator of the exhibition at the Museum for African Art that was held in conjunction with the "In the Company of Animals" conference. Sapir adds that " ... it is hardly a preferred food." 1 £' -•- T 1 111» -I 11 «1 1 1* Kruuk concludes his acknowledgements with a salute to nis tame hyena, Solomon, "who gave us so much fun under the guise of scientific information."
