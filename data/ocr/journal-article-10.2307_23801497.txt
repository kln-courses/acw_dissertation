<plain_text><page sequence="1">THE EVOLUTION AND CLASSIFICATION OF PHILOSOPHICAL LIFE THEORIES À NY classification, and especially one of theories, is always more l \ or less artificial. The various items classified can easily be distorted. As for theories, it is often a hard task to label them and place them under the caption of some common name, since many of them have an eclectic character at least in part. Still, an orderly study of a subject requires some sort of classification of its treat ments in accordance with what might be called a scholastic adage: qui bene distinguit, bene docet. The distinction and consequently the classification of biological theories has been attempted according to various criteria, each of which is valuable, of course, from its proper standpoint. One may simply sum them up on a historical basis, but then the enumeration must needs be crossed by the application of other criteria. One may classify them on the basis of their so-called scientific or outspoken philosophical character; but then it is difficult to trace the borderline, because general scientific theories in biology prac tically always contain some philosophical implications or, at least, imperceptibly slip into philosophical territory. Some have classified life theories according to their adherence to general philosophical systems, such as Monism, Pluralism (Dual ism), Materialism, and Idealism.1 This kind of procedure is very useful but sometimes too general. A quite common classification is that which is based on the question, whether or not there is an essential difference between animate and inanimate bodies. The theories which give an affirma tive answer are called vitalistic, those which answer in the negative, mechanistic. Others base their classification on the answers to the question: must a living organism be regarded as a plurality, i. e., as a sum of uncorrelated, independent entities, or as a unity, i.e., as an in tegrated whole? From this standpoint is made the distinction be tween Atomism or, in biological terms, Micromerism on the one 1. E. g., Schwertschlager, Phil, tier Natur, II, pp. 121 et seq. 113</page><page sequence="2">114 FRANCISCAN STUDIES hand and Holism on the other. This kind of classification is made quite often at present in view of many recent life theories; but it should be made also in view of very old and ancient theories, such as the Aristotelian-scholastic conception of life. The last two criteria, if taken independently of each other, cover only the dichotomy of one aspect of the life problem. To solve this problem satisfactorily in its entirety, they should be taken together; and, in fact, they supplement each other, as we shall see presently. We shall, therefore, apply both criteria at the same time; and to show the evolution of life theories, we shall also follow the his torical lines. In regard to the latter, we shall commence with the more modern which begin around Descartes' time, and only en passant shall we mention some older theories. The theory which we hold to be the right one is old and new at the same time, because it is that of the philosophta perennis: the Aristotelian-scholastic theory, which may be called vitalistic sub stantialism or animistic hylomorphism. To give a very brief sum mary, this system holds that an organism is to be conceived — on account of its activity and finality — as a natural body (corpus natu rale), i. e., as a body which is not just an aggregate of manifold parts, such as cells, atoms, electrons, etc., acting more or less auto nomically, but a body whose parts are essentially united into an organized whole or substance. This unity, empirically established, requires in every natural body — either organic or inorganic — two co-principles, matter and form, making up together one substance; the form being the specific principle, the source of its activity and the principle of its unity. Furthermore, the observation of the functions of living natural bodies proves that their formal principle must be of an order essen tially different from that of the form of inorganic natural bodies, and consequently that there exists an essential difference between these two kinds of natural bodies. The formal principle of substan tiality and unity is at the same time the principle of specification. Because the principle that distinguishes organic from inorganic sub stance is called anima, soul, the Aristotelian-scholastic life theory is often referred to as animistic substantialism. From a systematic viewpoint it would be logical to classify the various other life theories as tested by the scholastic view, i. e., ac</page><page sequence="3">PHILOSOPHICAL LIFE THEORIES 115 cording to their essential or perhaps even gradual agreement or dis agreement with that conception. From a historical viewpoint, how ever, the issue is different. Since Descartes, the prevailing system has been — and perhaps still is — mechanism, and practically all other life theories take their starting point from the refutation of one or more or all of the cardinal theses of the mechanistic system. An outline of various theories of mechanism, therefore, and a compari son of the other theories with the latter will show the historical development of the attempts to solve the life problem. But, since mechanism is the very opposite of scholastic substantialism in every respect, an outline of the theories which diverge from the former will at the same time show, one way or another, a positive approach to the latter. Mechanism in its proper and literal sense teaches that the only existing "force" in the world is eternal local motion which, from the beginning, drives the mass of eternal matter. It is in the first place a theory concerning the activity of matter; according to this theory matter is inert, essentially inactive, i. e., it does not dispose of any physical activity deriving from its own nature; in other words, it is deprived of all efficient causality. A fortiori, therefore, it denies that masses of matter, which commonly are called bodies, possess any principle of activity; and since such a principle would form the essential unity of a body, it denies such a unity as well. Thus mechanism becomes associated with atomism, a theory of the constitution of matter. Bodies, accord ing to mechanistic atomism, are composed of extended, but indivisi ble, essentially simple and immutable matter entities, the atoms. Transferred to the terrain of living bodies, mechanism presents the same fundamental theses and draws from them the conclusion that no distinction exists between what is called the animate and the inanimate world; biological mechanism recognizes in the organisms nothing but immutable particles of matter and passively received motion, exactly as in inorganic bodies; mechanism is consequently anti-vitalistic. As taught in biology, atomism at the present time often goes by the name of micromerism or simply merism (Greek piçoç part). As atomism, in the universal field, follows the purely analyti cal method, so does merism in regard to organisms: it breaks down</page><page sequence="4">116 FRANCISCAN STUDIES their structure into organs, tissues, cells, chromosomes, and genes, and these finally into atoms, electrons, and protons; and at the same time it analyzes their apparent activity as consisting of even smaller partial functions which it tries to reduce to mechanical motion. According to modern terminology mechanism may be designated as anti-vitalistic merism. Summarizing we may reduce the doctrine of biological mechan ism to two cardinal points of which the second is also twofold: (1) an organism is to be considered from a meristic standpoint, i. e., not as a unity but as an aggregate or sum of particles, e. g., cells, or whatever their names may be; (2) the forces of an organism are only mechanical, and there is, consequently, no difference between a living and an inorganic body. The above holds true for what is commonly said to be extreme mechanism. Many biologists, however, although still claiming the name of mechanists, mitigate one or another of the theses we men tioned. Just as dynamic atomism, in the inorganic field, means a mitigation of the first point, since it admits at least in words other forces than the purely mechanical, so there are also in history vari ous mitigated forms of biological mechanism. Other biologists object to being called mechanists and attack more or less resolutely one or both of the above points. Sometimes all antagonists of biological mechanism are simply labeled as vitalists. This is a mistake and does not do justice to tlie anti-mechanistic theories. Vitalism as such designates a system which is opposed to only a part of the mechanistic doctrine; its starting point is a refutation of the second thesis of that doctrine concerning the difference between the animate and inanimate, and consequently it has to revise, one way or other, the question of the organic forces. It does not, however, necessarily touch the first thesis. In fact, many biologists who are called or who want to be called vitalistic, ignore this point, pass over it, or positively maintain a meristic view, as is the case with the defenders of the theories of vital energies. Some scholastic textbooks over-simplify the life problem when they formulate it in these words: whether or not life can be reduced to purely physical and chemical forces. As if that were the whole biological problem. Besides, it is misleading, since very many who answer the problem, thus formulated, in the negative are still miles</page><page sequence="5">PHILOSOPHICAL LIFE THEORIES 117 away from the scholastic solution. Many vitalists tackle the problem only from the final point, without first constructing the basis for a solid solution by refuting the first thesis of the mechanistic doctrine. On the other hand, those biologists who do not answer to the name of merists take the first mechanistic theory as a springboard: they attack the meristic, summative conception of life which is in herent in mechanism, but by no means limited to the latter, as we just pointed out; therefore, they attack the meristic view of many vitalists as well. The name anti-merist, however, does not necessarily imply the rejection of the second mechanistic theory. These biologists employ, not the analytical, but the synthetic method, wherefore their system is called synthetic biology; and be cause they conceive an organism as a whole, they describe their biology also as the totality theory (Ganzheits-biologie), as organi cism (Organismentheorie), or as holism. The adherents of this theory claim that the analytical, summa tive, meristic, fragmentary theories commit a logical error, a petitio principit. They do not deny at all, of course, that analysis is a valu able means to secure data concerning the activity of the single or gans, tissues, cells, etc., but according to them the mistake of the micromerists lies in the point that the latter believe in the recon struction of the original whole by just adding together the struc tural and functional parts which they have found by analysis. This belief is based upon the very assumption that must be proved, namely, that an organism is nothing but an additive summation of parts, in other words that it can and must be regarded as a machine. But this supposition — the holists rightly observe — is exactly the point under discussion.2 A machine may indeed be taken apart in reality, and by putting the parts together it may be reconstructed also in reality. The living organism, too, can really be analyzed, but it cannot be re-synthesized really. The whole of an organism is more than the simple sum of its parts; and not only qualitatively more, but also qualitatively different from that sum, because its total activity is essentially differ ent from the summative addition of its partial functions. One may, of course, break down an organism mentally, but then the parts are 2. Cf. M. F. Canella, Orientamenti délia moderna biología; Micromerismo ad Or ganicismo (Bologna, 1939), pp. 11, 63-80.</page><page sequence="6">118 FRANCISCAN STUDIES mental parts i. e., parts with the connotation that they are parts of a living whole. Their value consists only in being considered as parts of a whole. These and similar considerations bring the holists to the concep tion that an organism cannot be conceived as an aggregate of cells etc., but is to be thought of as a complete totality, and that its activ ity is not equal to the collective action of its cells or genes, but is the unitary action of a whole as such. The holistic conception is certainly a first and valuable step in the direction of a solid solution of the life problem; it paves the way for its solution. But as such it is not enough. Some of its adherents, in fact, do not go farther, but just collect the arguments which prove the organism's structural and functional unity, as Kohler and other Gestaltists. Others see the implication and require a prin ciple to account for the unity. And finally some maintain, on the basis of the difference in activity, that the principle of living organ isms is of an order different from the one that constitutes the unity of inorganic bodies; they combine holism with vitalism, and thus they approach closely to the scholastic viewpoint. According to the criteria outlined, we shall classify the various philosophical life theories since Descartes into two general groups, accordingly as they take either a meristic or holistic view of an organ ism, and each one will have two subdivisions corresponding to their vitalistic or anti-vitalistic standpoint. I. Meristic Theories A. ANTI-VITALISTIC MERISM (MECHANISM) The history of mechanism from the time of Descartes on, if presented in the form of a curve, would show two peaks represent ing the extremes and three depressions representing mitigated forms of mechanism. Such a presentation takes into account not only mechanism as such but also as combined with materialism: a com bination made by many mechanists. Thus conceived, the wave starts off with Descartes, who certainly propounds pure mechanism as far as matter is concerned, but at the same time teaches spiritualism; the wave swells and forms a</page><page sequence="7">PHILOSOPHICAL LIFE THEORIES 119 crest with La Mettrie; then it falls down to a lower level represent ing some reduced form, as taught, for example, by Berzelius; with Haeckel it reaches its highest peak, whereas in recent times it is ebbing down again, since mechanism is presented nowadays in a rather diluted form. Although it is true, as E. Nordenskiôld rightly observes,3 that the mechanistic speculation "gives a somewhat mo notonous impression," it seems to be worth while to point out some of the main features of the above five groups in order to show the various shades. Since we are dealing here only with philosophical life theories, we omit mention of those biologists who adopt — dangerous as it may be — the mechanistic view more or less as a provisory attitude or scientific method, without drawing the philosophical conclu sions from it. 1. R. Descartes (1596-1650) is generally cited as the typical protagonist of the more modern mechanism. Descartes recognizes the existence of the spiritual soul which is the thinking substance, because he reduces all consciousness to thought. But since plants and animals are unable to think, they cannot be considered as pos sessing a soul; in other words, they are inanimate, not really living, machines; they are a composition of parts which inside and outside the machine are alike. And their movements are like the local mo tion of a machine; they respond automatically to external stimuli which are carried through the body-machine by means of the spiritus animales, "a kind of very subtle wind." The same holds true for man in as far as his body is concerned, with this additional excep tion, that the human machine-body receives its impulses from the spiritual soul, located in the pineal gland; there the action of the soul upon the nervous system, and hence on the muscles, takes place; and vice versa, the movements of the muscles are conveyed through the nervous system up to the brain where they become conscious. It is clear that the Cartesian conception of living bodies is a mechanism sut juris. We find here the fundamental thesis of mecha nism, namely, that the only force which works in matter is local movement; but we also find too many influences derived from Aristotelian substantialism to call this doctrine merism in the proper sense. Descartes' dualistic view of the body-machine in man is cer 3. The History of Biology (Tudor Publishing Company, New York, 1936), p. 606.</page><page sequence="8">120 FRANCISCAN STUDIES tainly not holistic, but it is not atomistic in the strict sense, because he does not admit indivisible atoms. He still holds the traditional idea of substance, a self-identical, permanent substratum for acciden tal attributes; and he applies this notion not only to the soul, the thinking substance, but also to matter, extended substance. He shows, too, that mechanism is not necessarily materialism, because at the same time he is ultraspiritualist; and, for that matter, his doctrine is not monistic but dualistic. Finally Descartes does not reject final ism and is by no means atheistic, as the extreme mechanists are. Consequently, Descartes may be considered as the forerunner of the extreme eighteenth- and nineteenth-century mechanism; but be cause of the many divergent, and sometimes inconsistent, elements in his doctrine, we believe him to be also the forerunner of the more recent machine theories and even of Driesch's dualism. Kindred mechanical conceptions of life are found in the theories of many of the biologists and physicians of Descartes' time and im mediately afterward, influenced as they are, at least partly, by him. Although Hobbes (1588-1679), with his explanation of mental impressions along mechanistic lines, may be said to have some importance for psychology, his concern in biology proper is small. Of much more importance are Gassendi, Borelli, Boerhave, and Hoffmann. All of them follow general ideas similar to those of Descartes, although, like Gassendi, they may attack several of the former's views. All of them, for one reason or other and mostly on religious or traditional grounds, admit the existence of a spiritual, immortal soul in man; to account for bodies they all adhere to the same me chanical principle, matter and local motion; none of them is an atomist in the proper sense, except Gassendi. P. Gassendi (1592-1655) goes much farther than Descartes in his meristic conception of bodies, which he conceives in the atomistic sense of Epicurus. Whereas Descartes still held to the idea of a bodily substance, Gassendi rejects it, thus anticipating, at least as far as matter is concerned, Locke's anti-substantialism. J. A. Borelli (1608-1679) analyzes and describes in his De Motu Animalium, as the title suggests, all kinds of animal movement, walking, jumping, etc., and concludes that the muscles function me</page><page sequence="9">PHILOSOPHICAL LIFE THEORIES 121 chanically under influence of nerve currents, which he conceives much in the same way as Descartes does the animal spirits; the differ ence lies mainly in the fact that Borelli's procedure is more experi mental. His renowned book exercised great influence, for example, on the most celebrated physician of the time, H. Boerhave (1668 1738), who in his Instituñones Medicae propounds a purely me chanical explanation of the different organical operations, for ex ample, the digestive functions. In his conception of the relation be tween soul and body in man, Boerhave closely follows Descartes. F. Hoffmann (1660-1742) adds a more chemical conception of life, following of course the ideas of chemistry of his time: the organism is to be taken as a chemical compound and its functions are of a chemical nature, but these chemical changes ultimately must be explained according to mechanical laws. In the nerves of the body-machine circulate the spirit us animales, "a kind of fluid com posed of chemical constituents." Here, as in the terminology of Descartes, the word "spiritus" is not taken in the strict sense, but signifies a more subtle form of matter. 2. Thoroughly mechanistic, extremely atomistic, and at the same time purely materialistic, are, in the eighteenth century, most of the philosophers of the period of enlightenment, especially those who are known as the French empiricists. The foremost example is J. de la Mettrie (1709-1755), who in his notorious pamphlet L'Homme Machine drew the final consequences from Descartes' premises; and in his Système d'Epicure re-established Gassendi's atomism. Like Locke he abandoned completely the traditional notion of substance still prevailing at the time, both for spiritual and corporal entities; and in L'Histoire naturelle de L'âme, he denied the existence of the human soul, which despite everything was admitted by the mecha nists of the preceding period. A work entitled Système de la nature, commonly attributed to d'Holbach (1723-1789), expresses the same ideas, only in a less flippant and apparently more scientific way. Condillac (1715-1780), who for the rest is more interested in psy chology than in biology, taught, it is true, an extreme atomistic sensism, but differently from most of the other enlightenment phi losophers; he maintained the existence and immortality of the human soul.</page><page sequence="10">122 FRANCISCAN STUDIES 3. It would be false to believe that from Descartes' time on all biologists, physiologists, and physicians were mechanists. On the contrary, as we shall see presently, by far the greater number of them in the latter part of the eighteenth and the beginning of the nineteenth century were vitalists: they maintained, in their own way, the difference between organic and inorganic bodies. This vitalism provoked, of course, a reaction; the reactionaries limit themselves for the most part to an attack on the vitalistic theories, especially of the Bichat-Cuvier school, but reject also the, extreme materialistic views of La Mettrie. In that period, moreover, biology took a defi nitely chemical turn: chemistry, and therefore organic chemistry too, relinquished the more or less phantastic speculations of Para celsus, whose influence is still noticeable in Hoffmann, and through the work of Scheele, Lavoisier, Fourcroy, Priestly, etc., became sol idly based on experiments. Most of the research workers did not busy themselves very much with theoretical implications; but, in as far as they did, the main issue for discussion was the question whether the life processes were to be explained exclusively by physi co-chemical forces or whether some other specific, vital forces were to be assumed. It is the general attitude of the opponents of vitalism that it is unscientific to look for mysterious so-called vital forces which would operate independently from the common forces of matter, and if there still remains in the organic processes an unexplained remainder, it should simply be labeled as "unknown." The mechanistic view of life of some of these authors sometimes creates the impression of a scientific fiction rather than of a real life theory. Thus J. C. Reil (1759-1813) finds the essentials of the living organism in some particular form of matter, and in the composition in which the chemical constituents are arranged. A typical specimen of the spirit of the time is J. J. Berzelius (1779-1848) who rejects his contemporaries' vitalism as unscientific, but still retains some hope and a practical innate feeling regarding "the immortality of the soul."4 F. Magendie (1785-1855), too, strongly opposes Bichat's vital ism, and maintains that the life phenomena should be considered as 4. Cf. E. Nordenskiôld, The History of Biology, p. 373.</page><page sequence="11">PHILOSOPHICAL LIFE THEORIES 123 ruled by physical and chemical laws, but admits that quite a few organic processes and especially those of the nervous system are in fact exempt from these laws and must, therefore, at least for the time being be regarded as inexplicable. C. Bernard (1794-1867), less sceptical than Magendie concerning theories, tried to elaborate a more positive life theory. He refuses to be either materialist or vitalist. As for the latter, on the one hand he rejects the vitalists' view that the general laws of inorganic matter are not valid for organic life, and on the other hand he admits a difference between organic and inorganic processes. In order to cover this contradiction he seeks refuge in a theory of his own, which he calls determinism: the general physico-chemical laws, operating in the organism, are determined to a specific kind of functioning. If this hypothesis has any meaning, it means at least a very serious mitigation of mecha nism and reminds one of the determining function of the Aristotelian forma substantialts. 4. Whereas the preceding period is characterized by a rather scientific attitude, limiting itself to experimental research work and avoiding as much as possible theoretical speculations, the succeeding period is very emphatic in proposing a life theory, to such an extent that the latter, a very extreme mechanistic and materialistic doctrine, is elevated to the rank of a dogma. The writings of this time, al though full of empirical data, experiments, and research work, are usually also stuffed with hypothetical assumptions to such a degree that it is difficult to find out what the author considers as fact and what as theory, or even if he makes the distinction at all. This is often called the Darwin-Haeckel period, or that of modern material ism, or the evolutionistic period. Its adherents conceive of the soul in material terms. Whereas the older materialists, like La Mettrie, would say that nothing is living, some of them in this period, like Haeckel, maintain that everything is alive, thus advancing a kind of materialistic hylozoism: the difference is nil, since both identify matter and spirit. The mechanistic character of the movement is perhaps best typi fied by the famous work Kraft und Stoff, written by F. Biichner (1824-1899), whose very title expresses the old theme of external matter and eternal energy, the latter conceived as mechanical force. The materialistic trend is vigorously expressed by J. Moleschott</page><page sequence="12">124 FRANCISCAN STUDIES (1822-1893) in his Kreislauf des Lebens, and still more by K. Vogt (1817-1895) in his notorious sentence that the brain secretes thought the same way as the liver secretes bile and the kidneys urine. The research work of many of the biologists of this period is for the most part concerned with evolution and consequently with the problem of the origin of life.5 Despite many divergences in detail, the essentials of the doctrine are that life necessarily, although by pure chance, has developed and must develop out of lifeless matter. This theory proceeds definitely along anti-finalistic lines: in the evolution of the world and of life there is no room for what is called in German Zielstrebigkeit, striv ing after a goal; but if "causes" there are, they can be only of an efficient-quantitative order. This view has been commonly called the analytical-causal explanation of the universe and in particular of the organic world. Analytical, because based on the method which analyzes the organism and its activity into its last elements, and so claims to find nothing but atoms and electrons and partial func tions. The term "causal" refers to efficient causality only: this, how ever, has not the meaning of real influence of cause on its effect, as grasped by the intellect, but only that of concomitance which, as far as our experience goes, is constantly observed between an antecedent and a consequent; only such a "causality" is acceptable, because it can be measured and consequently expressed in quantitative and mathematical formulas. Whereas Descartes and others mostly theorized, the scientists and biologists of the Haeckel period believed they were able to prove their views on the strength of facts and experiments. They had, indeed, made important progress in the use of the analytical and quantitative-mathematical method in the investigation of isolated vital processes, and thus it was psychologically somewhat under standable that they came to the opinion that the analytical-causal explanation of life to its full extent was only a question of time. 5.

And many others.</page><page sequence="13">PHILOSOPHICAL LIFE THEORIES 125 The average man believes, at first glance and in reliance upon common experience, that the world and things in the world obey order and finality, that everything both in the inorganic and organic world seems to be well adapted to itself and other things according to preëstablished laws. Moreover things seem to belong to different species: out of the combination of hydrogen and oxygen something new seems to originate which is not just the sum of the two, and a plant seems to be qualitatively different from an animal or mineral. This view, however, according to the materialistic mechanists is noth ing but appearance born out of a pre-scientific, anthropomorphic at titude. If one shakes off this attitude, then that which seems to be new turns out to be merely the recombination of already existing matter, and so-called finality proves to be blind chance. As soon as one admits that things possess their own well-determined nature, i. e., that they are principles of internal activity, one necessarily faces the problem of finality, because one has to explain the scope of that intrinsic activity. But the mechanist rejects the nature of a thing and therefore all idea of telos. His theory is that in the beginning there was extension, bits of pure quantity, which did not possess any qual ity, did not bear any force or activity; and besides, there was the eter nal motion which from without drove the bits of eternal extended matter. By means of local motion applied to passive matter, the apparently new but really only summative combinations of atoms, molecules, crystals, plants, animals, and men have originated. Hence, there is no difference between inorganic and organic matter: both are only an aggregate of atoms and sub-atoms put and held together by mechanical motion. The mechanistic view of this period was ob viously atheistic, atomistic, monistic, materialistic, ateleological. The evolutionists saw that one of their main problems was to give an "explanation" of the origin of life, i. e., how the stable units of the first primitive organisms, like organic germs, originated. The answer is very simple: through sheer chance, or rather a long series of chances. Out of these primitive forms the present organisms are supposed to have developed in virtue of the evolution-principle which, again, works through chance. At first sight such a chance theory would seem to be too unscientific, but the evolutionists shrouded it in a veil, which covered its crude reality and made it more acceptable. They, too, use the words "finality," "adaptation";</page><page sequence="14">126 FRANCISCAN STUDIES they would say that a certain combination of matter is adapted to its purpose, but they conceive adaptation in quantitative terms, as some thing that is divisible. If one divides a combination of matter, e. g., an organism or its part, an eye, into ever smaller parts, then the adherent purposefulness also becomes ever smaller, till finally the very smallest bit of matter possesses only a limit of finality, a final ity of the order zero. At that point, therefore, the boundary between adaptation and non-adaptation, finality and non-finality fades away. But then it does not seem so improbable that a finality of the order zero would originate by mere chance. Thus the very first germ of an organism came into existence. It is to be noted here that the ad herents of the extreme chance-theories usually require only one germ (monophylesis), well aware of the fact, that one has to be thrifty with casual abiogenesis of apparent finality. After the primitive germs have originated, the only thing one has to do, in order to explain the highest degree of finality of a com plicated organism, for example, is to add the limits of adaptability. Still, in this summation process lies a difficulty: one can add only homogeneous magnitudes; in this case, therefore, things that are all purposeful. But chance is blind and does not see similarity: so why does it put together only "purposeful" things, i. e., bits of matter that possess the above limit of finality and not things that again would destroy the "finality"? As an answer they offer the principle of selection, proposed by Darwin and developed by his followers. Selection is blind, it is true, but in the struggle for life the best adapted, the suitable, is necessarily saved. Suppose that at the be ginning of the series of organisms there is a very simply organized, perhaps even an unorganized germ; it divides itself many times into smaller pieces, which of their own accord, i.e., by chance, show little differences. Now "nature" takes care that only that which is most adapted survives. And thus, through summation of small dif ferences, variations may slowly increase.6 However plausible such kinds of "casual" explanations might sound to some ears, not even all the mechanists of the period were quite so satisfied with them, as is clear in the case of E. Dubois-Reymond (1818-1896), who does 6. Cf. T. van der Bom, Phil, van het Leven (Nijmegen, 1932), pp. 42, 56, 64; K. Peter, Die Zweckmàszigkeit in der Entwicklungsgeschichle (1920).</page><page sequence="15">PHILOSOPHICAL LIFE THEORIES 127 not see how the two problems of the origin of life and of the order in nature can be explained by the mechanistic conception, but who, on the other hand does not see either any other explanation and, therefore, puts these problems among the seven world-riddles which he considers as insoluble.7 Hence he proceeds far less dogmatically than Haeckel and expresses, much to the displeasure of the latter, his agnosticism in the famous phrase "Ignoramus et ignorabimus" : not only do we not know but we will never know the essence of life. 5. The generation succeeding the Darwin-Haeckel period and making up the modern period is for the greater part interested only in research work. Of course, its writings usually reflect the scientific credo of the writer, mostly according to the school in which he was brought up. The mechanistic school is still very strong but its teach ings are, in many respects, proposed in a somewhat mitigated form. Most authors subscribe to the physico-chemical theories of life, which smooth the stiff form of mechanism in as far as they admit, besides mechanical movement, applied from without, some physical and chemical forces, conceived as more or less inherent in matter, such as attraction, repulsion, and the like. Thus, to mention just a few names of men who devoted themselves more properly to theo retical discussion: F. le Dantec,8 W. Roux (1850-1924),9 J. B. S. Haldane (1892- ),10 J. Loeb (1859-1924),11 A. Cohen-Kysper.12 The physico-chemical theories, although somewhat of a mitiga tion, are not essentially different from extreme mechanism, for their adherents try with all their might to reduce these more or less in ternal forces to purely mechanical motion. Moreover, they empha size the fact that the physico-chemical forces found in protoplasm are in no way different from those of inorganic matter. As a counter proof to their chemical analysis, several authors tried to build or ganic structures out of inorganic constituents by means of artificial 7.

They conclude, therefore, that there is no reason to suppose vital forces or special laws. The modern mechanists, of course, have a strictly meristic view point and follow faithfully the analytical-summative method: they examine the partial functions of nutrition, growth, and generation, analyzing them in ever smaller processes: by adding these partial functions together through summation, they believe they have found the nature of a living organism: the sum or aggregate of physico chemical processes. Still there is a problem that from now on ever more haunts the thoughts of the deeper thinkers among the biologists: the problem of the unity of the organism or — as it is often called — that of form. The extreme mechanistic theory conceives of the organism as merely a mosaic of little pieces put together by mere chance, and thus destroys entirely even the appearance of unity. The evolution ists of the Haeckel period were mainly interested in the origin of the first primitive organisms and took the development of the in dividual organism as they manifest themselves now for granted; at the most they formulated some dogmatic laws like the biogenetic law of Haeckel. Yet, every unprejudiced mind wonders why the pieces hold together permanently, why the obvious unity remains so stable, how it is that an individual organism out of a seemingly formless matter acquires little by little its own specific form similar to that of its ancestors, and why the same form is reiterated indefi nitely. It was in modern times that Roux especially, reproaching his predecessors with negligence in this respect, stated the problem of what he calls the form-building forces. He tried to solve it by means of his mechanical theory of individual evolution. On the basis of his famous experiments on the frog's eggs — destroying one of the two first blastomeres and obtaining a half-embryo — he ar rived at his preformistic "mosaic" theory: the different parts of the future organism should be considered as predetermined in the fer tilized egg in such a way that this is like a mosaic of many different pieces and the process of development nothing but the development of these pieces. The answer was, of course, a perfect and typical example of micromerism, but the main part of it was the fact that the form</page><page sequence="17">PHILOSOPHICAL LIFE THEORIES 129 problem was formulated; it became the starting point not only of many ingenious experiments but also of various fertile theories. Many authors of the modern period believe that the stable unity of the organism, which is so obvious, calls for some special factor, conceived however along mechanistic lines. They re-introduce the Cartesian idea of the body-machine but give it a slightly different turn and thus propose what is called the modern machine-theory of life. In order to explain organic unity and also its difference from inorganic structures, these authors admit in the organism either (1) a kind of driving force which, however, is itself matter, or (2) a special organization of matter which produces some particular effects. Although the machine theories mitigate in various respects the ideas of "casual" mechanism, they are not essentially different from the latter and they remain meristic, mechanistic, and even materialistic. To a teleologically-minded man it would seem strange that biologists, who call themselves, and really are, mechanists, use the machine-concept; for, a machine, at least to one who thinks in teleological terms, is a thing which obviously serves a purpose, i. e., it is an instrument which man uses in the accomplishment of his scopes. The mechanists, however, conceive of a machine in analytical and summative terms: the machine is composed of many parts which one can separate, and therefore they contend that the function of the whole is nothing more and nothing else than the sum of its partial functions. Of course, it seems to us that the parts are united for a specific purpose, but this is said to be due only to the skilful arrangement which the constructor has made from without in putting the parts together: the product of the machine must be considered — they claim— with regard to its parts only as an effect, a result, not as a scope. The first kind of machine theories, namely, those according to which the difference between organic and inorganic structures con sists in a special kind of matter, may be found already in a primitive form in the writings of most of the Presocratics, as Aristotle inter prets them.13 They admit in the organisms a principle which directs the vital operations and which they call "soul," but this soul is of a material nature. According to Diogenes this principle of life is air, 13. Cf. S. Thom., Commentât, in Arisl., De Anima, Lib. I, lect. 5.</page><page sequence="18">130 FRANCISCAN STUDIES for Heraclitus it is breath, for Hippo water, for Critias blood. Demo critus and Leucippus, although atomists to the utmost, recognize nevertheless a gradual difference betwen life and matter, believing that the principle of the former consists in more subtle atoms, which are those of fire. Lucretius Carus teaches similar views: the souL is composed of some very small atoms distributed all through the body. In more recent times the same ideas and even the same word ing, describing the "soul" as a subtle corpuscle, is found — as we saw — in Hobbes and Gassendi, who directly link up with the founder of the organic machine theory, Descartes. The modern machine-conception of life is presented in the form of the biochemical or biogenic theories, which suppose certain chemi cal units as the active and directive elements of vital activity; they are believed either to be collected in one system, the organic life machine, or to be dispersed throughout the organism, in such a way that the whole of the organism ought to be considered as a machine, which in part is active and in part passive. These chemical units proper to living matter were at first postulated hypothetically and received various names. M. Verworn14 called this particular hypo thetical kind of matter of an albuminoid character "biogen" (life producing) : hence the name of the theory. The main characteristic of the biogen molecule would consist in very particular metabolic possibilities, i. e., in a constant and simultaneous alternation of dis integration and reconstruction; and in this extreme chemical ability would consist, according to Verworn, the only difference between the organic and inorganic. More or less the same function was ascribed by H. de Vries to what he called "pangenes"; Weismann speaks of "biophorids," Hert wig of "idioblasts," Wilson and Rabie of "organogenetic sub stances"; some tried to identify these life-producers with Haeckel's and Erlsberg's hypothetical "plastidules," or Darwin's "gemmules," Naegeli's "micellae," Wiesner's "plasomata," Dubois' "vacuolides," Haacke's "gemmae," Künstler's "sphaerulae." The weakness of these conceptions is their imaginary character; and modern bio chemistry objected especially on the ground that there exists no 14. Allgemeine Physiologie (Jena, 1909).</page><page sequence="19">PHILOSOPHICAL LIFE THEORIES 131 other albumen molecule than that which is known to general chem istry. For this reason many authors tried to put the biogenic machine theory on a more experimental basis. The little life machines were thought of as being the same as Altmann's "bioblasts" or Benda's "mitochondria"; and nowadays they are supposed to be "genes" of the chromosomes. Thus Jules Schultz, R. Goldschmidt, K. Lewin, T. H. Morgan and his school.15 The machine conception is evidently an ideal basis for the prefor mation theory. The various parts of the organism are believed to be preformed in the special life matter, whatever its name may be; and the latter's unfolding of itself is believed to be an explanation of morpho-genesis. A typical example is the theory of the determiners, propounded by H. Weismann,16 which was supposed to explain the development of the organism's form. Heredity, too, is readily explained by this biogenic matter: the gencomplex, remaining identical, is transferred from the ancestor to the descendants. The question, whence this particular life matter originates, is — if asked at all — answered in an evasive way. It is generally said to be something "given"; this special form in which matter exists in the world must be considered just as elementary and eternal as matter itself; "eternal," however, should not be taken in the philosophical sense. It means only that we suppose the exist ence of matter and of living matter as well, as far as we can go back in time. It is clear that the modern machine theories of life, mechanistic as they remain and want to be, recede quite strongly from mechanism proper, because, in their own way, they try to give an account of the unity of the organism, which no longer is considered as a fortuitous sum of various parts. Still, the summation idea prevails and a suffi cient principle of unity is wanting. Others do not see the idiosyncracy of life in a particular kind of matter but in a particular collocation or organization of matter, by means of which specific forces develop which, at least apparently, differ from the physio-chemical ones. This view is mixed by some authors with the foregoing conception. 15. T. H. Morgan, The Mechanism of Mendelian Heredity (New York, 1915). 16. Das Keimplasma (Jena, 1881).</page><page sequence="20">132 FRANCISCAN STUDIES Already the Pythagoreans seem to have had similar views, namely that the soul is a harmony of the various parts of the body — at least according to the interpretation of Plato,17 against the opinion of Aristotle.18 The same idea occurs in the teaching of Empedocles, who did not — as the other Presocratics — consider the soul as an entity apart from the body, but explained its activities merely by the particular constitution of the body. In the eighteenth century, as pointed out, Reil taught similar ideas. In the past century the idea recurs in what is called the "organicism" of Tongiorgi (the word "organicism" has very different meanings in biology). This author holds that living matter without doubt possesses specific forces, but he considers these organic forces as the "resultants" of the common physico-chemical forces, proceeding from the particular organization of matter in the protoplasm. In recent times the so-called emergence theories of life go still farther. They recognize the fact that vital activity is of a unique na ture which, as such, cannot be simply reduced to the physical and chemical forces as they prevail in inanimate matter. The advocates of the theory point out that animate matter follows obviously its own specific laws. Up to now, they say, two solutions of the problem have been offered. The biologists either reduced these organic laws merely to physico-chemical ones (but then they destroyed their own science and degraded biology to a kind of applied physics and chem istry), or else they thought it imperative to admit supermaterial forces (but such things are unknown to science). Since neither solu tion is acceptable to these authors, they claim, nothing remains but to admit that the vital phenomena follow laws which are indeed specific, but which fall under the general laws of matter. In other words we must recognize two sets of experimental laws, those of living matter and those of non-living matter. Both, however, are laws of matter and, consequently, must be derivable from the very general laws of motion. This is the idea that is in the mind of many biologists, although not always expressed with equal clarity. C. Lloyd Morgan19 proposes a theory of emergent evolution which claims that life originated from a particular collocation of 17. Phaedo, 85 E. 18. De An., I, 2, 404», 26. 19. Life, Mind and Spirit (London, 1926).</page><page sequence="21">PHILOSOPHICAL LIFE THEORIES 133 chemical molecules, fortuitously put together. Concerning the col location or organization of material units, Morgan distinguishes be tween the "resultants" and the "emergents" of matter. The resultant forces we may know as soon as we know the components, but be sides these, particular forces also emerge which we cannot foresee even if we know all the components. Now, the latter happens espe cially in the case of living matter, but it also occurs in that of in organic matter, and therefore the difference between the two is only gradual. Rhumbler20 maintains that the life processes must be explained as far as possible in a mechanistic way, out of the properties of liquid and half-liquid heterophasic systems; but he also recognizes their particular character, because the organisms strive toward a state of equilibrium by means of which they reach their own com plex form (fórmale Gleichgewichtszustânde). The above-mentioned tendency is clearly shown in the collective publication of a number of Russian biologists, among whom is Bauer.2,1 Biology, they claim, is a science of its own, because it is concerned with laws specifically valid for the organisms, the specific character of biological laws being evident to observation. Besides, biology is shown to be of a historical character, i. e., in their evolu tion the organisms follow obviously some progressive laws: the au thors call this historical lawfulness (geschichtliche G es etzmaszigk eit ) the "irrational remainder." A priori, however, they deny that these laws have any teleological character; they want to explain them only through efficient causes, and they maintain that they are still laws of matter. The ultimate scope of science, therefore, must be to find the final mechanical laws, from which both the physical and biological laws may be derived. Although these authors call themselves mechanists, and are such in fact, since they exclude all kinds of finality and follow the purely analytical-causal method, trying to reduce reality to a sum of parts and partial processes, nevertheless theirs is not a consequent mechanism. The acknowledgment of the specific character of the organic laws would naturally lead to the recognition of the properly vital 20. Cf. H. Driesch, Dos Lebensproblem (Leipzig, 1931), pp. 17 et seq. 21. Problème der theoretischen Biologie (Moskau-Leningrad, 1935).</page><page sequence="22">134 FRANCISCAN STUDIES forces, progressive lawfulness would again naturally imply finality; moreover, they admit the natural unity of the organism, but then a little more reflection would necessarily bring about the recognition of an essential principle of unity and finality. If these authors refuse to take this further step, it is only because of their aprioristic dogma that there is and cannot be anything else but matter and laws of matter.22 The above survey of some representatives of mechanistic thought makes it clear that there are quite a few shades of opinion, and it shows also how the more modern representatives have to struggle in order to press obvious facts into the swaddling bands of a pre conceived system. B. VITALISTIC MERISM The theories which we classify under this caption are a reaction against mechanism. They oppose, however, only one point of the mechanistic doctrine, namely, the identification of the animate with the inanimate. For that purpose they admit in organisms, besides physico-chemical, some special forces or energies which they denote by the term of vital forces, living energy, biotic force, etc.; and hence they are often called the theories of vital energies. They con ceive these special forces or functionings more or less autonomically, i. e., as directing the physico-chemical energies, as acting upon them and sometimes even as acting against them, and therefore as work ing independently of the law of energy. Thus these forces would show a somewhat capricious character. Moreover, some of the ad herents of this view advance the idea that the matter of which the organisms are built up is different from inanimate matter. On the other hand, the defenders of these theories do not shake off the atomistic yoke of mechanism: in varying degrees they all stick to the meristic viewpoint, in as far as they conceive of the organism in a summative way and follow the analytical method. Consequently there exists a deep-rooted difference between this kind of vitalism, and that of Aristotle, for instance. Of this vitalism, which we like to call meristic vitalism for the above reason, we may 22. Cf. M. Bruna, Biologie en Wijsbegeerte (Maastricht, 1937), pp. 33 et seq.</page><page sequence="23">PHILOSOPHICAL LIFE THEORIES 135 distinguish two types in the course of history: that which is usually called the older vitalism and neovitalism. 1. The Older V/talists. Of several authors who usually are cata logued as belonging to the vitalistic school it is hard to say how — if at all — they differ from mechanism: their vitalism seems some times more verbal than real. Such an author is W. Harvey (1578 1657), the founder of the physiology of the heart and blood-circula tion,23 whose "spiritus vitales" circulating in the blood do not seem to differ greatly from Descartes' animal spirits. We do not under stand how some can call him a "faithful Aristotelian." A peculiar mixture of merism and vitalism is found in the teach ings of C. Perrault (1613-1688): on the one hand he subscribes to Gassendi's atomism, on the other he maintains that animals are not mere machines but possess a soul, and a conscious one at that, which is supposed to be localized in the medulla oblongata. The exponents of the theories of vital energies in the strict sense endeavor to show facts which would demonstrate the difference be tween the organic and inorganic world. The characteristic of life, according to them, is that it manifests itself in certain qualities or forces, which are unknown to inorganic matter, such as irritability, sensibility, contractibility, sympathy, i. e., coordination and coopera tion of the vital functions of different organs. The last feature is especially interesting. This is the very fact which compels the holists to consider the organisms as a real unity and not just an aggregate, as we shall see; and it would, indeed, be the first and right con clusion to be drawn. The older vitalists, however, skip this first conclusion and jump directly to the inference that the animate is different from the inanimate. But by omitting the intermediate step, they fail to establish a sound basis for their own conclusion. The first to introduce the distinction between the organic and the inorganic in the way that is stated above is A. Haller (1707 1777), for whom irritability and sensibility are the typical features of life.24 The medical school of Montpellier, among whose followers are to be noted J. Barthez (1734-1806) and M. F. X. Bichat (1771 23. Exercitatio de motu cordis et sanguinis in animalibus (1528). 24. Primae lineae physiologiae (1747); On Sensible and Irritable Parts of the Body (1753).</page><page sequence="24">136 FRANCISCAN STUDIES 1802), proposes the same qualities as characteristic of life, adding to them the unifying process of sympathy, but fails equally to discuss the real nature of life, which it considers unknown. At most these authors look upon the vital phenomena as manifestations of some general kind of life force, not to be reduced to mechanical, physical, or chemical forces. The Montpellier school is often said to have adopted the views of Stahl, to be dealt with later. This is true only in part. Like Stahl the adherents of this school are strongly vital istic, as they maintain that the vital functions cannot be accounted for by physical laws. But unlike Stahl, whom we consider a holist, they fail to give a reason for these functions, since they reject Stahl's soul theory. To many so-called vitalists the vital forces are really not much different from inorganic forces; for example, L. C. Treviranus (1779 1864) conceives of them in a quantitative way, and J. Liebig (1803 1873) believes them to be measurable. Another group of medical men and biologists try to create a kind of unity among the vital forces, somewhat along the same lines as Harvey with his "facultas opifex," or like J. B. van Helmont (1577-1644) who in his strange obscure way demands some sort of a unifying principle in the living body, which he calls the archaeus, and which in man exists besides the immortal soul and directs and controls the vital functions by means of minor archaei, a kind of vital spirits. We cite Wolff, Blumenbach, and Wagner. The main purpose of C. F. Wolff (1733-1794) is to combat mechanism.25 The directing and unifying cause of the life phenomena is some inner force which he calls vis essentialis. This, however, is not an immanent principle like the Aristotelian soul, but a kind of force more or less on the same level as the mechanical forces, operating with them and partly checking them. J. F. Blumenbach (1752-1840) points out26 that Haller's and Bichat's irritability, sensibility, etc., are in themselves not forces but phenomena, i. e., effects of forces. The effects are known to us, not so the vital forces themselves. These forces act on the body-machine and are the instruments by means of which the vital factor operates. As for the latter, he rejects Wolff's term of vis essentialis and calls 25. Theoria generations (1774). 26. Ober den Bildungstrich (1791).</page><page sequence="25">PHILOSOPHICAL LIFE THEORIES 137 it nisus formativus (Bildungstrieb), i.e., the driving power which regulates and controls the form of the individual growth. The dif ference from Wolff does not seem to be only a difference of name, but also of function; the function Blumenbach ascribes to the nisus formativus is of a much more unifying character. According to some authors it is to be taken in the same sense as the vis formativa of the scholastics. Blumenbach's successor at Gôttingen, R. Wagner (1805-1864), again introduces the term "soul" but, due to the materialistic tend ency of the time, conceives of it in a more or less material way.27 And so vitalism again approaches mechanistic materialism very closely. A similar trend of mind we find in L. C. Virchow (1821 1902) who generally is presented as a materialist, but who does not seem to be a very determined one. Being a disciple of J. Midler, he holds that the organism disposes of special life energies, but being a child of his time he views them in mechanical terms. 2. Neovitalism. In the latter half of the past century a vitalistic current originated which was not just a resuscitation of the older doctrines of vital energies, but in some respects different from them, and therefore it was called, e. g., by Rindfleisch, Neovitalism. Its defenders did not only theorize but endeavored to prove their vital ism by facts and experiments; they tried to bring the vital forces into accord with the law of conservation of energy; furthermore, many of them paid more attention to those vital phenomena which are called psychic or conscious acts. Among the first to be noted is J. Reinke who in his speeches and works28 showed himself a strenuous and almost passionate oppo nent of materialistic mechanism. He starts off with the analysis of the conception of a machine, with which the mechanists compared a living body. In any machine we should distinguish, he observes, two kinds of forces: primary forces (Krafte erster Hand), i.e., the mechanical, physical, and chemical energies, and the secondary forces (zweiter Hand). The latter are brought into the dead matter by the human spirit, and Reinke calls them "dominant forces." They 27. Menschlïcbes Gehirn ais Seelenorgan (Gôttingen, 1862). 28. Phil, der Botanik (1905); Einleitung in die theoretische Biologie (1911); Die Welt als Tat (1915); Die schaffende Natur (1919); Grundlagen einer Bio dynamik (1922).</page><page sequence="26">138 FRANCISCAN STUDIES dominate and direct the primary forces, but in such a way that no physico-chemical law is violated: these laws are only bent down according to the rational will of the inventor or constructor. The secondary forces, however, do not originate out of the energetic forces and cannot be reduced to them; consequently, the law of energy does not hold for them. Then Reinke applies this doctrine of "dominant forces" to the organism. The living body, too, is to be considered as a machine, but there is one important difference. Whereas in the case of non-living machines man introduces his dominant forces into dead matter, the "life dominants" are not brought into the life machine from the out side, but are rooted in the living matter itself, are immanent.29 We find somewhat similar ideas expressed by D. E. Cope (1840 1897), Montgomery, and O. Lodge. In Neovitalism, it is clear, there is the machine theory plus addi tional life forces. The conception of the organism is, therefore, ob viously meristic; a living body remains a summative unity. The ad herents of this theory do not even attempt to raise the question whence these special vital forces derive; the idea of the nature of a thing, as the one principle of the thing's activity, is alien to them. The doctrine of dominant vital forces, if mixed with psychic elements, is called psycho-vitalism or psychobiologism. Its adherents claim that special vital forces exist in all kinds of organisms, not only in man but also in plants and animals, as psychic or conscious factors: to every living being, to every living cell or organ, they attribute the faculty of perceiving needs, of judging about the means able to satisfy these wants, and of acting accordingly. This theory seems strange at first view, but is understandable as the result of a false conception of teleology. The psycho-vitalists are right in hold ing that the vital processes obviously show finality, and in this way they differ greatly from the mechanists; they hold that the special life forces are directive and thus striving toward a scope. But their idea of finality is wrong or rather unilateral: they forget the dis tinction between "striving toward a goal" and "striving consciously toward a goal," and identify the latter with the former. In other 29. Cf. T. van der Bom, Phil, van het leven, pp. 99-101.</page><page sequence="27">PHILOSOPHICAL LIFE THEORIES 139 words, they think of general finality always in terms of special final ity. If, therefore, on the basis of facts, we must explain vital proc esses as final, we must — so they conclude — ascribe them to the working of conscious factors. Hence the psychovitalists believe that all organisms possess the faculty of perception, feeling, judgment, and striving. Such con scious striving is supposed to be the cause of individual development of an organism and also the cause of evolution of the species. Among the defenders of this theory we mention: A. Pauly (1850 1904),30 R. H. Francé,31 G. Bunge,32 R. Neumeister,33 P. Jean, A. Wagner, Schneider, etc. The psychovitalistic theories show the same defects as Reinke's doctrine, and these in a greater degree, because the summative char acter of the former's vital forces is still more emphasized: several of the authors quoted above, especially Pauly and Francé, so to say, cut the vital forces into pieces, with which they furnish each organ, each tissue, each cell. Psychovitalism, therefore, is obviously a form of panpsychism or hylozoism, according to which all matter is animate, a doctrine we find clearly expressed in a materialistic sense by Haeckel, who holds that every atom is animate in as far as it disposes of a certain amount of energy. Haeckel went even farther and — giving a particular meaning to an old term — called heredity the memory of the plastidule. Thus he foreshadows another type of vitalistic theories, which are called mnemonistic, developed especially by Rignano. E. Rignano34 admits besides the physio-chemical energies, a spe cial nerve energy, proper to life. The purely meristic character of the theory is clear from the fact that the vital energy, according to Rignano, just as the physical and chemical, is divided into particles 30. A. Pauly, Darwinismus and Lamarckismus (1905). 31. R. H. Francé, Sinnesleben der Pflanzen (1905); Liebesleben der Pflanzen (1906); Die Pflanze als Erfinder (1920); Bios, Die Gesetze der Welt (1926). 32.

The only difference is that these par ticles, the nervions, are as far as their charge is concerned not equal to each other, but each particle disposes of a characteristic charge. Thus a particular nerve current, i. e., a nervion in motion, is always specifically different from any other nerve current. Rignano's theory is mnemonistic, because it links up with the mneme theory of Hering and Semon, in regard to the proper feature of life phenomena. Every organism is what is called an historical being, namely, one that begins and ceases at a given moment. As an individual it is something that exists only once, and as such can not be repeated. In the first place it is connected by many bonds with previous generations and in its development faithfully reproduces all the po tencies which these former generations had accumulated in the course of time, and thus it is to a great extent the product of in ternal and external factors which existed previously; secondly, dur ing its individual life it is susceptible to many nerve impressions which again become registered and stored up in the organism and which are added to those that it inherited, and thus every individual of each new generation becomes a being that occurs only once; thirdly, the whole is transmitted farther to the coming generations, which in turn show something "only once existing." Now, it is evi dent that no machine is able to make use of the data of previous experience, and several authors, therefore, see in this feature, namely, of receiving and conserving impressions, the characteristic which differentiates life from a machine. But we find a similar capacity in the highest living being, above all in man: a capacity of the psychic sphere, i. e., memory. The faculty of memory faithfully copies that which once was received, and any act, once performed, can be repeated with greater ease in the future, because of memory. Consequently, these authors "explain" everything that is given to the organism in the course of history by means of the function of memory, using for it the Greek word mneme. The specific property of protoplasm according to these authors is memory. We should remember here, that to many scientists explaining means nothing else but reducing many processes to some fundamental phenomenon which in itself need not be known.</page><page sequence="29">PHILOSOPHICAL LIFE THEORIES 141 This is the theory of E. Hering,35 further elaborated by R. Simon (1859-1919).36 The power of irritability (Reizbarkeit) of the older vitalists has now become the primary and distinguishing force of living substances, i. e., the power to receive stimulation, to keep its impressions, and to react to it. These authors, however, do not com mit the mistake made by Francé, namely, that of accepting the mneme as a psychic, conscious factor. They adopt the viewpoint of pyschophysical parallelism, according to which any psychic phe nomenon is accompanied by a physiological change, and they con sider the physiological aspect only. When an organic substance is hit by a stimulus, something re mains after the stimulation ceases, and this something is called engram. The proper character of physiological engrams is that they are awakened out of their latent state by a stimulus, more or less similar to the original one. Thus, by means of the power to preserve external stimuli, these authors explain many vital phenomena, for example, the fact that organs and tissues become stronger through repeated functioning, the phenomenon of evolution, regenera tion, etc. Returning now to Rignano, we find that this author has tried to explain the nature of the mneme in his theory of vital nerve cur rent. To each momentary status of the organism — thus he believes — a particular nerve current corresponds, different from any other. Every current becomes fixed in the organism, i. e., transformed into latent, potential nervous energy. Later, in similar circumstances, the potential energy will again be changed into actual energy and thus render the execution of a performance, which was executed on a previous occasion, easier. Thus, too, the specificity of the vital nerve energy guarantees that the offspring copies faithfully all that the ancestors once in the same stage have registered in the form of energy. Consequently the ontogenetic evolution is nothing but a discharge of the organic accumulators at the right moment.37 Stripped of its peculiar terminology, the theory does not seem to offer much of an explanation.
