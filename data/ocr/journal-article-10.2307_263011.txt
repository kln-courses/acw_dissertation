Crosby proposes the reading v K' {v twa' for the Vulgate " KIE us in order to obtain a satisfactory contrast between 885 f. and 887. The contrast between dead and alive he rejects as impossible in the case of a god; but the contrast which he does recognize-among the dead and among the living-can hardly be looked upon as more acceptable. The clue to the correct understanding of these lines is in the word dluevvvo's. This word is not found elsewhere in the Iliad; and in the Odyssey it is always used in the phrase (vEKv'w) dpuvEvna Kap?)va, except in Od. xix. 562, where it appears as an epithet of dreams. It naturally has the connotation of death, and the combination gus alpEv-qvo's, "a live ghost," is an effective oxymoron. The contrast in the lines is between dead and alive, but the idea of death is in the second member, not in the first. Of course, Ares cannot die, but he can do the next thing to it; and the lines have the familiar humorous turn which Homer always enjoys when his divinities become unmanageably anthropomorphic. "Either I should have had a long, hard fight, or I should have been-alive, to be sure,-but still as good as dead, from the spear-strokes." Whether this interpretation is sound or not, Mr. Crosby's note will at any rate make it necessary for the com- mentators and translators to reconsider this passage. It may be that the proposed interpretation will persuade some critics that the three lines (or 887 alone) are not spurious after all, in spite of the objectionable g0s. IVAN M.
