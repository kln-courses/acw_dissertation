<plain_text><page sequence="1">Issues, Voter Choice, and Critical Elections W. LANCE BENNETT University of Washington WILLIAM HALTOM University of Washington The study of critical elections in American politics has been marked by a steady growth of knowledge and a remarkable consensus among practitioners in the field. Although minor quibbles have appeared from time to time, the work within each generation has set the agenda for the work of the next. The pioneering efforts of Key (1955, 1959), Schattschneider (1960), and MacRae and Meldrum (1960) produced clear descriptions of the phenomenon of critical elections, as well as operational definitions of the concepts. This group of studies paved the way for the systematic analysis and classification of elections in the work of Campbell et al. (1960), Sellers (1965), Pomper (1967), and Burnham (1968). The election patterns discovered in these studies, however, required explanation. The next wave of interest in critical elections, ushered in by the theoretical works of Burnham (1970) and Sundquist (1973), identified the essential variables governing electoral dynamics, but still did not explain precisely how these variables worked. That explanation is the next obvious step in the theory of critical elections, and it is the subject of this discussion. The basic definition of a critical election has remained more or less unchanged since Key's (1955: 4) original isolation of "a Authors' Note: The authors would like to acknowledge the financial support of the Graduate School Research Fund of the University of Washington. SOCIAL SCIENCE HISTORY, Vol. 4, No. 4 November 1980 379-418 @ 1980 Social Science History Assn. 379</page><page sequence="2">380 SOCIAL SCIENCE HISTORY category of elections in which voters are, at least from impres- sionistic evidence, unusually deeply concerned, in which the extent of electoral involvement is relatively quite high, and in which the decisive results of the voting reveal a sharp alteration of the preexisting cleavage within the electorate." In order to account for these significant departures from the electoral norm, Burnham (1970) proposed a "strain" theory which linked periodic realignments in the electorate with the management of social tensions. According to this theory, the preoccupations of political parties with electoral success and coalition maintenance can result in an insensitivity to social change and its concomitant tensions. As parties lag farther behind a changing society, threatened and injured groups become more concerned with the failure of party governments to keep pace with social demands. These concerns can escalate to a "flash point" at which a triggering event can produce a critical election. In such an election, the electorate becomes ideologically polarized by an issue or cluster of issues. Involvement and attention are intense. Groups reorganize around revamped party ideologies to form an outline of future policies that is more in keeping with the changes in society. In short, critical elections provide an outlet for strain and an occasion for parties to catch up with social changes. Issues occupy a central place in Burnham's explanatory scheme. He describes critical elections (1970: 10) as "issue- oriented phenomena, centrally associated with [social] tensions and more or less leading to resolution adjustments." However, he does not explain how issues in these elections differ from issues in other elections, how they enter a campaign, what it is that makes them compelling grounds for new and often unheard-of voter choices, and what determines the varying impact of such issues across elections. Sundquist (1973) made some inroads in these areas with his suggestion that realignments are precipitated by "new" issues that polarize the electorate across preexisting parti- san cleavages. Only such new and intense issues can overcome the tendency of the American system toward issueless elections and voting based on party identification. The resulting polarization of</page><page sequence="3">CRITICAL ELECTIONS 381 the electorate forces parties into making strategic commitments to the issues. With the introduction of this idea of party stance on an issue, Sundquist all but ended his development of issues as independent variables. Instead of explaining how the characteristics of issues affect election dynamics, he concentrated on the ways in which power relationships within parties can affect the development of issues. As a result, issues are treated almost as dependent variables that develop according to the outcomes of struggles among the power blocs within the parties. This formulation does not strike us as incorrect as much as incomplete. For one thing, it concentrates on cases in which issues that have produced new social cleavages work their way into party philosophy and rearrange patterns of party loyalty as a result. This is one possible pattern of realignment, but it fails to account for cases in which social strains are too broad and convoluted to be summarized by single issues or a cluster of related issues. In these cases, voters may fall within multiple potential cleavages. They may look to the parties for formula- tions of their social concerns rather than for the adoption of established issues. In other words, some elections may be opportunities for the political system to accommodate clearly defined cleavages, while at other times they are forums during which parties can generate issues that crystallize particular cleavages out of the set of potential splits in the electorate. In addition to neglecting the capacity of elections to clarify and interpret social concerns, current election theory fails to consider the importance of different ways of defining the same issue. Only part of the impact of an issue can be attributed to what the issue in the abstract means to voters. Campaign issues can be symbolized in various ways and used in different contexts to affect the scope, the intensity, and the very meaning of their appeals to voters. The need to go beyond the abstract definitions of campaign issues has been recognized in the body of scholarship called the "New Political History" (Swierenga, 1971; Kleppner, 1972; Wright, 1973; McCormick, 1974; Bogue et al., 1977). This</page><page sequence="4">382 SOCIAL SCIENCE HISTORY approach has emphasized the ethnic, cultural, and religious cleavages that determine patterns of response to political issues (Benson, 1961; Holt, 1969; Luebke, 1960; Kleppner, 1970; Allswang, 1971; Formisano, 1971; Jensen, 1971; McSeveney, 1972). The focus of the new political historians has been described as follows by one observer (McCormick, 1974: 357): "Central to the ethno-cultural historians' view of American politics is the idea that partisan appeals are carefully constructed bridges between leadership goals and grass-roots aspirations. It is a party's charac- ter and image, and not its formal policy proposals, which attract voters and maintain their loyalty. There is little doubt that the New Political History has established the importance of looking beyond the abstract categories of campaign issues in order to explain patterns of voting. However, this approach has yet to generate a theoretical framework to explain how issues affect voters or how voters incorporate issues into the process of voter choice. There are three specific areas in the current historical theory of elections that must be developed in order to produce systematic explanations of voting patterns. First, the ethnocultural approach, as presently formulated, attributes patterns in the vote to very specific religious and cultural factors. These factors may operate in some elections, but they are probably only a small subset of the voter orientations that can operate across various elections and, perhaps, even within the same election (Bogue et al., 1977: 203, 205; Thompson, 1976: 265-269; Blocker, 1973: 202; Wright, 1973: 662-664). The limitations of narrow formulations of voter orientations have been underscored in a variety of research efforts showing, among other things, that religious factors are crucial at some times and less important at others (Jensen, 1971: 309-315; Holt, 1969: 74-79, 215-218); that religious and economic factors can operate togeth- er (Hammarberg, 1975); and that different areas can display different mixes of voter orientations (Luebke, 1969; Rogin and Shover, 1970; McSeveney, 1972; Wright, 1974; Kousser, 1974). In short, according to Bogue et al. (1977: 203), the tendency to list specific factors that affect specific voter blocs in specific</page><page sequence="5">CRITICAL ELECTIONS 383 elections does not appear to be a step toward a general theory: "Members of the ethnocultural persuasion sometimes appear to be replacing a monocausal and simplistic economic interpreta- tion with an equally monocausal and simplistic cultural inter- pretation." This problem can be resolved by specifying an exhaustive set of general voter orientations, plus conditions associated with their use. Such a set of ideal-type orientations should encompass the existing list of factors, predict new factors that will turn up in future case studies, and explain when particular types of orientations will come into and out of play. Second, current historical analysis has not specified what it is about issues that attracts voters. The general consensus seems to follow Kleppner's (1970: 149) adoption of the distinction between "position" issues and "style" issues proposed originally by Berelson et al., (1954: 215-234). Whereas the original distinction was intended to separate different types of issues, Kleppner argued persuasively that every issue can be broken down into a "style" and a "position" component. Following this useful modification, he argued that the substance of policy appeals is important only to a few issue-oriented or ideological voters. However, the "style" component is the factor that links ambig- uous and complex issues to the personal and cultural orientations of the average voter (Kleppner, 1970: 143-151, 371). This distinction needs to be filled out with a description of what constitutes an issue's style and how that style interacts with the various possible voter orientations. The framework presented in the next section defines three distinct dimensions of issue style (or "symbolic format," as we call it) and shows how they interact with corresponding political orientations to determine voter choice. The final contribution of this framework to the emerging theory of elections involves a solution to certain problems of ecological analysis. Most ethnocultural analysis has been tied to aggregate data, due to the nature of historical voting records. This has frustrated any serious theorizing about the dynamics of individual voting choice. It has also produced a host of problems with ecological inference (Blocker, 1975: 211-212; Kousser, 1973: 239; Lichtman, 1974: 433; also see Kleppner's response, 1972: 25).</page><page sequence="6">384 SOCIAL SCIENCE HISTORY The construction of a framework based on the interaction between individual political orientations and the symbolic for- mats of issues permits hypothesis testing via experimental and survey methods. However, it also makes it possible to aggregate historical voting data along the lines defined in the framework. In fact, the case we have chosen to illustrate the framework is the presidential election of 1896. The record of campaign debate and social conditions in 1896 suggests that the issues of the day conformed to particular symbolic formats that meshed with the dominant political orientations of some voter blocs and worked against the orienta- tions that most likely governed the choices of other groups. The proposed interactions between the symbolic formats of issues and the various types of voter orientations are given prima facie support both in historical accounts of the election and in available data on vote distributions. It must be emphasized that although these data are suggestive, they are not conclusive. The purpose of the analysis at this stage is less to prove the theory than to define the concepts and demonstrate their plausibility. In the tradition of Key (1955, 1959) and Schattschneider (1960), the analysis relies primarily on suggestive historical evidence to develop a theory that is systematic enough to be tested using more reliable data and more rigorous survey or experimental methods. POLITICAL ORIENTATIONS AND ISSUE FORMATS The first order of business in explaining patterns of voter choice is to determine what factors can motivate voters to become involved in an election and to be concerned about its candidates and issues. A review of the literature on the bases of political attention and involvement indicates that there are three distinct kinds of political orientation. Some perspectives stress the importance of personality con- flicts as bases of political arousal and action (Lasswell, 1965: 23- 104; Smith et al., 1956; Edelman, 1971; Lane, 1962; Piaget, 1965; Etheredge, 1978). The presentation and resolution of issues that</page><page sequence="7">CRITICAL ELECTIONS 385 appeal to these private orientations can produce a sense of security or reassurance that individuals cannot achieve in their private lives through their own means. Another school of thought emphasizes the sensivity of individuals to symbols of group, class, party, and social condition. People who hold such sociocultural orientations tend to look for explanations of social problems that are cast in terms of clear models or social processes and/or clear references to symbols of group of cultural identity (Campbell et al., 1960, 1966; Cobb and Elder, 1972; Gusfield, 1966; Ward, 1955; Geertz, 1964; Albanese, 1976; Kleppner, 1970; Swierenga, 1971; Wright, 1973). The third major perspective on political attention and involvement emphasizes the attraction of individ- uals to the drama, spectacle, and entertainment of politics. Individuals driven by dramaturgical orientations are inclined to inspect political issues for elements of drama, intrigue, and human interest that allow them to become drawn into the real-life drama of politics as participants (i.e., voters) who can affect its outcome (Rosenau, 1973; Nimmo, 1974; Edelman, 1964; Merel- man, 1969; Mount, 1972; Bennett, 1977a, 1977b, 1979). Although an individual may tend to rely on one of these orientations more than the others as a characteristic means of processing information and formulating political responses, it is important to understand that these political orientations are neither mutually exclusive nor unchangeable. For example, under certain circumstances dramaturgical orientations may combine with sociocultural orientations to ignite political move- ments or to inspire intense political participation (Albanese, 1976; Bennett, 1977b; Zolberg, 1974; Turkle, 1975). Under other conditions, private orientations may be transformed into socio- cultural orientations, resulting in new political demands and a sensitivity to new kinds of political information (Lasswell, 1965: 118). Survey research on voting behavior is producing increasing evidence that voters seem to make qualitatively different kinds of choices depending on their personal circumstances and the way in which information is presented in the electoral context (Tufte, 1978; RePass, 1971; Page and Brody, 1972; Converse et al., 1969; Fiorina, 1977; Nimmo, 1978: 380).</page><page sequence="8">386 SOCIAL SCIENCE HISTORY All of this points to the possibility that the three major schools of thought on political orientations represent complementary rather than competing perspectives. Voters can employ multiple political orientations that may shift in emphasis from one to another over time. In other words, it makes sense to think about voter choice as a remarkably flexible response to personal circumstances and the political forces operating in an election. As the orientations underlying voter choice shift within different groups, voters become receptive to different issue formats. As a result, voting patterns in any election and shifting vote patterns across elections reflect how well the issue formats presented by candidates and parties correspond to the existing patterns of voter orientations. PRIVATE ORIENTATIONS AND CORRESPONDING ISSUE FORMATS Private orientations operate when the personal concerns, fears, anxieties, or personality characteristics of individuals directly govern their selection and evaluation of political stimuli. Individ- uals operating under this political orientation tend to engage in primary process thinking, which is characterized by a high fantasy content, little rational mediation of basic impulses, and minimal logical constraint. Issues become personalized, and objects and institutions acquire anthropomorphic traits. Private motives become projected onto distant actors and issues. The political world becomes an immediate source of threats and reassurances. Issues that mobilize private concerns in the voting public tend to display one or both of two symbolic characteristics. First, anxious or fearful audiences are often responsive to highly abstract appeals. Under conditions of intense emotional arousal, the mind is prone to leap to wild conclusions or to project meaning onto incoherent or ambiguous actions and events. For example, an experimental study showed that subjects under conditions of high fear arousal tended to find profound meaning</page><page sequence="9">CRITICAL ELECTIONS 387 in a nonsensical and abstract parable, while subjects with low emotional arousal found the parable utterly meaningless (Mc- Conahay, 1968). In an earlier discussion of this idea, Lippman (1922: 99) observed that abstract and seemingly unrelated ideas can become meaningful simply because they acquire similar emotional associations or because they occur together in a context that the individual has filled with a single dominant emotion. Another symbolic format that may appeal to private concerns is the practice of defining issues in terms of certain familiar themes that remove issues from the realm of political means and equate them strictly with emotional ends. These themes involve the individual in an issue by literally managing the private emotions for which the issue has come to stand. For example, Edelman (1977: 4-5) has noted the role of "security" themes as a kind of master symbolism in individual appeals: "Security" is very likely the primal political symbol, for threats engage people intensely in the news of public affairs. Through the evocation of threat and reassurance, leaders gain followings and people are induced to accept sacrifices and to remain susceptible to appeals for support. The willingness of mass publics to follow, to sacrifice, to accept their roles is the basic necessity for every political regime. Without a following there are no leaders. For governments and for aspirants to leadership it is therefore important both that people become anxious about their security and that their anxiety be assuaged, though never completely so. "National security," "social security," and similar terms are potent symbols. As the analysis of the 1896 election in this article will indicate, McKinley's campaign theme of "a full dinner pail" was aimed at the dominant private concerns of unemployment and private security operating in the urban labor force following the depres- sion of 1893. In contrast, Bryan's failure to launch much in the way of private appeals no doubt cost him further support in this voter bloc that he had already alienated with his social symbol- ism. The use of emotional management themes in defining</page><page sequence="10">388 SOCIAL SCIENCE HISTORY campaign issues often works hand in hand with the general practice of recategorizing issues from symbols using the language of public, or civic, reference to symbols that reflect individual emotions and private experience. Private appeals typically trans- form references to issues such as national productivity, economic cycles, trade policies, or legal rights into categorical references to health, job, family, order, or security. The power of these symbols to crystallize public opinion does not lie in any rational process, but lies rather in their capacity to produce an easing of deep psychological tensions. Once the leap has been made from undefined psychological concerns to some private symbolic representation of them in the outer world, the individual's psychological conflicts can be brought under some control. This general process of political judgment and response is illustrated in Lasswell's observations (1965: 100) about the specific case of guilt as a basis for political involvement: The symbolization of the environment as immoral facilitates the projection of individual guilt feelings from the self to the symbol of the environment. The individual origin of the guilt feelings is not necessarily related to any rational link to the particular aspect of the environment which is criticized. Any obscure stresses between incompatible unconscious structures may generate guilt feelings, from which the individual may relieve himself by changing his symbolic definition of the environment. Therefore, when weapons become symbols of security for people, people feel better when new weapons are built. When people regard minority groups as lazy, immoral, or violent, they feel better when those groups are socially isolated, denigrated, or punished. When political ideologies or religious beliefs are linked to threatening changes in social morality, it becomes attractive to support candidates who advocate the old morality. Considering the degree to which these connections between political symbols and private concerns are blind to reality testing and rational argument, it is not surprising that the symbols that mobilize private concerns can become powerful forces in electoral politics.</page><page sequence="11">CRITICAL ELECTIONS 389 SOCIOCULTURAL ORIENTATIONS AND CORRESPONDING ISSUE FORMATS Under certain circumstances, individuals may recognize that their private concerns are shared by others. For example, membership in an occupational group may draw people into mutual discussion and definition of their problems. Members of racial groups may gradually realize that they are discriminated against as a group, not just as individuals. The recognition by individuals that they do not suffer their problems alone has important consequences for the types of symbolic appeals that will crystallize voting choices. First of all, a sense that problems are held in common may reduce the levels of fear and anxiety operating at the individual level, and lead people to seek less abstract and projective symbolism in definitions of issues. Second, the increase in dialogue and debate among members of groups who recognize shared problems may sharpen critical thinking and lead people to expect tighter connections between issues and the problems they address. Finally, the recognition that group or social position can affect personal well-being may increase sensitivity to specific social patterns and economic forces at work in society. These factors make people responsive to different issue formats. Issues that are symbolized as sociocultural appeals differ from private appeals in at least three ways: (1) they use symbols of collective identity or membership; (2) they often use less abstract symbolism; and (3) they usually contain logical or rational explanations about how or why a policy should produce partic- ular results. These aspects of sociocultural appeals can have important political consequences. For example, the use of membership symbols to attract public attention can transform issues defined by social symbolism into potential rallying cries for new political organizations. This happened during the 20 years prior to the election of 1896, years which saw the emergence of many economic issues which became the bases of expanding political organizations that eventually grew into the Populist Movement. In addition to this, sociocultural appeals provide the</page><page sequence="12">390 SOCIAL SCIENCE HISTORY public with concrete understandings about their social problems and political options, opening up the possibility for rational debate and choice in politics. DRAMATURGICAL ORIENTATIONS AND CORRESPONDING ISSUE FORMATS In situations characterized by low private arousal and minimal social consciousness, people may still be drawn to elections out of sheer curiosity, a desire for entertainment, or human interest. The political arena is probably the only place in the real world where the events that unfold rival literature and the theater for staged human drama. There are several reasons that people may be disposed to get caught up in the spectacle of politics. In some cases, political involvement may satisfy a need to be part of something or to join with others in some constructive activity. Political drama always acknowledges the importance of the public. It casts leaders and powerful figures as their humble servants. It invites the people to participate in historic events and significant actions. In addition to this, political drama may be interesting to people because it carries them away from mundane reality. It confronts them with grand issues, heroes, villains, and moral intrigue. Perhaps the most powerful aspect of the dramaturgical orientation is the sense that being receptive to the drama of politics and the somewhat unreal posturings of political actors will carry the individual into a special symbolic world filled with humor, pathos, and human insight. It is this same orientation that allows people to transform movies, plays, or novels into reward- ing emotional and intellectual experiences. We know, at however unconscious a level, that in order to experience the message contained in any art form (and politics is surely an art form) we must relax some of our assumptions about reality. We must permit contrived stage settings to represent real scenes. We must allow the complexity of real life to be reduced to its most simple and essential elements. We must permit actors to act. We must resist the temptation to look too far underneath the actor's persona on stage to try to find out what he or she is like in real life.</page><page sequence="13">CRITICAL ELECTIONS 391 For purposes of appreciating a performance, we are disposed to treat the dramatic production as if it were real. What political spectators often get in return for this orientation is a way of understanding real life issues that they could not have assimilated an another form. Political issues are often new, confusing, and even frightening for people. When voters encoun- ter them initially through dramatized presentations, they are put in contact with simple and easy-to-grasp images that may subsequently be developed into stable opinions through private or social appeals. This is because dramatic formats make issues and candidates appealing by creating a break with the mundane world and establishing voters as key actors in the election drama. By exaggerating the consequences of issues, emphasizing heroic aspects of candidates, or building suspense around the unknown outcome of the campaign "horserace," dramatic appeals can create an interest and a stake in the race for voters who may be unmoved by private or social concerns. Dramatic appeals also can intensify the involvement of already aroused participants and lead them to see a particular course of action as a satisfying expression of their concerns. The format of a dramatic appeal generally includes a special physical setting that lifts a performance out of the stream of mundane events and focuses audience attention on particular features of action and the actors (Edelman, 1964: 95-113). Actions within this setting are reconstructed in terms that parallel the composition of ordinary social action; however, they have a claim on reality only through their coherence as a self-contained performance. In Boorstin's (1961) terms, such a performance makes its underlying connection to reality ambiguous by creating a parallel structure of action which, according to Burke (1969), is judged in terms of implicit esthetic "ratios" among its symbolic elements. ISSUES, VOTER CHOICE, AND THE ELECTION OF 1896 The importance of the interaction between voter orientations and issue formats is illustrated nicely by the 1896 election. This</page><page sequence="14">392 SOCIAL SCIENCE HISTORY election is generally regarded as the culmination of a period of voter realignment that began with the Populist movement and gained focus through the presidential race of 1892 and the congressional elections of 1894.1 It is commonly assumed that the major factor that triggered the voter alignment of 1896 was Bryan's single-minded advocacy of the free coinage of silver as the solution to the nation's economic problems in general and the plight of Western and Southern farmers in particular. In this view, silver somehow triggered the growing strains in the electorate. The impact of the issue qua issue may have been substantial within the subset of ideological or issue-oriented voters. However, we propose that the composition of the eventual voting alignment in 1896 had much more to do with the symbolic formats used by both candidates to define their chosen issues than with the capacity of any categorical issue or set of issues to unleash existing cleavages. There are several reasons why issue formats and not issue categories offer better explanations of the vote. First, silver was only one of a number of issues that could have dominated the Democratic platform of 1896. Therefore, it is not enough to explain the vote as the response of clearcut cleavages to the most obvious critical issue of the day. It is tempting to view the silver issue as the natural result of two decades of political agitation, particularly from Western settlers who sought an inflationary remedy for their economic problems. It is important to recall, however, that from 1870 to 1890 various groups and movements espousing various issues rose and fell, almost as if the Western public were trying out a succession of social themes in search of a broadly acceptable formulation about the causes and cures of such problems as climate and water rights, railroad policies and monopoly, and increasing specialization, over- production, and mechanization. Early groups like the Anti- Monopoly, Reform, and Independent parties stressed themes of fair competition, individualism, and self-reliance, as well as the importance of the yeoman farmer to America. The Greenback Party elected 15 members to Congress in 1878 on such issues as government control of credit, a ceiling on interest charges, and replacement of banknotes with a national currency. The Popu- lists, arising in the 1880s as a rejoinder to laissez faire, social</page><page sequence="15">CRITICAL ELECTIONS 393 Darwinism, and the negative state (Pollack, 1962: 18-24), pro- posed the free and unlimited coinage of silver, increased money supply, an end to private credit systems, graduated net income tax, government operation of transportation and communica- tions, monopoly control, the direct election of senators, and initiative and referendum voting (Warren, 1968: 148, Whicher, 1953: viii). The Populist platform was the broadest formulation of social themes and corresponding political issues in this era, the result of a long search for the conditions that were keeping Western and Southern farmers in their poor competitive positions (Glad, 1960: 47; Faulkner, 1959: 52-56). In light of this array of salient issues, it is important to recognize that silver was only one of many possible issues in 1896. In fact, many Populists (particularly in the Midwest) saw it as an entirely peripheral issue (Jones, 1964: 27; Pollack, 1962: 103-123). It is therefore difficult to explain the rise of silver as the most obvious expression of social strains and existing social orientations among a cohesive political group. Second, although there was a clear constituency for the silver issue prior to 1896, it is difficult to argue that this constituency was formed solely on the basis of ideological concerns about silver as an abstract policy question. Much of the popular support for silver prior to the election was a product of interactions between issue formats and political orientations similar to those that operated in the larger public during the election. The main difference was that prior to the election, the issue was promoted by interest groups, while during the campaign it was presented by candidate and party. However, in neither case is it clear that, the public responded to the issue on its merits as a sensible policy formulation as much as they responded to the symbols that were typically used to define it. These symbols engaged broader private, social, and dramaturgical orientations. If cleavages can be said to have existed in the electorate, they were drawn along the lines of such orientations. Silver was presented in a vocabulary of regional, moralistic, and "mode of production" symbols. Such appeals engaged the sociocultural orientations of Western and Southern farmers by resurrecting the spirit of the Greenback Party and promising protection against foreclosure by common economic enemies.</page><page sequence="16">394 SOCIAL SCIENCE HISTORY Silver was also represented as a remedy for the increasing concentration of capital in the cities (Faulkner, 1959: 55). These economic references tied into the regional symbolism that made silver a vehicle for expressing sectional distrust of the East and of the Eastern capital that was rampant in the West and South (Hollingsworth, 1963: 4-5). These appeals of the silver issue were magnified, in turn, by the moralistic rhetoric that asserted the values of agrarian culture and expressed fears that the neighborli- ness and morality of the democratic agrarian frontier were falling prey to the avarice of monopoly capital (Whicher, 1953: 1-9). To the groups that viewed free silver as a social statement, the panic of 1893 had added private concerns. The public mood in much of the South and West following that crushing depression was volatile, emotional, and preoccupied with security. It is reasonable to expect social orientations to be overlaid with strong private concerns in groups most affected by the losses of farms, the burdens of more expensive credit, and currency deflation. However, the economic collapse also engaged the intense anxi- eties of many homeless, unemployed, and hungry Americans in other regions as well. Thus the depression made more people receptive to silver as a panacea for private life concerns even if it was not the most convincing formulation of their sociocultural orientations. As with many issues that appeal to private orienta- tions, silver was a naive formulation for complex problems: The truth was that many Americans in these years were searching for a panacea to remove their hardships and allay their feelings of disappointment and inadequacy. If the free silver propagandists had not succeeded in making their cause the central issue in the campaign of 1896, it was likely that the Republicans would have succeeded in giving that position to the tariff issue. In retrospect the Republican argument that permanent well-being would flow from protective tariffs revealed no greater sophistication in the field of economic statesmanship than the free silverman's convic- tion that all would be well if the country would adopt his ideas about money [Jones, 1964: 6]. As an object of both social and private concerns, silver was kept before the public by interest groups (such as the American</page><page sequence="17">CRITICAL ELECTIONS 395 Bimetallic Union), by pamphlets and books (such as Coin's Financial School), and by sympathetic newspapers. These efforts linked silver to evolving social and private orientations by multiplying the dimensions of the issue, increasing its salience, and endowing it with the status of a high moral debate (Hofstadter, 1963: 12-15, 30; Jones, 1964: 336-339). However, these characteristics that made silver "the foremost political topic of the day" (Hollingsworth, 1963: 12) had little to do with the concrete substance of the silver coinage program. More clearly, the rise of the initial silver constituency was the result of symbolic formats associated with the issue which captured a range of emerging political orientations. The third reason that the substance of the silver issue is an inadequate explanation of the pattern of the vote in 1896 has to do with the fact that the initial preelection silver constituency described above formed only one component of the eventual vote in 1896. It is hard to explain the urban and Midwest votes (which held the keys to the realignment) as simple reactions against the existing doctrine of silver. The rise of the silver issue prior to 1896 had more or less ignored the private and sociocultural orienta- tions of urban laborers and Midwestern farmers. The problems of employment and wages were the objects of workers' private concerns. Midwestern farmers did not blame eastern financiers for their problems (Destler, 1947: 108-110). They tended to regard overproduction, rampant competition, and backward farming methods as causes of the crisis (Kleppner, 1970: 307-315). The evolving definition of the silver issue prior to 1896 did not address the concerns of either of these groups. One interpretation of this is that these groups were not part of the "natural" silver cleavage, and, therefore, they were driven into the Republican party by their antipathy toward silver. However, this explanation verges on the sort of circular reasoning that must be avoided if a theory of elections is to develop beyond its present state. As the discussion thus far has indicated, there are not "natural" constituencies for issues in the abstract. A vote is split depending on how political orientations are engaged by develop- ing definitions of issues. The Southern and Western silver constituencies were the result of the evolution of diverse formats</page><page sequence="18">396 SOCIAL SCIENCE HISTORY for the presentation of the silver issue. Therefore, the absence of formats that captured the orientations of other groups does not mean that such formats could not have been developed. More- over, the absence of Midwest farm and labor voters from the pre- 1896 silver constituency does not mean that they could not have been drawn into the Populist-Democratic alliance during the campaign. In fact, it is our contention that the vote distribution in the election hinged on whether Bryan could (or chose to) develop issue formats that appealed to these orientations and whether McKinley's issues were defined in ways that better represented the orientations of these crucial groups. THE RHETORIC OF 1896 The voter alignments generally attributed to the divisiveness of silver as an abstract issue can be explained more precisely as responses to the symbolic formats used to present the issue to the public. Voter choices depend on the possible interpretations that an issue can generate. A basic law of electoral choice would seem to be that if voters operating with certain political orientations cannot construct and are not supplied with credible and per- suasive positive interpretations of an issue or a cluster of issues, the issue cannot become a ground for their votes. Not only does this formulation offer a more precise explanation of voter choice and electoral outcomes, but it provides a clearer way of thinking about the role of the candidates in presenting issues to their publics. For example, the outcome of 1896 is generally attributed to the impact of the silver issue, which outweighed the rhetorical prowess of Bryan and the banality of McKinley. However, an examination of campaign rhetoric and the use of symbolic formats suggests that while Bryan was a master of drama, he was far from a master of persuasion, and that while McKinley is not widely remembered as a superb orator, his political craftsman- ship seems beyond dispute. In fact, McKinley's choice of issue formats seemed almost perfectly designed to neutralize the strengths of Bryan and to capitalize on his weaknesses.</page><page sequence="19">CRITICAL ELECTIONS 397 THE BRYAN CAMPAIGN The fact that Bryan entered the Chicago convention as little more than a favorite son and left as the nominee of the Democratic Party can be attributed to his rhetorical prowess. His "Cross of Gold" speech during the convention platform debate on the silver plank galvanized the convention behind Bryan's silver candidacy. This seems curious in that the delegates had come to the convention pledged to one side or another of the silver issue. Bryan's ability to "cut his way through and at one bound" and move "from a possibility to a winner's seat" (Jones, 1964: 238) was testimony to the power of his dramatic appeal, as demonstrated by this description (Jones, 1964: 1229): The convention at last had found its voice. Bryan had said nothing new; he had made no profound argument which men would remember and cite later. He had said, however, what hundreds of delegates, inarticular and mute, felt and believed. The failure of the convention to arrive at such an expression earlier had saddened and depressed them. In a few minutes Bryan had set everything right. Bryan's speech was an exemplary dramatic appeal: he drew a willing audience into a dramatization of the silver issue by expressing its beliefs and sentiments in a particularly glorious way. Bryan's Dramaturgical Appeals The Bryan campaign of 1896 was, of course, legendary for its dramatics. While it is unnecessary to recount the testimonies about his endurance, power, earnestness, wit, and sheer spec- tacle, it is helpful to review the dramaturgical strategy that he used. Bryan employed three kinds of dramatic tactics to enhance the spectator appeal of his campaign. First, he led his audiences to judgments about attacks from the local press or from gold advocates, or about McKinley's inconsistent record on silver</page><page sequence="20">398 SOCIAL SCIENCE HISTORY (Bryan, 1896: 465-466). This encouraged the audience to leap to the judgment ahead of Bryan and to respond by vociferously approving him and disparaging his enemies. His second tactic was to encourage the audience to speak out during his speeches; most commonly, his ploy was to ask questions that triggered partisan responses (1896: 477). Bryan's third tactic was to exaggerate the significance of the election and the voters' roles in it. He would cite the intimidation tactics or innuendoes of the opposition in order to encourage his supporters to band together and rely on their own personal courage to thwart the enemy. Probably his greatest call to action was his "crossroads rhetoric," contained in such phrases as: "This question involves the welfare of our nation, it involves humanity, it involves civilization" (1896: 572-573). Bryan (1896: 552) constantly emphasized the impor- tance of silver with hyperbole that suggested that the audience before him held the future of the world in its hands. These were, of course, somewhat common devices for drama in political campaigns. What was uncommon was the revivalist fervor, the moralistic tone of Bryan's rhetoric. Kleppner (1970: 298-301) showed rather convincingly that the tone of Bryan's appeals was ill-suited to the traditional concerns and values of the Democratic Party. The Democrats had heretofore opposed positive government and had opposed attempts to legislate morality. In 1896, however, Bryan used the style of pietistic moralism, conservative fundamentalism, and governmental pa- ternalism in an attempt to remake the bases of Democratic support along new lines. Kleppner argued that this style failed to reactivate or reinforce the partisan attachments of traditional Democrats. In this sense, Bryan disrupted traditional Democratic voters by violating their expectations with a dramaturgy more appropriate to traditional Republican appeals. Bryan's failure to connect with traditional Democratic loyalties naturally impaired his efforts to engage the dramatic orientations of certain audi- ences. By turning the silver campaign into a crusade for morality, Bryan disrupted his own strong suit. If he were to convince many voters to support him, he would have to rely on individual and social appeals to shore up this disruptive dramatism.</page><page sequence="21">CRITICAL ELECTIONS 399 Bryan's Private Appeals Although Bryan's dramatic appeals won him the nomination and attracted large audiences throughout the campaign, an examination of his speeches shows a curious imbalance of symbolic formats in his appeals. The most striking imbalance is the limited incidence of private appeals. He evidently believed that the events of the depression and the history of public debate over silver had readied the masses for collective ideological organization behind his candidacy. (Even if this had been an accurate reading of the situation, the narrow scope of his social appeals failed to include many sectors of the "toiling masses" whose support he desperately needed.) However, given the severe personal distress and the absence of well-articulated social orientations among the urban labor force, Bryan would have been well advised to make the silver issue speak to private concerns. Bryan's closest approximation to an individual appeal was associated with his representation of the election as a battle of great moral principles. This elevated the discussion of silver on occasion to an abstract plane of right and wrong that invited individuals to project disparate concerns onto the silver stand. However, this was probably a private appeal less by design than by Bryan's grandiose vision of silver as a social issue. Bryan (1896: 464, 515) claimed that silver was a prerequisite to all other reforms. This perspective called for some abstraction at times to make silver a repository for other social concerns. There appear to be no other recurring examples of individual appeals in Bryan's 1896 campaign. There are several reasons' for this in addition to his belief that the masses were ready to coalesce around silver as the quintessential social issue. One of them was that Bryan was under heavy attack from the Eastern press for being a demogogue and an anarchist. Private appeals only fanned the flames of journalistic persecution and made it that much more difficult for him to reach the masses through the press. Probably the most persuasive explanation for the absence of individual appeals is that Bryan saw the election as an Armageddon between the forces of plutocracy and democracy. He saw the issues strictly</page><page sequence="22">400 SOCIAL SCIENCE HISTORY in terms of social and sectional cleavages, and there was little room in this vision for nonideological appeals. Like his failure to use traditional Democratic dramaturgy, Bryan's failure to use individual appeals seems to have narrowed his possible avenues of potential support, particularly in the hotly contested Midwest. Bryan failed to personalize the silver issue. He failed to supply Midwesterners with grounds for seeing silver as a superior solution to economic problems. We have already noted that silver held little intrinsic or ideological appeal to Midwesterners. For Bryan to neglect the personal fears and economic insecurities of Midwestern voters was clearly a strategic miscalculation. Bryan's Sociocultural Appeals Despite Bryan's concentration on sociocultural appeals and his obvious dramatic skills for getting them across, these appeals were curiously uneven. For example, his masterful efforts to divide the electorate into the two camps of the "plutocrats" and the "democrats" (i.e., the classes vs. the masses) were vitiated by Bryan's insistence on making invidious distinctions among groups in the democratic camp. These distinctions clearly established the Western, agrarian interests as primary and all other interests as secondary at best. Any appeal that his general sociocultural references may have had to urban labor or mid- western farmers was undercut by these ill-conceived qualifica- tions. Bryan established his commitment to the democratic ideal with powerful appeals to "the people." His foes attacked him, he said (Bryan, 1896: 469), because they were out of touch with the common people. "There is nobody on our side but the people" (1896: 303). Bryan (1896: 343-344) asserted that the monetary question could be understood and decided by the common people both because the financial question was a moral question and because the people took the trouble to study the question, as they were the ones who were suffering. Financial experts, according to Bryan (1896: 344), attacked the right of the people to decide</page><page sequence="23">CRITICAL ELECTIONS 401 because they feared justice and because they did not want to relinquish the control they had (1896: 515): When I find a man who thinks that the money question is too complicated for the people, I generally find a man who thinks it is just complicated enough for himself. When I find a man who thinks the money question is too deep for the people, I generally find a man who thinks that he has made a study of deep questions. Whenever I find a man who thinks that the masses are not intelligent enough to act for themselves, I generally find a man who wants to act for them. Bryan (1896: 446) frequently employed such fighting rhetoric as: "In this campaign the lines are drawn between Plutocracy and Democracy. In such a fight there is no middle ground; those who are not with us are against us," both to emphasize the momen- tousness of the decision and to draw up the lines between the masses and "the money power." This "us vs. them" rhetoric epitomizes the sociocultural appeal. "If I had behind me the great trusts and combinations," he added (1896: 304), "I know I would no sooner take my seat than they would demand that I use my power to rob the people in their behalf." Bryan supplemented this dichotomy (1896: 547) by blaming the depression on the greed of the plutocracy and by claiming that this momentous choice offered the people a chance to elect themselves to office. He reinforced this distinction between plutocrats and demo- crats with another distinction between producers and nonpro- ducers of wealth. The plutocracy had succeeded, Bryan argued (1896: 316, 518), because the producers had been submitting to laws made by nonproducers. Naturally, the nonproducers had been using their power to enrich themselves at the expense of the people who produced the wealth. By electing him, the producing masses could take back their government and once again exercise some control over their lives. While the nonproducers sought high office from greed, Bryan claimed (1896: 476), the common people sought only equality and justice. Bryan (1896: 502, 551, 467) drew these lines in the battle with a multitude of phrases: sometimes the battle was between "the creators of wealth" and</page><page sequence="24">402 SOCIAL SCIENCE HISTORY "the money changers"; sometimes between the "worker bees and the drones." Bryan also argued that their advocacy of the tariff had allied the Republicans with the plutocracy, while the Democrats prefer- red silver to help return rule of the people to the land. The Repub- lican tariff, Bryan said, meant that prosperity could be recovered only by aiding businesses through protection. In opposition to these "trickle down" theories, Bryan offered some "percolate up" ideas: The well-being of the nation-aye, of civilization itself-depends upon the prosperity of the masses [1896: 325]. I believe that all the classes which rest upon the producers of wealth can only prosper permanently when the producers of wealth are prosperous [1896: 538]. I believe that that policy is best for this country which brings prosperity first to those who toil ... their prosperity will find its way up to the other classes of society which rest upon them [1896: 583]. The link between party and social group that Bryan employed is another classic sociocultural format. This alignment of workers and Democrats was overlaid with a third broad and compatible social category: the distinction between "national" and "foreign" interests. The gold standard was, from Bryan's viewpoint (1896: 566), a crippling source of dependence on foreign nations: "We advocates of free silver believe that only by having financial policy made by the American people for the American people can we support the honor of the United States." This foreign dependence and loss of national dignity was also tied to the Republicans who rejected bimetal- lism in part, Bryan claimed (1896: 508), because it departed from international monetary agreements: "What hope does the Re- publican platform hold out to the people? Only the hope that foreign nations will be more kind to the American people than the Republican convention was." He reiterated this claim that the Republicans favored turning over American policy to European</page><page sequence="25">CRITICAL ELECTIONS 403 policymakers throughout the campaign with such references as "the European plan" and "European foreign policy." He even invoked veiled references to colonialism with statements such as: "The agitation for free silver will never cease in this country until the gold standard is driven back to England" (1896: 305, 461, 476). These overlapping references to workers, masses, "the people," Democrats, and nationalism opened the possibility for broad social identification with the Bryan campaign. In fact, they give the appearance of one of the most far-ranging ideological appeals in American electoral history. Had Bryan limited his social appeals to these sorts of references, it would have been easier for many voters to see the silver issue as a representation of their social positions and to regard a Democratic vote as an expression of these social understandings. However, as mentioned above, Bryan's sociocultural references did not stop here. In fact, the thrust of his free-silver rhetoric contained social references that cut directly across the broad categories outlined above. In contrast to the ideological rigor of his broad social references, many of Bryan's most emphatic and salient appeals seem narrow, gratuitous, and, above all, antagonistic to his goal of building a coalition of the "toiling masses" within the Democratic Party. The first of these divisive social references was a preoccupation with sectional antagonisms. Despite his need for electoral votes in the Midwest, Bryan insisted on playing up the separate interests of East and West and the fundamental economic conflicts that divided them. This campaign appeal was lost to a great extent in the Midwest because, as we saw above, the Midwest was prone to see the West and the South as the problem areas. At best, Bryan's sectional rhetoric fell on uninterested ears. At worst, it fell on the ears of those who disliked the West and Western farmers. The ambiguity of his sectional references was compounded by his all-too-explicit analysis of why current financial practices were bad for the country. When he explained the need for financial reform, his references to the interests of "the people," "the toiling masses," or "the workers" gave way to the mention of only one group-the farmers. Underneath the broad references to</page><page sequence="26">404 SOCIAL SCIENCE HISTORY a class struggle in America, Bryan's rhetoric (1896: 468) often indicated that the real struggle was between the plutocracy and one embattled social group: "My friends, we have had our financial legislation run by those people who have made more in an hour gambling in stocks and bonds, and gambling in what farmers produce, than all the farmers of the union could make producing their crops." Thus, not only did Bryan exacerbate long-standing sectional differences stretching from the Age of Jackson through the Civil War to the legacy of the Homestead Act, but his social references excluded the most important emerging group in the electorate: the urban labor force. To some extent this bias in his social appeals was simply an error of omission. Although he made reference to the "work- ingman" or the "toiler" as the victim of the gold standard, he generally showed how silver would benefit farmers and neglected to explain the benefits to urban labor (if, indeed, there were any). However, the far more serious flaw in his social appeals was the overt reminder that the farmer was the backbone of the nation and the mainstay of the coalition of the masses. Labor was explicitly cast in an inferior position. This pattern of social references continued throughout the campaign with the fateful line (1896: 205) that was introduced in the "Cross of Gold" speech: "You come to tell us that the great cities are in favor of the gold standard; we reply that the great cities rest upon our broad and fertile prairies. Burn down your cities and leave our farms and your cities will spring up again as if by magic; but destroy our farms and the grass will grow in the streets of every city in the country." An effective social appeal induces voters to respond collec- tively and positively to the candidate before them. However, these narrow categorical references impeded identification with Bryan among city dwellers and workers. This is ironical in light of the basis for such identifications contained in his initial references to nationalism, democracy, and the masses. The exclusionary references in Bryan's definition of free silver were compounded by the absence of private appeals. These factors combined to prevent many voters operating out of private concerns or out of regional</page><page sequence="27">CRITICAL ELECTIONS 405 or occupational sociocultural orientations from reaching favor- able interpretations of Bryan's position. In short, the pattern of voter alignment that is generally attributed to the divisiveness of silver as an abstract issue can be explained more precisely as a response constrained by the symbolic formats that Bryan used to present the issue to the electorate. This analysis of the Bryan campaign can only explain his failure to appeal to more of the toiling masses with his "plutocracy versus democracy" rhetoric. A common flaw with electoral studies is the tendency to assume that dislike of one candidate is tantamount to support of the other major candidate. However, dislike of the candidate of one's traditional party is as much grounds for simply staying home as it is grounds for switching partisan affiliation. What must now be shown is that the McKinley campaign was more than a mere open door to Bryan's defectors; it contained issue formulations that actively encour- aged the defection. THE McKINLEY CAMPAIGN In contrast to Bryan's use of restricted issue definitions, McKinley made effective use of all three types of appeals. In its own way, the McKinley campaign was as dramatic as the Bryan campaign. This not only neutralized some of Bryan's dramatic appeal, but it provided the largely pro-McKinley press with daily material to disseminate. As a result, McKinley was able to obtain wide distribution of his individual and social appeals both against the silver issue and in favor of his tariff policy. It is important to contrast the McKinley campaign style with that of Bryan. McKinley made dramatic appeals with his "front porch" campaign in Canton. These appeals contrasted with Bryan's in the sense that McKinley had far more control over the visits to his home than Bryan had on his exhausting whistle-stop tour. McKinley also appeared far more dignified and less harried than Bryan. In contrast to Bryan's pietistic and disruptive style, McKinley used a pluralistic style that avoided the cultural</page><page sequence="28">406 SOCIAL SCIENCE HISTORY cleavages that had characterized recent politics. In this manner, he kept his campaign open to a wider audience than it would have drawn otherwise. To secure support from such audiences, McKinley employed a number of sociocultural, private, and dramaturgical appeals that were relevant to key Midwestern voting blocs. McKinley's Dramatic Appeals Given Bryan's obvious dramatic appeals, one might assume that a rather staid fellow like McKinley was outmatched. Nothing could be further from the truth. McKinley made Canton, Ohio the Mecca of the 1896 campaign by receiving visiting delegations of his fellow citizens from numerous states. Approximately 750,000 people came from surrounding areas to visit McKinley at his home, to pay their respects, and to provide an audience for his carefully prepared campaign: For the eager Republic pilgrims, the journey combined the excitement of a political demonstration with the pleasure of an outing. Decked in campaign badges, caps, and neckties, they tumbled off the trains into the welcoming arms of Canton. Committees of greeters were on hand at the depot, with the well- mounted and nattily uniformed squads of the Canton troop which had been organized for escort duty. The parades formed around their bands and banners, and, guided by the clattering horsemen, wound through a town ablaze with red, white, and blue, and noisy with the cheers of the citizens on the curbstones. At the foot of North Market Street the delegations passed beneath the ornate plaster structure of the McKinley Arch, surmounted by the candidate's portrait, and at last broke ranks to crowd onto the McKinley lawn [Leech, 1959: 88]. A standard ritual then followed in which a delegation would pay its respects to McKinley, and a spokesman would read a short speech informing the candidate of the special reasons for the group's visit. The group then would make some show of its support. The spokesman's remarks normally were cleared with</page><page sequence="29">CRITICAL ELECTIONS 407 the McKinley staff, and in some instances McKinley even redrafted the remarks. McKinley would then play out his role by noting two or three of the spokesman's points or by praising the delegation for troubling to visit him. McKinley always tailored his prepared remarks to visitors' interests. After the speech, he would go among them to shake hands and greet them informally (Leech, 1959: 88-89). The dramatic appeal of these performances to the voters was powerful. They drew visitors in with the intimacy of the occasion. They conveyed the very positive image of a presidential contender responding to their particular concerns, shaking their hands, praising their town's contributions to America. McKinley's knowledge of their areas of interest and their concerns was impressive. Moreover, McKinley was a master of asking leading questions and using lines that evoked applause, which excited the crowd even further. The effect was to create a euphoric atmo- sphere, yet the schedule of events, the dialogue, and the composi- tion of the audiences weire under virtually complete control. Republicans were quick to compare these scenes with the "undignified" way in which Bryan "begged" for votes. McKinley could appeal for votes without appearing to thirst for power and office. He was always rested. His speeches were precise and well- researched. The novelty of the front porch campaign helped the already friendly Eastern press make the Canton visitations into media events. The New York Tribune (1896a: 1; 1896b: 1) announced the continuing tales from Canton with headlines such as "STILL FLOCKING TO CANTON" and "MORE PIL- GRIMS TO CANTON-INCLEMENT WEATHER NO BAR." These serial headlines tied the visits together into what appeared to be a ceaseless mass demonstration of McKinley's popularity. Many of the Tribune's articles during the last month of the campaign reprinted McKinley's remarks in entirety, including such notations as "storms of applause" at appropriate points. The New York Times (1896: 1) reprinted almost as many of McKin- ley's remarks. Although the Times gave less total coverage to Canton than did the Tribune, its stories hammered away on the diversity of the groups visiting McKinley.</page><page sequence="30">408 SOCIAL SCIENCE HISTORY Fifteen thousand men who came from the mills, furnaces, farms, colleges, workshops, mines, and counting rooms of New York, Pennsylvania, Illinois, Ohio, and Indiana marched up the Market Street hill in Canton today to greet and to hear Major McKinley, and then marched down again with the flush of enthusiasm in their faces, and the promise of victory in their ringing cheers. McKinley's Private Appeals In these performances McKinley made strong appeals to private orientations that were aimed at arousing fears about free silver and its advocate. McKinley argued that silver was scaring businessmen. He claimed that it was a lack of business confidence that had brought on the depression in 1893, and that the new fear of silver was preventing a speedy return to prosperity, as he declared (Library of Congress, 1961: 61-62, 20): "Having stricken down our industries, a new experiment is now proposed, one that would debase our currency and further weaken, if not destroy, public confidence," and "having destroyed business and confi- dence by a free trade policy, it is now proposed to make things worse by entering upon an era of depreciated currency." McKinley clearly appealed to fears of permanent or chronic depression and laid the blame for the slow recovery at the feet of free silver agitation. This rhetoric also kindled a fear of radical solutions as well. "Bryanism" was a label in the Eastern press for the Democratic campaign that connoted radicalism and anarchy. McKinley claimed that a Bryan victory would divide the country and plunge it into open class warfare. Bryan's efforts to pit labor against capital were portrayed as dishonest and a disservice to domestic tranquility by McKinley (Library of Congress, 1961: 85): "We want peace and tranquility in the United States. We want it established once and for all that this is a Government of law and by law and that now as always we are a law-abiding people." And (Library of Congress, 1961: 71-72): "Instead of seeking to work the masses," McKinley said of Bryan's campaign, "it would be worthier on the part of all of us to try to get work for the masses." With this last appeal, McKinley referred to recent labor unrest with the implication that his platform promised</page><page sequence="31">CRITICAL ELECTIONS 409 prosperity and an end to labor agitation and economic disorders. If free silver and Bryanism threatened all, tariff protection promised prosperity for all. This was the positive thrust of the majority of McKinley's private appeals. A common theme was the security of protecting American jobs from foreign labor (Library of Congress, 1961: 77): "I cannot fail to remember one thing which stands between your labor and the labor of Europe ... a wise, patriotic, American protective policy." Protective tariffs, he argued, would reduce unemployment and protect the high wages of the American worker (Library of Congress, 1961: 59, 84). The tariff would do this by creating new markets. Silver promised idleness, stagnation, and business trepidation; protec- tion promised high wages, prosperity, and business confidence. McKinley thus tried to turn the cause of the depression from deflation (which Bryan argued) to overproduction brought on by a lack of markets. Only a tariff could increase demand and thereby bring back prosperity (Glad, 1964: 179-188; Fite, 1971: 257-258). This appeal could be made very personal, as when McKinley (Library of Congress, 1961: 58) noted, "This great American doctrine of protection is associated with wages and work and linked with home, family, country, and prosperity (emphasis added). This set of categorical references to dominant areas of private life connected his argument to the everyday concerns of the audience without burdening his appeal with logical exposition. This is a classic form of the private appeal. McKinley's Sociocultural Appeals McKinley was also concerned with turning silver and the tariff into sociocultural appeals by showing how silver threatened, and tariffs protected, various groups in society. Before his many labor audiences in Canton, for example, McKinley (Library of Con- gress, 1961: 89, 61) argued that labor would suffer the most from depreciated currency with such declarations as: "We do not propose now to inaugurate a currency system that will cheat labor in its pay," and: "If we have good wages, they are better by being paid in good dollars. If we have poor wages, they are made poorer</page><page sequence="32">410 SOCIAL SCIENCE HISTORY by being paid in poor dollars." These appeals led naturally to more overt social appeals to labor. McKinley had long cultivated labor ties in his career (Jones, 1964: 289-290), and he took great pains to express his special identification with laborers with such statements (Library of Congress, 1961: 77, 90) as: "Somehow when an assemblage of workingmen comes to pay me a visit, it attracts my interest and touches my heart more than anyone else," and "to be called by laboring men themselves 'the workingman's friend,' is the highest honor for which I could strive." These common membership signals to labor were generally accompanied by more sophisticated attempts to split labor away from Bryan's "toiling masses" and to link it to business. McKinley charged (Library of Congress, 1961: 79) that his opponent was trying to divide the classes against one another and to blind them to their mutual interests: "Labor is indispensable to the creation and profitable use of capital and capital increases the efficiency and value of labor." This connection of labor and capital was at odds with the traditional agrarian orientation from which Bryan operated. In this sense, the "battle of the standards" became a battle of social myths as well. The symbolism in Bryan's social appeal was anchored in the myth of the traditional frontier yeoman who stood for egalitarian democracy and community, and McKinley invoked the myth of the new Horatio Alger representing the values of acquisitive individualism and self-help (Glad, 1960: 32-36). McKinley's appeal to labor and capital was connected to a still more encompassing social appeal for patriotism and national solidarity. In pointed contrast to the "divisive" Bryan, McKinley called sectional and class appeals unpatriotic. Whereas the silver issue was "un-American," his tariff policy was "an industrial policy that is for America and Americans" (Library of Congress, 1961: 85). The proof that the Republicans were for national unity was the diverse cross section of support that he had cultivated so carefully in Canton audiences and targeted in his social appeals. This broad social emphasis was calculated to lend support to such unity appeals (Library of Congress, 1961: 62) as: "The Repub- lican Party can submit its principles to the workingman, to the</page><page sequence="33">CRITICAL ELECTIONS 411 farmer, to the student, to the scholar, to those of every calling or profession, with confidence, because those principles are right and eternal." McKinley dramatized this appeal for unity against a backdrop of patriotic displays. He alleged that silver would debase the nation's honor in addition to its currency, and he called on the voters to make their votes express their love of country. Parades, flag days, flag buttons, posters, hats, ties, and ribbons were used to identify McKinley with patriotism. These patriotic props not only supported his appeals to unity, honor, and pride, but also allowed citizens to express their strong feelings for their country at a time when many of them were experiencing extreme anxieties about impending revolution or civil war. The appeals to patriotism allowed them to submerge these fears in a flurry of support for the man of Canton (Jones, 1964: 291-293). THE IMPACT OF ISSUE FORMATS ON THE VOTE On 3 November 1896, William McKinley won a clear, although not overwhelming, victory. He gained 50.8% of the popular vote to Bryan's 46.7%, winning by 570,000 votes over his Democratic opponent. This translated into an electoral vote margin of 271 to 176. However, more impressive than these margins of victory was the endurance of the Republican coalition that formed in 1896 and made the Republicans the dominant party in national politics for the next thirty years. In terms of the structure of the vote, then, 1896 was a disastrous defeat for the Democrats. Election returns document the success of the McKinley appeals. Among workers in the Midwest, Bryan managed a majority in no state, and ran well below the labor votes received by Cleveland in 1892. In Detroit, Bryan fell below even the Democratic levels of 1894 during the depths of the depression! (Kleppner, 1970: 288-290). That Bryan could be endorsed in Pennsylvania by the American Federation of Labor, the Knights of Labor, the American Railway Union, and the Farmer's Alliance, and still lose badly among Pennsylvania's "toiling</page><page sequence="34">412 SOCIAL SCIENCE HISTORY masses" (Stevens, 1937: 75-77, 84), is evidence for his lack of labor support and for McKinley's ability to secure such support. In light of this poor showing among labor, it is reasonable to suppose that urbanites in general would be even less responsive to Bryan's appeals for the primacy of Western farmers, his advocacy of unfamiliar economic cycles, and his praise for the yeoman agrarian tradition. The returns confirm this. Even in the friendly South, Bryan lost industrial cities. In New England he managed only 33% of the urban vote, 37% in the Middle Atlantic states, 40- 43% in the Midwest, and only 46% on the Pacific Coast (Diamond, 1941: 286). Bryan fared little better among Mid- western rural voters. In both Michigan and Wisconsin, Bryan fell below Cleveland's 1892 showing (Kleppner, 1970: 294). His strength was in Indiana and Ohio where he managed to win 48% of the vote from rural areas (Diamond, 1941: 289). However, in Minnesota and Iowa, Bryan polled only 40% and 43% of the rural vote respectively. He fared even worse in the East, and failed to gain rural majorities in border states as well (Kleppner, 1970: 287- 291). Although these election returns are consistent with our analysis of the rhetoric of 1896, previous scholarship has suggested the importance of an exclusively ethnocultural explanation. As described earlier, these analysts point to the religious under- pinnings of partisanship and argue that the pietistic appeals of Bryan disrupted the support of traditionally staunch Democrats while the pluralistic appeals of the Republicans kept the door open for both sides of the pietistic-ritualistic conflict. This argument is in many ways a strong one. Although exception to the central works may be taken on methodological grounds (Blocker, 1973: 202-203; Kleppner, 1972: 19-25; Bogue et al., 1977: 204; Wright, 1973: 660-666; Kousser, 1973: 239; Lichtman, 1974: 433), we shall confront the ethnoculturalists on theoretical grounds. In brief, we believe that the framework we have outlined and illustrated above offers a more general explanation that: (1) is sensitive to multiple political groups and changing voter orienta- tions, (2) includes the ethnocultural perspective but addresses other factors as well, and (3) is better able to ground the explanation of critical elections in a theory of voter choice.</page><page sequence="35">CRITICAL ELECTIONS 413 The ethnocultural perspective is simply not very general. Even if we accept Kleppner's carefully culled data from homogeneous districts in three states, we find it difficult to generalize to heterogeneous districts, to other states, and to other regions. Generalization to other elections is equally difficult. There is evidence to suggest that ethnic and religious groups may not have been all that important in determining votes in less homogeneous communities (Allswang, 1971: 28-34) and in other states (Jensen, 1971; Luebke, 1969: 35; Rogin and Shover, 1970: 15-22). It is reasonable to assume that ethnoreligious voting was prevalent in communities where religious views were constantly reinforced, but that is not grounds for believing that the same holds true elsewhere. The ethnocultural approach has done great service to the study of elections by vanquishing the monocausal socio- economic interpretation, but it tends all too often to act as if cultural factors were thereby demonstrated to be the only important factors. The ability of voters to have multiple orienta- tions and to shift orientations under different conditions would seem more consistent with current social psychology (Bogue et al., 1977: 205). In addition to its narrow scope, the ethnocultural perspective does not offer a convincing explanation of why voters who were repelled by Bryan's pietism were attracted to McKinley- particularly as many of them (or their offspring) remained committed to the Republicans for the next thirty years. Without the addition of McKinley's private and dramaturgical appeals we would be hard-pressed to explain why disaffected Democrats did not simply stay home instead of voting for the other party in large numbers. In short, if we look only to ethnocultural factors, the realignment of 1896 seems problematical. However, in light of the diversity of McKinley's appeals, it is clear how groups with different orientations could have been drawn to the Republican party and gained reinforcement for their variously grounded choices in the years of prosperity that followed 1896. In the final analysis, of course, our argument is a speculative one. In its defense, it can be said that it is an extension of other equally speculative but well-accepted theories. It extends these perspectives by outlining plausible linkages between what the</page><page sequence="36">414 SOCIAL SCIENCE HISTORY candidates say, how the voters decide, and the characteristics of the resulting vote. Finally, it is consistent with (though certainly not proved by) available historical evidence. This consistency with broad historical evidence lends face validity to the argument and reinforces it as a plausible first step toward a more systematic theory of what issues represent to voters and what elections mean. The key variables of issue format and voter orientation presented in this argument can be operationalized and measured at the individual level and linked to actual or probable votes through survey or experimental methods. With these measures, it would be possible to show how voters process issue stimuli, why some issue formats may be more effective with some voters than with others, and why the same issue may represent different things to different voters. All of this holds out the prospect of a next step in the theory of elections that might explain the impact of issues, the grounds of voter choice, and the conditions of voter realignments. NOTE 1. One critic of Key's theory of critical elections has argued that 1896 was not actually a "realigning" election. Pomper (1967) proposed that 1896 be classified as a "converting" election because, according to his analysis, the majority party remained victorious but there was a change in the underlying electoral cleavage. While these classification criteria appear valid if one looks only at the trend of party dominance in presidential elections before and after 1896, they obscure two important defining properties of critical realigning elections. First, as Key (1955) emphasized, if a realignment means anything, it involves changes in the political agenda and popular understanding about issues on that agenda. Pomper substitutes a technical distinction for Key's concerns about voter understanding and involvement. Pomper (1967: 535) dismisses these factors as "difficult to establish historically and not vital to the concept." Second, even on technical (i.e., vote distribution) grounds, it is misleading to define realignments simply according to patterns of party ownership of the presidency. It is true that the Republicans dominated that office both before and after 1896, but a look at the congressional situation (Kleppner, 1970: 5-6) reveals that the period prior to 1896 was anything but stable: "While the Republicans controlled the Senate for seven of the ten Congressional sessions between 1875 and 1895, they were able to organize the House only twice. .... The party simultaneously controlled both houses of Congress and the presidency</page><page sequence="37">CRITICAL ELECTIONS 415 only during the 51st Congress. By 1892 their share of the national vote had dropped to 43.0%. ... This Republican demise was not matched by the ascendance of the Democracy. . .. The Republican decline had not produced a new majority party, but a period of protracted political stalemate." REFERENCES ALBANESE, C. L.
