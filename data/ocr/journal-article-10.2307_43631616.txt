An initial reading of this 1990 work might see it - to use Stan Allen's words on the effect of a figure emerging from a field - "as moments of intensity, as peaks or valleys within a continuous field" that, through imper- ceptible subterranean forces, produce "vortexes, peaks, and protuberances out of individual elements."1 Another interpre- tation might place Kelley's piece closer to the generic image of a Zen garden, to which its title refers, and yet another, in the uncanny space of repressed childhood memories lurking beneath crafty domestic artifacts. A figure of a field, a figure of a landscape, and a figure of hidden figures, Arena #4 ( Zen Garden ) helps to illuminate the trajectory of architecture's turn toward representational images, a turn that computa- tional processes slipped into design through the very logics of the software itself. At the same time, Kelley's work taps into an anxiety in art and architectural practices regarding figura- tion: that it contaminates purely visual fields with embedded narrative content. Arena #4 also revives discussions of repre- sentational imagery in a modernist world that has privileged abstraction over realism and fields over figures, the politics of which stretch from neoliberal aesthetics to the identity of bodies in space. These politics have produced a latent fear of figures, but that fear is fertile ground for the design research of architecture studios like MachineHistories, Pita &amp; Bloom, Maxi Spina Architecture, Greg Lynn Form, and Mark Foster Gage Architects, practices that pull pictorial tropes out from under the blanket of abstraction to deploy them as part and parcel of formal experimentation. Gestalt art theory offers systematic approaches to analyzing the figure-field dynamic these architects explore, providing strategies to govern figu- ration's tendency toward signification by focusing on com- positional techniques rather than the semantic content of symbolic objects. A systematic approach to analyzing the 1.

From Field to Figure If Sanford Kwinter's 1986 essay "La Citta Nuova : Modernity and Continuity" marks architecture's theoretical move toward fields, then Ron Witte's 2007 essay "Go Figure" her- alds its eventual pivot to figures. Kwinter describes the field as a space of propagation and effects that contain neither matter nor material points but function through vectors and veloci- ties. Twenty years and a digital world later, Witte observed "a new figure lurking in architecture" that the terms "fold, metaphor, chunk, smoothness, shape, surface, data-scape, pattern, or blob" betray as evidence of "unabashedly figure - conscious" architectures.2 For Stan Allen, the field-figure dynamic constitutes spatial matrices that unify diverse ele- ments while simultaneously allowing them to express their autonomous identity within open-ended and responsive sys- tems "characterized by porosity and local interconnectivity."* As he explains, minimalism emptied figuration in order to displace meaning from the object to the spaces occupying the field between object and viewer as "a fluid zone of perceptual interference, populated by moving bodies."4 A key indication of architecture's figurai unease came in the early 1980s with the controversial addition of Frederick Hart's bronze sculpture Three Soldiers (1984) to Maya Lin's Vietnam Veterans Memorial (1982), demonstrating the ideo- logical turmoil swirling around the differences in the mean- ing of figures and fields. Lin's design registers the war's legacy by using black granite walls to cut a V-shaped wound into the ground, the geometry of which stitches together the Lincoln Memorial and the Washington Monument's site lines. In responding to the site's physical and cultural field condi- tions Lin's work contrasts with the representational and his- toricist monuments on the mall just as much as Hart's figurai sculpture clashes with Lin's nonfigurative memorial.5 During 2.

Lacking narrative content, absent representational figures, and memorializing a controversial war, the "black pit" drew enough vociferous negative commentary to justify the addition, against Lin's protests, of Hart's sculptural group and a flagpole. If Lin's vision for an abstract design ultimately has been vindicated by the memorial's mass appeal, then it was achieved at the price of a compromise that catered to conservative forces. This figure/field polarity follows the distinction Clement Greenberg drew in his 1939 essay "Avant-garde and Kitsch," in which he contrasts modern art's compulsion toward abstrac- tion with the reactionary dimensions of the rappel a l'ordre* % call to realism and advances the role of nonobjective, avant- garde art over the debased role of figurai art as a tool of fascis- tic regimes. For Greenberg, kitsch is figurai, representational, and narrative while avant-garde is abstract, nonrepresenta- tional, and contains only the vestigial narrative content of its own formative processes. The political dimensions of this division had already been demonstrated at the Nazi regime's 1937 Degenerate Art Exhibition in Munich. Organized by Adolf Ziegler, the exhibition celebrated figurai art as healthy while deriding the major stylistic schools of modern art as "degenerate." It is little surprise, given the political affiliations that Greenberg identified with avant-garde and kitsch, that a fear of figuration still pervades architecture, despite attempts by Robert Venturi, Denise Scott Brown, Aldo Rossi, and other postmodern architects to expand the field of inquiry to architecture referencing its own representational language of classical orders or pitched roofs that had been coopted by totalitarian regimes. Greenberg's polemic also exposed formalism as elitist, a position against which postwar artists such as Andy War- hol responded by elevating popular culture to high art. More recently, artists such as Kelley and Jeff Koons have pro- duced figurative work that destabilizes the visual fields of their museum contexts.

Highland terrier standing guard in front of Frank Gehry's Guggenheim Bilbao, alludes to the design opportunities offered by architecture's ambiguous state between build- ing and sculpture. Similarly, Claes Oldenburg and Coosje van Bruggen's Binoculars , which form the entrance and confer- ence rooms at Gehry's Chiat/Day building in Los Angeles, and Gehry's own Fish Dance restaurant in Japan fully liber- ate the potential for inhabitable figures that Koons's terrier suggests. The presence of large-scale inhabitable figures has evolved from commercial kitsch such as the Tail-O-the-Pup hotdog stand in Los Angeles or Lucy the Elephant in Mar- gate, New Jersey, to include high-concept architecture such as Gehry's Experience Music Project Museum in Seattle, whose form he reportedly mined from collected images of broken Stratocaster guitars. Figurai destabilization, though, provokes particular apprehension in architecture when a building's representa- tional imagery invites easy nicknaming - such as "gherkin" (Foster + Partners' Swiss Re Tower), "pants" (OMA's CCTV Headquarters), "bird's nest" (Herzog &amp; de Meuron's Bei- jing National Stadium), or "wave" (Foreign Office Archi- tects' Yokohama International Passenger Terminal) - with terms that threaten to trivialize architecture's complexity as pabulum.6 While the caryatids supporting the porte cochere of Berthold Lubetkin's Highpoint II perform as a mote in the eye of modernism and the leg in Luigi Moretti's Casa "Il 6.

Girasole" intrigues as a partial object, buildings whose figura- tion overtly refers to forms and shapes external to their per- formative exigencies threaten architecture's autonomy and therefore stability. Rather than focusing on individual buildings, however, another way to consider the figure-field dynamic in con- temporary architecture is through the lens of context and to argue for object buildings that in fact jump out from, rather than blend into, the existing urban morphology. The danger of the perfect figure-field balance is blandness while the city composed only of object buildings may lack cohesion. Among the many games the Surrealists played in order to tap into the creative unconscious, "Certain Possibilities Relating to the Irrational Embellishment of a City" challenged artists to "con- serve, displace, modify, transform, or suppress certain aspects of a city." Paul Eluard proposed laying Arc de Triomphe on its side as a pissoir and Tristan Tzara suggested conserving the Eiffel Tower but changing its name to "the Glass of Milk."7 The naming and maneuvering of urban icons necessary to play this Surrealist game only is possible in a world of highly iconic architecture that, like the objet trouvÃ©, recontextualizes its surroundings in terms of scale, adjacency, and signification. 7.

In Art and Visual Perception: A Psychology of the Creative Eye (1954), Rudolf Arnheim expanded gestalt (German for "shape form") theory to the arts through the analysis of figure-field dynamics. For Arnheim, writing in Visual Thinking in 1969, "All early imagery relies on the simple distinction between figure and ground: an object, defined and more or less structured, is set off against a separate ground, which is boundless, shapeless, homogeneous, secondary in importance, and often entirely ignored."8 The Rubin Vase, a bi-stable two-dimensional form that fluctuates between the figure of a vase and that of two human profiles, similar to the often-cited image of a rab- bit that also is a duck, illustrates the gestalt principle that the figure-field relationship may be dynamic and exist in a condi- tion of permanent oscillation. The fortuitous parallel between Arnheim' s theories and Giambattista Nolli's 1748 ichno- graphic map of Rome allowed urban theorists, such as Colin Rowe and Fred Koetter in their Collage City (1979), to critique modern architecture for its inability to treat the city as a simi- lar oscillation between figure and field. The conjunction of these two concepts developed figurai architecture in both a planimetrie (Nolli) and an optical (Arnheim) dimension. Rosalind Krauss's rehabilitation of gestalt art theory into an understanding of the optical unconscious explains how modern art eroded the distinction between figure and ground, one that scientific research had established as fundamental to visual perception. While the spatial field or ground was gener- ally perceived to occur behind the figure, high modernist art gave way to a condition in which foreground and background existed as pure synchrony, emphasizing the space of vision as self-reflexive flashes of recognition. As Krauss observes, "The mapping of the retinal field onto the modernist pictorial plane with the positivist expectation that the laws of the one would legislate and underwrite the autonomy of the operations of the other, is typical of the form in which high modernism established and then fetishized an autonomous realm of the visual."9 Given this move toward abstraction and the erasure of representational images from perception, the introduction of figures into fields colors cognition with referential distrac- tions that resist autonomy's thrust toward apperception. These traces of reality, mimetic shards that cut through the space of abstraction, feature highly in MachineHistories's 8.

Partners Steven Joyner and Jason Pilarski explored the digital potential of distorting Greg Turk and Marc Levoy's 1994 Stanford Bunny, a digital model that consists of 69,541 triangles composing a mesh of the scan of a ceramic rabbit. They developed a tool that allowed them to maintain all topo- logical information while distorting the rabbit's form on a series of bas-relief foam panels. They also milled a seven-foot tall, slightly distorted version of this rabbit to act as a norma- tive index against which to compare the more radical distor- tions manifest in the panels. The formal variants range from literal to abstract rabbits as an iterative series that displays the "quantum notion of a single object existing in in several states simultaneously."10 No matter the degree of formal distortion, the mathematical process of glitching that MachineHistories devised remained consistent with the original mesh to the extent that all versions of the white rabbit are topologically exact reproductions. The result is a series of panels that can be read as explorations in figured fields, landscapes in which brief moments of figurai references to the original rab- bit rip the abstract visual field with fragments of represen- tational figures that seem to synthesize Nolli's cartography 10.

This transformation of figure into field exemplifies the degree to which a recognizable image approaches a state of pure abstraction. It also indicates the limits of control a designer can exert on a form as it stretches topologically across a wide spectrum of operations before abandoning resemblance. The degree to which a figure becomes submerged in or emerges from a field also limits its legibility. The perceptual phenomena of emergence , multistability , reification , and invari- ance place a finer point on the primary figure-field relation- ship and offer compelling techniques for suspending figures and fields in a viscous spatial colloid. MachineHistories's rab- bit panels demonstrate the condition of emergence wherein the image of the bunny appears in a flash of recognition from the white panel on which it was milled, like the archetypal picture of a Dalmatian that suddenly emerges from the field of dots that camouflages its presence. To the extent that the recent 76 Log 55</page><page sequence="9">turn toward figurai architecture serves to reintegrate the fig- ure with the field and to recontextualize the ground with con- tours, the oscillating image of the rabbit-duck has eclipsed the stable distinction between duck and decorated shed as a domi- nant paradigm of contemporary architectural production.11 The multistable form in architecture appeared in the recent exhibition "BUST" at Jai &amp; Jai Gallery in Los Angeles, where Florencia Pita and Jackilin Hah Bloom superimposed an 18th-century dandy's wig on the profile of a pitched-roof house to produce an inhabitable "head." Jai &amp; Jai's direc- tors, Jaitip andjomjai Srisomburananont, and guest curator William O'Brien Jr. invited a group of architects to reconsider the anachronism of the architectural facade vis-Ã -vis "fron- tality, proportionality, anthropomorphism, zoomorphism, fig- uration, and symmetry," using the vehicle of a sculptural bust developed at a human scale.12 Pita and Bloom took the shared etymology of face and facade as an opportunity to produce an unstable figure that fluctuates between a periwig's curls and stereotypical domestic architecture. The oscillation between ornament-curls and house-head parallels the gestalt prin- ciple of multistabilly , in which two figures appear simultane- ously within each other. Pita and Bloom also explored figurai architecture in Balloon Frame, their project for the MoMA PS1 Young Architects Program competition in 2014. Here they made vertical silhouettes of shadows cast by the character bal- loons that float above the Macy's Thanksgiving Day Parade. The hanging clusters of stuffed animals that make up Kelley's sculpture Deodorized Central Mass with Satellites (1991/1999), on display at PS1 during the design competition, suggest an evolutionary trajectory to Pita and Bloom's extraction of fig- urai imagery from popular culture for Balloon Frame. The gestalt operation of reification involves identifying illusory contours in a kind of connect-the-dots puzzle wherein the observer cognitively links the endpoints of segmented lines in order to complete the shape of partial objects. Maxi Spina's design of a chess set called In Turn transforms the archetypal figures of Staunton Chess pieces through partial rotations across three axes, modifying them into sectional profiles that create gaps that must be imagined as continuous in order to register the piece's original figure. Greg Lynn's recent work repurposing children's toys into a variety of scales, clusters, and orientations evokes the playful and at times troubling irreverence of Kelley's stuffed-animal mobiles. It relies on the principle of invari- ance - where a singular object retains its figurai status when reproduced at different sizes, orientations, or assemblages - to 11. Gestalt theory defines the term contour as an invisible set of observed lines added to images to make them whole. Contour also has architectural import as the invisible ground lines of building sites and the wire frames of 3-D models. In his writing on Francis Bacon, Gilles Deleuze conceptual- ized contour as an essential transitional component for figurai painting that also has implications for architecture's explora- tion of contaminative pictorial forms. Deleuze writes: "Let us return to Bacon's three pictorial elements: the large fields as a spatializing material structure; the Figure, the Figures and their fact; and the place - that is, the round area, the ring, or the contour, which is the common limit of the Figure and the field."

Little Tikes Classic Whale Teeter Totter and the BIG Shark Kickboard, which form part of the constellation of objects that constitutes the Hammer Museum fountain (2010), convey a sardonic unease when uni- formly painted white and stacked among his blob bricks. Mark Foster Gage's unsubmitted proposal for the Helsinki Guggenheim competition similarly draws from readymade sources, here 3-D models of cameras, dinosaurs, Mickey Mouses, and more to produce a compositional technique that merges a collection of artifacts to make hybrid volumetric figures fill a symmetrical rectilinear volume.1* An example of "kitbashing" - the extraction of components from existing models to be reas- sembled in unconventional and innovative ways - Gage's project can be seen as grouping symbolic objects in a syntactic assem- blage that extracts almost all semantic content from the objects themselves. The project's lack of critical or contextual engage- ment approaches the figurai work of Koons, which purports to be entirely devoid of hidden meaning or cultural critique. But is such semantic emptiness really possible when work- ing with figures? Consider Gage's Helsinki Guggenheim in the trajectory of figuration's more frightening dimension of mon- strosity. If the grotesque is understood to be the unseemly amal- gam of disparate objects and anatomies to produce monstrous bodies, then his museum project displays an edifice encrusted with fragments of the human anatomy, toys, animals, and more in a formal amalgamation that begins to suggest architectural orifices and fleshy surfaces onto which have been attached the abandoned detritus of popular culture - from balloon puppies to women's breasts. The threat such grotesqueries pose to the kitsch figuration favored by the right wing can be seen presaged in the work of Hans Bellmer, who approached the human form through an avant-garde lens, dismembering and reassembling life-sized dolls into nonstandard agglomerations of buttocks, il. Gage identifies a move away from architecture responding to field conditions: "Architects' interest today in the philosophy of object-oriented ontology and its umbrella philosophy, speculative realism , is growing out of a frustration that architecture is increasingly justified solely by its relations and not by its own particular autonomous qualities."

Held up to ridicule at the aforementioned '9V degenerate art exhibition, these dolls demonstrate that it is not so much the concept of figuration itself that aligns with the right wing as it is the appropriate alignment of body parts. Any challenge to the officially sponsored image of the "natural order" such as the grotesque poses, carries at least an implicit critique of the normative modes of combinatory arrangements. Bunnies, wigs, parade floats, children's toys, chess pieces, dinosaurs, Mickey Mouses, anchors, and balloon animals - or gherkins, binoculars, and pants - transform architec- ture's fear of figuration into provocations that recalibrate the Greenbergian equations of high and low with avant-garde and kitsch, into probative compositional elements wherein avant-garde is kitsch. Recent explorations in figurative archi- tecture exploit the potential for visually coherent images of nonarchitectural forms to disrupt architecture's abstract field through a series of operations that subordinate content to process. As architects toy with introducing semantic content into abstraction, shredding optical fields with holistic objects and disturbing autonomy with external references, they haz- ard to inflate the field's disciplinary boundaries. To engage figuration, then, while resisting its inexorable drive toward representation and criticality, is to risk altering form with architecture's most significant other. Rather than unintended political affiliations or inadvertent semantic content, it seems that architecture's most compelling reason to fear figures might concern the nihilistic potential of jumping the repre- sentational shark from buildings to cartoons, from a-signifi- cation to insignificance.
