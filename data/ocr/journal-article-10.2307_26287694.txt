<plain_text><page sequence="1">DISCRETIONARY SUBJECTS: DECISION AND PARTICIPATION in william Gibson's fiction JanineTobeck We are not stuff that abides, but patterns that perpetuate themselves. —Norbert Wiener, The Human Use of Human Beings The etymological root of "crisis" is Greek, from krinein: to decide. In the conventional crisis/resolution plot, it is toward resolution that the appearance of decision gravitates; there is a rush to judgment. In an essay called "Creative Reading," William S. Burroughs breaks down this type of narrative into three easy steps: "Menace poses challenge. Man meets challenge. Menace is removed by protagonist" (37). Though seeming to affirm an idea of character predicated on agency, this model presents the human as a continuous being threatened by external forces and construes the actual, discrete moment of deciding as an equally potent danger that must be quickly elided. Burroughs's title and formula raise a moral concern: is reading "protagonist" interchangeably for "man" a damnably "creative" act, producing a too tidy semblance of agency? Flannery O'Connor would lament the postwar public's demand that fiction help "heal the ravages of our times" by "transporting]" the reader "instantly, either to a mock damnation or a mock innocence" (820) because it makes efficiency in judgment the absolute measure of the judgment's moral value (819).

DISCRETIONARY SUBJECTS: DECISION AND PARTICIPATION in william Gibson's fiction Janine Tobeck</page><page sequence="2">Tobeck 379 reliable structure for narrative, is there still value in the traditional protagonist that models decisiveness for us or in privileging the decision as a core of ethicality at all? Between his short story "Johnny Mnemonic" and his novel Pattern Recognition, William Gibson shifts the weight from deci sion to a model of participation as the marker of ethical agency in a literary subject, testing whether character can be successfully reimagined and re-empowered without having to abandon the popular plot-driven narrative form. Although the title and plot of "Johnny Mnemonic" present its protagonist as an acting subject, he is in fact incapable of making decisions. The story thus illus trates the potential lie of agency perpetrated in progressive nar rative forms: when the having-been-made of a decision carries the weight of the moral, the complexity of making a decision is deemphasized, often to preserve or create an empty appearance of continuous and rational subjectivity. In Pattern Recognition, lit erary character as such a controlled narrative device gives way to agentive literary subjects that merely happen to enjoy controlled narrative. The ethical action is understood to be conducted not, as is typical of decision-based moral systems, in the space of a rupture between the particular and universal, but between versions of the self. Here, the ethical is differently located, in—as Michel Foucault suggests—"its circumstantial integration and by virtue of the place it occupies in a pattern of conduct" (28). In Pattern Recognition, Gibson begins to explore the implications of this conceptual shift not only for individual ethics, but also for the shifting politics of globalization and for the potential role of the novel in helping to negotiate these transitions. Critics largely agree that the subject in Gibson's fiction is a romantic one.1 Indeed, many of his characters share a desire to overcome the flesh, especially through unification with the transcen dent nature of cyberspace. But he also ironizes the narratives and technologies through which they do so, as the artificial intelligences created in his stories are often unintentionally programmed with a mirroring tragic flaw: the desire to attain personality. This is true in the Neuromancer trilogy, and more compactly so in an episode of the X-Files that Gibson co-wrote, called "Kill Switch." In it agents Scully and Mulder try to stop an evolving program set loose on the Internet from its murderous attempts at self-realization, while its creators are simultaneously trying to ditch their bodies and upload their minds to the Web. Gibson's romantic notions of subjectivity converge with his favorite tech obsessions most blatantly, however, in The Difference Engine, which he coauthored with Sterling. The novel is an alternate</page><page sequence="3">380 Discretionary Subjects history of industrial England based on the premise that Charles Babbage's analytical engine—a precursor to modern computers conceptualized in 1822—was actually built. The machine is used to gather copious amounts of information on citizens, and the novel ends on its coming to self-consciousness. Helping it achieve self consciousness is the particular obsession of Lady Ada Byron. Her character believes that a program called the "Modus" is the key to solving this problem. As she explains: If we envision the entire System of Mathematics as a great Engine for proving theorems, then we must say, through the agency of the Modus, that such an Engine lives, and could indeed prove its own life, should it de velop the capacity to look upon itself. The Lens for such a self-examination is of a nature not yet known to us; yet we know that it exists, for we ourselves possess it. (421-22) Gibson's work is romantic in the sense that it posits as character istic the postindustrial subject's driving empiricist desire for self comprehension, which is often projected outward, as here when the Engine is expected to develop the capacity for self-examination that humans have but do not understand. In our desire to under stand the self, he suggests, we are driven to create narratives and technologies "through the agency of" something else so that we can observe comprehension in action. I contend that Gibson's work is not primarily about how technology affects subjectivity, but about how concerns about subjectivity decide technology, and how the same impulses that drive the forms technology drive the creation of narratives. "Johnny Mnemonic" addresses the ironically flawed arti ficial intelligence, ironizing our distanced self-examination through narrative, while Pattern Recognition attempts to turn a more cor rective "Lens for such a self-examination" on ourselves. johnny Mnemonic:The Engine That Couldn't "Johnny Mnemonic" demonstrates how a decision-based narrative—by which I mean a story whose elements are plotted to create the appearance of a naturally occurring resolution—can disguise a reactive concept of decision and present it as intention. On its face a standard crisis/resolution story, "Johnny Mnemonic" examines a character who is initially hunted for information he is hired to carry in a data storage space implanted in his head but who ends up, with others' help, "figuring out" how to profit from</page><page sequence="4">Tobeck 381 that information more directly (22). But what appears to be a straightforward Johnny-makes-good plot is undermined in part be cause the information that drives the story is information to which Johnny has no conscious access, and even though the story's end promises an imminent resolution to this problem, the information is never actually converted into knowledge. A more cautious reading reveals that, although Johnny appears to be a menace-removing protagonist, he is more accurately a market object whose survival depends on the actions of other characters. If we believe Johnny's account of himself without noting this discrepancy, we expose only our desire to find in the narrative a continuous and deciding moral subject that is not really there. In an interview about its film version, Gibson described "Johnny Mnemonic" as a story that should satisfy even the most demanding of O'Connor's readers: "We want to see him get the information for himself, escape, turn the tables on the bad guys. But in the end he does something else, and manages to become a human being in the process" (Van Bakel). Curiously, though, Gibson also speaks of the story (and/or its audience) as if it had deprived him of authorial agency: that whole business of narrative—I'm always uncomfort able with that. I wish I didn't have to do that. I'd like to be able to write books that don't need verbs. . . . The ongoing descriptions of things is where the pleasure is in writing. But there's always the editor in the back of my head saying, Now wait a minute, these people have to be doing something and going somewhere. (Van Bakel) Whether or not Gibson believed that his compromise for narra tive's sake was ultimately heroic, the story itself never arrives at that conclusion. My analysis of Johnny's unredeemed (and unredeeming) subjectivity hinges on the fact that he says "I decided" (1,16, 21). Because Johnny is only a subject in the bounds of the story and because his "I" refers to a consciousness housed in a brain that shares space with a technological implant, the story invites us to consider this signal of agency as a point where narrative and tech nological contexts meet. To better understand Johnny, then, I would like to turn briefly to the work of British mathematician Alan Turing, who greatly influenced the trajectory of this conflation in Gibson's work and in the postwar era at large. Turing is useful here for how he defines technological subjectivity (or artificial intelligence) via analogy to a machine that can fool a human being through the exercise of conversation. Even more revealing, however, is how his</page><page sequence="5">382 Discretionary Subjects use of the mathematical terminology of the decision compounds its existing narrative and philosophical senses (as a determined structure of plot and as a concept of will), making an elusive idea of subjective agency even harder to grasp.2 Consider Turing's use of literary analogy to describe the state of research in 1951 on "programming a machine to think": "There are plentiful ideas, but we do not yet know which of them are of importance. As in the detective stories, at the beginning of the investigation any trifle may be of importance to the investigator. When the problem has been solved, only the essential facts need to be told to the jury. But at present we have nothing worth putting before a jury" ("Can Digital" 6). Compare Peter Brooks's description of plot as "the design and intention of narrative, what shapes a story and gives it a certain direction or intent of meaning. We might think of plot as the logic or perhaps the syntax of a certain kind of discourse, one that develops its propositions only through temporal sequence and progression" (xi). (Perhaps we could call plot a way of programming a reader to think?) My invocation of Brooks here may seem unjust, as, in context, the terms "logic," "syntax," and "sequence" have nothing to do with computers. However, I choose it for the dual purposes of demonstrating an interdisciplinary im brication of terms and structures and of introducing a situation in which differences between intention, which receives the emphasis in Brooks's statement, and selection or responsiveness (as highlighted in Turing's account), disappear beneath a shared (and prevalent) idea about how narratives convey meaning. Turing appears in Gibson's Neuromancer as the namesake of the police force (the Turing Registry) that arrests the main character for "conspiracy to augment an artificial intelligence" (154). Among the ironies of this association, Tyler Stevens identifies "an offensive [one] of using Alan Turing's name to mark those who guarantee a queer-free cyberspace and the maintenance of normative subjec tivity" (422). I might agree, except insofar as Turing's texts, which are very much about how possible it is to fake the appearance of humanity in and by means of narrative, do on some level per petuate a conventional concept of subjectivity. This entails reading Turing's work as conventional narrative that produces a character that provides an unreliable semblance of agency. By tracing the trajectory of the concept of decision from Turing's 1936 paper on the "Entscheidungsproblem" (or decidability problem) to his more famous 1950 paper, "Computing Machinery and Intelligence," I show that this reading is not so far out of line.</page><page sequence="6">Tobeck 383 Turing wrote the 1936 paper in response to Hilbert's de cidability problem—"the problem to find an effective method by which, given any expression Q in the notation of the system, it can be determined whether or not Q is provable in the system" (Church 41).3 The 1950 paper is a philosophical outgrowth of the mathematical theory of 1936, and the decision in different senses becomes central. The initial paper took on Hilbert's challenge to find a decision procedure that would be context- and interpretation free, to remove from the systematical exercise of mathematical logic any dependence on the physical world. Turing hypothesizes this method in terms of what is now called the algorithm: a finite, step-by-step performance of discretely delineated states or opera tions that are, as he says, purely mechanical. He uses the analogy of a computer—that is, a human being performing rule-of-thumb operations without thinking about them—but he expands it into the concept of a logical computing machine (now commonly referred to as the Turing machine) in order to ensure consistent application of the operations. Suggestively, then, the Turing machine, which leads into the later theory of artificial intelligence, is introduced as a control for interpretive variance. Control over interpretation dominates both the substance and structure of Turing's argument for the possibility of artificial intelligence. In the 1950 paper, Turing's hypothetical "thinking machine" earns its identity by convincing a human observer to decide that it, too, is human. The paper opens with analysis of the question, "Can machines think?" In order to prevent the "normal use" of the words "machine" and "think" from encouraging the "absurd" idea that the answer could be found through "a statisti cal survey such as the Gallup poll," Turing proposes a "relatively unambiguous" reformulation of the question "in terms of a game" ("Computing Machinery" 433). The "imitation game" he outlines runs like this: a man (A) and a woman (B) are separated from an "interrogator" (C), who tries to determine the gender of each player by asking them questions about, for example, the length of their hair, and examining their (typewritten) responses. The man, it is supposed, will try to get the interrogator to make "the wrong identification" by giving ambiguous replies, while the woman will "help" the interrogator by being truthful.4 The interrogator must decide which is which, either on the evidence of the conversation or—if player A can dissemble well enough to prevent an informed decision—by guessing after the time limit is reached. Turing then proposes that the question "can machines think" be replaced by this: if a machine plays the part of A in the imitation game, "Will the interrogator decide wrongly as often when the game is played</page><page sequence="7">384 Discretionary Subjects like this as he does when the game is played between a man and a woman?" (434). Although it is generally assumed that the machine that is supposed to play the imitation game is modeled on the Turing ma chine of 1936, the Turing machine's proper analogue in the game is actually the interrogator. The game focuses less on the manipula tive player's ability to create good responses than on limiting the interrogator's decision-making power by mitigating the effects of context (like voice or the appearance of handwriting). The ma chine that could win is one that could either trick the interrogator into making the wrong decision, or keep the game going until the time limit forces a decision not based on procedure. What Turing's theory comes down to, then, is this: having proved the existence of the undecidable by positing the limitations of a Turing machine, he hypothesizes that a machine could expose limitations in the decision-making capacity of an interrogator, if the interrogator is limited to Turing machine-like functions. A Turing machine is less an entity than a manipulation of human perception. Turing uses his narrative game as a productive prison, because although "one cannot expect to be able to mimic the behaviour of the nervous system with a discrete-state system ... if we adhere to the conditions of the imitation game, the interrogator will not be able to take any advantage of this difference" (451). On the surface, then, there is no great difference between the anthropomorphs that emerge from Turing's game and from plot-driven fiction, at least if we consider—with Brooks again—that "we constitute ourselves in part through our fictions within the constraints of a transindividual symbolic order" (xiv). Turing's thinking machine and the character in a progressive narrative are each as human as the other, so long as a reader believes it (or fails not to). But if moral character depends on some concept of free will, then these semblances of the human are bad role models: it is not by their decisions, but by the reader's mistake, that they become subjects. Brooks calls plot a path of intention, and in his description gives it agency to shape not only narratives, but, "by extension, lives" (xii). In Turing, the "life" that emerges from language is another product of careful ordering, an appearance in text of something that never need come into actual presence. Story decides subject. It would be an overstatement to suggest that these subjects have no instructional value; however, what potential they may have is lost when we look for a "moral" that they cannot offer and find it there anyway. In a 1951 radio broadcast, Turing sounds very like Gibson and Sterling's Ada Byron: "The whole thinking process is still rather mysterious now, but I believe that the attempt to</page><page sequence="8">Tobeck 385 make a thinking machine will help us greatly in finding out how we think ourselves" ("Can Digital" 8). In fact, most efforts to create Turing's thinking machines have focused less on the mysteries of human thinking than on building on what little is already under stood. Those who believe that a computer with enough memory could be given a threshold level of syntactical rules and common knowledge, after which it could start generating its own thoughts, have found, as an unexpected but commonsensical consequence, that the more information a computer has, the more information it must consult to find an appropriate algorithmic procedure. Daniel Dennett has called this the "frame problem" (181), as there is no known way to ensure that a discrete-state machine will decide how to act within the time frame of normal human behavior. So, isolat ing the selective decision procedure leaves the intentional kind of decision unexplained. On the "age old controversy ... of 'free will and determinism,"' Turing comments: It may be that the feeling of free will which we all have is an illusion. Or it may be that we really have got free will, but that there is no way of telling from our behav iour that this is so. ... I do not know how we can ever decide between these alternatives but whichever is the correct one it is certain that a machine which is to imi tate a brain must appear to behave as if it had free will. ("Can Digital" 5) His answer to these maddening undecidables is to fit the machine's program with a "random element" to help mimic human unpredict ability. Unfortunately, this is perhaps the most definitive approxima tion of willful thought progressive logic can muster. The story of Johnny Mnemonic never brings us a true resolu tion because Johnny is basically a Turing machine that could win the imitation game, a too-hollow victory from which to draw a moral. Johnny seems human enough, as an embodied character who nar rates his own story. He even signals his agency by four times claim ing that he decided (or will decide) something, but the driving plot of the story exposes his limited decision-making capacity at every major turn. Only his third decision, about where he will live, could be considered agentive, leaving his fourth, projected one ("one day I'll have a surgeon dig all the silicon out of my amygdalae, and I'll live with my own memories and nobody else's, the way other people do"), only questionably possible (22). The narrative "I" is in fact a discrete-state mechanism incapable of discretion, which makes the progressive plot a vehicle for perpetrating a fraud of anthropomorphism. While other Gibson characters may seek tran</page><page sequence="9">386 Discretionary Subjects scendence through technology, Johnny's is a quest for mortality, a dream of humanness based on the ability to decide. Gibson has described the story as an "action-chase piece" ("William Gibson"), and we can easily read it this way. Johnny makes a living by carrying stolen data "stashed in [his] head on an idiot/ savant basis" (2). The story transpires because a fence, Ralfi Face, figures out that the goods he'd hired Johnny to store belong to the Yakuza crime organization, so to save himself he puts out a contract on Johnny. Johnny confronts Ralfi but is disabled by his henchman until the meeting is broken up by Molly Millions. As they leave the scene, Ralfi is assassinated by a Yakuza stalker, but Molly helps Johnny escape. She takes him to Jones, a junkie cyborg dolphin who decodes Ralfi's password, allowing Johnny access to the stored program. She then brings him to the "Pit" above Nighttown, an early formulation of Gibson's favorite interstitial zones, cut off from the "information economy" (16) by the resistance of a group of people called Lo Teks. The Yakuza stalker manages to trail them there, but Molly defeats him in a face-off. Johnny then tells us that he chose to stay in Nighttown, and now works with Molly and Jones, lifting traces of old programs from his memory bank. This same bank is what he plans, eventually, to have surgically removed so that he can live "the way other people do" (22).5 From its opening, though, the story introduces problems of subject identification ranging from personal to categorical. As in much of Gibson's work, bodies are more style than substance, compositions of implants and transplants as changeable as clothing. Johnny, who changes his own appearance as his career demands it, frequently suffers a great deal of anxiety about not being able to count on other things being as they seem, which indicates that he would be more comfortable in a rule-based system of referentiality. Beyond the difficulties of identifying any particular person, Johnny seems particularly troubled when he cannot clearly discern human ness at all. In the crowd that mills about are figures "so lost under superstructures of muscle graft that their outlines weren't really human" (2), and the bouncers at the bar are called the Magnetic Dog Sisters: and I didn't relish trying to get out past them if things didn't work out. They were two meters tall and thin as greyhounds. One was black and the other white, but aside from that they were as nearly identical as cosmetic surgery could make them. They'd been lovers for years and were bad news in a tussle. I was never quite sure which one had originally been male. (2)</page><page sequence="10">Tobeck 387 The sisters trouble Johnny in seemingly equal parts due to their impressive force and their categorical volatility.6 Ralfi Face, on the other hand, has kept an appearance long enough to provide a reliable reference for Johnny: "I guess he'd always been Ralfi Something or Other, but he owed his acquired surname to a singu lar vanity. . . . he'd worn the once-famous face of Christian White for twenty years—Christian White of the Aryan Reggae Band" (3). Interestingly, this single stable reference is later revealed as the "key" to Johnny's data, so a reasonable guess could have saved him a great deal of trouble. Given that the story opens with an act of only circumstantial self-definition, we should also doubt who or what Johnny is. "I put the shotgun in an Adidas bag and padded it out with four pairs of tennis socks," Johnny narrates, "not my style at all, but that was what I was aiming for: If they think you're crude, go technical; if they think you're technical, go crude. I'm a very technical boy. So I decided to get as crude as possible." We have, then, a narra tor who is willing to assume characteristics designed to limit the identificatory powers of an observer. He is "your basic sharp-faced Caucasoid," but only by a disguise surgically manufactured for his attempt to get close to Ralfi without being recognized. Furthermore, this is just one of a number of apparently habitual alterations, as indicated by the familiarity he has with a certain body shop: "The girls at Under the Knife were big on Sony Mao, and it was getting harder to keep them from adding the chic suggestion of epican thic folds" (1). What Johnny says about Jones resonates with how we might think about Johnny: "He was more than a dolphin, but from another dolphin's point of view he might have seemed like something less" (10). Johnny is less human than machine, the only character in the story whose name seems more tied to his function than a chosen self-image, because, as he explains it, "that was the nature of my game, because I'd spent most of my life as a blind receptacle to be filled with other people's knowledge and then drained, spouting synthetic languages I'd never understand" (18). Of the identifiers Johnny applies to himself before the turn into the present at the end of the story, only "I'm a very technical boy" and "I'm a whiz at trivia" (3) occur in the present tense, indicating that these are his only essential traits, while the last words of the story, "I'm getting to be the most technical boy in town" (22) carry this stability into the future. The first two of Johnny's "decisions" are such in the algo rithmic sense, requiring no more than discrete-state functioning. As in the first example, ("I decided to get as crude as possible"), the second is characterized by reference to past experience and</page><page sequence="11">388 Discretionary Subjects induction from prior results. As a Lo Tek lights a cigarette, Johnny observes, "Yiheyuan filters. Beijing Cigarette Factory. I decided that the Lo Teks were black marketeers" (16). In fact, Johnny is a walking frame problem, disabled by excessive data-checking. If "Johnny Mnemonic" is a progressive story, it is Molly who drives the actual events forward while Johnny spends most of his time trying to "figure out" the events, which are moving too fast for him to process. Despite the preparations Johnny makes to get close to Ralfi, for example, he is immediately identified and disabled by the henchman, locked in a state of tunnel vision that goes beyond the physical. When Molly interrupts with the razorblades implanted under her nails, his "thought" process proceeds from observation to question to observation, producing no narratively relevant material: Bright blood sprayed the table. He was clutching his wrist white-knuckle tight, blood trickling from between his fingers. But hadn't her hand been empty? He was going to need a tendon stapler. He stood up carefully, without bothering to push his chair back. The chair toppled backward, and he stepped out of my line of sight without a word. "He better get a medic to look at that," she said. "That's a nasty cut." (5) While Johnny is missing crucial details and belaboring unimportant others, such as the motion of the chair, Molly makes the cut, both literally and in the plot. On their way out of the bar, Johnny's focus is again not on what Turing might call the "essential facts" of the story ("Can Digital" 6), and again his reaction is too slow: I glanced up, out of some passing reflex, maybe because I've never got used to it, to the soaring arcs of light and the shadows of the geodesies above them. Maybe that saved me. Ralfi kept walking, but I don't think he was trying to escape. I think he'd already given up. Probably he already had an idea of what we were up against. I looked back down in time to see him explode. Playback on full recall shows Ralfi stepping forward as the little tech sidles out of nowhere, smiling. Just a suggestion of a bow, and his left thumb falls off. It's a conjuring trick. The thumb hangs suspended. Mirrors? Wires? And Ralfi stops, his back to us, dark crescents</page><page sequence="12">Tobeck 389 of sweat under the armpits of his pale summer suit. He knows. He must have known. Description of the assassination proceeds for another ten lines before Johnny finally says, "I brought the gym bag up, and my hand convulsed" (7). The scene spreads in time, through Johnny's immediate reactions, through his later reflections, through an inexplicable "full recall," and into the (past) present thoughts of Ralfi. The narrative bears out in content and form the falseness of Johnny's ownership of the story. It is Molly who brings Johnny to Jones, Molly who smuggles him into Nighttown, and Molly who eliminates the stalker. It's no surprise when Johnny tells us that "transition to idiot/savant mode is always less abrupt than I expect it to be" (13). In his most conscious moment, Johnny only becomes aware of his lack of consciousness. He explains his state of mind as the final showdown begins: "it came to me that I had no idea at all of what was really happening, or of what was supposed to happen" (18). Then we witness Johnny's worst case of running through algorithms in a stasis of indecision: He was there, at the edge of the light, taking in the Kill ing Floor and the gallery of silent Lo Teks with a tour ist's calm. And as our eyes met for the first time with mutual recognition, a memory clicked into place for me, of Paris, and the long Mercedes electrics gliding through the rain to Notre Dame; mobile greenhouses, Japanese faces behind the glass, and a hundred Nikons rising in blind phototropism, flowers of steel and crystal. Behind his eyes, as they found me, those same shutters whir ring. (18-19) Meeting the eyes of his would-be killer, in a moment demanding at least an instinctual act of self-preservation, a memory sequence begins. Although a middle point (the Japanese tourists) registers with his earlier impression of the killer as a tourist, he misses the chance to return to the moment and spins on. Instead of decision, Johnny comes to a memory of a cognate of decision, in the time slashing mechanism of the camera shutter. And even that is superior to Johnny, since its action is phototropic. While Johnny remains stuck in his memory search, Molly "hit the Floor, moving" (19). That Johnny is sequential, and Molly continuous in ways that determine events over which Johnny has no control, leaves us in a peculiar position of doubt over the narrative we receive. On the one hand, as it is told in past tense, it is located in Johnny's memory,</page><page sequence="13">390 Discretionary Subjects and therefore we might be able to trust his presentation in "full recall." On the other, things are happening in the time of the story that Johnny, even afterward, cannot "figure out," including Molly's motivations and motions. So, while Gibson manages to demonstrate a problem with Turing's thinking machine, he leaves open this other possibility of agency by letting it roam unexplained and inexplicable inside the bounds of Johnny's progressive text. Pattern Recognition and Participation Mystique In his interview about the movie "Johnny Mnemonic," Gib son portrays himself as a passive and reluctant respondent to the demands of narrative, but he later characterizes himself as a kind of authorial Maxwell's demon, sorting "huge shallow reaches" of information for "nodal points," creating narrative that's "emergent" rather than progressive ("Clive Barker"). This vision of authorial selection allies with an altered sense of development—away from "uniformitarianism" and toward accommodating "catastrophism," to introduce the main intellectual conflict of The Difference Engine. Roughly speaking, this is the same debate that such postwar sci ence theorists as Thomas Kuhn and Norbert Wiener waged against believers in straight-line progress. In a sense, Gibson replaces re cursive sorting with inductive sorting; that is, he sees his writing as being less about projecting the logical conclusions of causal chains deduced and more an ability to hunt cool—as he calls the job of Pattern Recognition's protagonist—sensing what within the "huge shallow reaches" of information will catch on and what won't. But because the compulsion to comprehend still dominates our creative thought, Gibson is also concerned about the degen erative effects of over-sorting on the potential for agency: "One [thing] that I've noticed ... is that because of the Internet . . . in effect, the world's attic is being sorted. It's being sorted with a speed and precision that would have been impossible ten or fifteen years ago. The whole concept of rarities and random finds is disappearing very, very quickly. . . . And there's something . . . horribly sad about that" ("Clive Barker"). What's sad about it, says Gibson, is that we will lose both "the magic of the search" and "our capacity for hunting and gathering." In his science fiction, the threat of technology is rarely—even in The Difference Engine—that machines will someday comprehend themselves and then turn on us. Rather, it is that we use them to comprehend ourselves, with often devastating consequences to our very capacity to learn. In Gibson's analogy, the apparent impulse behind sorting the "world's</page><page sequence="14">Tobeck 391 attic" would be to develop a comprehensive set of human artifacts, presumably for the sake of learning about our history, and through that, ourselves. As in Turing's plan to use intelligent machines to study how the human brain works, the belief is that our products hold the key to our self-understanding. The Internet brings the analogy to stories, as these artifacts become information added to a rapidly expanding compendium—one that gives the sense that all that can be known by or about us will eventually be found there. But because these technological proxies are self-images created in a state of incomplete knowledge, trusting what they reflect breeds a destructive kind of self-misunderstanding. While it "seems as though man everywhere and always en counters only himself," Heidegger warns that "precisely nowhere" do we any longer encounter our "essence" (27). Heidegger's defini tion of Enframing through technology is useful for understanding Gibson's problem with "sorting," as Heidegger describes it as a form of "gathering together" (24) and an "ordering" that "drives out every other possibility of revealing" including that which, "in the sense of poiesis, lets what presences come forth into appear ance" (27). By habit—and our success at doing it—we've begun to mistake "ordering" for the only true form of revealing; by seeing ourselves only as producers and products—of history, of technol ogy, of information—we fail to see ourselves as "the one[s] spoken to" (27). In Gibson's attic analogy, we are becoming so successful at sorting that we will forget what a fundamental activity sorting, itself, is. Our capacity to deal with "rarities and random finds," of that which does not fit into the increasingly narrated human and narrated world picture will grow weak with disuse, while the rari ties and randoms themselves do not disappear. Our sense of com prehension is a delusion, and the material danger of this delusion is figured in Gibson's work as the mercenary Molly Millions. Like Johnny Mnemonic, Neuromancer's Case also fails to predict or ac count for her appearance, and, like Johnny, finds himself suddenly at her mercy just as he was applauding himself for foreseeing and averting an intricate plot against him. Heretofore completely ex ternal to his surroundings, Molly introduces a story into which Case fits just as naturally as he did in his own, but he was dangerously unprepared for its possibility. As Molly herself puts it, "'I think you screwed up, Case. I showed up and you just fit me right into your reality picture'" (Neuromancer 25). "Emergence"—the term Gibson uses to describe his own au thorial focus—also drives more recent artificial intelligence or, more accurately, artificial life research. This trend is characterized by a greater emphasis on probabilism as a model of development and</page><page sequence="15">392 Discretionary Subjects by a reinfusion of the biological and social into its materials. The new focus on context, patterns, and morphogenesis still involves sorting through what's empirically found, but there is a shift from analytical to synthetic approaches to explanation. In Technoroman ticism, Richard Coyne is critical of the "Utopian" unity narrative of information technology (12), and leery of Gibson as one of its pop icons, suggesting that the syntheticism of new artificial life theory is really, like Gibson's fiction, a holdout of romantic holism pitted against fragmenting rationalism and empiricism.7 I would argue that Gibson's romanticism is closer in kind to O'Connor's, both derived from Hawthorne's romance in an attempt to "keep for fic tion some of its freedom from social determinisms and to steer it in the direction of poetry" (O'Connor 818). Gibson responds with violence to narrative and, like O'Connor, uses narrative as vio lence. On the question of narrative unity, he explains, "I have the sense of something that's been shattered and we're left with the shards of the Miltonian universe," but rather than put them back together or rebuild Adam and Eve in their Edenic perfection, his "strategy was to . . . impact them into tiny explosive containers" ("Clive Barker"). Two explosions ground the story of Pattern Recognition, Gib son's first novel set in the present: the (actual) attack on the World Trade Center and a (fictional) bomb planted in a tree in Russia that wounds twin girls named Stella and Nora and kills their parents. Neither event is made central to the novel's plot, nor do they de termine it in any particular way, but they do create the conditions of the present in which Gibson's protagonist, Cayce Pollard, oper ates. Many of her behaviors appear to be ways of coping with or repressing the fact that her father disappeared on September 11. And she is a "footagehead" (23), a member of the virtual commu nity F:F:F (or "Fetish: Footage: Forum") (3), devoted to discussion of video fragments of unknown origin that appear on the Web that turn out to be created by one of the wounded twins as a method of recuperative therapy. So the two explosions influence nearly everything Cayce does, but the story's focus is on how she deals with that influence rather than how she is determined by it. In this novel history is catastrophic, and yet the narrative is plot-driven, progressive. This seeming contradiction is not unusual for Gibson, who has never produced particularly surprising experiments in form, but in Pattern Recognition, the contest is meaningful. The novel replaces deterministic time with the market, a transition represented by Hubertus Bigend, head of the Blue Ant advertising firm, "whose premises until recently were those of an older, more linear sort of agency" (9). Obviously, agency here</page><page sequence="16">Tobeck 393 refers to the company, but as Blue Ant "has from the beginning billed itself as a high-speed, low-drag life form in an advertising ecology of lumbering herbivores" (6), advertising serves a bigger than-business function in the novel. It provides the predominant social backdrop, and it covers ail possible privileged universal posi tions: here it is figured as a natural ecology, elsewhere it is nature harnessed by science—in the "reactor-cores of fashion" (8)—and even a religion practiced by "The Children's Crusade" of shoppers that descends on Camden Town every Saturday (37). Bigend's view of historical development accommodates the catastrophism imposed by the events of September 11: In a sense, we have no future. Not in the sense that our grandparents had a future, or thought they did. Fully imagined cultural futures were the luxury of another day, one in which "now" was of some greater duration. For us, of course, things can change so abruptly, so violently, so profoundly, that futures like our grandparents' have insufficient "now" to stand on. We have no future because our present is too volatile. (57) Of the past, Bigend believes only that "'History is a best-guess narrative about what happened and when'" (57). Bigend's break from linearity suggests changes in more than office space. Although determinism is to some extent defused, and there is no posturing over decisions in the novel—none involve anything more meaningful than whether to stay at a hotel or where to go for coffee—it's now nearly impossible to find an example of character agency that is not somehow underwritten by this new all-encompassing corporate agency. The novel's main quest, Cayce's search for the origins of the footage, is underwritten by Bigend, who seeks to alter the face of advertising by analyzing the "single most effective piece of guerilla marketing ever" (64), to get exclusive control over the footage "subculture" (65). He hires Cayce because he knows she is an interested party: he's been monitoring the forum, and her username is the real-self-identical "CayceP"—a name with which he's already familiar thanks to her marketing career success. Of course, she is not his only iron in the fire, with the implication being that whoever discovers the footage's provenance, it will eventually fall within his purview. Beyond the question of whether there is any agency outside the agency's, there is the question of whether there actually is an outside. The footage plays the role of the post horn in Pynchon's The Crying of Lot 49, and footageheads "propagate primarily by word of mouth, or, as with Cayce, by virtue of random exposure,</page><page sequence="17">394 Discretionary Subjects either to a fragment of video or to a single still frame" (53). This contagion model of community formation is no different than the "viral" model of advertising (85), in which, for instance, one of Bigend's employees goes out to clubs and drops names in the midst of conversations to spread interest. The forum has an opt-in structure and an aversion to going too public. Inside, the fights look the same, for instance, as they do in old arguments about religion. The primary battle is between "Progressives," who believe that the footage "consists of a work in progress, something unfinished and still being generated by its maker," and the Completists, "a relative but articulate minority" (46) who are "convinced that the footage is comprised of snippets from a finished work, one whose maker chooses to expose it piecemeal and in nonsequential order" (46-47). As Jameson says, "The problem, for the group forming around this artifact, as indeed for all group formation, is that of the contradiction between universality—in this case the universality of taste as such—and the particularity of this unique value that sets us off from all the others and defines us in our collective specific ity" (111). Forum members are intolerant of jargon, simplicity, and newcomers. And, of course, the whole thing is already under surveillance by the Bigends of the world. Cayce is Pattern Recognition's Oedipa Maas, set on her quest with a Blue Ant expense account. Her decision to accept the job is not forced, but she's fully conscious of its non-freedom. She has modeled her self-understanding on her father's example rather than her mother's: he was a Cold War security expert, she a conspiracy theorist. While her mother is studying Electronic Voice Phenomena to hear her father's voice from beyond the grave, Cayce is remem bering what he said in life, and reminds herself of it throughout her quest. When she, like Oedipa, starts experiencing "apophenia," or "the spontaneous perception of connections and meaningfulness in unrelated things" (115), she reminds herself of her father's stance on paranoia: "Like someone who'd learned how best to cope with chronic illness, he never allowed himself to think of his paranoia as an aspect of self. It was there, constantly and intimately, and he relied on it professionally, but he wouldn't allow it to spread, become jungle. He cultivated it on its own special plot, and checked it daily for news it might bring: hunches, lateralisms, frank anomalies." For Win Pollard, paranoia, or thinking of the self "as the center, the focal point of something [one] doesn't, can't, understand" doesn't minimize the self. "Paranoia, he said, was fundamentally egocentric, and every conspiracy theory served in some way to aggrandize the believer." For Cayce, staying focused on the fact that she is "only a part of something larger" is self-grounding (124). She does not miss</page><page sequence="18">Tobeck 395 the fact that the forum culture resembles the larger culture, arid she remains aware of the contradictions in her own behaviors. If, in Pattern Recognition, the market stands in for history and advertising is a metaphor for story-telling, then Cayce—the homophonic female counterpart to Neuromancer's protagonist, Case—is also a kind of author figure who embodies Gibson's conflict ing desires to create and destroy narrative. The world she moves in is huge and shallow, and Cayce makes a living, like Gibson, out of scanning it for nodal points. She is a "coolhunter" (2), with an uncanny knack for identifying "street-level emergence" in fashion (9), so she is hired to consult on marketing design, since she can tell instantly whether something will catch or not. "Google Cayce . . . and if you look closely you may see it suggested that she is a 'sensitive' of some kind, a dowser in the world of global market ing" (2). But she can only stand contributing this degree of sorting. Although she works "at the level of consumer repurposing, she has no doubt that commodification will soon follow identification" (10), and she "is, literally, allergic to fashion. She can only tolerate things that could have been worn, to a general lack of comment, during any year between 1945 and 2000." She resists the retroactive fixing of an emergent product with a definite label, and has panic attacks in Tommy Hilfiger stores or at the sight of the Michelin Man. She tears off or otherwise effaces all of the labels on her own clothing. "She's a design-free zone, a one-woman school of anti whose very austerity periodically threatens to spawn its own cult" (8).8 Conversely, in relation to the footage, Cayce is driven to nar rative, wanting to comprehend both its provenance and its whole ness, and wanting it to transcend all markers of time and place in the world. She does not want it "productized" (86), but cannot resist the temptation to try to sort it out: The one hundred and thirty-four previously discov ered fragments, having been endlessly collated, broken down, reassembled, by whole armies of the most fanatical investigators, have yielded no period and no particular narrative direction. Zaprudered into surreal dimensions of purest speculation, ghost-narratives have emerged and taken on shadowy but determined lives of their own, but Cayce is familiar with them all, and steers clear. And here in Damien's flat, watching ... she knows that she knows nothing, but wants nothing more than to see the film of which this must be a part. Must be. (24)</page><page sequence="19">396 Discretionary Subjects The footage provides an alternative religion to fashion and gives her the romantic sense of getting to the origin of something, "as if she participates in the very birth of cinema" (23). With Bigend's credit card, she gives in to the urge to construct a logical narrative that has a Maker with an intention. Cayce is aware that both her profession and her search for the footage is "Complicit in whatever it is that gradually makes London and New York feel more like each other, that dissolves the membranes between mirror-worlds" (194). At the same time, Cayce never fully agrees with Bigend's views on time or control. Bigend's understanding of possible action, given the volatility of the present, is that '"We have only risk management. The spin ning of the given moment's scenarios. Pattern recognition'" (57). His management and spinning make this "recognition" an issue of control, another facet of predetermined direction: "No path for Bigend, but straight on, climbing" (69). Cayce's relationship to the footage represents instead Gibson's new-romantic perspective on the desire for narrative as an important and overlooked kind of agency in itself. It is a "participation mystique" (255) and a giving oneself to "the dream" (23), articulations that Cayce picks up from her forum-mates. In an e-mail she sends to what she believes is the "Maker's" address, she writes: We don't know what you're doing, or why. Parkaboy thinks you're dreaming. Dreaming for us. Sometimes he sounds as though he thinks you're dreaming us. He has this whole edged-out participation mystique: how we have to allow ourselves so far into the investigation of whatever this is, whatever you're doing, that we become part of it. Hack into the system. Merge with it, deep enough that it, not you, begins to talk to us. He says it's like Coleridge, and De Quincey. He says it's shamanic. That we may all seem to just be sitting there, staring at the screen, but really, some of us anyway, we're adventurers. We're out there, seeking, taking risks. In hope, he says, of bringing back wonders. (255) Jameson argues that Cayce's "commodity bulimia" is the "inevitable price" of her trend-predicting gift, that "within the brand name the whole contradictory dialectic of universality and particularity is played out as a tug of war between visual recognition and what we may call the work of consumption. . . . the logo into which the brand name gradually hardens soaks up its toxicity and retains the poison" (113). Cayce's freedom from productized or redeemed narrative appears to come through learning how to participate, not</page><page sequence="20">Tobeck 397 in a dialectic of universality and particularity, but in her own story such that she does not consume it and is not poisoned by it. By participating in the forum, Cayce learns through reading (both the footage and her favored friends' posts) that participation can be continuous without requiring a fixed self: when the entire forum has been archived, she finds herself reading early posts she had written without at first recognizing them (Gibson, Pattern 267). She encounters her self in a form that is no longer herself, but the record of her participation and what she responded to traces her ongoing emergence, without producing a necessarily deterministic continuity. In another idea paraphrased from a forum-mate, Cayce recognizes that "The future is there ... looking back at us. Trying to make sense of the fiction we will have become. And from where they are, the past behind us will look nothing at all like the past we imagine behind us now'" (57). By allowing herself "so far into the investigation" of the footage and the community that springs up around it, she "become[s] part of it" (255); she exercises, as Foucault writes, "not the curiosity that seeks to assimilate what it is proper for one to know, but that which enables one to get free of oneself" (8). This freedom and "becoming part of it" is neither an evacuation of the self nor an assimilating comprehension of what she finds, but more like a proliferation, a "hack" and "merge" activity (Gibson, Pattern 255). Cayce's ego remains, but she "cultivate^] it on its own special plot," the way her agent father does paranoia. Apart from that plot, she can be "only a part of something larger" (124), not assimilating what she finds to aggrandize herself, or being caught in an eternal feedback loop between particularity and universality. In the forum, Cayce is an agent without being one self. A mark of Gibson's either evolving or decreasingly ironic relationship to narrative is the fact that in Pattern Recognition his interstitial zones have been replaced by liminal states. For Cayce, "Always, now, the opening of an attachment containing unseen footage is profoundly liminal. A threshold state" (22). The difference is subtle, but shifts outer space to inner. The threshold is one of conscious perception, and liminality is a more personal potentiality: where Neuromancer"s Case moved about virtually by being jacked in to cyberspace, Pattern Recognition's Cayce contemplates making "jack moves," unexpected "lateralisms" that themselves represent freedom from an overdetermining context of self (91).</page><page sequence="21">398 Discretionary Subjects Notes 1. For the new romanticism of Neuromancer, for instance, Gibson has been accused of being less than original (Olsen 283), and of "remythologiz[ing] an earlier, powerfully autonomous subject through a literary form that is, in effect, a latter-day version of adventure/romance" (Stockton 588). Others praise or condemn Gibson's emphasis on the transcendence of physicality, and his disembodiment of the human subject into forms of information and technology. For Bruce Sterling, however, strength of (embodied) character marks Gibson's greatest innovation within science fiction: "Rather than the usual passionless techies and rock-ribbed Com petent Men of hard SF, his characters are a pirate's crew of losers, hustlers, spin-offs, castoffs, and lunatics. We see his future from the belly up, as it is lived, not merely as dry speculation" (xi). 2. Turing participated in Wittgenstein's lectures on the foundations of mathematics at Cambridge in 1939 (published as an edited col lection of participants' notes). Wittgenstein was interested in how "[m]athematical propositions are first of all English sentences," how "each mathematical proposition has a resemblance to certain non-mathematical propositions," and how "[mathematicians, when they begin to philosophize, always make the mistake of overlooking the difference in function between mathematical propositions and non-mathematical propositions" (qtd. in Diamond 111). Wittgen stein frequently engaged in discussion with Turing, who seemed hesitant to accept the necessity of these reflections. The pains Turing later took to differentiate between his theoretical purpose for words and their "normal use" ("Computing Machinery" 433), however, suggests that they had an impact on his thinking. What it means to "decide" is among the structures Wittgenstein ana lyzes. 3. This definition of the Entscheidungsproblem is given by Alonzo Church, who disproved it independently of Turing. Their combined answers are often referred to as the Church-Turing Thesis. 4. Despite Turing's efforts to mitigate contextual interruptions, the decision he sets up in the game is highly dependent on cultural assumptions about gender roles and appearances. Hayles's and Stevens's works provide particularly interesting analyses of gen der and performativity issues raised by Turing's game. See also Lyotard's "Can Thought Go on Without a Body" in The Inhuman, which is staged as a he/she dialogue. 5. In fact, we learn in Neuromancer that he is later assassinated while Molly is out running errands (176). 6. It is tempting to read in this last instance a conjuration of Turing. Also tempting is the fact that Jones, the cyborg dolphin, was used by the Navy in the (unidentified) war to "find submarines, suss out enemy cyber systems" (9), while in his lifetime Turing was most noted for cracking Germany's encoded submarine transmissions.</page><page sequence="22">Tobeck 399 7. Artificial life research maintains the goals of self-comprehension and transcendence, but with its less controlled contours, its pro ponents seem to see a more ethical purpose in it than that which has been assigned to old artificial intelligence in both science and fiction (that is, control through organization of the human mind and, by extension, collectivity). A utopie sense does infuse C. G. Langton's description of artificial life research: "In addition to pro viding new ways for studying biological phenomena associated with life here on Earth, life-as-we-know-it, Artificial Life lets us extend our studies to the larger domain of the 'bio-logic' of possible life, life-as-it-could-be, whatever it might be made of and wherever it might be found in the universe" (xv). I suppose its relative ethical ity depends in part on whether we plan to colonize what we find. 8. Some consider this Gibson's comment on his own commodification in the "cyberpunk" movement.
