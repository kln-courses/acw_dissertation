<plain_text><page sequence="1">CHAPTER 14 Additions to the Corpus of Early Cretan Figurines: Was There a Nude Goddess in Early Minoan Crete? by Philip P. Betancourt Small Early Minoan (EM) figurines, belonging to several classes, include some that are schematic and greatly simplified and others that depict more detailed anthropomorphic imagery One class of these sculptural miniatures stands out for its repetition of several specific details in images made in very different artistic styles. The class appears at several sites, sculpted in marble, bone, and other materials. The image that is depicted consists of a nude female figure standing or sitting, facing to the front with the legs either touching or close together and the arms folded across the front of the body, one above the other. The class has been studied in detail for its chronology, typology, relation to Cycladic figurines, and possible artistic development within Crete.1 A visual relation between figurines of this class and those of a large class of Cycladic folded-arm figurines has suggested to several scholars that the Cretan sculptures are derived from their Cy cladic counterparts.2 The addition to this class of two figurines from the Ayios Charalambos Cave in Lasithi contributes further evidence for an understanding of the group and encourages a new discussion of the image s possible meaning within the context of Early Bronze Age Crete. The excavation of the Minoan ossuary in the cave near the village of Ayios Charalambos has yielded several new examples of Minoan anthro pomorphic and zoomorphic figurines. The ossuary was excavated in two campaigns. Costis Davaras directed a project there between 1976 and 1983,3 and he and the author directed new excavations in 2002, Eleni Stravopodi joining the team as codirector in 2003. Among the finds from the cave are two figurines that depict a nude female form with the folded arms that are the hallmark of the class with Cycladic connections. As in the case of many of the Cretan examples of this class, the nature of the funerary context, the well-known Minoan communal burial in which the finds are thoroughly mixed, prohibits stratigraphic dating. The ossuary was filled within a short period during the Middle Minoan (MM) IIB period when both human bones and objects from as early as the Neolithic period were moved there from an earlier tomb or tombs. The date is established by finds of MM IIB pottery extending from the ossuary's surface to the bottom of the deposit, a depth of deposit of over a meter when measured from the highest objects in the cave's room 5 to the bedrock floor in the room. 1.

BETANCOURT ^^^^^ ^ The ossuary is a natural cave with seven small rooms, five of them used by the Minoans as a repository for the contents of their community's earlier burials. These rooms were filled with disarticulated and broken hu man bones, including approximately 40 complete human skulls and over 200 that have been mended from fragments found at different levels in the deposit. Along with the human bones were animal bones, pieces of pot tery, stone vases, bronzes, jewelry, seals, stone tools, marine shells, human figurines, and other objects that had been included in the original burials. The small sculptures, and most of the other objects, were apparently part of the earlier burial offerings rather than part of a ceremony that may have taken place at the time of the final deposition, because they were found mixed among the disarticulated bones rather than in place as if left in the course of a ceremony. The two nude female figurines from Ayios Charalambos are made of different materials and in different artistic styles. One of them belongs to a well-known, though rare class, while the other figurine is the only known example of its type. They are now deposited in the Archaeological Museum in Ayios Nikolaos.4 One of the figurines from the cave is a slim female figure with an erect, standing pose, straight legs, and a frontal face (Fig. 14.1). It has a head with sharply defined facial features and arms bent at the elbow and folded across the front of the body at the waist. The figure, which is completely nude, is carved from animal bone. It can be assigned to the Siva type of Cretan figurine in the typology of Keith Branigan, a class that can be dated to the EM II to III periods.5 Branigan placed four other figures in this type. Three examples come from the Mesara (one from Siva and two from AyiaTriada), while the other piece is a looted figure with no provenience. They all have similar facial features, the same simplified female nude body standing in a stiffly frontal position, and the same arm placement. In his discussion of the Siva type, Branigan concluded that the class has enough characteristics in common with marble Cycladic figurines to suggest an ultimate derivation from those images.6 The typology of the Cycladic figurines was first discussed in detail by Colin Renfrew.7 He was 4.

Betancourt able to divide them into a series of typological groups, and he suggested a general typological development within the Cycladic Islands. The second figurine from Ayios Charalambos is very different in style. It consists of a scaraboid-shaped stone image with one rounded side and one flat side.8 The rounded side has a groove to delineate the head and another line at right angles to it, as if it were the delineation of the scarab beetles wings. The flat side (Fig. 14.2) has an incised image of a nude woman, with a line to set off the head, another for the shoulders, lines for the arms folded across the waist, a pubic triangle, and a division between the legs. This very schematized image represents the extreme end of the simplified versions of the class. Further simplification would result in an aniconic figurine. Both pieces from Ayios Charalambos are related in some way to the class of Cycladic sculpture called the folded-arm figurine (FAF), a large Cycladic and Cretan class consisting of nude female images with the arms folded across the front of the body, one above the other. The most common Minoan version of the FAF is the Koumasa type.9 The pieces shown here (Figs. 14.3-14.6) are typical of the type. The form of the type is very thin, and the front and back are flattened. All examples are made of marble. The details are rendered more by incision than by modeling, and variation within the group is fairly limited, though some examples are more angular than others. In the Aegean Islands, the FAF is associated with the Keros-Syros group, an assemblage of artifacts associated with the middle phase of the Early Bronze Age Cyclades.10 As Branigan has shown, the Cretan class can most likely be assigned to EM II?III.11 Several Cretan figurines are generally related to the Cycladic FAF classes but have not always been assigned to specific types. They have 8. For the relation of the shape to that of a scarab, see Davaras 1982, p. 388. 9. Xanthoudides 1924, pp. 122-127; Renfrew 1969, pp. 18-19, Koumasa variety; Branigan 1971, pp. 61-63. 10.

BETANCOURT ^^^^^^ general affinities with the Cycladic female figurines but also unique char acteristics. A seated figure from Tekes, near Herakleion (Fig. 14.7), for example, is similar to the other FAF examples except for the seated pose. Karantzali regarded it as a Cycladic import.12 Renfrew assigned the small pair of joined figures also from Tekes (Fig. 14.8) to the Koumasa type,13 but because of their small size, the figures are slightly simplified, and it is not easy to assign the pair to a specific class. DISCUSSION The difficulty in discovering the meaning behind Aegean Early Bronze Age figurines has long been recognized.14 Among the numerous possible explanations for their represenation and function that have been proposed and discussed are as dolls, divine nurses, attendants to help convey the deceased to the next life, concubines, protective goddesses, cult images, amulets, icons, votives, funerary gifts, and dancers or maidens related to the burial practices. Most examples come from graves, but domestic uses have also been suggested,15 and several broken and even repaired pieces such as the one illustrated in Figure 14.6, as well as examples found in settlements, prove that the figurines were in use before they were placed in graves.16 A major difficulty in assessing the meaning of this class is that most examples come from looting, so that we do not have information about their contexts to aid in interpretation. An appreciation of ancient meaning is especially elusive in the Cyclades, where the evidence is more diverse than on Minoan Crete. Marble figurines occur in more classes in the Aegean Islands than on Crete, presenting vari ous poses, several arm gestures, and a number of accessory items such as jewelry and even musical instruments, and include male as well as female figures. The Cretans did not copy everything, thus the restricted nature of the Cretan examples makes it easier to narrow the possibilities for the Minoan interest in this class of image. Taken as a whole, the FAFs on Crete represent a series that extends from actual Cycladic examples to pieces that are close to the original types Figure 14.7 (left). Seated marble figurine from Tekes.

Aspects of the originals that were omitted in derivatives must have been less important in the new location than aspects that were care fully retained through successive copies. The Koumasa type (see Figs. 14.3-14.6), known only from Crete, is closely related to figurines manufactured in the Aegean Islands. The Cretan versions of this type imitate both the Cycladic concept and many elements of the Cycladic style. The material was also copied. As Papathanasopoulos has emphasized, white marble is the only material used for figurines in the Cyclades.18 Although the Koumasa type is rendered only in white marble, both the Siva type, in animal bone, and the scaraboid figure, in stone, depart from this practice. The attractive and lustrous white marble of the images clearly did not have the same symbolic content on Crete that it did in the Cyclades. Stylistic differences also exist. The Koumasa type is closer to the Cy cladic images than some of the other Cretan figures. The Siva type adds elements of the facial features and changes the proportions of the human body. The scaraboid-shaped stone figurine from Ayios Charalambos aban dons the Cycladic style completely, retaining only enough iconographic elements to make the stone recognizable as a nude female form with a particular stance. Only a few iconographic elements are shared by all versions of the Cretan FAFs.The features that occur repeatedly in a disparate class are likely to have been regarded as essential by those who made them. If one assumes that the ancient audience was expected to recognize the image, then figurines that are extremely simplified can be especially use ful in determining what was regarded as necessary for the recognition of a given class of image. The following elements occur in all the Cretan FAFs: 1. The figure is nude. 2. The figure is female.19 3. The figure has a strictly frontal stance, with the head and shoul ders facing straight to the front. 4. The legs are either touching or straight together. 5. The arms are folded across the front of the body, one above the other. 6. The figure is simplified, and the breasts are de-emphasized. These elements unify the class and make its figurines easily distin guishable from those that are clothed or that have different gestures. An important aspect of the arm gesture and the stiff, frontal stance is that these characteristics create a self-contained and introverted image, a figure to be observed or recognized, not a figure that recognizes someone else. The figure is also extremely formal. It has no details that suggest humor, no representations of jewelry or costume that would associate it with a particular human group or status, and no other details that associate it with any human social group. 17. The identification of actual Cy cladic imports has been controversial because of the difficulty in distinguish ing between very close copies and pieces of Cycladic manufacture. For discussion and examples of possible Cycladic imports, see Renfrew 1969, p. 19; Branigan 1971, pp. 61, 77; Karantzali 1996, p. 157; Sakellarakis and Sapouna-Sakellaraki 1997, vol. 1, pp. 339-349. 18.

The only male marble figurine from Crete, from Archanes, is prob ably a Cycladic import, as suggested by Karantzali (1996, p. 157).</page><page sequence="6">i76 PHILIP P. BETANCOURT A useful confirmation that the folded-arm gesture is restricted to the Early Bronze Age nude female figures comes from the contrast with later figures, almost all of which are either clothed or so schematic that details such as clothing are not represented.20 Not a single example of the gesture occurs either in the terracotta figures recorded by Rethemiotakis or in the copper, bronze, and lead figurines recorded by Verlinden.21 These slightly later clay and metal figurines include both male and female images, pre senting several clothing classes and several gestures. Their gestures often salute or recognize someone or something outside of the figure itself?for example, by placing one arm across the breast or by raising one arm to the forehead or shoulder or by reaching out with one or both arms22?but the figures never hug themselves by folding the arms at the waist. CONCLUSIONS ON THE MEANING Although an ancient meaning for a class of objects such as these figurines cannot be determined with any precision, several aspects of the group's significance can be better understood through the evidence. In particular, two types of information help to establish some of the boundaries of the ancient meaning: the nature of the figurines themselves and their archaeo logical contexts. The recurrent nudity and the specific gesture and stance of the Cretan FAFs suggest that the figure is a particular personage who is supposed to be recognized by its visual characteristics. Specific visual elements provide the spectator with clues that allow recognition. The repetition of these visual clues in figures that are otherwise very different stylistically implies that the figure is an individual personage capable of being recognized. The identity of this personage is what is difficult to determine, although some of the many alternatives can be discounted because they are not supported by evidence. Explanation of the figurines as children's dolls is highly unlikely because dolls are typically intended to be dressed. The de-emphasis of the head in some of the images suggests that these figurines are not intended to have added clothing: an addition of clothing would obscure and hide the body, leaving the head as the essential human aspect that would permit the figure to be recognized. Figures without faces are seldom dolls. In addition, the scaraboid figure (Fig. 14.2) would be difficult to clothe, as would the seated figure (Fig. 14.7) and the tiny double figure fromTekes (Fig. 14.8). None of the Cretan FAFs are pierced for suspension, so they could not be worn as amulets or jewelry, a characteristic that is very different from those of the EM III-MM IA figurines of women in the Ayios Charalam bos tomb itself, where clothed figurines from this period are pierced for suspension and could have been amulets worn for religious or protective purposes or for personal adornment. Unless the nude figurines were car ried in bags or tied to the body with cords, they were neither jewelry nor amulets, and an image such as the scaraboid figurine is not designed to make suspension from a cord one of its salient features because it is too 20.

These features suggest that the meaning of the nude figurines goes beyond simple adornment. In her discussion of the Minoan female sculptures from domestic contexts, Geraldine Gesell has correctly emphasized that one must always use contexts to establish meaning, particularly when dealing with ancient belief systems.23 In applying this concept to the nude female figurines, one must recognize that although a few examples come from secondary contexts in settlements, no figurine of the type discussed in this paper has been discovered in a primary domestic context in Crete. This situa tion is not necessarily entirely a result of lack of excavation. The EM IIB figurine in the probable shrine at Myrtos Pyrgos is very different from those discussed here.24 This figurine is from the same period as the FAFs, but it is clothed, it holds a jug, and its lower body is bell-shaped. In later shrine contexts in Crete, many of which have been admirably catalogued by Gesell,25 the figures of women show no signs at all of descent from the early nude images. Whatever their meaning, the nude female figurines represent a Prepalatial tradition that is not reflected in either the known EM or later Minoan cult contexts. Enough of the figurines occur in tombs to show that the images were clearly regarded as appropriate for deposition with the dead. The most common context of the figurines in Crete is a deposition with the deceased along with personal objects that seem intended for some use in a life after death. Is the nude female figure also associated with a life after death? At Ayios Charalambos, as in other Minoan tombs, it is personal pos sessions that form the main category of Cretan burial goods, making it difficult to demonstrate that the figurines are not also personal property. They are not public cult images of the type found in the communal shrine at Myrtos Pyrgos, mentioned above, and they also represent something very different from the concept of the cult image as the term was understood in Classical Greece when sculpted figures associated with the architecture of individual deities were used as public focal points for religious beliefs.26 The portable character of the figurines has parallels from Late Cyp riot II Cyprus. According to Begg, the rounded contours and tapering, single, stem legs of Cypriot figurines are elements that facilitate their being handheld.27 The same qualities exist in the earlier Cretan figurines.28 The suggestion offered here is that the figures are personal or familial possessions. That is not to say they cannot represent an individual who is divine or who has special powers. The fact that the nude female always has the same stance and gesture makes the figure recognizable as a specific and identifiable personality. The inference is that only one individual is represented by this figure. The associations of the individual should also be identifiable by its re peated characteristics. A constant feature in the image is its female sex, and another is its nudity. Nude female forms are often regarded as presenting characteristics that strongly suggest regeneration and fertility as a symbolic concept.29 These concepts are compatible with a deposition in tombs by people with enough of a belief in the regeneration of the spiritual form of the deceased to bury food, drink, and personal objects in the grave. 23. Gesell 1985, pp. 64-66. The concept is not new, of course, but it remains essential to any interpretation. 24. Warren 1972, pis. 69, 70. 25. Gesell 1985, pp. 68-142. 26.

Compare also, from Enkomi, a figurine of this general description found near a decedent's right hand (Dikaios 1969-1971, grave 19). 28. The similarity in shape does not imply any direct connection between the two groups of figurines, only that facilitation of portability may lead to the adoption of similar forms. Ucko (1968) suggests that stump arms facil itate portability. He also says (1968, p. 425) that Hobbe women in Africa carry figurines to insure the health of their children. 29. Barber 1987, p. 131.</page><page sequence="8">178 PHILIP P. BETANCOURT The association with the scarab in one of the images from the Ayios Charalambos Cave should also be taken into consideration. Scarabs were well known in many Cretan communities. An example comes from the Ayios Charalambos Cave itself.30 In Egypt, the scarab was derived from the dung beetle, a creature that had multiple religious symbolisms.31 It was associated with the movement of the sun because of the insect s habit of roll ing balls of dung across the ground. Because the insect s death after laying eggs in the soil was followed the next season by the birth and emergence of the new generation, it had an easy association with the regeneration of life after death, and it was an appropriate image for inclusion in Egyptian tombs.32 We cannot know how much, if any, of this symbolism went with the scarab to Crete, but it may not be coincidental that the image was ap propriate for a burial offering in both cultures. Taking all of this evidence together, one possible conclusion is that the nude female imagery represents a female individual whose images were owned as personal or familial possessions in the EM II to III periods and whose symbolic message and/or religious power had to do with regenera tion and life, including possibly a continuation or regeneration of life after death. Most likely, the figures represent a goddess; if the individual was not a goddess, she must have been a personality who was easily recogniz able by her pose and gesture, such as a mythological figure well known within the society. Whoever or whatever the images represented, the nude female figurines are a part of the Early Bronze Age. Their presence, and presumably their symbolic content, died out at the end of EM period, when nude imagery was replaced by clothed figures with differently conceived visual messages. 30.
