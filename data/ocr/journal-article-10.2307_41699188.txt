Cologne: Amharsi Sri, Intuition Music &amp; Media Gmbh, 1997. Book with one CD-ROM and three audio CDs. ISBN 3-93298-05-X. Distribution: Intuition Music &amp; Media, e-mail: immco- logne@aol.com. Three audio CDs (with two-and-a-half hours of music) and a CD-ROM accompany this attrac- tive book with numerous color illustrations. This volume, dedicated to Africa, is the first of an eight- volume "World Music Atlas SeriesAVeltmusik- Atlas Serie." Each volume is issued in two languages, in English and in German. Future issues in the same format will include: Vol. 2, Latin America; Vol. 3, The Middle East; Vol. 4, Italy and the Mediterranean; Vol. 5, Asia and Oceania; Vol. 6, North America; Vol. 7, Celtic Europe; Vol. 8, The Ways of Jewish Mu- sic. The idea for this series can be traced to Francesco Mizzau, Livio Giacomi and Matteo Sil- va and it is produced by Gianfranco Barbetta (Harmony Music), Francesco Mizzau (Si.Lab) and Matta Silva (Amiata Media). It is the declared intention of the editors "to divulge awareness of the world's many musi- cal origins, a multimedia voyage into one of the human activities which, along with language, has accompanied man on his millenarian road towards material, mental and spiritual develop- ment" (p. 9). "Our aspiration is that ethnic music will be studied in schools as an important subject, a metalanguage for mutually understanding and accepting the differences of all the cultures of the planet" (p. 11). Those who are familiar with Microsoft Encarta World Atlas will not be surprised that mu- sicologists are also making initiatives to use multimedia for their own purposes. It is a matter of sheer logic that the ten-second examples on a CD-ROM give little more than only a short glimpse of the music to a passionate listener, and so the editors have decided to supplement the volume with three audio CDs. The interested listeners and readers will be grateful to them, for at present navigating through the CD-ROM sound landscape only produces in most cases a kind of musical fast-switching. Without doubt it will still be a while before image, film and sound, also in terms of documentation, can be made easily available in their entire lengths on CD-ROM. Vol. 1 : "Africa" is divided into six chapters (which correspond on the whole as well to the navigation possibilities of the CD-ROM): 1) "A Brief Account of African Ethnohistory" by the editorial staff of "Nigrizia"; 2) "The Music of North Africa" by Claudio Vedovati; 3) "The Music of Sub-Saharan Africa" by Leonardo D'Amico; 4) "Vocal Music" by Serena Facci; 5) "Musical Instruments" by Leonardo D'Amico and 6) "Modern African Music of the Sub-Sa- hara" by David Ryder. The texts are short and kept very general in tone. The chapter "Musical Instruments" for example is divided into sub-chapters of each one page in length. In these sub- chapters the following topics are treated: "The Object of Sound: Meanings and Functions," "The Instrument as Taboo," "The Instrument and Its Languages," "Anthropomorphism and Sexual Duality," "Music and Trance," "Aesthetics of Sound," and "Organologie Appendix." As in many CD-ROM editions, the source information regarding musical titles and picture captions is very rudimentary. The person who wants to trace the sources to their documentary originals in order to learn more about a piece or a picture will find this too tiresome. Even if the volume is only meant as an introduction, one could expect, in reference to an entire continent, something more than a humble "General Bibliography" with no more than 28 book titles. It is indeed the CD-ROM which would be the best conceivable medium for adding on extensive bibliographies and source references without problems.

In this matter, Encarta World Atlas 98 does offer without doubt some prac- tical tips. It can be assumed that the World Music Atlas Series will be continually broadened in up- dates as well as in topics. Without doubt, it will provide in the future a handy overview of mu- sic in the world, when the eight planned volumes are all issued. This sound library will, in a playful way, provide access to the listener interested in the musical traditions of the world to the diversity and plurality of sonic concepts.
