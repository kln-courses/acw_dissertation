<plain_text><page sequence="1">Marco Frascari is a Professor of Architec- ture in the Doctoral Program of Georgia Institute of Technology Too many anomalies are casting doubts and shadows within the productive realm of architecture. The present paradigm is not "normal" anymore. We are in a "puz- zling" phase of architectural understand- ing. The professors and the professionals of architecture are playing with the pieces of their "theory/practice" puzzles. Most of them are not following the rules of the game. They are figuring out their own solitaires by composing their own private images. They are using the pieces of the puzzles as construction blocks. Although the pieces are fitting, the results of these solitary plays are solipsistic composi- tions.1 Nevertheless, a commnon image is slowly emerging in the layouts of these puzzles. It is an image of a body, a perspi- cuous representation of the reality of architecture. To be more precise, two are the bodies incorporated in the image, the human body and the body of the building. Both the bodies are involved in the pro- cess of making a meaningful architecture. Sometimes they are so near that they merge; sometimes they are far apart. This tension between them allows the elabora- tion of a meaningful constructed world. They rule the constructing as well as the construing of architectural artifacts. This dual-body image results from an understanding of corporeality as the cen- tral focus of the architectural presence. A presence which is not only a being, but it is also a becoming. Body, perception and memory are the elements composing a growing spiral on which a true relation- ship theory-practice should be built. This will give back to architecture its original nature of being a specific discipline with its own proper theoretical knowledge, which can be then transferred in the instrumental knowledge necessary to its practicing. The corporeal solution of the puzzle also reveals a class of reflective objects pertinent to architecture. These objects are not necessarily physical (such as stone or cement), nor technical (such as geometry or the science of construc- tion), nor historical (such as typology or decoration), nor literary (such as compo- sition or criticism). Rather these objects result from a knowledge internal to archi- tecture itself which analyzes the sensible human nature and its way of organizing time and space in a place. The physical, technical, historical and literary objects are merely the necessary embodiment of architecture. In an interview, a leading professor of aesthetics, Dino Formaggio, has stated: "I believe that an architectural revolution could only take place on the basis of a new conception or corporeality. It is no more the Renaissance idea of body, nei- ther the Modulor body of Le Corbusier."2 Placing the concept of "corporeality" as a central point of his aesthetic theory, For- maggio is proposing a new architectural anthropomorphism. Anthropomorphism understood as the ascription of human characters and attributes to buildings and edifices has a long tradition in architec- tural theory. Vitruvius, a rhapsodist archi- tect from the first century B.C., recounts in his treatise the diverse methods of anthropomorphic practice in the Hellenis- tic-Roman Tradition. A practice which Vitruvius suggested for the determination of measures and proportions as well as for the imaginary to be used during the project and construction of buildings.3 In his book for architectural patrons, Leon Battista Alberti discusses the organization of the-built bodies speculating on a poetic of the body.4 In our own time, Leon Krier, an aggressive Post-Modern architect from Luxembourg, returns to the body-meta- phor to fight his battle against the dele- terious Modernist city and its poorly organized body, patched up by means of mechanistic and functional prostheses and organs transplanted to improper sites,5 a monstrous metaphor conceived within the spirit of I'homme machine.6 However, the image embodied in the solu- tion of the puzzle is not anymore meta- phorical, but rather is based on an under- standing of metonymical relations between the built and human bodies. The image shows a new Humano Corpore Fabrica, a new construction resulting from a projection of corporeality,7 or as Formaggio has it encapsulated in a pow- erful aphorism, "the arrow of the possibil- ity of the project is shot by the body."8 The same concept of a direct participation of the body in the project is poetically expressed by Paul Valery through the mouth of the Greek architect Eupalinos: "When I design a dwelling ... I confess ... it seems to me my body is playing its part in the game."9 In rhetoric, the metonymy indicates fig- ures of semantic transfer based on rela- tionships of logical and material contigu- ity between the literal and the figurative terms. While in the metaphor the relation- ships established are pragmatic and extrinsic (city= body, head =seat of gov- ernment, stomach = market, church = heart, etc.), in the metonymy the relationship is syntagmatic and intrinsic. The effects substitute for the causes, the materials for the objects, the contained for the container, the abstract for the con- crete or vice versa. In architecture the dominant figures are visual and the mor- phological characteristics are perceived by the nonvisual entities which give privi- leged status to perception. A sound is grave or acute; a tactile sensation is soft or cold. The metonymy acts in relation to this privileged status of perception while the metaphor acts through other types of consciousness that are based on judg- ment. In a metonymical procedure, the project of a handle results from the mold of the grasp of a hand rather than from a formal representation of the hand itself. A metonymy, in which the synecdoche has the lion's share, is exemplified by an illus- tration by Teofilo Gallacini for his treatise on fortifications.10 (Fig. 1) In the design of a rampart, the architectural form is anthropomorphized into a head, based on the metonymical understanding for look- ing out rather than on the metaphoric iso- topy of a bridgehead in a bastion. The traditional metaphoric Vitruvian dou- ble origin of architecture, from the hut as construction and from the body as proportion1 was challenged by the Vene- tian friar Carlo Lodoli (d. 1761), a peculiar architectural theoretician.12 Lodoli pro- poses an architecture where the /ogos of the materials determines the structure and the logos of the body determines the proportions. His request for a metonymi- cal usage of corporeality is embodied in an episode of his life told by his faithful pupil, Andrea Memmo.13 The episode regards a chair designed by the Venetian friar. The idea which underlies the design is that the shoulders and the bottom should dictate by contiguity respectively the chair back and seat. The request is not for a functional answer, but rather for a dignifying solution.14 Using the design of the chair as touchstone for an architec- ture generated by the process of human contiguity Lodoli calls for an organic architecture. He is the first to use the word organic within the architectural Jubilee 1987 JAE 40/2 A New Corporeality of Architecture</page><page sequence="2">field. He used it in its proper etymological meaning-Organon: the corporeal part of the body employed to relate holistically with the constructed environment. Carlo Scarpa (d. 1978) approached the question of the body through the medium of the drawing. In many of his drawings, the human figures are metonymically embodied in the artifacts. An instance of Scarpa's embodiment technique is in a drawing prepared for the study of an opening inserted in the wall fronting the entrance to the Brion Tomb in the Ceme- tery of Altivole. (Fig. 2) Three female fig- ures, with the lineaments of figurines from the 1930s, give rhythm to the tripartite construction of an "impassable" opening. The window is based on the geometry of two intersecting metal-edged circles dec- orated with rose and blue glass-mosaic mounted on either sides of the window within the canals of the metal profile of the window frame. The lineaments of the face of the central figure regulate the intersection of the circles. The geometry of this face is the origin of the minimal system of the relationship between the two circles. The face, with its forehead set at the intersection of the two circles, determines the rule for the secant of the intersection by means of the position of the eyes, nose, and mouth. In these cir- cles, the canonical relation of the diago- nal of the square and the golden mean is disregarded.15 Instead, a two-faced rela- tionship is approached but not attained, just as a perfect symmetry in the human face is never achieved. This, drawing indi- cates Scarpa's great attention to micro- architectural conditions; a forehead set against the fresh metal of the window frame is undoubtedly the beginning of an architectural reflection that originated the geometric thought of the intersection of the circles. This attention that avoids the macro in favor of the micro is at the base of this new embodiment of architecture. The small things of the body and its habits constantly regulate the becoming of architecture. A "being" and a "making" that focus, as Manlio Brusatin has indi- cated, on .. the minimal mechanisms of small sys- tems and subtend-as in biological life- to the production of larger systems of arti- ficial and artistic forms. A projective sen- sibility that perceives the union of small things that have great effects and the dis- continuity of the great that finish small (minima crescunt maxime maxima des- crescunt).' 16 Architects cannot do anymore without the identification of the human body and its elements in the architectural body. This is a new anthropomorphic practice of body/ building topology, a practice that avoids the too simple road of isomorphism, iso- tropic, and metaphoric representations of the past. Instead using the body as a pro- posing element of architectural meto- nymy, new kinds of instrumental and the- oretical representations can be reached. Through embodiment, architecture becomes a perspicuous representation, a real human project, a representation of a becoming, dealing with a therapeutic dimension. In other words, architecture is a representation dealing with the recon- ciliation of the art of living well with the art of constructing well, a Janus-like pres- ence which can be represented by an etymological chiasm-techne of logos and logos of techne. From this point of view technology is indeed the richest means for the architectural production of meaning. Technology deals with both the construction and the construing of a piece of architecture reconciling the art of living well with the art of constructing well in a metonymical way. Despite the present limitations of the role of the body in archi- tectural projects, the process of embodi- ment is taking place in the constructed world as well as in the drawings neces- sary to accomplish its construction. The role of the professor as well as of the professional of architecture is to recog- nize itand make it tangible in their work. Rephrasing this last statement within a mythological frame, it is possible to say that in his anthropometric practice Dae- dalus had made tangible the embodiment of the corporeality of the geranos (the dance of the crane) in his design of the Labyrinth.17 Notes 1 An indirect warning sign of this more or less conscious intellectual danger in the contemporary professings of architecture was given by Manfredo Tafuri in his discussion of the "Historical Project" in La sfera e il labirinto Einaudi (Turin) 1979. The English translation of this article (by Diane Ghirardo and Stephen Sartarelli) appears in Oppositions No. 17 (Summer, 1979). Of particular interest in this respect is the introductory quotation of this essay which comes from Ginsburg, Carlo and Adriano Prosperi Giochi di pazienza. Un seminario sul "Beneficio do Cristo" (Turin) 1975, p. 84: "Sometimes (but not always) there is a moment during research when, as in a game of solitaire, all the pieces begin to fall into place. But unlike the game of solitaire, where the pieces are within reach and there is only one fig- ure to compose (so that the exactitude of the moves is pre- cise and immediately controllable), in research the pieces are only partially available, and more than one figure is the- oretically possible. In playing solitaire, one always takes risks more or less consciously, using the pieces like blocks in a toy construction kit. For this reason, the fact that every- thing falls into place is an ambiguous clue: it is either com- pletely right or completely wrong. In the latter case, exter- nal verification is replaced by the selection or solicitation (more or less deliberate) of evidence, forcing it to confirm the more or less explicit presuppositions of the research. The dog thinks he bites a bone and instead bites his tail." 2 Formaggio, Dino "Progettare con il corpo," Domus No. 676 (October, 1986), pp. 17-24 3 See Pollio, (Marcus) Vitruvius De Architectura (especially in "Book VI") Dover (New York) 1975; n.b.: I am using the word "project" with the meaning given to it by the Italian tradition, see: Frampton, Kenneth "Anthropology and Construction," Casabella, Nos. 520-21 (Jan.-Feb., 1986), pp. 26-30. From this point of view anatomy and stereotomy are analogous, consequently architecture is a construction resulting from the projection of the human subject. 4 Alberti, Leon Battista De Re Aedificatoria (translated by J.
