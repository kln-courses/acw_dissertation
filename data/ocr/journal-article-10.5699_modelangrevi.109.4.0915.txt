<plain_text> <page sequence="1"> SCIENCE IN THREE DIMENSIONS: WERNER HERZOG’S CAVE OF FORGOTTEN DREAMS One of the distinguishing features of Werner Herzog’s Cave of Forgotten Dreams, noted by reviewers at the time of its release in , was the fact that it had been filmed in 3-D. While Herzog himself was critical of the use of 3-D in mainstream cinema, his decision to use the technology for this particular documentary was determined by its subject, the Palaeolithic paintings of Chauvet Cave in the Ardèche region of south-eastern France. It is a well-known fact that prehistoric cave paintings are not normally flat, as our own traditions of two-dimensional representation might lead us to assume, but exploit the three-dimensionality of their support, the accidents and irregularities of the cavern walls themselves. In this sense Herzog’s use of stereoscopic projection is scientifically correct, as it allows him to capture something of the objective reality of the paintings. It is also, in a wider sense, phenomenologically correct, to the extent that 3-D provides the viewer—who will never have direct access to Chauvet Cave—with a heightened sense of immersion in the total environment of which the paintings are an integral part. However, despite the effectiveness of the use of 3-D in Cave of Forgotten Dreams, it is not in my view the most interesting or compelling aspect of the film. In this respect, the ‘three dimensions’ of my title are more metaphorical than literal, referring not so much to Herzog’s exploitation of the medium of 3-D as to his tendency to present science itself in three dimensions, to look at the subjects of science, those who make science, as well as the objects of science. is, it could be argued, is what distinguishes Cave of Forgotten Dreams from more generically conventional documentaries on prehistoric culture. In common with these documentaries, Herzog’s film fulfils the basic educational function of science communication, which is to present the facts of a given domain of knowledge and, ideally, to encourage further reflection on it. At the same time, the film’s mode of composition—the closing credits indicate that it is ‘Written, Directed and Narrated by Werner Herzog’—seems imme- diately to present us with a more reflexive perspective on its subject matter. In this sense it is very much the product of what is commonly referred to as Herzog’s ‘vision’, and equally the product of what should here be referred to as his ‘voice’. It would be a mistake, however, to reduce the film to some unique combination of vision and voice, to an expression of the personal  Cave of Forgotten Dreams, dir. by Werner Herzog (Creative Differences Productions/History Films, USA, ); running time  minutes.  Discovered in , these paintings are the oldest representations of their kind, dated at approximately , years  (Before Present).

More accurately, it could be said that Herzog’s highly structured staging of the docu- mentary and his strategic deployment of its protagonists create an additional dimension of objectivity, providing a fascinating insight into what the human science of prehistory has become in the twenty-first century, both in France and internationally.e following analysis will look in turn at the treatment of locations, institutions, and individuals in Cave of Forgotten Dreams, conclud- ing with a consideration of how this remarkable film might help us to think in a more critical and more reflexive manner about ‘humanness’ or ‘what it means to be human’. e importance of location and landscape in Herzog’s films is explicitly acknowledged by the director himself. As he comments in his interviews with Paul Cronin: ‘I like to direct landscapes just as I like to direct actors and animals. [. . .] What I look for in landscapes in general is a humane spot for man, an area worthy of human beings. [. . .] e starting point for many of my films is a landscape.’ e striking opening scene of Cave of Forgotten Dreams is indeed a floating perspective of a landscape. Moving to the metre of Dutch composer Ernst Reijseger’s soundtrack, the camera in sequence tracks a vineyard near to Chauvet Cave, rises abruptly to encompass the surround- ing landscape, including the spectacular Pont d’Arc—the natural geological feature created by the Ardèche river—then descends to scan the cliffs leading to the cave entrance before cutting to its interior. is opening composition is completed by the voice-over of the director himself, situating the cave in terms of its geographical location, the history of its discovery, and its signifi- cance as the repository of the oldest known examples of prehistoric cave art. In addition to the factual contextualization provided by the director’s voice, the visual movement of ascent–descent characterizing this opening sequence seems to constitute a kind of thought-process in itself, transiting from a human-engineered landscape (nature–culture) to a geologically transformed landscape (nature–nature) to the human–semiotic landscape of the cave itself (culture–nature). At the same time, Herzog’s sequencing is convergent with the statistical evidence about sites such as Chauvet, which indicates that they are frequently found in geographical locations that are in one way or another visually remarkable. e cave named aer Jean-Marie Chauvet, one of its three discoverers, is a sealed vault, sealed from public access and the atmospheric variations which would over time compromise the state of preservation of its contents.is was the hard lesson learnt from the example of Lascaux Cave, which from the time of its opening to the public in  through to its closure in  suffered  Herzog on Herzog , ed. by Paul Cronin (London: Faber and Faber, ), pp. , .  On the importance of landscape types in the location of Palaeolithic sites see Jean Clottes, Pourquoi l’art préhistorique?

Herzog and his small filming team were allowed access for four hours a day over a period of six days in . e hypnotic attraction of the film, enhanced by Reijseger’s soundtrack, resides for a large part in the way it initiates the viewer into the internal space of the cave, the 3-D camerawork of director of photography Peter Zeitlinger allowing us to experience, vicariously, the beauty of its mineral concretions, producing a more immediate sense of inhabitation than conventional two- dimensional projection. As the filming team moves through this enchanting environment, the narrator confesses at one point to an uncanny sense of being watched, as if the previous inhabitants of the cave were somehow still present—a feeling also experienced by certain scientists and the cave’s dis- coverers. For myself, watching the carefully choreographed movements of the cave’s visitors elicited the distinct sense of another presence, in this case the spirit of twentieth-century science as represented by the prehistorian André Leroi-Gourhan. e leading figure in his discipline in France until his death in , Leroi-Gourhan campaigned extensively for the proper protection and preservation of archaeological sites such as Lascaux. In addition to the at- mospheric degradation mentioned above, the other tragedy of Lascaux Cave was that precious archaeological evidence scattered on its floors had been destroyed in the construction of pathways for visitors to view the paintings. e movements of the filming team in Herzog’s documentary are therefore strictly controlled: wearing sterilized boots and under the supervision of the cave guards, they process along a  cm-wide metal walkway protecting the floors. It is forbidden to step off the walkway. Over a period of more than thirty years, Leroi-Gourhan had visited virtu- ally all of the decorated prehistoric sites in France, and came to use the term ‘sanctuary’ to describe the nature of these locations. While this term, still current in the discourse of prehistorians, is not explicitly used in Herzog’s film, it is easy to see that his audio-visual representation of the cave also follows this interpretation. e geographical location of Chauvet Cave, its internal structure and composition, its ambience and aura, compel the visitor to acknowledge this spiritual significance, even if the absolute loss of context means that it is impossible to determine its ultimate meaning for prehistoric humans. It is equally easy to see that Herzog’s focus is also on how humans of the twenty-first century relate to the cave, how the scientific protection and preservation of the Chauvet site creates what is effectively a second degree or dimension of sanctification. e tracking shot at the start of the film is in this  See André Leroi-Gourhan, Les Racines du monde: entretiens avec Claude-Henri Rocquet (Paris: Belfond, ), pp. –.  Leroi-Gourhan discusses his use of this term in Les Racines du monde, p. . </page> <page sequence="4">  Science in 3-D respect simple but significant: it follows the small group of researchers wind- ing their way to the cave entrance, the narrator’s commentary informing us of the periodicity of their visits to the site. e construction of this sequence, its representation of the seasonal convergence of a group of scientists—two of whom are carrying sticks—on the site of Chauvet, clearly communicates the sense of a pilgrimage, a recurrent theme in Herzog’s films. If the human context of the ‘sanctuary’ of Chauvet is irretrievably lost, what remains is the directly observable, living context of the community of researchers who create meaning around it. Herzog’s practice as a director is to extract different individuals from the scientific community at Chauvet, who in their turn comment on different as- pects of the cave, in particular the paintings. While this mode of presentation is standard practice in the factual documentary, there is a clear gradation in the relative foregrounding of the film’s protagonists, reflecting what one might briefly term the elective affinities of Werner Herzog. e selection of these protagonists seems at first sight to be a structural and hierarchical one. e archaeologists Dominique Baffier, Jean Clottes, and Jean-Michel Geneste are the elders of the community, those who act as the guardians and guides of the cave. In the credits at the end of the film they are listed first and separately from the rest of the Chauvet research team. Dominique Baffier is the curator of the cave—Herzog describes her as its ‘custodian’—and she is the main guide in the first part of the documentary. Jean Clottes was the first director of the Chauvet research programme following the cave’s dis- covery in , and also accompanies the visitors in the opening sequences of the film. Jean-Michel Geneste is the current director at Chauvet, and is most present in the middle and closing sequences. ese three protagonists together represent the generational authority that is necessary for the insti- tutional organization and transmission of knowledge in a discipline such as prehistory. However, the director’s presentation of these protagonists is not equally balanced, indicating a selective bias which may have something to do with language. e research team at Chauvet is French and French-speaking—the discip- line of prehistory has a long history in France, dating back to the middle of the nineteenth century, and the country is commonly described as le berceau de la préhistoire, the cradle of prehistory. At the start of the twenty-first century, on the other hand, the language of international science has become, and remains, massively English.

Moreover, he con- fesses to a certain aversion to French as a language. It is not that he cannot speak the language, rather that he refuses to speak it, that he will only speak it if compelled by exceptional circumstances. In his interviews with Paul Cronin he attributes this linguistic prejudice to his inability to understand irony, which he describes as a specifically French cultural trait.Whatever we might make of this explanation, Herzog’s confession alerts us to the lines of linguistic demarcation that may separate different categories of protagonist in the film. Of the three protagonists we have considered so far, Baffier speaks in French, with an English-language voice-over, while Clottes and Geneste speak in English. Other members of the Chauvet research team—the palaeon- tologist Michel Philippe, archaeologists Carole Fritz and Gilles Tosello—also speak in French, again with voice-overs. e use of voice-over rather than subtitling can be frustrating for the bilingual viewer, as it tends to block out the original voices of the presenters. But apart from this technical consi- deration, and perhaps more fundamentally, the division in the film between French- and English-speakers seems to correlate with the difference between fact and interpretation, between the objects of science and the subjects of science. e scenes involving Baffier, Philippe, Fritz, and Tosello are the most straightforwardly factual and descriptive sequences in the film, and closest to the conventional form of the science documentary. Here we are presented with experts who explain to the audience the current state of scientific know- ledge about the contents of the Chauvet Cave. us, in an extended tour of the cave Baffier guides us from the series of positive hand-markings to the Panther Panel, the Panel of the Horses, and finally the Panel of the Big Lions. Fritz and Tosello comment on the chronology of clawmarks le on the walls by cave-dwelling bears and the different stages of composition of the Panel of the Horses. Philippe, the only palaeontologist represented in the film, reminds us of the importance of the fossil deposits on the cave floors, which provide evidence of relative frequentation by different animal species. e testimonies of these different experts provide the viewer with a select- ive but representative picture of current archaeological knowledge about the cave, and the carefully forensic approach of the scientific teams who study it. However, the director clearly does not approach these individuals in the same way that he approaches their English-speaking colleagues. With the latter, the  Cronin, Herzog on Herzog , pp. –.  In the French version of the film, voice-overs are applied to the English-speaking prota- gonists, with a symmetrically problematic elision of their voices. is is compounded by the fact that the main narrator is no longer Werner Herzog, but fellow German film-maker Volker Schlöndorff. Herzog is of course the narrator in the film’s German version, but voice-overs are applied throughout to both French- and English-speaking protagonists.  See the general plan of Chauvet Cave in La Grotte Chauvet, ed. by Clottes, p. . </page> <page sequence="6">  Science in 3-D viewer senses that there is a background dialogue between director and actor beyond what is presented on screen, that we are in contact with the subjects of science as much as with the objects of science. Because their interventions are most clearly framed by the format of the interview, these individuals are not only communicating their knowledge but also responding to questions, and therefore seem to assume a more reflexive position with respect to the established facts of their science. One of the most immediately engaging of Herzog’s protagonists in this category is the young archaeologist Julien Monney. roughout the docu- mentary, Monney is interviewed not in the cave but in an office, next to a laptop computer and facing the director, who is out of view. Responding to the latter in an accented but very proficient English, he insists on the situated humanity of the scientist: ‘I’m a scientist, but a human too.’ He describes his own subjective experience of being in the cave as so powerful that he had found it difficult to sleep following his first contact with it. Replicating what is a thematic leitmotif in Herzog, who claims that he does not dream, Monney confesses to having had recurrent dreams of lions, both real and representational (the film’s camera scans the famous Panel of the Big Lions, located in one of the deepest recesses of the cave), in which, like Daniel in the lions’ den, he was not afraid. Prompted by the director’s questioning, he reveals that he was once a circus performer, which seems to place him in a recognizable lineage of Herzogian characters who possess what might be termed a binary existence, who do not fit simply and squarely into the structures of professional identification imposed upon us by society. Despite his unusual past, and his willingness to speak of the human di- mension of science, Monney nevertheless conforms to the institutionalized division of labour of his chosen discipline. As an archaeologist, his articulate responses on the cave do not deviate from the established norms of the discip- line, and he is carefully circumspect in his interpretations. In this sense he and his French colleagues at Chauvet continue the research tradition established by Leroi-Gourhan, who was suspicious of speculations on the meaning and function of prehistoric artefacts which were not grounded in a meticulously assembled body of archaeological evidence. Leroi-Gourhan had criticized the unscientific nature of previous archaeological excavation practices, and dis- tinguished between the authentically scientific imagination which creates the means for further discovery and a more intuitive form of scientific imagi- nation based on unfounded extrapolation from the facts. In particular, he was critical of certain kinds of ethnographic comparatism, that is, interpreta-  One thinks here of the protagonists of documentaries such ase Great Ecstasy of Woodcarver Steiner (), e Dark Glow of the Mountains (), and Encounters at the End of the World (). </page> <page sequence="7">    tions of prehistoric culture based on what we know about contemporary, or historically recorded, traditional societies. If the sealed vault of Chauvet Cave and the narrow metal walkways that protect its floors can be seen as the material manifestation of this research tradition, its intellectual legacy can be observed in the collective behaviour of the research team at Chauvet. Indeed, what the director shows us in the first half of the film is a community dedicated mainly to the empirical ana- lysis and description of the facts of Chauvet. A particularly striking—and beautiful—image early in the film seems to summarize this attitude: it is a three-dimensional computer-generated topographical map of the cave based on the laser-scanning techniques of expert geometer Guy Perazio. e viewer moves through this virtual environment as if flying across a landscape, the narrator explaining that ‘is map is the basis for all of the scientific pro- jects being done here.’ While Herzog’s perspective in the film is not an anti-scientific one—he seems on the contrary to be fascinated by the array of analytical techniques available to the twenty-first-century archaeologist— his question to Monney immediately following this sequence crystallizes the viewer’s own questions. e laser-scanned representation of the cave, he sug- gests, is like the Manhattan telephone directory; it is a total topographical description of the cave, but tells us nothing about its prehistoric visitors: ‘Do they dream, do they cry at night, what are their hopes, what are their fami- lies?’, he asks. Monney has already explained that this type of measurement is the starting point but not the goal of the Chauvet research project, which is to create ‘stories’ about Palaeolithic existence derived from the scientific evidence, but he cannot of course respond to Herzog’s question. He describes the prehistoric past as irretrievable, and instead speaks to the existential ques- tion of how he or Herzog as human beings can relate to its remains. His own dreams of lions did not scare him at all, and gave him a deeper, non-scientific intuition of the nature of the cave: ‘It was more a feeling of powerful things and deep things, a way to understand things which is not a direct way.’ Herzog’s elicitation of the human dimension of science through his dia- logue with Monney is only the starting point of the film’s investigation of Chauvet. It does not exhaust the metaphysical impulse which is characteristic of Herzog as a director, but which is also the characteristic impulse of the audience he is mediating—a phenomenon such as Chauvet naturally generates a demand for meaning. As the film unfolds, this meaning is slowly introduced  See e.g. the introduction to Leroi-Gourhan’s Les Religions de la préhistoire (Paris: Presses Universitaires de France, ), pp. –.  Jean Clottes is critical of this tendency in post-war French prehistory, describing it as ‘un empirisme trompeur et sans ambition’ which prefers to ‘laisser les faits parler par eux-mêmes’. If such research is able to establish the ‘what?’, ‘when?’, and ‘how?’ of prehistoric art, it fails to address the question of its ‘why?’, of its possible meanings (Pourquoi l’art préhistorique?, pp. , –, –). </page> <page sequence="8">  Science in 3-D through the guiding voice of its narrator, in dialogue with the voices of his English-speaking interlocutors—the presence of French-speaking specialists ends more or less literally with Dominique Baffier’s guided tour of the cave, just short of the first half of the film. In order properly to understand Chauvet, it is necessary to look at the wider material culture in which the paintings at Chauvet participated. In the following sequence, Jean-Michel Geneste shows us two examples of portable art, replicas of a ‘Venus’ and a lion-headed male figure fromHohlenstein-Stadel in the Swabian Alps. Leaving France and tran- scending historically defined borders, the camera takes us to the Prehistoric Museum of Blaubeuren, also in southern Germany, where archaeologist Ni- cholas Conard demonstrates the Venus of Hohle Fels, the oldest example of Palaeolithic figurative art, which replicates part of the visual theme of a hybrid bison-woman representation found in Chauvet Cave.e didactic content of these sequences is that there is a common cultural complex linking archae- ological sites in modern-day France and Germany, but this is accompanied by what may be described as meta-empirical speculation on what these artefacts might tell us about the beings who made them.us Geneste asks whether the lion-headed figure represents the spirit of the lion in anthropomorphic form, a marriage of human and animal, or an entirely new being, while Conard pro- poses that such artefacts are clear evidence of ‘a religious concept involving the transformation between humans and animals’. As the camera adopts a high aerial perspective, pointing north in a breathtaking vista along the Ar- dèche river towards south-western Germany, the narrator himself proposes that the art at Chauvet ‘was not a primitive beginning, or a slow evolution, it rather burst onto the scene like a sudden explosive event. It is as if the modern human soul had awakened here.’ He continues: ‘Even more astonishing to consider is that at the time Neanderthal man still roamed this valley.’ It would be easy to dismiss this commentary as the first-person reflections of a metaphysically minded director, but in fact it replicates at least one side of the received wisdom among prehistorians on the origins of so-called ‘modern’ humanity.is particular interpretation of the archaeological evidence argues for a relatively rapid development in the cognitive and cultural capacities of Homo sapiens around the period of Chauvet, a phase of transition frequently described by specialists as an ‘explosion’. If they certainly would not use the term ‘soul’, these specialists nevertheless refer to the Palaeolithic ‘mind’ or Palaeolithic ‘cognition’ as the outstanding adaptive trait defining ‘modern’ humans. If it is difficult to accept Herzog’s dramatized image of Neander-  Apart from its effectiveness in the representation of the internal space of the cave, mentioned above, the haptic potential of 3-D also becomes evident in the sequences in which different specialists handle artefacts as they explain their significance or mode of construction.  See e.g. Randall White, Prehistoric Art: e Symbolic Journey of Humankind (New York: Abrams, ), pp. –. </page> <page sequence="9">    thals ‘roaming’ a landscape inhabited by more civilized Cro-Magnons, his interpretation is subsequently reiterated and confirmed in scientific mode by the archaeologist Conard, who states quite categorically that Neanderthals, despite their ‘sophistication’, never possessed the kind of symbolic artefacts in evidence at Chauvet and the sites in southern Germany.is genetic discri- mination, this need to distinguish between different categories of the human, reveals the metaphysical impulse at work within the discipline itself, the com- pulsion to address the fundamental questions of essence and of origin: who or what are we; when, where, and how did we begin? What makes us human? And therefore implicitly, by way of opposition: what is not (quite) human? rough his scientific protagonists, Herzog carefully lays out the defining features of the (modern) human (soul). Chauvet has given us the example of sophisticated graphic representation, while the caves in Germany yield evi- dence of portable objects with symbolic significance. e German caves also contain evidence of what is defined as another essential feature of emergent human creativity: music. Here, Conard is the perfect ambassador for his dis- cipline, reminding us that ‘archaeology today is not a heroic adventure with spades and picks, but high-tech scientific work that’s done with incredible detail’. He illustrates his point by asking fellow archaeologist Maria Malina to demonstrate how she reconstructed an ivory flute from tiny fragments of bone found dispersed in a cave located in the same region as Hohle Fels. But while the scientist reconstructs the flute, Herzog calls upon another prota- gonist, the experimental archaeologist Wulf Hein, to play it. It is here that the documentary appears to deviate somewhat from its hitherto predominant mode of science communication. Filmed next to the entrance of the cave at Geissenklösterle, Hein is dressed from head to toe in a costume made of reindeer skins; compared with the university-based archaeologists we have seen so far, his appearance is relatively unkempt. We as viewers know that Herzog as a director is intuitively drawn to this kind of character, and we recognize his type. His appearance injects a certain degree of levity into a film which until now has unfolded mainly in the registers of muted fascination and reverence. Hein plays ‘e Star-Spangled Banner’ on a replica Palaeolithic flute. While Hein’s performance is a pleasure to watch, it would be mislead- ing simply to file him away under the category of the eccentric Herzogian character. As the self-description ‘experimental archaeologist’ suggests, his specialization is the attempted reconstruction of the behaviour of Palaeolithic humans, in particular aspects of their material culture. In a sense, it could be said that his function is to bring us down to earth, to the everyday existence that would have surrounded exceptional sites such as Chauvet, and to the outside world: the myth of cave-dwelling humans is an enduring one. His </page> <page sequence="10">  Science in 3-D flute-playing demonstrates the cognitive continuum linking us to prehistoric humans—he is able to play ‘e Star-Spangled Banner’ on the flute because it is pentatonic. But equally significantly, his performance brings us a step closer to what up to this point has been a missing dimension of the film: the question of technology. Hein may be slightly unkempt, but he is well dressed, and his reindeer suit is exquisitely tailored. As he explains, evoking with a sweep of his hand the glacier-filled landscape of the Upper Palaeolithic, the climate in this part of Europe would have been an exacting one, and the suit, like Inuit clothing, is the signifier of an advanced technical culture, perfectly adapted to its environment. Contrary to appearances, the para-institutional character of Hein does not therefore depart from the film’s main scientific narrative, but provides it with an additional dimension. Structurally, the film stages its return from Germany to France through the character of Maurice Maurin, a retired master perfumer who was for some years chair of the French Society of Perfumers: ‘Back in France, near Chauvet Cave, explorers using more primal techniques in search of hidden under- ground chambers roam the landscape.’ Maurin is filmed with his head close to the ground, smelling the rocks, then turns to face the camera. Even less than Wulf Hein does this character belong to the institutionalized structures in which the majority of the film’s protagonists operate; it is difficult to ima- gine him as a participant in a more conventional documentary on Chauvet. But again, the inclusion of this character, immediately following that of Hein, has its own intrinsic logic. Speaking in French—this is the only voice-over in the second half of the film—Maurin correctly explains that explorers locate underground cave complexes by searching for tell-tale air currents emanating from the landscape. e narrator then adds that ‘ere are plans to build a theme park for tourists with a precise replica of the cave a few miles from here.is replica may even contain a recreation of the odour of the prehistoric interior.’ e character of Maurin therefore functions as a kind of poetic con- densation of objective practice, that of the speleologists who discovered the cave and that of the experts who aim—doubtless exploiting the laser-scanning techniques presented earlier in the film—to reconstruct the total environment of Chauvet. But, echoing what Monney says about his dreams, he also seems to represent an alternative way of exploring Chauvet: ‘It’s a matter of try- ing to experience it in a different manner.’ While specialists such as Conard demonstrate the ‘high-tech scientific work’ of archaeological reconstruction, Maurin, an individual who has spent a lifetime refining his sense of smell, and who, like Neanderthal man, roams the landscape, uses ‘more primal tech-  ere is a very brief reference to flint tools just before Geneste’s demonstration of the Venus and lion-headed figures.  See Jean-Marie Chauvet, Éliette Brunel Deschamps, and Christian Hillaire, La Grotte Chauvet à Vallon Pont-d’Arc (Paris: Seuil, ), p. . </page> <page sequence="11">    niques’ of exploration. His research, predicated on one of the more viscerally immediate of the senses, extends our thinking about Chauvet beyond the instrument-mediated analysis of what has endured—flint, bone, decorated rock—reminding us of the more evanescent realities of a disappeared world. e two relatively more eccentric characters in Herzog’s film, Hein and Maurin, are presented in sequence and back to back. Structurally, they func- tion as a point of transition, a signpost which points us in the direction of the film’s conclusion. In line with Herzog’s alternating dialectic between inside and outside, once more we enter the space of the cave, this time without the mediating guidance of the experts. It is at this point that the narrator refers to his team’s sense of being watched, as if they were disturbing the Palaeolithic people in their work. e sanctuary of Chauvet elicits an ecstatic response—a number of scenes show different protagonists transfixed in contemplation— but it can also become oppressive: ‘It was a relief to surface again above ground.’ e concluding sequences of the film are mainly staged outside, in the landscape surrounding Chauvet, and could be said to constitute an argument, or perhaps more precisely a play of perspectives, in the manner of Flaubert. Appropriately, the metaphysical impulse that runs through the film is given its most focused expression in these closing sequences, as the principal English-speaking protagonists in their turn speak to the meaning of Chauvet. e first sequence takes place in the vineyards of the film’s opening scene. Here, Jean-Michel Geneste demonstrates the hunting techniques of Palaeo- lithic peoples. e camera focuses on his hands as he indicates the different points of articulation of a spear: its sharp point constructed from bone; the forked joint and tight binding which fix the point to a long sha made of wood. In a gesture enhanced by 3-D projection, Geneste thrusts forward with the spear, demonstrating its effectiveness as an instrument made to kill. e demonstration, however, does not end here. Geneste points to the feathers at the base of the spear, designed to stabilize its flight when thrown. e tool then becomes a machine as he explains the principle of the spear-thrower, which when attached to the base of the spear, allows the thrower both to amp- lify the power of the throw and increase its precision. Geneste demonstrates this advanced projectile technology by launching the spear some distance into the rows of vines. ough his demonstration is gently mocked by the director, who presumes that the Palaeolithic hunter would have been more effective, the purpose of this sequence is clear. At this comparatively late stage in the film, like Wulf Hein’s costumed re-enactment, it brings us closer to the total human fact of Chauvet Cave, to the material conditions of possibility of hu- man aesthetic production, that is, advanced human technics. In anticipation </page> <page sequence="12">  Science in 3-D of the following sequence, let us simply call this particular manifestation of the human Homo technicus. Following another brief interlude in the cave, our next sequence is again filmed outside, with the other elder protagonist Jean Clottes. Unlike Geneste, Clottes is not demonstrating something—he is not, to paraphrase Leroi- Gourhan, combining gesture and speech. He is simply talking, or rather, professing. Clottes speculates that like traditional peoples, humans of the Palaeolithic period would not have had the same rationalistic attitude as ourselves towards the material world. In an English whose formulations ap- pear idiomatically French, he uses the concepts of fluidity and permeability to characterize Palaeolithic mentality. Fluidity refers to what would have been the relative lack of distinction between different categories of object or being. us the human can become animal or the animal human, the animal or hu- man can become an object, and so on. Permeability refers to the abolition of boundaries between the material and spiritual worlds. A shaman, for example, is able to visit supernatural spirits in other worlds or receive visits from them. Together, these two concepts give us a sense of the radical difference between the lives of prehistoric peoples and our own. Clottes concludes that our self- characterization asHomo sapiens is not a valid one—‘we don’t know, we don’t knowmuch’—preferring the descriptionHomo spiritualis. e director’s foot- note to this argument is the shot of a bear skull placed on a rock, pointing towards the cave entrance, commenting that it is the strongest evidence in the cave of human activities with a potentially spiritual signification: ‘e staging seems deliberate.’ However, he adds: ‘What exactly took place here only the paintings can tell us.’ Jean Clottes’s definition of Homo spiritualis is not specific to Herzog’s film. It is part of a wider hypothesis about Palaeolithic culture which he has formulated over a number of years in collaboration with the South African ar- chaeologist David Lewis-Williams. In their co-authored booke Shamans of Prehistory, originally published in French in , Clottes and Lewis-Williams argue that prehistoric cave art needs to be understood in the context of sha- manic practices specific to traditional hunter-gatherer societies. Adopting a neurophysiological and ethnographic-comparative perspective, they propose that the altered states of consciousness and out-of-body experiences of the shaman are human universals, with an identifiable structure and sequence across cultures. If one accepts the anatomical and neurological modernity of Palaeolithic humans, it follows that the shamanic experience would have been the same for them. It is therefore possible to argue that a certain num- ber of representations found in prehistoric cave art are of shamanic origin,  Le Geste et la parole, : Technique et langage; : La Mémoire et les rythmes (Paris: Michel, –). </page> <page sequence="13">    the graphical expression of the geometric figures and animal-hybrid forms perceived at different stages of the hallucinatory experience. Clottes and Lewis-Williams’s theory has been a controversial one, and it is not my intention here to comment on its coherence or its ultimate validity; my interest is rather in its place in the speculative economy of Herzog’s film. On the one hand, it would seem that the voices of director and protago- nist are convergent regarding the definition of Homo spiritualis; they com- bine in an attempt to answer the question of the metaphysical status of the paintings at Chauvet. e final intervention of Julien Monney following this sequence seems to confirm this interpretation, as he gives the comparative- ethnographic example of an Aboriginal wall-painter who insists that it is not he himself who is painting, but the hand of the ‘spirit’ who is painting through him. On the other hand, in terms of sequencing, this evaluation of what-makes-us-human is presented back to back with the demonstration of Homo technicus by Jean-Michel Geneste. is sequencing or staging could be read as dialectical, in the sense of Homo spiritualis representing both the an- tithesis and the sublation of Homo technicus, but it can also be read in a more Flaubertian sense, as a play of perspectives on the human. As always, every- thing is in the sequencing, and the staging seems deliberate. Significantly, the film does not conclude with Clottes’s assertion of Homo spiritualis. e final intervention is in fact made by Jean-Michel Geneste. Here, as in an early sequence of the film, Geneste is filmed outside, sitting with the Pont d’Arc behind him. In his inimitable voice, Herzog asks Geneste the most impossible question, the question concerning the origin and foundations of ‘modern’ humanity: ‘Do you think that the paintings in Chauvet Cave were somehow the beginning of the modern human soul? What constitutes hu- manness?’ Geneste does not respond to this question directly, or rather, he responds to the second element of the question, the question of ‘humanness’, discreetly leaving aside the question of the ‘beginning’ or the ‘modern’. His response is first Darwinian and materialist. Humanness is an effective adapta- tion to landscape and the beings that inhabit the landscape, animals and other human groups. Humanness is also the capacity to communicate something, to ‘inscribe’ memory on specific things such as walls, wood, and bones. is, he proposes, is the invention of Cro-Magnon. On Herzog’s prompting, he agrees that music and mythology are also specifically human attributes, but keeps firmly to the concepts of communication and memory, qualifying that the figuration of animals, of humans, and of things is a way of communicating between humans, using the future to evoke the past, to transmit information in a more stable form than oral communication.  See Jean Clottes and David Lewis-Williams, Les Chamanes de la préhistoire: transe et magie dans les grottes ornées (Paris: Seuil, ).

In a co-authored book on Lascaux, published in , Geneste explores precisely this idea of Palaeolithic art as inscription, as a form of collective memory. Symptomati- cally, he and his co-authors are sceptical about the Clottes–Lewis-Williams hypothesis concerning the shamanic origins of some of the cave paintings: visions experienced in a state of trance, they argue, are an ephemeral pheno- menon, whereas the animal figures at sites such as Lascaux are not dissociable and form complex ensembles linked to diverse aspects of social and individual experience.e book questions the idea of a sudden and dramatic ‘explo- sion’ or ‘revolution’ in human development during the Upper Palaeolithic. While accepting that the graphic representations and signs that appear in the archaeological record between , and , years  are indicative of a qualitative shi in human cognition, the authors prefer to situate the emergence of art within the incomparably longer duration of the evolution of technology. e appearance of human technics four million years ago was the material condition of possibility of an extended history of human thought conceived as successive stages in the formalization of memory. Taken together, the different appearances of Jean-Michel Geneste in Herzog’s film seem to represent a cumulative demonstration of this argument, which functions as the virtual counterpoint of Jean Clottes’s subordination of Homo sapiens–Homo technicus to Homo spiritualis. From this perspective, the response to Clottes’s assertion that ‘we don’t know, we don’t know much’ would be that we do know, that we in fact know more and more, and that this was already the case for the Palaeolithic humans who are the question mark of Herzog’s documentary. e hunting instruments demonstrated by Geneste in the landscape next to Chauvet are clear evidence of the advanced state of technical development during the Upper Palaeolithic, a development which cannot be separated from evidence of behaviour of a more ‘spiritual’ nature: Homo sapiens is Homo technicus is Homo spiritualis. In what is one of the more stylized moments of the film, Geneste concludes his definition of ‘humanness’ by pointing at the camera which is filming him: despite the temporal distance between them, the grammatological ‘in- vention’ of Cro-Magnon is structurally no different from our contemporary audio-visual recording technologies. At this point, the film cuts to the point- of-view of the miniature remote-controlled aircra which has been filming, in three dimensions, the different aerial perspectives shown in the documen- tary.

Earlier in the film, the director described the multiple depictions of a bison leg or rhino horn as a kind of ‘proto-cinema’, ‘like frames in an animated film’, while he and Geneste together comment on a scene from Swing Time () depicting Fred Astaire dancing with his shadows, linking this twentieth-century example of visual truquage with prehistoric humans’ manipulation of light and shadow in caves. A less explicit scene, unobtrusive in its banality but revealing in terms of what it shows us, depicts members of the French research team—some ten or so individuals—at work in a room near Chauvet. As the camera pans across the room, the surface narrative comments on how the intellectual division of labour between the scientists is counterbalanced by the collaborative and interdisciplinary nature of their work: ‘Although they each have their special field, they compare and combine their findings.’ However, the film’s mediation of this twenty-first-century en- vironment, in which the majority of the protagonists are seated, takes on a more salient meaning for the viewer as we see that it is entirely populated with screens. e two archaeologists that Herzog extracts from this seated community (Carole Fritz and Gilles Tosello, referred to above) are standing, visibly for the purposes of their presentation, next to an Apple Macintosh computer monitor. On one level, their demonstration is simply part of the didactic convention of the science documentary, that of the expert explaining to the public the detail of his or her specific area of research. On another level, we as viewers become aware of the abysmal nature of this scene, the fact that we are looking at a representation of a representation of a representation—the environmental punctuation, or framing, of the prehistoric painting sublated in the computer-generated framing of its composition sublated in the cinematic framing of the scene of scientific demonstration. From the long-durational perspective of human-technological evolution, these nested representations can be seen as simply variations on the technical theme of framing. What links us with Palaeolithic humans is our capacity and compulsion to window the world, to selectively project its features onto a suitably sanctified screen or space. What distinguishes us from them is our terminal existence, our </page> <page sequence="16">  Science in 3-D predominantly sedentary and solitary postures as operators of the keyboard and computer. To conclude, we have shown how Cave of Forgotten Dreams, while remain- ing true to the objective standards of the science documentary, also manages to integrate the human dimension of the subjects of science, eliciting from its protagonists confessions of a more existential or metaphysical nature which combine with Herzog’s own voice and vision to produce something which seems to be more than the sum of its constituent parts. In this respect, the film captures the epistemological ambivalence of the discipline of prehistory itself, which as one of the human sciences is bound to the most rigorous standards of objective verification, but which as a human science is in the final instance compelled to respond to the demand for meaning.e film’s highly structured staging of its protagonists provides us with a multidimensional view of the discipline, from the careful empiricism of members of the research team at Chauvet to the more speculative testimonies of individuals such as Clottes and Geneste. Viewed as a kind of philosophical essay, it is not clear that the film reaches any definitive resting place in terms of explanation or argument; like the flying perspective that is a persistent theme in Herzog’s films, it seems restlessly to visit the different polarities of our relationship to Chauvet.e signature Herzogian ‘postscript’ to the film seems to confirm this relativity of perspective. In a quasi-science-fictional scenario, albino crocodiles in a tropical greenhouse barely twenty miles from Chauvet, their environment warmed by the excess heat from a nearby nuclear power station, are imagined reaching the flooded cave, the narrator’s voice-over asking what they would make of the paintings. However, this is not the film’s final image. As the credits proceed in time with Reijseger’s music, the camera freezes on one of the many negative hand-markings found on the cave walls. Like the hundreds of abstract signs which accompany the paintings at Chauvet, these markings have not been mentioned in the film itself. If we were to give any interpre- tation to this final image, it would have to be that it represents something like the analogical signature of the human, a signifier of the anatomical variation which, a long time before Cro-Magnon, first distinguished humans from the animals around them.
