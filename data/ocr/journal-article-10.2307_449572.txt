<plain_text><page sequence="1">Florimell and Marinell W I L I A M B LI S S E T THE MYTH OF FLORIMELL and Marinell within the moral structure of The Faerie Queene: to attempt such a study is certainly to "thrust into the middest of things"; wheth- er one can make a "pleasing analysis of all" remains to be seen. The Faerie Queene has the reputation of being a diffuse poem, ancd the story of Florimell aLA Marinell begins at the point at which clearly defined structure leaves off. It is narrated by means of interruped episodes, and it stretches-"sprawls," if you in- sist-over three of the middle books of the poem. And yet, if the spirit of finesse is more proper to Spenser than the spirit of geometry, perhaps an examination of this part of his work may bring us to a vantage point for a revaluation of his work. The task of analysis is immediately doubled by the use of the word "myth." W. B. Yeats in his selection of Spenser was content to speak of "the sad story of Florimell and Marinell." It may in the end be sufficient to say that Spenser presents a myth of the turning year, original to himself but bearing some relation to such existing patterns as Proserpine and Adonis.l But it is not sufficient at the beginning; let us begin-first with the structure, then the myth within the structure. The overriding quests and incidental adventures of the Red- crosse Knight and Sir Guyon show forth fully and sequentially the theological virtue of Holiness and the natural virtue of Temperance.2 The first two books taken together, display struc- tural resemblances (the second to the first) that are better de- scribed as sustained symmetry than as occasional parallelism. To take an example: when Guyon and the Palmer, early in their story, come upon two victims of an evil enchantress, we cannot help recalling that the Redcross Knight, early in his quest, had learned the fate of Fradubio and Fraelissa, trans- formed into trees. In the earlier episode the hero had been quite unable to help the victims and indeed unaware that the Lady he was escorting was the enchantress Duessa herself. Guyon in contrast, on hearing the story of the death of Mordant from the lNorthrop Frye, Anatomy of Criticism (Princeton, 1957), pp. 138, 153, 160; "The Structure of Imagery in The Faerie Queene,") UTO, XXX (1961), 123. 2A.

Fradubio's story had told of the hideousness of the true form and nature of the Witch, a descrip- tion later visibly corroborated; but in the second book it is enough to have Acrasia's malice and cruelty established by the suffer- ing of her victims and to rely on the association with Duessa to seep through from the first book and taint her beauty when she appears, for that beauty must be displayed as "the utmost that vice promises to her followers." Again, late in their careers the two knights undergo, and al- most fail to survive, their most serious trials when separated from their guides. Despair in the guise of an old man, though himself repellent, offers the Redcross Knight the last evil that can yet be made to seem good-abdication from battle-but at the cost of giving up the possibility of holiness, of denying his own true identity. Mammon, likewise a gloomy and ugly old man, offers a similar temptation to Guyon-riches and power in this world, which seem to make the effort of temperance unnecessary. Normally, the guardian of a subterranean hoard would be a dwarf or a dragon. Spenser seems to have departed from this convention in order to balance the figure of Despair, the usual motifs appearing in subordinate roles, for Guyon is followed by a fiend and sees troops of deformed artisans at work. Moreover, we recall that the Redcross Knight should never have been drawn into conversation with Despair, and so we are brought to think (by the structure, even thus isolated from the morality) that Guyon should not have found himself inspecting Mammon's Cave. Perhaps Colin's motto as he composed the Legend of Temper- ance should have been mutatis mutandis. He sustains the analogy of nature as commensurate wih grace, Aristotelian ethics with revealed religion, through the twelve cantos, though with ever increasing tension-especially at the end when he shows the final enemy of the temperate man as no longer simply the good in bad measure but as perils of the soul, pictured in apocalyptic imagery as beasts from the sea and a harlot-enchantress. Thus he bends the conclusion of Book II into parallel with Book I, while all the time lavishing upon the Bower and its mistress a sensuous beauty completely tangential to the disclosed hideous- ness of Duessa and the Dragon. The effect of the destruction of the Bower is like the sight of a pendulum arrested at its 88</page><page sequence="3">WILLIAM BLIS S E T T furthest outward swing. No wonder that those readers who start with "A gentle knight was pricking on the plain" and end with "Let Grill be Grill and have his hoggish mind" complain of a feeling of dissatisfaction, even of outrage, as they close the book. But Spenser is the poet of the second thought: his normal practice is to arrange polarized or complementary episodes and persons so as to present a certain total conception. The deepest and strongest impressions are made first in The Faerie Queene, but they are followed by finer ones calculated to right any im- balance of feeling. Spenser thus makes dialectical progress, or, to use one of his own favorite images, advances by tacking like a sailing vessel. The main reason that the elaborate sylnmmetry sustained be- tween the first two books cannot move toward any full close is the fact that the quests of the two knights are presented struc- turally as complementary whereas in actual experience they diverge widely. It is true that the first two books are books of edification,Bildungsromanens in the order of grace the Redcross Knight's experience in the House of Coelia, and in the order of nature Guyon's in the House of Alma, constitute the great instauration of the ensuing poem. But the Redcross Knight in achieving his quest arrives at the true center of his being, mar- riage with Una in the redeemed kingdom. The devastated Bower of Bliss is far from the true center of Goyon's being, rather the anti-center, the furthest removed from the countenance of Glori- ana depicted on his shield. Acrasia has exerted all her power- a supernatural power falsely appearing natural3-in order to usurp thle center of human concern, to make her Bower appear a world-navel, a paradise; but Guyon and the Palmer expose it at the end as peripheral, as indeed nowhere. That exposure closes the second book, but in such a manner as to demand con- tinuation and compensation. If the Bower of Bliss is a deceit, what is the reality of which it is a counterfeit? That is the obligatory question that the poet must answer, and it alone would be sufficient to account for his choice of Chastity as the titular virtue of the next book. Now, assuming that most of the materials actually used in Books III and IV were present in Spenser's mind at the time that he fin- 3Harry Berger, Jr., calls her a "demonic allegorist" in The Allegorical Temper (Yale, 1958), Chapter 10. 89</page><page sequence="4">FLORIMELL AND MARIN E L L ished the Book of Temperance,4 one may consider the struc- tural possibilities open to him when embarking on the Legend of Chastity. The most obvious one, of course, is to repeat the pattern that has already worked well twice, though with some stress the second time. What would that entail, specifically? At the outset the Knight of Chastity, Britomart, would hear the complaint of Scudamore of the abduction of his young wife Amoret, as Guyon had heard the story of Mordant and Amavia. As Guyon had moved thereafter to the House of Medina to witness and join in a display of temperance as the golden mean between excess and defect, so Britomart would need to be as- sociated in a similarly explicit and elementary tableau of chas- tity and its opposites. There is nothing like this in Book III; leave it for a moment. The nymphomanic giantess Argante and the homosexual giant Ollyphant might easily have been give enough weight to balance the intemperate villains Cymo- chles and Pyrochles. Idle Phaedria and promiscuous Malecasta are a younger and an elder sister, and are rejected with similar polite distaste by the two heroes. Britomart's vision of Artegall and the promise of future greatness to their descendants might, if removed to the position of the chronicles in the House of Alma, not only balance that episode but serve as a connecting link with the present fifth book-the allegory of love issuing into the allegory of history through the marriage of chastity and justice. And, fortified in her chaste love of right, Britomart could successfully achieve her quest, the rescue of Amoret from the most insidious and iniquitous enemy of nuptial joy and fruit- fulness, the most costly luxury of the leisure class, that con- spicious waste of life that we have come to call courtly love. Such is the chief rejected possibility, the book that Spenser did not write. It would have been a notably thinner book than its predecessor, we notice, lacking anything to balance the HIouse of Medina and (what is more important) lacking a counterpart to the episodes of Despair and Mammon and the subsequent rescue of the two earlier heroes by Arthur. Nor is this an over- sight. The very nature of Spenser's conception of chastity as spontaneous and intuitive makes it superfluous to show its Knight as deliberately choosing or explicitly defending her virtue; and his conception of the virtue as invulnerable and his 4See Josephine W. Bennett, The Evolution of The Faerie Queene (Chicago, 1942), esp. Chapter 18. 90</page><page sequence="5">WI L L I A M B L I S S E T T embodiment of it in a woman-a woman in armor--makes it difficult to imagine a situation from which she would have to be rescued. Suggest never so subtly and persuasively to Brito- mart that she should offer "tea and sympathy" to some calum- niated young knight, and see how her rather full virgin lips curl as she reaches for her sword. Moreover, the difficulty that we have noticed about CGuyon's quest, that it is outward and not homeward bound, ending in destruction not in joyous reward, would be made more acute if the Legend of Chastity thus organized failed to supply the missing counterbalance to the Bower of Bliss but offered in- stead a similarly placed House of Busirane, that no less demands a counterbalance of its own. The two compensations in the poem as we have it are of course the Garden of Adonis in Book III and the Temple of Venus in Book IV, but they are neither of them structurally symmetrical with anything in Book II. The Garden of Adolnis, placed as it is in the middle canto of the third book, is related to the Bower not by structural symmetry but by thematic polarity. The warm glowing mys- terious centrality of its presence alone would preclude the structural possibility that we have been examining. But it is not alone. In the very first canto Florimell crosses the scene like a blazing star, and all perpendicular parallels, even the division into books, are abandoned as her story and that of Marinell flow through the Legends of Chastity and Friendship to end that of Justice. Florimell is often identified with Angelica, the fugitive heroine of the Orlando Furioso, and the narrative technique that her appearance introduces, the advancement of several stories by interrupted sequence, is rightly traced to Ariosto. Any moral allegory must, however, take account of Florimell's constancy and Angelica's inconstancy in love, and my interpretation will concentrate on a mythical quality that she possesses and An- gelica largely lacks. I am convinced further that Spenser adopted the appearance of Ariosto's narrative technique in order to do something quite original with it-not simply to achieve nar- rative suspense, but to afford free movement within the heart- land of his poem by polarizing characters, events, and themes. Britomart has unseated Guyon, and Prince Arthur has recon- ciled the two momentary foes "through goodly temperance and affection chaste." Just as the moral allegory is plain as day, 91</page><page sequence="6">2 FL 0 R I E L L A N D M A R I N E L L Spenser changes the lighting and introduces symbolism from the twilight threshold of consciousness. The three friends leave fa- miliar territory behind them and ride far into strange lands, entering at length into a vast forest "whose hideous horror and sad trembling sound ful griesly seem'd" The stage is set for the sudden appearance of Florimell in terrified flight: Still as she fled, her eyes she backward threw, As fearing evill, that pursewd her fast; And her faire yellow locks behind her flew, Loosely disperst with puffe of every blast: All as a blazing starre doth farre outcast His hearie beames, and flaming lockes dispred, At sight whereof the people stand aghast: But the sage wisard telles, as he has red, That it importunes death and doleful drerihed.. (III.1.16) It is this change of key that checks us from identifying the new figure as simple an allusion to Ariosto's Angelica or as a type of womanhood in distress through lack of fortitude and inner resourcefulness. We are told later that her sufferings are "cause- less, of her own accord" and that not even the hardest heart will reprove her. She is a victim of Fortune, "that cruell Queene avengeresse," that is, of Nature at her most baffling; and from the beginning she is dissociated from moral types and associated with strange and terrible natural forces. Her companions ride off to the aid of Florimell, but Brito- mart's heart is filled with the thought of Artegall, and, having come to a seacoast, she sighs deeply, comparing the cruel billows and tumultuous winds of the scene before her to the sea of pas- sion by which the frail vessel of her soul is tossed within. Upon the Britoness, declaiming thus in full-throated operatic style (the passage derives from Tasso; so does grand opera), comes an armed knight, forbidding her access to his strand. Disdaining his threats, Britomart challenges him to combat, and in short order the knight tumbles to the ground and wallows in his blood. The stanza that identifies him likens his suffering to that of a beast in a sacrificial rite: Like as the sacred Oxe, that carelesse stands, With gilden homes, and flowry girlonds crownd, Proud of his dying honor and deare bands, 92</page><page sequence="7">WV I L L I A M B L I S S E T T Whiles th'altars fume with frankincense around, All suddenly with mortall stroke astownd, Doth groveling fall, and with his streaming gore Distaines the pillours, and the holy ground, And the faire flowres, that decked him afore; So fell proud Marinell upon the pretious shore. (III14.17) Britomart rides away, for she owes Marinell nothing; she takes with her that air of heightened matter-of-factness that the poem always has when she is present. The birth and upbringing of Marinell are now described, the poet here, as before in the case of Satyrane, taking a lenient view of the peccadilloes of his heroes' parents. With the blandest abstention from moral com- ment he tells how Marinell's mother, the nymph Cymoent, was discovered asleep one day by the famous Dumarin, who "was taken with her love, and by her closely lay." Her con- ception of a son is the most natural thing in the world. Marinell in manhood grows to be a great lord not only through his strength at arms but through his riches, to the protection of which all his powers are directed. We learn that the treasures of the sea have been poured upon his strand, and we cannot help noticing that he possesses wealth and the cares of wealth without per- forming any useful labor or knightly service. His mother has been less than happy in her attempt to form the character and direct the life of her son. Cymoent has learned from wise Pro- teus that a "virgin strange and stout him should dismay, or kill," and Marinell on her solicitous advice abjures love and, as a result of unrelenting watchfulness over useless tieasure, begins to take on an unknightly, a churlish character. In Milton's un- approving sense, we may term Florimells a fugitive, MarinZ ell's a cloistered virtue. His anxious pacing up and down the strand of gems may be taken in moral allegory to characterize a life contracted to a narrow and self-regarding range of ex- perience, utterly ungenerous, and devoted neither to time nor eternity. The most fortunate thing that could have happened to Marinell is his encounter with Britomart, in which false celibacy is overcome by true chastity. What, however, is to be made of the stanzas that tell of how the sea-nymph, gathering daffodils, receives the news of her son's mishap? 93</page><page sequence="8">F L O R I M E LL AND M A R 1 N E L L She flong, and her faire deawy lockes yrent, To sorrow huge she turnd her former play, And gamesome merth to grievous dreriment: She trew her selfe downe on the continent, Ne word did speak, but lay as in a swowne, Eftsoones both flowres and girlonds farre away Whiles all her sisters did for her lament, With yelling outcries, and with shrieking sowne; And every one did teare her girlond from her crowne. (111.4.30) It is a ritual of grief: a year-hero has received a deadly wound, flowers are falling, women are wailing, and the elements suffer like passion. And yet, as the sorrowing mother leads a chorus in symmetric gestures of lamentation, the effect is tempered with comedy, for the very elaborateness of the repetition (like the stanzas having to do with Priamond and Diamond and Triamond) makes the feeling unserious, and so prepares the reader for Marinell's eventual recovery and the happy issue out of all his afflictions: Soone as she up out of her deadly fit Arose, shee bad her charet to be brought, And all her sisters, that with her did sit, Bad eke attonce their charets to be sought; Tho full of bitter griefe and pensive thought, She to her wagon clombe; clombe all the rest, And forth together went, with sorrow fraught. The waves obedient to their beheast, Them yielded readie passage, and their rage surceast. (III.4.31) As Cymoent and her attendants remove the wounded man from the shore and take him to a submarine bower, a place of con- cealment and care, the story of Marinell has left the context of moralizing about love of wealth and avaricious celibacy and en- tered the context of myth. By this I do not mean that Spenser is simply making use of classical mythology, though the alert reader will have re- cognized in the sea-nymph and her concern for her mortal son a version of Thetis and Achilles:5 each consults the prophetic 5See H. G. Lotspeich in Variorum III, 240; also Isabel E.

More generally, the wounding and recovery of Marinell recalls the pattern of the dying and reviving god that we associate with Adonis. But over and above such parallels, I would argue that Spenser is a mythmaker in his own right. Mythmaking is an act of intelligence,6 a form of "invention" in the old sense of discovery, disclosure of something that is there all the time-sensibly perceptible resemblances between external world-process and inner experience, whereby the outer world is brought to focus within, the inner projected outward. What the shape of Spenser's myth is to be must await further news of Florimell. Renowned throughout faerieland for beauty and virtue, "for none alive but joy'd in Florimell," to none of her suitors does she give her love: it is devoted entirely to Marin- ell, who has set no store by it at all-"Dy who so list for him, he was loves enimy." On hearing of his grievous wound, Flori- mell four days since has left the court in order to discover him, alive or dead. At the cost of discrepancy in the narrative, Spen- ser has linked Florimell's flight and Marinell's wound. Her flight takes her into a landscape of folklore, and she sees what is a familiar sight there-a little smoke curling through the treetops. Anyone acquainted with the Odyssey or with Han- sel and Gretel will know what to expect-a sylvan lodge and dwelling in it a witch. Though not out of reach of womanly compassion for the fugitive or of an impulse to adore her beauty as a thing divine, the Witch is a malignant creature. The proof and product of her malignity is introduced at once, a sluggard son who never "cast his mind to covet prayse, Or ply himself to any honest trade." 'The two sons in this story are similarly overborne by their mothers, though to opposite effect, for Mari- nell waxes rich from his joyless self-discipline, while this lout, void of wealth or learning from self-indulgence, no sooner sees Florimell than he begins to pester her, and when she makes her escape he splashes about in a tantrum. The Witch there- Miss Rathborne sees in Spenser's story an allusion to the marriage of Achilles and Helen, after their death, on the White Isle, and she has very kindly given me references to the Heroicus of Philostratus, XX, 32-40, to Pausanias, III, 19, 11-13, and to Sir James Frazer's note in his Loeb edition of Apollodorus, II, 216-217. 6See the essay "Myth and Intelligence" in Reid MacCallum, Imitation and Design (Toronto, 1953). 9S</page><page sequence="10">FLORIMELL AND M A RIN E L L upon sets free a hyena-like beast; charging it to bring Flori- mell back or devour her. This is maternal solicitude with a vengeance. But the Witch is no more successful than Cymoent in providing a passion-free existence for her son; for when the beast, having pursued Florimell to the seashore (that is, to the element of Marinell and Cymoent), returns with her gir- dle, the frenzy of the churl is aggravated, and she must try some new device. She consults her familiar spirits and by their direction frames a counterfeit of the true Florimell. This is an embodied succubus, such as we remember from the opening canto of the first book; but Archimago's sprite had received from the prince of the powers of the air a body made of "liquid air," whereas, in keeping with the myth of the turning year, the false Florimell is compounded mainly of snow. The description of this alchemical masterpiece reserves its sting for the end of the alexandrine: In stead of eyes two burning lampes she set In silver sockets, shyning like the skyes, And a quicke moving Spirit did arret To stirre and roll them, like to womans eyes; In stead of yellow lockes she did devise, With golden wyre to weave her curled head; Yet golden wyre was not so yellow thrise As Florirnells faire haire: and in the stead Of life, she put a Spright to rule the carkasse dead. (III.8.7) The false Florimell quickly moves up in the world of falsity: the Witch's boorish son is hers from the beginning, but the boastful mock-knight Braggadochio with bluster and threats takes her from him, only to lose her, after bluster and threats, to another knight. The true Florimell meanwhile has hastened down from the court7 to the wilderness and from the wilderness to the sea, pursued by ever more repellent enemies-the foster, the churl, the beast; nor are her troubles over when she jumps into a fishing boat and thrusts out to sea. The old fisherman on wak- ing, is courteously addressed as "good man" and "father"&gt; before Florimell has to rebuke his rudeness. Here moral evil appears in its ugliest guise as lustful old age; the Myrrha story alluded to in 7Rathborne, 286-288, for Florimell's role as a figure of "civility." 96</page><page sequence="11">W I L L I A M B L I S S E T T the description of her flight seems about to be enacted in in- verted form when Florimell's cries bring help from Proteus the shepherd of the seas. Proteus is "an aged sire with head all frory hore, And sprinckled frost upon his deawy beard," and his grim visage so alarms the girl that she shrieks and hides her face at the sight of it. Our Proserpine has seen her gloomy Dis. Proteus attempts to assuage her fears, but his presence is like that of winter or of death, freezing her heart and benumbing her senses. He brings Florimell to his submarine bower. This hollow cave resembles the place of Marinell's concurrent suf- fering; and it recalls the hollow core of the Bower of Bliss where Verdant lay imprisoned and the empty room where Busirane tortures Amoret; but this is a natural prison not an artificial, for Florimell's is not primarily a moral plight. The deceivers of winter ply their arts, the snowy Florimell abroad in the world, Proteus in his watery wilderness. Like Acrasia, like Busi- rane, Proteus uses all his skill to bind-Marinell and his mother in chains of anxiety by his riddling prophecy, Florimell in an actual dungeon after he has failed to win her love by trans- forming himself into every tempting or terrifying shape: Deepe in the bottome of an huge great rocke The dongeon was, in which her bound he left, That neither yron bar es, nor brasen locke Did neede to gard from force, or secret theft Of all her lovers, which would her have reft. For wall'd it was with waves, which rag'd and ror'd As they the cliffe in pieces would have cleft; Besides ten thousand monsters foule abhor'd Did waite about it, gaping griesly all begor'd. (IV.11.3) The same monsters of the deep that had surrounded and threatened the boat of Guyon and the Palmer are Florimell's jailers-"greedy seas doe in the spoile of life delight;" but the poet is quick to combine these symbols of mental anguish with those of the pathos of the year: And in the midst thereof did horror dwell, And darkenesse dredd, that never viewed day, Like to the balefull house of lowest hell, In which old Styx her aged bones alway, Old Styx the Grandame of the Gods, doth lay. 97</page><page sequence="12">FLORIMELL AND MARINEL L There did this lucklesse mayd seven months abide, Ne ever evening saw, ne mornings ray, Ne ever from the day the night descride, But thought it all one night, that did no houres divide. (IV.11.4) At this point we are once more reminded that all Florimell's sufferings spring from loyalty in love to Marinell, who has been left many cantos before, still languishing from his wound. Now we hear of his partial recovery. His physical wound is cured, but he remains with his mother "like her thrall," Who sore against his will did him retaine, For feare of perill, which to him mote fall, Through his too ventrous prowesse proved over all. (IV. 11.7) Marinell is yet to be made a whole man. This wholeness is achieved after one of the most impres- sive episodes of The Faerie Queene-the Marriage of the Thames and the Medway.8 Superbly successful in itself as the final achievement of Spenser's long-projected Epithalamium Thamesis and as a sustained passage of incantation based on place-names, it is also strong in structural and thematic value. It makes decisive the direction of the Legend of Friendship, which moves from disorder to order, from separation to union. But it also reaches back in compensation for a long-uncorrected imbalance of feeling surviving from the Legend of Temperance: it answers the Voyage to Acrasia's Bower as the Garden of Adonis has answered the Bower itself. Guyon there had separated the waters of passion from the air of reason and rebuked them; the waters for him and in terms of his virtue of Temperance were a symbol of chaos, waste, and void, or teeming with devouring monsters. But there are other qualities of the great waters, suppressed rigorously then, that can now be given free play. All the countless progeny of the sea meet together in Proteus's house to celebrate the wed- ding of two of their number. The poet to do justice to the recital of their names and to rise to higher strains invokes the Muse for aid, and the great procession begins to move. Neptune 8See H. R.

The rivers pass by as persons without ceasing to be rivers: their anthropomorphic qualities humanize the world of nature, and their solemn succession gives their names the effect of in- cantation. Since most of the names are British, this effect has a peculiar appropriateness to the Legend of Friendship: the united island, bound together in harmony of regions and rivers, is simply friendship writ large.9 But the impression that the poet most desires to convey by dwelling at length on the great solem- nity is this: O what an endlesse worke have I in hand, To count the seas abundant progeny, Whose fruitfull seede farre passeth those in land, And also those which wonne in th' azure sky? For much more eath to tell the starres on hy, Albe they endlesse seeme in estimation, Then to recount the Seas posterity: So fertile be the flouds in generation, So huge their numbers, and so numberlesse their nation. (IV. 12.1) The figure of the goddess in the Temple of Venus had been the correction and answer to the figure of the enchantress in the Bower of Bliss. Sea-monsters had been emissaries and outposts of Acrasia's power; here Venus enters into possession of the friendly and abundant seas: Therefore the antique wisards well invented, That Venus of the fomy sea was bred; For that the seas by her are most augmented. Witnesse the' enceeding fry, which there are fed, And wondrous sholes, which may of none be red ....

For Marinell has accompanied his mother (now called Cymodoce) to the wedding banquet, but, being a mortal and unable to partake of immortal food, he walks abroad and hears under a cliff the voice of one piteously complaining. This "sigh of Proserpine"'10 is the voice of Florimell bewailing the misery of her wintry prison and-what is mythically the same thing-the self-sufficiency of Marinell and his indifference to her love. Marinell, overhearing, is struck first with pity, then with love, which unable to express itself openly, turns inward in self-reproach and soon reduces him to a pining misery worse than his former wound. But the mother's misguided care from which his sufferings originally took cause now works his cure. Cymodoce-"she that with her least word can assuage The surg- ing seas, when they do sorest rage"-reveals her character con- sistently in her initial concern for Marinell(a natural mistake with no malice in it), her care and cure of his wound, and now her gaining Florimell for him. Conveniently forgetting the source of her son's wealth, "wreck of sea,"' she denies to Proteus any right to Florimell, "a waift the which by fortune came upon your seas," and by appeal to Neptune gains her release. It is significant of the non-moral context of the myth that Florimell is not rescued by a heroic lover but released by a god at the order of a superior god-that is, in the natural course of events. Cymodoce finds that the captive in beauty "all living creatures did excell," and this accords well with the allegory. Florimell embodies in natural symbolism, in physical allegory, simply the vernal beauty of creation, and time has come round for her to manifest herself to her lover- Who soone as he beheld that angels face, Adorn'd with all divine perfection, His cheared heart eftsoones away gan chace Sad death, revived with her sweet inspection, And feeble spirit inly felt refection; As withered weed through cruell winters tine, That feeles the warmth of sunny beames reflection, Liftes up his head, that did before decline.

(IV. 12.34-35) On this quiet note the Legend of Friendship ends, and Spenser once again has proved his mythopoeic skill. How easy, and how apparently right, it would have been to unite the lovers, to celebrate the end of their winter of unrequited love or self- complacency, their return to health and circulation, under the sacramental form of wedlock. There are several good reasons for not doing so. One is that a wedding festivity has only just concluded and a second would be an anticlimax; another is that only the first intimations of spring have appeared-it is still Lent-and the lovers need time to regain their strength and deepen their love; yet another is that such a wedding at the conclusion of a book would come perilously close to concluding The Faerie Queene itself-and concluding it on the note of comedy. The cycle of the year is so powerful and insistent a pattern that a poet must guard against its seizing control and forcing him to write a tragedy of winter or a comedy of summer; it exerts great force to draw the whole of human life into the orbit of the natural, a tendency that the tragedian counters by his stress on the responsible choice of the hero, and the comedian by the free play of his own ironic intelligence. Spencer for like reasons estab- lishes his ascendancy as a poet over the pre-existing year-myths of Adonis and Proserpine. The myth of Florimell is an independent myth in allusion to the established myth of Proserpine. It presents a springtime com- ing to life in man and the world but not the recurring cycle of the seasons. Florimell eats no pomegranate seeds,11 and it is un- thinkable that she should ever return to the castle of Proteus or become his implacable Queen. Perhaps a clue to the working of liThe seven seeds that Proserpine ate may have suggested the faintly puz- zling seven months of Florimell's imprisonment, though I should think that an allowance of only seven cold months in the British climate is optimistic enough. An association of Proserpine with Proteus and river-gods is to be found in Claudian, De Raptu Prosperpinae, III, 1-5. 101</page><page sequence="16">102 F L O R I ME L L A N D M A R I N ELL Spenser's imagination is afforded by the fact that in the late medieval romance Arthur of Little Britain12 the mistress of the hero is not the Queen of Faerie, who is called Proserpyne, but her mortal protegee and double, named Florence. This may have encouraged him to invent a heroine dissociated from Proserpine, (who as a queen is a type, though a rather sinister type, of Glo- riana); and the name Florence in the context of year-myth may have been what sent him to the Flora of Ovid's Fasti- the "mother of flowers" honored by merry springtime games, who began her career as the nymph Chloris pursued and captured by Zephyrus in early spring.l3 Florimell's pursuers are forces of winter and death, like Proserpine's, but otherwise she resembles Flora; she is not a queen, not a daughter, not lunar, not chtho- nic, she is attended like Flora by the Graces, like her she is a fugitive at the beginning of her story and at the end enjoys reposeful flowering. The result of such departures as these from standard mythical patterning is a sort of irony, but a suffused not a sharp irony. Not only does Spenser depart altogether from the two existing myths in their conclusion and outcome, but he deliberately blends them in the telling, blurring the areas of contact-or, to vary the metaphor, allows cross-fertilization between them. Florimell has no parents in the story but is once compared to the mother of Adonis. Cymodoce in her loving care is almost a Venus to Marinell's Adonis, but in her redemption of Florimell is alto- gether a Ceres to her Proserpine. From another point of view Flo- rimell is Marinell's Venus since she is the seeker not the sought, the lover not the loved; and Marinell is Florimell's Dis, but print- ed from the positive rather than the negative, the light rather than the dark half of the year. Reversing the usual roles, Florimell is active (though frail) and Marinell passive (though involun- tarily so): she is physically freed through him, he is psychologi- cally freed through her. The fusion of the two nature-myths is further suggested by the likeness of the names, the first syllables of which marry the flowers and the waters, the similar suffix suggesting honey of generation. Myth is about man, not simply about the year, and Spenser asserts this with emphasis in the Proem to the Legend of Justice, 1Lord Berners's translation (1582), esp. 24, 123, 204 ff.

We are thus forcefully reminded of the fallen condition of the world in which the virtue of Justice must be excercised, and so when Florimell's dwarf (Dony is his name, little Adonis) comes to tell Artegall of his Lady's espousal, he tells also of a "cursed cruel Sarazin" blocking the way. We expect Artegall to over- come the wicked extortioner, and he does, but we no longer ex- pect the consummation of all things to occur at the wedding. Just this: After long stormes and tempests overblowne, The sunne at length his joyous face doth cleare: So when as fortune all her spight hath showne, Some blisfull houres at last must needes appeare; Else should afflicted wights oftimes despeire. So comes it now to Florinzell by tourne, After long sorrowes suffered whyleare, In which captiv'd she many moneths did mourne, To tast of joy, and to wont pleasures to retourne. (V.3.1) In celebration of the wedding are three days of jousts and tourneys, a sort of Floralia, which balances Satyrane's unhappy tournament in the previous book. Marinell wins against all chal- lengers on the first two days, but on the third is taken prisoner and has to be released by Artegall, who, to preserve incognito, has exchanged shields with Braggadochio. The garland is award- ed to the stranger-knight, and of course Braggadochio comes for- ward to claim it. Florimell, in giving him thanks, is disdained by the boaster, who leads forth the snowy Florimell, thinking to put the real one to shame. Everyone including Marinell him- self is struck with amazement; but at this tourney the Knight of Justice assumes his proper character to put things to rights. After first exposing Braggadochio as an imposter, he places the true Florimell by the false, whose snowy substance melts as with heat, leaving only the empty girdle. "So feeble skill of perfect things the vulgar has," is the comment as the year-myth moves back into moral allegory. Over at last is the season of sins and snows, and when the false knight is also degraded and cast out into the wilderness, this tourney ends on a note of joy and jollity that the other had failed to attain. Spenser has ended the myth of Florimell and Marinell without 103</page><page sequence="18">104 FLORIME L L AND MARINE LL ending his poem. He has even contrived the telling of it so as to make necessary the invention of a counterbalance later on. Just as the marriage of the Thames and the Medway answered the voyage to the Bower by presenting the watery part of the world in its marvellous fecundity, by accepting the passionate side of man s nature without moral distrust, so he must find a com- pensation for his treatment of time in terms of lingering wounds, panic flight from lustful old men, and dark imprisonment. Muta- bilitie herself, to be sure, is a bumptious and pushing young woman and is quite properly put in her place, but the pageant of the seasons and Nature's presence and doom do for the "ever- whirling wheel of change" what the earlier marriage procession of river gods had done for the earlier image of watery chaos- supply the dexter to the sinister in a typically Spenserian discordia concors.
