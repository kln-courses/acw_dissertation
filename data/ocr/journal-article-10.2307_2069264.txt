<plain_text><page sequence="1">Behaviorism and Beyond Behaviorism: A Conceptual Reconstruction, by G. E. ZURIFF. New York: Columbia University Press, 1985. 369 pp. $35.00 cloth. NORMAN K. DENZIN University of Illinois Perhaps because of its simplicity, behav- iorism is an easily-joked-about theory. To wit: Two behaviorists have sex. Afterwards one says, "That was fine for you. How was it for me?" Or turn a solipsist inside out and the result is a behaviorist: "You exist, do I?" (Johnson-Laird 1985, 787, 788). G. E. Zuriff's book is organized as a series of confrontations between the various theses advanced by be- haviorists and the major critics of these posi- tions. This is a thorough, if not painful analysis. The author takes the reader through the case against introspection, the behavioral view of language (including Chomsky's famous review of Skinner), the controversy over theory, theorizing, intervening concepts, hypothetical constructs, the basic S-R model, the behav- iorist interpretation of thought, the objections to a theory of agency in behaviorism, the arguments over first-person reports, and be- havioral epistemology. No argument against behaviorism is ignored. Yet behaviorism and Zuriff refuse to yield to the critics. The conse- quence has been a theory that has become a caricature of itself, as it has attempted to ab- sorb its critics' positions into its own hard- science, behavioral point of view (see Taylor 1985a, 122; Skinner 1985a, 1207; 1985b). Behaviorism is dead in psychology. It is being replaced by a new family of theories called "cognitive psychology." These theories have attempted to address precisely those processes behaviorism ignored: mind lan- guage, meaning, thought, intentionality, human agency, and so on (Ericsson and Simon, 1984). Within cognitive psychology a new paradigm is emerging, and it goes by the name of artificial intelligence. Some claim that it will replace the old behavioral view (Haugeland 1985), while others argue that it will die more quickly than behaviorism be- cause its simplistic assumptions are so obvi- ous (Taylor 1985a, 127). As psychology moves farther into a cognitive paradigm, the in- terpretive point of view appears to be taking hold as well (Taylor 1985a, 11). Behaviorism and Its Variants in Sociology None of this controversy would be of inter- est if it were not for the fact that the behav- ioral approach is alive and apparently doing well in sociology. A listing of the schools of thought and the theorists who have committed themselves to the behavioral point of view (or variations within that approach, i.e., social reinforcement theory) will perhaps make my point. Consider the following behavioral theorists and approaches in sociology: social exchange theory (Homans, Blau, Thibaut, R. Collins, Kelly, Emerson, Burgess); social reinforcement theory in family sociology (M. Straus, R. Gelles, W. Goode); deterrence theory in criminology, reinforcement psychol- ogy, and microeconomics (G. Becker); ex- pectation states theory (Berger et al.); deci- sion theory; role identity theory in symbolic interactionism (McCall and Simmons; Stryker); neofunctionalism's theory of action and rationality (Alexander); American structuralism, and utility theory (White, Coleman); resource mobilization theory in collective behavior. While some might quarrel with the above classification of theories and theorists, the basic key assumptions of behaviorism are present in each. The theoretical vocabulary in- cludes terms like reward, reinforcement, cost, utility, value, resource, comparison level, ra- tionality, transaction, profit, outcome, and Law of Effect. Coupled with this vocabulary is a methodology that is behavioral, often ex- perimental, quantitative, causal, statistical,</page><page sequence="2">554 REVIEW ESSAYS predictive, nonsubjective, and noninterpretive (in the hermeneutic sense). If the above argu- ment is warranted, then the conclusion is clear. In a variety of different forms, contem- porary American sociology is behavioral and noninterpretive. This conclusion holds for the major theories, methods, and middle-range theories that grip and hold the American sociologist's attention. It is this form of theorizing that is in control in American sociology and it is this form of sociology that is taught to our students. It is also the form of sociology that still receives the greatest amount of financial support from the Ameri- can government. Problematics in Behaviorism The key problems with behaviorism are by now well understood. It is conceptually nar- row. Despite the efforts of its best sociological practitioners (e.g., Collins, 1975, 1981) it is reductionistic, psychologistic, and tautological and produces ad hoc explanations. Its key terms cannot be independently observed. It offers a static, stop-start rather than continu- ous processual model of human interaction. It cannot explain self-destructive interactional behavior (e.g., alcoholism, family violence). Its model of learning cannot deal adequately with purpose, intentionality, or creativity, nor with the complex forms of learning involved in language acquisition. It is by and large anti-introspective and against the use of interpretive mental con- structs such as meaning, motive, intention, or self. It is unable to make assumptions about causal factors that lie outside the immediate causal field of the subject. It fails to offer an interpretive theory of emotionality, feeling, and human sentiment. It ignores the lived ex- periences of human subjects. It fails to con- ceptualize action as a self-mediated, interac- tional production that sets its own goals and intentions as it unfolds. It confuses, in this respect, cause with effect. It fails to analyze the lived body as a plane of experience that transcends the physiologi- cal organism. Human experience is not just a response to external stimuli; rather, every ex- perience of the human is uniquely situational and given meaning in the situation in which it arises. Physical causality (in the form of ex- ternal events, i.e., reinforcement schedules, stimuli, etc.) does not operate for humans be- cause they interpret both stimulus and re- sponse and reinforcement as they act. Hence reflex arcs (Dewey) cannot adequately de- scribe human behavior; rather our attention must be given to interpretive circles of self- defined experience (Merleau-Ponty; Sartre). In a similar fashion, the Law of Effect (be- havior continues when it is reinforced) must be set aside. Humans do not conform to this law, nor do primates in their natural environ- ments. The reverse anthropomorphism that underlies the behavioral model must, then, be dispensed with. It is no longer appropriate to recognize only those characteristics in hu- mans that have been found in nonhumans. Finally, the temporal structures of behav- iorism teleologically confound effect with cause, producing a sterile, static, temporal view of human experience. That is, by locat- ing time antecedent in causal events, behav- iorism ignores the ability of the human to grasp and give meaning to time in a way that obliterates the linear model of temporality that underlies behavioral inquiries (see Denzin 1986, chap. 4, for a demonstration of how this assertion operates for drinking alcoholics). These familiar problems are confounded by the fact that behaviorism, in its modern forms, has invaded the realm of the social, with de- vastating consequences. Penology, criminol- ogy, alcoholism studies, mental hospitals, in- come maintenance programs, family planning, juvenile delinquency rehabilitation programs, and drug abuse programs are just a few of the many areas where the sociological versions of behaviorism have become institutionalized. In these areas human lives are crushed, some destroyed, in the name of a purely objective, experimental branch of the natural sciences. Sociological behaviorism is an atomistic, non- dualistic sociology that speaks with the auton- omous voice of a science that has lost touch with human experience. A Hermeneutics of Sociological Behaviorism What is the attraction of behaviorism in sociology? How did this attraction get carried to such an extreme? As behaviorism with its reductive, archaic naturalistic model of human beings entered its long decline in psychology, "moving through phase after phase of special pleading" (Taylor, 1985b, 1), it gathered strength in sociology. This is a paradox; I would like to offer an interpretation of how it occurred. Several factors appear relevant. First, the behaviorists in psychology attempted to grasp the prestige of the natural science model as they built their theories and lab- oratories. (Of course, a similar process is working now as cognitive psychologists align themselves with computer scientists and the</page><page sequence="3">REVIEW ESSAYS 555 theorists of artificial intelligence.) Sociology, in the hierarchy of human disciplines, has al- ways been near the bottom. There are many reasons for this, including the inability to for- mulate a theory of human societies that would work. Furthermore, sociology has always shown a tendency to borrow from neighboring disciplines; this has allowed sociologists to ig- nore the subject matter of sociology. The re- sult has been a borrowing of models, metaphors, and methods from those human disciplines that (a) have appeared to succeed and (b) have gained the greatest amount of social prestige, as measured by federal fund- ing. Hence, economics and psychology have been the identity models of the contemporary sociologist. Mathematics runs a close third in this race to vicariously emulate the hard, proven natural sciences. It would be natural, then, that a discipline hard pressed to prove itself would turn to dis- ciplines that have succeeded. Unconsciously, sociologists have been psychologists all along. If the dominant theory in psychology had been not behaviorism but something else, sociologists would have grasped that model (e.g., psychoanalysis). But there is more than a simple cost-benefit model operating in sociology's emulation of behaviorism. It has to do with the image of freedom, social control, and human agency as these processes are formulated within behav- iorism. As Charles Taylor observes (1985b, 5), the great thrust of behaviorism was toward disengagement and a particularly modern view of freedom as the ability to act on one's own, without outside interference or authority. An agent, under behaviorism, is a social atom, strangely independent of society, its cultures and languages, yet responsive to a social envi- ronment that can be scientifically controlled. This view hides the creative, interpretive relationship the human agent has with the so- cial world. This view treats the social world as an aggregate of atoms, not as an interactional web of social relationships. The relationship of the human agent in sociological behav- iorism with the realm of the social is always conceived in causal, not interpretive terms. Hence elements from the social operate as external causes impinging upon the agent. This view removes the requirement of studying human interpretation. The immense method- ological armamentarium of sociological be- haviorism prohibits the study of meaning and intentionality, because these terms cannot be studied rigorously, reliably, and validly. Hence science stands in the way of science. The modern behavioral scientist is commit- ted to a view of human action that fundamen- tally portrays humans as being independent of society (Taylor, 1985b, 8). Behaviorism's human agent conforms to the rational model of humanity conceived in the seventeenth century and brought to fullest expression in the nineteenth century with the rise of utilitarianism and modern capitalism. Hence this cost-effective, reductionist, rational decision-making stereotype of the modern in- dividual fits a particular moment in human history. It easily glides into an order of things, to use Foucault's term, that privileges the state over the person. It also supports a neoliberal, conservative theory of the state that asks the human disciplines to become ar- chitects and priests for the modern informed political consciousness. The consequence of all of this by now is history. Yet when history repeats itself a sec- ond time it becomes, as Marx said, farce. The farcical rebirth of behaviorism in sociology would be tragic, if it weren't for the fact that we have seen its failures before. But the mod- ern sociologist has a responsibility to read the history of behaviorism in psychology. When this paradigm is pushed farther and farther into the realm of the social its effects can no longer be read as benign and accidental. A sociological theory of the human agent still requires development. Its pieces lie in scattered places: Mead, Blumer, Heidegger, Sartre, Merleau-Ponty, Foucault. A picture of human action and agency grounded in self- interpretations, language, and human interac- tion awaits acceptance, despite the recent ef- forts of Habermas and Giddens. The program of behaviorism lives on be- cause it satisfies the requirements of the mod- ern sociological self-consciousness. It is a morally palatable program because it removes responsibility from the sociologist while it confers self-respect and the illusion of scien- tific rigor and self-control. At the same time this program, with its guise of rigor and philo- sophical sophistication, satisfies the sociologist's need to be scientific. But it makes the modern sociologist an agent of the state. And, in this basic sense, it makes mod- ern sociology an extension of a state appara- tus that defines power, knowledge, and truth for the scientific community. Sociological be- haviorism, then, appeals because it removes the problem of values from the hands and consciousness of the sociologist. Zuriff s book should be read by every social theorist and by every social psychologist. The history it charts offers a lesson in how not to be a modern behavioral scientist. 0</page><page sequence="4">556 REVIEW ESSAYS Other Literature Cited Collins, R. 1975. Conflict Sociology.
