They were the shock troops of the modern, marching us into the Utopian future and away from the desiccated, conservative, politically and /or aesthetically compromised past: the term "avant-garde" itself insistently conjured notions of forward motion. As a result, in the twentieth century the avant-garde has typically been aligned with confrontational materialist dialectics. Those who mourn the passing of the avant-gardes - such as Peter Bürger, Alain Badiou, and Richard Schechner - often understand them to be fatally undermined by a shift from historical diachrony to the timeless synchrony demanded by multinational capital: one of the clichés about postmodernism that we've inherited from Fredric Jameson, David Harvey, and others is that it collapsed time into space and was best discussed in terms of dehistori- cized, spatializing logics.1 Whether or not postmodernism is still with us, certainly the twenty-first century began with an insistent return of history pre- cisely in the context of geographical spatiality, ironically in the I would like to thank Jered Sprecher for introducing me to Nicolas Bourriaud's work through the 2007 University of Tennessee Contemporary Arts and Society Faculty Research seminar. 1.

In some surprising ways, the arts were prepared, armed with newly reworked techniques and aesthetic language that focused not on a Utopian vision of the socioeconomic future but on a redefined ethical relation between people in the spaces of the present. Stemming from different fields and working from a post-1 950s countercultural move toward the "everyday," arts discourses have produced critical keywords that share an im- perative of connection: interactivity; relationality; activated spectatorship; intersubjective relationship; remix; participation; collaboration; connectivity; conversation; poetics of relation; translation; cosmopolitanism. The importance and proliferation of these keywords today imply that intersubjective communication is an aesthetic as well as an ethical imperative that has deepened through, and after the turn of, the twentieth century. If how to see and hear the Other was at the heart of the postmodern debates of the mid- twentieth century, often figured in tropes of difference and in the mode of irony, a strong query in the twenty-first-century arts is how to speak with the Other and how to set discourses in dia- logue, often on a global scale. In the early years of the twenty- first century, for example, literary theory is consumed by pragmatisms and their planar logics of interaction and exchange. Ecological criticism has gained popularity and critical force, focusing on human relationships within an environmental con- text.2 And in the visual arts, work published since the turn of the twenty-first century by Grant H. Kester, Rudolf Frieling, and others has analyzed as fundamental to post-1 950s visual arts such concepts as participation, collaboration, conversation, and collectivism.3 The emphasis of those in this last group is exem- plified in installation art of the 1990s, which reformulated post- 2.

Art curator Nicolas Bourriaud and artists such as Rirkrit Tira- vanija, Liam Gillick, and Félix González-Torres promoted a "rela- tional aesthetics" that was less a Utopian move forward than a millennial swerve sideways, in the tradition of pragmatism and dialogics. This turn has once again raised in art circles the ques- tion of the relation between ethics, politics, spatial models, and aesthetic form. A reconsideration of dialogics across the arts, therefore, seems now to be in order. In this article, I turn to my own primary field of study to ask in what ways contemporary fiction may partici- pate, if at all, in an interarts move to relational aesthetics as a new avant-garde form that turns away from utopianism and the aesthetics of confrontation and toward an ethics of collaboration between artist and audience, audiences and works, audiences and other audiences.4 A thought experiment in some ways, this essay is meant to sort out both the questions and the possible answers that arise when different but contemporaneous art forms are compared against one another and in relation to what seems a dominant theoretical turn in philosophy and aesthetics. The texts I've picked, for reasons I hope become apparent, are Mark Z. Danielewski's novel Only Revolutions (2006) and the col- laboratively produced media novel TOC (2009).5 The following essay falls into three sections. The first is an elaboration of relational aesthetics as defined by art historian Nicolas Bourriaud, who broke into the international art field with his impassioned, manifesto-like monographs explicitly attacking the modernist Utopian avant-garde and putting 1990s relational art in its place as a new form of humane and contem- 4. While certainly internal dialogism of the kind theorized by Mikhail Bakhtin is of continuing interest to experimental literature studies, my focus here is on externalized dialogism, or how a literary text might participate in the kind of relational dialogue between artwork, artist, and audience exemplified in some relational visual or installation artworks. 5. Since I gave talks pairing TOC with Only Revolutions at Narrative conferences in 2009 (Birmingham, U.K.) and 2011 (St. Louis), a number of critical studies have been published pairing these two texts, particularly in relation to their approaches to time. While regretting the publication lag time, I'm pleased to be in the company of this grow- ing community of critics.</page><page sequence="4">ELIAS • 741 porary avant-gardism. From the ensuing theoretical debate, the second section extrapolates the "ecological chronotrope" of rela- tional art, the possible intersection point for a cross-disciplinary relational aesthetics. The third section is an attempt to see if and how experimental literature based in new literary forms might participate in a similar relational aesthetic defined this way. While I think that the material specificity of aesthetic forms mat- ters, and that what is constructed as "relational" in installation art will not translate easily into textual forms, I will try to illus- trate how two contemporary interactive fictions might be con- textualized within the 1990s debate about relationality in art and then illustrate how one novel - Danielewski's Only Revolutions - might suggest a refusal of a merely spatialized postmodern tex- tual surface in favor of a relational, ecological dialogics. Focusing on Bourriaud's work as a dominant theory in the visual arts, my claim in this essay is that in numerous (Western? first world? postcolonial?) arts fields, dialogics has been put on the critical table once again, but in what seems to be a new form: an ecological model that enjoins artists to engage their audiences in ethical interchange, in the context of an increasingly threat- ened and threatening social space of planetary scale.6 My inves- tigative questions are these: in what ways might contemporary fiction participate in this ethical turn? How might an ecological dialogics inform a new dialogical avant-garde in the literary arts? These questions, however, beg another, important one: for fic- tion, is a dialogical avant-garde possible? Relational Aesthetics and Its Discontents In Relational Aesthetics, originally published in French in 1998, Nicolas Bourriaud gave voice to a major movement in museum art of the late 1990s and celebrated the death of the old avant- garde, aligning it with Utopian politics and teleologica! defini- 6. The parentheticals in this sentence signify other branches of this argument too broad to be explored in this essay, namely, the influence of the "post" theories (postmodernism, postcolonialism, poststructuralisms), as well as other critical theories such as feminist and queer theory on the new centralization of dialogics in theory.</page><page sequence="5">742 « CONTEMPORARY LITERATURE tions of history that, he claimed, had to be abandoned: "The role of artworks is no longer to form imaginary and Utopian realities, but to actually be ways of living and models of action within the existing real, whatever the scales chosen by the artists" (13). The new art is "an art taking as its theoretical horizon the realm of human interactions and its social context, rather than the asser- tion of an independent and private symbolic space" (14). It is represented in overtly public art (art performed or installed in public spaces outside the museum and meant to make visible in real time and place certain social relations), but Bourriaud him- self is primarily concerned with museum art that forces exchanges between people, such as that by Rirkrit Tiravanija, Félix González-Torres, Henry Bond, and Liam Gillick. These art- ists share an aesthetic of participation, proximity, and encounter, in the interest, he claims, of dialogism. González-Torres's "candy pours," for instance, are large instal- lations consisting of hundreds of pounds of mounded, individ- ually wrapped candies. They present a dilemma of interaction to visitors - They seem free: should I take one or not? Is this an artwork, and if so, what does it mean? - and also embed social reference. In 2007, the Williams College Museum of Art pre- sented González-Torres's 1991 pour Untitled ( Placebo ) on World Aids Day; the piece signified a relation between the disappearing candy and AIDS victims and became a meditation on human loss as well as a tribute to the artist's own deceased partner, Ross Laycock. Bourriaud references art as different as that by Gillick, Dominique Gonzalez-Foerster, Jeremy Deller, and Philippe Par- reno and Pierre Huyghe as examples of a new "convivial art" based on the unscripted encounter between spectator/partici- pant and artwork, "where heterogeneous forms of sociability are worked out" ( Relational Aesthetics 31). Examples abound. Tom Marioni's FREE BEER (The Act of Drinking Beer with Friends Is the Highest Form of Art) (1970-79), for instance, is a museum "salon" where both the act of drinking beer together and the debris left over after a salon gathering are considered forms of art; such installations have spawned others that resemble in all details neighborhood bars, and which exhort museum patrons to drink</page><page sequence="6">ELIAS • 743 beer together as the performance of the artwork.7 Here Bour- riaud's relational aesthetics posits form as the open space - the conduit - of interaction and interchange. Bourriaud's claim is that the move from time to space is crucial to the new art: such art is birthed in the moment of worldwide urbanism, economic globalization, and worker migration, a moment of enforced and constant encounters. In this context, the art space becomes politicized when it addresses or reveals through its functioning and form how contemporary urban space may produce models of sociability ( Relational Aesthetics 17). Key to all the claims in Relational Aesthetics is the idea that radical utopianism, with its future projections and abstractions, must be replaced with a new, but not naive, humanistic commitment to everyday experience and civic sociality. Obsession with teleology and idealized space must be replaced by lived community and investigation of how art can shape and participate in everyday life: [T]he age of the New Man, future-oriented manifestos, and calls for a better world all ready to be walked into and lived in is well and truly over. ... It seems more pressing to invent possible relations with our neighbours in the present than to bet on happier tomorrows. . . . the imaginary of our day and age is concerned with negotiations, bonds and co-existences. . . . Art, likewise, is no longer seeking to represent utopias; rather, it is attempting to construct concrete spaces. ( Relational Aesthetics 46-47) Here Bourriaud jettisons a diachronic rationale in favor of a syn- chronic balance that attempts to shift the power back to the everyman and the everyday.8 A coherent and theoretically informed response to Bourriaud's Relational Aesthetics has come from Claire Bishop, who has writ- ten extensively on the topics of installation and participatory art. 7. Tom Marioni discusses this installation in a 2008 podcast produced by the San Fran- cisco Museum of Modern Art. 8. Bruce Barber presents a provocative discussion of the difference, in the arena of public art, between strategic or exemplary actions as a form of agitational protest and "intervention" as a prelude to instrumental or communicative action. In Bourriaud's statement are echoes, of course, of Michel de Certeau's Arts de faire , the first volume of L'invention du quotidien.</page><page sequence="7">744 • CONTEMPORARY LITERATURE Citing installation art, performance art, and Fluxus of the 1960s and 1970s, Bishop argues that Bourriaud's claims are not new ("Antagonism" 52).9 She also objects to Bourriaud's theory of relational form, claiming that the actual artworks that Bourriaud references - such as a museum installation that looks like a retail bar, where museumgoers can share a beer together - tend to have little or no formal structure. Understanding form itself to be the locus of meaning, Bourriaud can assume that "the work is auto- matically political in implication and emancipatory in effect," and thus he is closer to the formalism of Clement Greenberg than he would wish to admit ("Antagonism" 62). This is a slight mis- reading of Bourriaud's claims, for he asserts that it is precisely form as improvisation - a kind of open work that is nonetheless highly conceptualized and structured - that is the provocation to interchange and, finally, meaning in these artworks. Bourriaud's The Radicant (2009) is an implicit response to Bishop's criticisms that exposes how difficult it may be to define a dialogical avant-garde. Bourriaud tries to do so through his definition of "altermodernism" (in his 2009 book of that title), an approach to art that is "our modernism." Bourriaud's organizing trope of the altermodern is not the "radical" but the "radicant," defined through a plant metaphor (ivy, which puts out runners directed by chance that root in haphazard, unpredictable, and often temporary ways) ( Radicant 51). Aware that his "radicant" sounds exactly the same as Gilles Deleuze and Félix Guattari's "rhizome," Bourriaud clearly wants to claim some mix of the unmoored subjectivity of a Deleuzian Body without Organs (constructivism all the way down), Mikhail Bakhtin's ethical sub- jectivity constructed by dialogic interplay between two relatively stable selves, and Richard Rorty's ironic pragmatist conversa- tion. This shifting ground would create a provisionally centered subject, differentiating altermodern subjectivity from the free- floating false consciousness produced by capitalist globaliza- 9. In this article, Bishop cites Lewis Kachur's Displaying the Marvelous: Marcel Duchamp, Salvador Dalí and Surrealist Exhibition Installations.

Bishop gives a full-length treatment of participatory aesthetics in Artificial Hells.</page><page sequence="8">ELIAS -745 tion/ Simulation (52).10 This altermodern subjectivity is created, he claims, through urban wandering. How all of this operates, however, is only marginally clarified in relation to the third pri- mary characteristic of the nomadic altermodern, which is trans- lation: "Translation is at the center of an important ethical and aesthetic issue: it is a question of fighting for the indeterminacy of the code. . . . [It] collectivizes the meaning of a discourse and sets in motion an object of thought by inserting it into a chain" (131; emphasis added). Translation is the spatialized, synchronic ethics of altermodernism. More than did theories of otherness, it demands an ethics of recognition, a relation of the face-to-face. Bourriaud's "altermodern" is thus a deliberate spatialization of time, culture, and thought paradigms, yet unlike Emmanuel Lév- inas, Martin Buber, John Dewey, or Bakhtin, Bourriaud does not work out exactly how this ethics is enacted - that is, what the fundamental catalyst would be that turned "being together in a space" to dialogical relation (translation).11 Rather, he states the conditions needed for it to occur, which are the creation of the art space (relational aesthetics) and cosmopolitan wandering, together provoking contact with Others and intersections of dif- ferent points of view. Bishop specifically questions the quality of the "democratic relationship" between spectator /participant, artwork, and artist that is set up by relational artworks. When Rirkrit Tiravanija con- structs a kitchen inside a museum, complete with stir-fry and dining tables, and invites museumgoers to enter and cook their dinner together as part of the installation, certainly there is soci- 10. Of course, it was Edouard Glissant in Poetics of Relation who much earlier formu- lated a critique of "roots" in the context of postcolonial politics. Glissant is mentioned only in passing by Bourriaud. Recently, Alison Gibbons has applied Bourriaud's term "altermodernism" to experimental fiction ("Altermodernist Fiction"). 11. In Relational Aesthetics and in The Radicant, Bourriaud notes the prevalence of the journey trope and "topography" in the work of Jorge Luis Borges, Bruce Chatwin, W. G. Sebald, and Liam Gillick; he cites Jacques Lacan on the "journey form." Interestingly, Bourriaud's theory of "relational aesthetics" shifted to the terms "translation" and "wan- dering" at precisely the moment when modernist and contemporary studies became preoccupied with these terms. See, for example, Steven G. Yao's Translation and the Lan- guages of Modernism and Sandra Bermann and Michael Wood's Nation, Language , and the Ethics of Translation.</page><page sequence="9">746 • CONTEMPORARY LITERATURE ality happening. It is unclear, however, whether that sociality is the same thing as dialogue and whether it has any bearing on the construction of an equitable and just public sphere. Bishop points out that these museum exhibits may not in fact bring together people who are radically different from one another: "there is no inherent friction since the situation is what Bour- riaud calls 'microtopian': it produces a community whose mem- bers identify with each other, because they have something in common" ("Antagonism" 67). Starting from a familiar academic preference for constructivist subjectivity, Bishop castigates Bour- riaud's examples of relational aesthetics as not intrinsically dem- ocratic "since they rest too comfortably within an ideal of subjectivity as whole and of community as immanent together- ness" (67). She instead advocates Ernesto Laclau and Chantal Mouffe's Lacanian-derived advocacy of "antagonism," which assumes that subjectivity is decentered, incomplete, and depen- dent upon identifications. "Antagonism" contrasts to Bour- riaud's relational communion between whole subjects but also contrasts to "difference," which leads to a collision between fully formed, monadic subjects.12 For Bishop, friction is the point of art; the works of artists Thomas Hirschhorn and Santiago Sierra better reflect a subjectivity defined as incomplete, and they con- struct environments of antagonism that encourage the negotia- tion, unease, discomfort, and contestation between viewers, participants, and context truly central to any democratic func- tioning. Opposing relational antagonism to Bourriaud's rela- tional sociability, Bishop's residual Hegelianism posits conflict as the basis of social relations between self and other, under- playing any kind of coherent, shared, consensual project among the practitioners and participants of relational arts. I would argue, however, that while Bishop's "dissensus" and Bourriaud's "consensus" positions seem antithetical, both are actually built into most definitions of dialogism as ethical inter- change. Differences between these critics' positions result from a splitting apart of the two fundamental operations of Platonic 12. Bishop ("Antagonism" 66), quotes from Laclau and Mouffe's Hegemony and Socialist Strategy (125).</page><page sequence="10">ELIAS -747 dialogue, confrontation and cooperation.13 For Plato, dialogue implied heated confrontational challenge as well as mutuality and exchange. If Bourriaud and Bishop tear apart the Platonic elenchus into its constituent ethical and political moves of inter- change and confrontation, cooperation and competition, it may be useful to ask what would be necessary for a resuturing - that is, what would be the necessary prerequisites for recreating a double-edged, dialogical avant-garde. Perhaps it might be glimpsed in the visual arts in works by Mary Jane Jacob, Aaron Levy, Anton Vidokle, and others - art- ists, art historians, and curators who have taken art from its museum contexts back out into the streets. Jacob has termed her curatorial practice "reciprocal generosity," noting the same art discussed by Bourriaud - González-Torres' s candy piles and Tir- avanija's "food events," for example - but also referencing art taking place outside the space of the museum, such as the exper- imental public art program Culture in Action (1993) and Iñigo Manglano-Ovalle's Tele-Vecindario: A Street-Level Video Project (1993), which offered technical training to youth in an outdoor media installation. Challenging the position of power occupied by most museums, she asks: "How can artists be more generous and encourage an experience of their art that is more open, allowing 'others' entry and equally appreciating their experi- ences? How can art be an exchange?" (5). In this and other of Jacob's curatorial projects, art is the catalyst for nonironic dia- logue about real and emotional issues within lived communities and demands that artists and curators relinquish their authority in the artistic exchange. Such practice "evokes the possibility of change in the culture, so that through exhibitions it might be possible to shift ideas and work the joints of what art 'is,' who the audience are, and what their place is in art" (9). While there are many issues that grow out of practices such as this - At what point does something stop being art and simply become a town hall meeting? How is true conflict moderated in this arena? - 13. I am aware that this interrelation is precisely what Jacques Rancière finds suspect. See The Politics of Aesthetics, where he discusses "dissensus" and "consensus" theories in the visual arts.</page><page sequence="11">748 • CONTEMPORARY LITERATURE curatorial projects such as Anton Vidokle's Night School and the work being done by Krzysztof Wodiczko or Aaron Levy, Martin Rauchbauer, and Gregg Lambert with the Perpetual Peace Project illustrate a turn toward art's engagement in the world, predicated on a dialogic aesthetic. Levy in fact calls his activity the "curating of relationships."14 But how might this in any way relate to the literary arts, which by the nature of their medium are not usually collaborative at the level of the material object and not usually performed or experienced in the company of others? Can literary art ever be participatory and dialogically avant-gardist in the ways that Bourriaud, Jacob, or others working in the visual arts seem to desire? The Bourriaud-Bishop debate over relational aesthetics in the visual arts does make clear one of the most important criteria for defining "relational" art - its insistence on humanizing and localizing the origin of historical change. That is, such art seems to insist on a shift from understanding change as structural - in the manner of evolutionary theory, dialectical materialisms, or newer versions of systems theory in sociology - to understand- ing social change as originating in local contexts and dictated by individuals' "giving of reasons" and the exchange of human views and values.15 Like environmentalist localisms, this view of art seems to think globally but act locally. It is ambivalent about the nature of subjectivity but insists on art as a neutral but provocative activity that is able to provide grounds for conver- sations between people, as a platform upon which to create humanistic common knowledge among peoples, and as a neutral 14.

Badiou writes: "[N]o one gets involved any more with the political creation of a new man. On the contrary, what we hear from all sides is the demand for the conservation of the old humanity and of all endangered species to boot (our ancient wheat included) when it is precisely today, with the advent of genetic engineering, that preparations are under way for a real transformation of man, for the modification of the species. What makes all the difference is that genetics is profoundly apolitical. ... It will happen in accordance with the automatism of things" (9).</page><page sequence="12">ELIAS -749 language or third term within which ethically to conceptualize cultural difference. Far from either the arts of the pure form or the arts of socialist realism, the dialogical avant-garde claims to embed a set of foundational humanistic values and privileges, above all its ability to provoke intellectual interchange and rea- sonable negotiation of social perspectives. In many ways, it is a very old version of humanist art aligned with a pragmatist ethics and a late-Bakhtinian aesthetics. In its operations, the "dialogical avant-garde" moves from the diachronic, structural model of historical change characterizing much of the modernist avant-garde's Utopian "futurity art" to a post-postmodern valuation of the synchrony of lived planetary space shaped by human intention, collaboration, and consensus building. (Which is the more Utopian is an interesting question.) The relation of time to space modeling in participatory, interac- tive, and relational art is often defined as a turn away from dia- lectical utopianism (implying structurally determined and teleological models of time and history) as well as from unidi- rectional and totalizing postmodern globalization (a model of time and space that implies a perpetual present of economic totalization - the time of the Spectacle - and the monologic voicedness of global capitalist spaces). Relational art claims to move away from these and toward a flattened, synchronic space of interpersonal exchange and dialogue (a spatialized model of ethical exchange dependent upon a reservoir of voicedness). In order to enact an ethics of engagement and aesthetics of reci- procity, relational and dialogical aesthetics need a horizontal axis of exchange and a redefinition of chronometric time. Dialogical aesthetics in fact seem to have a dominant chrono- tope - namely, that of the "planetary" or the "environmental" or "the ecological." Environmentalism's ethic of conservation is based on a notion of closed space - the space of the terrarium, the closed system - and on a very old, pre-chronometric notion of time as cycle. From the early 1990s on, visual artists and art historians seem to have put an ecological or planetary model of time in opposition to two different targets. The planetary model was first opposed to the dehumanizing context of cosmic space constructed by science and then, as a metaphor for the cyber-</page><page sequence="13">750 • CONTEMPORARY LITERATURE netic, to scientific rationality. But artists also seem to use a plan- etary chronotope to oppose the chronometer, the instrument used to measure out time, space, and labor in the alienating arena of work under capitalism. A new planetary chronotope appears to return to organic "earth time," when in fact it often anthro- pomorphizes the notion of "the planetary" to signify ecologies of human culture. Christian Moraru writes, for example: "What we need ... is what I call an ecology of relations, that is, another way of thinking about being in the world and, more broadly, about being: ... a shift away from an egological to an ecological modernity or cosmodernity. . . . What I mean by ecology is cul- tural ecology. ... I argue for a certain cultural environmentalism" (48, 49).16 And here is where literature might enter the playing field. The formal commonality between the visual arts and the literary arts based on a "relational aesthetic" or ethical interactivity may be their foundational chronotope, a rethinking of the time/space relation in terms of nonteleological ecology or human planetary relations.17 An ecological conservationism figures space-time as essentially synchronic within a cyclic repetition. Change hap- pens at the evolutionary level, akin to paradigmatic substitution (selection), while the system embeds functioning structure through its associative linkages. As a metaphor of an alternative social logic - one positing an alternative to the "forward motion" of incessant change and growth characterizing market logic - ecology is based in conservation and is predicated on a belief in human self-determination to the extent that humans can pro- mote maintenance, stewardship, and regeneration of existing resources understood to be in delicate balance within a closed 16. Moraru has used Ulrich Beck's notion of "risk society" in the latter' s Risk Society : Towards a New Modernity (1992) and World Risk Society (1999) to explain in part how relational thinking becomes global thinking (44) and has himself articulated a planetary "imaginary of late globalization." Theories about what comes after postmodernism often pose this idea of the planetary as chronotope of the arts; see, for example, Gayatri Chak- ravorty Spivak's "Planetari ty" chapter in Death of a Discipline ; Ursula Heise' s Sense of Place and Sense of Planet: The Environmental Imagination of the Global (2008); and Wai Chee Dimock and Lawrence Buell's Shades of the Planet (2007). 17. I refer readers to Grant H. Kester's useful discussion, closely related to many aspects of my own, of time as "duration" in relational installation art (69 and following).</page><page sequence="14">ELIAS -751 and finite system of oppositions. Understood this way, certain forms of ecology are radical because they redefine historical time and space within a conservationist ethic and against modernity's abstract arrow of time: ecology is radical within the purview of consumer capitalism precisely because it is conservative. Supporting a synchronic over a diachronic perspective - and, concerned with lived human cultures, situating itself within a human social world redefined by a planetary ecology of resources - a lateral avant-garde based in dialogism similarly would not be the flat- tened nonspace of postmodernism but rather a "radically con- servative" recognition of culture in /as planetary space. For the novel to participate in a dialogical avant-garde, an avant-garde that valued the ethics of relation, literature might need to construct an ecology of space-time as both a political/ ethical goal and as a formal compositional method. It might need to construct space-time paradoxically as local on a global scale and moving forward in a circle. That is, it would need to present time thematically and symbolically as a circle in the manner of planetary seasonal time while simultaneously recognizing the lin- ear but nonteleological nature both of novel form and of plane- tary, evolutionary time - in contradistinction to the modern abstraction of time's arrow. Because it participated in the ethical project of dialogical avant-gardism, such literature would need also to provoke readers into interacting dialogically - with one another, with the text, and with the world. One way to do this would be to complicate literary structure and language (particu- larly through techniques of spatialization and openness) to enact formally, with readers, its ethic of dialogue and lateral engage- ment. For the novel to participate in a relational aesthetic similar to Jacob's "reciprocally generous" public art - rather than merely exhibiting Bakhtin's notion of internal dialogism or treating dia- logue and human relations as themes or organizing ideas - it would need to create a rhetorical platform of exchange. Its chron- otope would need to be human planetarity, a shared synchronic but cyclic cultural environment of dialogue and exchange, and its form would need to provoke interaction between text and reader, even reader and reader, in a dialogical exchange mimick- ing that desired within "society," on a planetary scale.</page><page sequence="15">752 • CONTEMPORARY LITERATURE Working from the discussion above, I would like to posit that any novel operating in the manner of the "dialogical avant- garde" theorized in the visual arts would need to take into account in its composition four criteria implied or stated in this visual arts debate. The first of these is the incorporation of populist languages and the "everyday," as both the artwork's own partici- pation in the lifeworlds of its readers and its invitation to readers to interact - with one another, with the text, with the world. The second trait would be a highly conceptualized openness of form, sig- nifying as well as constructing an improvisational and dialogic interpretive community. As Umberto Eco and others have argued, spatiality, in Joseph Frank's sense, as well as interactivity and some sense of multimodality, might be integral to construct- ing this open form.18 Third would be a dialogue with difference as a key formal principle and a key thematic idea. This criterion would involve a rejection of metanarrative or programmatic ideological advocacy in favor of open, global, multicultural dialogue cen- tered on the question of human flourishing. The final character- istic of such a novel would be a structuring chronotope that required a rethinking of the time/space relation in terms of a nonteleological planetary ecology. This formal quality could be evidenced in dif- ferent ways in different novels. The ecological space of the planet - rather than the space of the individual/ mind, the closed community, or the bounded nation-state - would become the integrated rather than the alienated cultural space of the human. With these criteria in mind, we might look at Only Revolutions and TOC as test cases, to see if such a listing gives us any pur- chase in terms of literary analysis. Only Revolutions and the Relationality of Ecological Time In contrast to some interpretations of Mark Z. Danielewski's Only Revolutions that align it with autopoetic self-reproduction, I read the novel as an exercise in relational aesthetics in the lit- 18. This notion is contested.

By 2012, the MZD Forums for Only Revolutions listed over 6,900 posts on 249 threads; the fan base on the MZD Forums has been par- ticularly enthusiastic about combing the text for patterns, hidden meanings, and symbolism, and the posts are often good enough to be quoted in professional, published criticism on the novel.20 The fan community thus breaks down the line between amateur and professional analysis of this novel, taking criticism out of the halls of academe and beyond the coterie boundaries of the book group into the much more diverse, public, international, contestatory, but also dialogic arena of cyberspace. In addition, Only Revolutions enters the lifeworlds of its readers through its incorporation of vernacular language and images drawn from mass culture. Reviewers and fans have usefully aligned the novel (as they did with House of Leaves [2000]) with ergotic literature and visual writing, as well as with free-verse poetic form. In a different light, the writing may be understood as improvisational rap or spoken-word poetry, both located at the nexus of pop culture, vernacular expression, and public per- formance.21 Danielewski has strong personal connections to the world of pop music, and he has noted that Only Revolutions has a "fugai" quality and a "chorus"-like structure, linking the book to voiced and multitrack compositions ("Revolution"). This 19. See Leonard for such a reading, which aligns literature with systems theory and its claim that systems are autopoietic and thus profoundly machinic in operation. 20.

Brian McHale has in fact analyzed the novel as a long poem.</page><page sequence="17">754 • CONTEMPORARY LITERATURE "voicedness" carries over to narration: in point of fact, this nar- rative is told by two autodiegetic narrators who give voice to their own experience of themselves, the world, and the other. It is a novel written in dialogue (or fugai monologue) as well as one that promotes dialogue between author and reader. Of course, the many formal games in Only Revolutions invite the reader to play with the text. It is always tempting to outline the plethora of structural and typographical games in the novel: the multidirectionality of the narrative (Sam's and Hailey's nar- ratives begin at opposite ends of the book and cross in the mid- dle); the publisher's hint to rotate the entire book 360 degrees after every eight pages; the constrained writing; the daisy- chained organization of initial chapter letters signaling Sam and Hailey; the text's color coding; the quadrant structure of each page; the inclusion of a "chronomosaic" next to the main story, and its meaning; and so on.22 Dirk Van Hulle discusses the "pro- jector reel" dots marking each of the five sections of the novel in terms of Linda Hutcheon's "process mimesis," in which readers have a high degree of engagement with a text "because they are given the chance to participate in the creative process as a wit- ness of the way in which the book analyzes itself."23 Van Hulle also notes the many correspondences between language play in Only Revolutions and in James Joyce's Finnegans Wake; Barthesian linguistic intertextuality and language play characterize expres- sion in Danielewski's novel. Virtually every aspect of the text demands the reader's deep attention and active engagement. This tension between the invitation of the book's open form and the highly conceptualized, highly controlled narration of the "allways sixteen" narrators Hailey and Sam is similar to that within relational visual art. Highly artificial at the level of con- ception, greatly constrained in terms of performance parameters, the relational artwork nonetheless opens itself at a certain point to its audience to make of it what they will. The epigraph of Only 22. By 2010, most of these details had been noted at the MZD Forums and since then have been noted many times in published criticism of the novel. 23. Van Hulle (131) is quoting Linda Hutcheon's Narcissistic Narrative: The Metafictional Paradox (9).</page><page sequence="18">ELIAS -755 Revolutions, "You were there," indicates such an invitation, for it not only links Only Revolutions to Danielewski's previous novel, House of Leaves (which opens with "This is not for you"), but also indicates the latter text's opposite intent. If House of Leaves begins by producing the mixture of invitation and discomfort appro- priate to the gothic genre, Only Revolutions invites the reader to engage with the narrative world.24 This engagement can be lit- eral, physical: to progress through the book, readers must phys- ically rotate it 360 degrees. But the engagement is conceptual and thematic: indeed, at the very center of the novel is the word "choose" (180/181). Time movement in Only Revolutions is spatialized but contin- uous, in the form of a cycle. Sam's end is Hailey's beginning: the cycle of story is unending and dual, as in a Möbius strip.25 The protagonists' rotation around one another is emphasized by the typography of the first letters beginning each of the eight-page sections of the book, and their stories appear on each page in mirror-image printing of exactly 90 words each, with each page containing a total of exactly 180 words and facing pages con- taining a total of 360 words of first-person narration by the com- bined two narrators. Each page of dual narration consists of exactly 36 lines. Thus the notion of rotational degrees is built into the number of words and lines on each page. As a kind of com- pass to help readers locate themselves within the text, each page prints in its outside margin, exactly midway down the page, a half-green, half-gold circle (symbolizing a full 360-degree rota- tion), itself containing two circles, one green circle stating the page of Sam's narrative and one gold circle stating the page of Hailey's narrative; if one flips the pages of the book from end to beginning while observing the page circles, the two circles within the larger circle seem to move, rotating around one another. In addition, on the book's inside flyleaves are meticulously sketched hieroglyphs or mandalas connoting the central textual 24. Alison Gibbons makes this point ('This Is Not for You" 30). 25.

Composed of lists of words prohibited from use in the text, this is printed in reverse per- spective (one has to hold the page to a mirror to read the words).26 Thus a reader considering all parts of the book, includ- ing flyleaves and inside content, must read top to bottom (height), front to back (width), and inside to outside reversed (an attempt at depth) - three dimensions that together imply the "global" nature of the "text as world." The structuring chrono- tope of this text is indeed cyclical time and the circular space of the earth - that is, the planetary. It is noteworthy that Danielewski states that he was reading Giorgio Agamben's The Open while composing Only Revolutions : House of Leaves is what I would call a centripetal book. It's about inferi- orities and history and progeny and ancestors. Now this [Only Revolu- tions] was pointedly a centrifugal novel. It was about getting outside. It was about looking at landscape. It was about addressing what the open was. It was about - not only [at] an academic level - reading Agamben's "The Open" and readdressing what Heidegger was talking about with "the open." Looking at the naturalists, looking at ecocriticism. ("Revolution") Published after Homo Sacer, The Open is Agamben's investigation of the human/animal distinction and the nature of the anthro- pological machine that allows for the creation of the "non-human human" and the animal as distinct from the human. It posits that the solution to the continuing enforcement of metaphysical sep- aration between human and animal is understanding both human and animal as unsavable, irreparable - a state of existing in Heideggerian infancy or a state of biopolitics in which human- 26. Some commentators have argued that these are words that do not appear in the text itself, which I have not corroborated; the shaped lists (in ellipses, globes, and other patternings) of hundreds of words, however, are grouped by categories (words that define terms of filial relation; words beginning with specific letters; words listing com- munication devices and technical instruments; terms of deception; words connoting writ- ing or signification; terms related to the Judeo-Christian religious tradition; words that refer to a body, including "geist")- From what I can see, the letters J, V, and Q are omitted from many of these lists, and the letters X, Y, and Z are also omitted frequently. Like the unpredictable offsetting throughout of the lowercase letter a, this aspect of the text is mysterious.</page><page sequence="20">ELIAS -757 ity becomes ahuman, undifferentiated from animals or being. This rejection of interpretive schémas (machines) is a desire for an undifferentiated ontology very much in keeping with the rejection of animal /human distinctions early in Hailey's and Sam's respective stories, when they are undifferentiated from and integrated with plants, animals, and inanimate objects. As they enter the world of adult work and society, they occasionally experience the Heideggerian state of boredom that allows them to become aware of the artificiality of their situation. Such self- awareness can be countered only with raw, libidinal life and rein- tegration of the self with nature and with death - both of which take place in Sam's and Hailey's stories. While this narrative arc seems rather far from dialogics, even an advocation of its opposite, a return to vitalist, undifferen- tiated Being, I would argue that in fact the novel refuses both Being and its ontological opposite, the absolute separation of nature from the monadic cogito. Rather than setting up an oppo- sition between open and closed, one and many, this text seems to advocate integration-as-communication, or dialogic being. What energizes the narrative both thematically and structurally is the continuing, dialogic interchange between Hailey and Sam themselves as well as between the teenagers and the world - a movement between backward and forward and between his- torical life and Life as such. The space of the planet as lived environment is the dialogic rather than the alienated or dura- tional space of the living, and that space includes both nature and culture. The figure occupying such a liminal, dialogic space between boundaries and ontological levels is in many cultures that of the trickster. Danielewski has noted that Lewis Hyde's Trickster Makes This World was "very important for Only Revolutions" ("Revolution"), and in that text are echoes of Agamben's notion of necessary return to a "state of infancy" (Hyde 71): "Krishna or Hermes, Coyote or Raven - when one of these speaks his first lie he is the eternal child who cannot be significantly damaged and so may cleave to the pure and playful delight of floating fiction in the face of stern reality" (Hyde 72), though his lies</page><page sequence="21">758 • CONTEMPORARY LITERATURE somehow call the truth into question.27 But if, like both Hailey and Sam, the trickster is the eternal child, "allways sixteen" ( Only Revolutions 167), he is also like them always on the road, always existing in a dialogical relation to society and its institutions. The trickster is the very figure of dialogue: "They are the lords of the in-between. A trickster does not live near the hearth; he does not live in the halls of justice, the soldier's tent, the shaman's hut, the monastery" (Hyde 6). Sam and Hailey likewise are meant to be understood as tricksters, simultaneously living teenagers and allegorical figures signifying rebirth, youth, cycle, season, nature, and creative and destructive energies, as well as symbols of the youthful (but not innocent) soul of postnational America. The first lines of the characters' separate sections align them with mythic figures of regeneration. Hailey's section, for example, begins with the words "Samsara! Samarra! Grand!" while Sam's section begins with his exclamation "Haloes! Haleskarth! Con- traband!"28 Meaning something like "flow on" or "wander in perpetuity," Samsara, or Sangsãra, is a derivation from Sanskrit referring to the continuous flow of life in cycles of reincarnation within Hinduism, Buddhism, and other Eastern religions. Start- ing the novel this way signals from the beginning a preference for duration over chronological time, cycle over line. "Haloes" signify a nonhuman, otherworldly, and holy state of being, while "haleskarth" is an obsolete word signifying freedom from injury. Thus on the one hand, the characters are associated with freedom from human bodies and their limitations - grand contraband indeed. Yet on the other hand, the notion of natural cycle is aligned with these characters' names and colors, signifying (at the least) the sun/male principle and the earth/ female principle but reversed in attribution (Hailey, the female character, is color- coded gold). The characters are resituated in nature, but as lim- inal figures or, perhaps, as living beings aligned with nature in 27. Notably, Bronwen Thomas has analyzed the characteristics of the MZD Forums precisely in relation to trickster traditions. 28. These are common observations by fans on the forums as well as by professional critics of the novel. See, for example, Wikipedia, "Samsara," and the MZD Forums.</page><page sequence="22">ELIAS -759 an open, undifferentiated, but planetary existence.29 As they revert to this state at the end of the novel, each dying in the other's story, Hailey is "what terrortories become when some' re none. / Lostlastandstrewn" (292 Sam), while Sam is "every ter- ritory. And drive. / Lostlastandstrewn" (292 Hailey). Like the seasons, time moves on, sweeping the Ozymandian anthropo- morphic machines before it. Sam and Hailey begin again. Ironically, they do so at their most egocentric. At the begin- nings of their stories, at the moment when they are aligned most intimately with nature, animals, and the earth, they are at their most mentally self-enclosed: one with nature, they are also com- pletely selfish beings. Thus while it is easy to see this book as advocating a return to nature and the kind of annihilation of the human category that Agamben advocates, in point of fact the characters lose ego and a sense of themselves as anthropomor- phic centers as they turn toward the Other. Here, to threaten the boundaries of the self is not to lose the self, but to gain it - not as ego, but as community, as love. Christopher David Kilgore has noted that Sam's and Hailey's travels geographically form the figure of a heart on the U.S. map; likewise, they follow a spiritual path from hubristic, narcissistic self-enclosure to other- directed love based in a dialogic formation of self, a thematic and structural ideal that the text seems to recommend. After meeting one another and falling in love, Sam and Hailey grad- ually enter the world of work and lose their connection to nature, but what they gain is other-directed thought, recognition, the possibility of procreative sex, and love. At page 177 in both char- acters' sections, the color coding of the text begins to interwine precisely at the word "too" - one o in gold, one o in green (pun- ning on two becoming one in "too") - and for the first time, we see dialogue within Sam's section, for as the couple has sex, Hailey (coded in gold) seems to respond to Sam's exclamations ("Over with so fast" [178 Sam] and "Only US" [179 Sam]). Their revelation about dialogic relation occurs during their lovemak- ing, "Where we're / closest, where we touch, where we're 29. Leonard notes this opening but reads it as the text's attack on nationalist identity in favor of a postnational globalization (54).</page><page sequence="23">760 » CONTEMPORARY LITERATURE one. / Somehow continuing on separately" (179 Sam). It is no accident that at the very center of the book, their narratives are exactly the same and balanced on the page: "We take nips of a saltier equity. Mixed" (180/181 Sam and Hailey). Hailey and Sam at this moment realize their tragic choices, which are to love and risk a loss of egocentric self in an ongoing dialogic relation with the other, or to be self-sufficient and realize a lack of human meaning: " - Love &amp; Horror's impermanence forever against / Loss &amp; the Caprice of endurance" (181 Hailey and Sam). This dilemma of self-other relations has been expressed by Danielewski himself in an interview: "Because freedom is ultimately the quest from anything - to be unrestrained by your circumstances, by your society, by even your own body - whereas love is all about attachment. It's all about the involve- ment with someone else, which is the opposite of freedom. And yet love allows you to transcend certain things" ("Revolution"). Even the relationship between freedom and unfreedom is explored dialectically, each dependent upon the other for mean- ing, neither complete in and of itself. Relationship, not essence, is the goal at the journey's heart: "We're not talking about par- ticular words but the relationship between words," Danielewski notes of the novel. "Not the particular names of planets but the nature of an eclipse and the effect of gravity on the orbit"("LAist"). If Hailey and Sam are somehow principles of life, the domi- nant ideas expressed by the modern time line or "chronomosaic" that run in the gutters of all of the book's pages are of death, violence, and war. This fact is consistent with a reading of the text that privileges a relational aesthetic. Beginning from Sam's side of the book on November 22, 1863 (the date of the battle of Chattanooga, as Danielewski has noted) and from Hailey's side on November 22, 1963 (the date of John F. Kennedy's assassi- nation), history in this text always features violence and the over- throw of existing institutions (it is only revolutions), and it is always the same story over and over again (only revolutions, never advance). The notion of time as a cycle thus enters even the arena of history. As essentially a spoken-word poem, the novel seems to update Vico's notion of historical ricorso, where</page><page sequence="24">ELIAS -761 mythic history is linked to the metaphoric mode.30 Like Vico's portrait of history, in Only Revolutions history is tropological, not "natural": it is the product of the textualization of the world, a separation from Being into the human time of the social, which explains the overlaps between the terms or "voice" of the chron- omosaic and Hailey's and Sam's voices (commentators have noted, for example, that the teenagers' word for "die" - "go" - also is used in the time line). The same social and tropological apparatus that constructs history also interpolates the teenagers in time and discourse, and perhaps the same circular, planetary logic (including the time of myth) disrupts it or moves it cycli- cally forward. Thus while thematically the chronomosaic raises questions about the value of being and relation in the world, structurally it works dialogically with the main narrative: there is a give and take between the two prose structures, each sharing elements of the other, yet at the same time they pull in different directions, one toward historical linearity and the other toward allegorical or mythic cycle. Both, it is asserted, are US. Somewhat paradoxically, the constrained form of this tightly structured and controlled novel somehow opens the work at the level of interpretation and engages the reader dialogically with the text itself. Understanding Only Revolutions as an attempt to construct a relational aesthetics gives an alternative to readings of the text as technological system. While I'm not sure that this novel constructs a democratic space that forces readers into eth- ical relation to one another and the world (as advocates of rela- tional aesthetics often claim), I'd argue that understanding the book's attack on the Cartesian monad and the anthropomorphic machines of modernity does not leave art to be understood as a machinic system or autopoetic text. Rather, the novel seems to construct a middle ground wherein monadic selfhood is the- matically as well as textually dismantled by the controlled opera- tions of the text, where interaction becomes the means for 30. Also like Vico's "aesthetic historicism," history in the chronomosaic is guided by a rhetorical figure, in this case, metonymy/ synecdoche, the tropes congenial to legend and the time of heroes - aligning with Sam and Hailey's mythic stature in the text. The term "aesthetic historicism" is Erich Auerbachs, in "Vico and Aesthetic Historicism" (110).</page><page sequence="25">762 « CONTEMPORARY LITERATURE reconstructing a communal experience, and where communal experience has an ethical valence linked to themes of the plan- etary. The text pits a phenomenological vitalism against monodie individualism; through its open form it offers dialogic art as an important mediator of human agency and ethical relationships. Philip Leonard, citing N. Katherine Hayles's work on electronic literature as an open system, contends that Only Revolutions pro- vokes a coming together of "text and reader in the continual forging and reforging of a system that is both embodied and technological," and that readers are not "activated as individuals by this text" but rather "are . . . forced to confront their status as components in the emerging and open system of the text. ... as interacting and mutable entities that are constantly remade by acts of narrative engagement which they neither manage nor control" (51). I question that last clause, for the act of interpre- tation pulls readers into the dialogic operations and values of the textual world. The text seems to me to be an open work that may point to the dialogical avant-garde, one whose central chronotope of the planetary constructs subjectivity as both indi- vidual and collective; in which reader participation creates equalized interpretive communities; and in which aesthetic form puts ideas in dialogue, in this case in the service of a meditation upon the nature of the human in a social world. TOC and the Otherness of Space-Time Much more illustrative for me of Leonard's interesting claims about the autopoetic text is TOC, a collaborative CD-ROM media artwork by Steve Tomasula, Stephen Farrell, Matt Lavoy, and Christian Jara and the winner of the Gold Medal, Best Book Mul- timedia Produced 2010 from the eLit Awards, the 2010 Mary Shelley Award for Outstanding Fictional Work, and the 2010 Jacket and Cover Design Award from the Association of Amer- ican University Presses. TOC would seem to have a number of head starts on Danielewski's novel in terms of dialogism. First, it is the result of a collaborative dialogue between four artists working together and separately in different media. Second, it is "an interactive illuminated manuscript that is part animated</page><page sequence="26">ELIAS -763 fable, part written myth, and history," a hypermediated art form in "chapters" incorporating aural and written narrative, film, and animated graphics ("Video Reader's Guide"). Third, the sto- ries themselves are open and recursive, looping in a Möbius-like structure and demanding interpretation by readers. Finally, the "interactive fiction" is inscribed in a digital format that is loaded into one's computer and, like a video game, demands physical input from the reader.31 Yet in terms of its relation to a "dialogical avant-garde" as defined above, this text contrasts in interesting ways with Danielewski's Only Revolutions. For example, the creative dial- ogismi in TOC seems to be internal, taking place between the creative artists, while Only Revolutions included Danielewski's online fan community from the start, diversifying input about the text's construction not through academic collaboration but through public interaction, within cyberspace. Perhaps as a result, rather than being "a novel that challenges the authority of the 'text' in all contexts," as a ForeWord review put it (Rev. of TOC), TOC' s language is polished, elevated, oracular - in direct contrast to the hip-hop, improvisational feel of Danielewski's textual language. If incorporation of populist languages and the "everyday" is necessary to the dialogical artwork's participation in the lifeworlds of its readers, in TOC we see a late-modernist fascination with high art in its insistence on authorial control, in its language games (particularly with internal monologue), and in its many visual references to modernist film and avant-garde music. (One entire section of the text is composed of video clips that mimic modernist dissociation and cinematic montage.) In TOC, it is not primarily human voices but aesthetic forms that are in dialogue, as well as philosophical theses concerning the nature of time. TOC consists of four major sections. The first is a picture of a galaxy with voice-over narration telling of the "mythic" Queen 31.

Two other major sections, "Chronos" and "Logos," follow this opening and are accessed interactively from the navigation screen (called "an interactive table of contents"). The fourth major section, "The Island," is accessed when the user successfully navigates all of the Logos links. Choosing TOC' s Chronos box takes the user to a thirty-minute "continuously flowing animation" (a video incorporating .mp3 and .mov elements) about a Vogue model trying to decide whether to euthanize her hospitalized, comatose husband and whether to abort her pregnancy by her twin brother (this section was also published independently as a short story).32 Choosing TOC' s Logos box opens a "piano scroll box" which, with some interaction, allows the user access to four subsections. Three of these subsections are a chart showing star distances, links to a set of eight video montages, and links to a set of twenty-three short narrative texts (fig.). These three sections are accessed from green, blue, or red color-coded lines on the "moving piano scroll" in the "Logos" box. The fourth Logos subsection (a mixed-media video montage with voice-over telling of the apoc- alyptic destruction of human civilization and the flight of Queen Ephemera and her twins to a remote island) can be accessed only after the other three are completed. This section leads in turn to the fourth major division of the overall text, the Island section (itself divided into twenty-one sub-subsections), which tells the story of the primitive Tic and Toe island peoples. When users complete this section, the island scene explodes and they are returned to the frame (a picture of a star galaxy in deep space). As noted above, clicking on blue lines in the Logos scroll box will take the reader to a set of twenty-three vignettes, each with its own interactive elements. Focusing on the creation in a long- ago world of a fictional "Difference Engine" and its later modern incarnations as the "Influencing Machine" (various types of chronometers), the loosely connected vignettes tell the bizarre, fairytale-like story of a woman who wishes to know and control 32. Tomasula has commented on this episode in an interview ("Not Just Text").</page><page sequence="28">ELIAS -765 The "interactive table of contents" of TOC showing the Chronos and Logos boxes after clicking all lines in the moving "piano scroll" Logos box (bottom right). time, and the men who later cut out her heart and place it in the Influencing Machine in order to do so. This machine in the fic- tional text recalls the factual Antikythera Mechanism, created in the second century b.c.e. and discovered in 1901, used by the ancients as a calculator and for the study of astronomy. When used fictionally as a symbolic marker of time in TOC, the Differ- ence Mechanism becomes more sinister, a machine as well as a metaphor signifying the instrumentalization of knowledge and the creation of biopolitics. It "was used to regulate cyclical activ- ities from those as large as social migrations and crop rotations to those as small as the rhythm of a cell" (TOC). Thus all of the vignettes in this section circle around the idea that the mecha- nization of time originated in the human desire for control - not only of Time itself, but of the bodies of oneself and of others within the social world. Clicking on red lines in the Logos moving player-piano roll takes a user into a series of eight mixed-media stories (video collage with voice-over) with a similar theme. Six of these videos mimic modernist avant-garde films and are the work of Zoe</page><page sequence="29">766 » CONTEMPORARY LITERATURE Beloff, who presented The Influencing Machine of Miss Natalija A. as a video installation in 2001. In grainy, double-exposed black- and-white film showing bizarre images (a clicking octopus beak, for instance) and with a weird whispering voice-over, users hear how the modern Influencing Machine originated in 1875 but took its major form in the 1930s (again linking the Machine to modernism, but also to the rise of totalitarian politics and the military-industrial complex before World War II). Specific real- life entities are mentioned, such as Robert Bosch GmbH, the world's biggest car-parts maker, in "Under the Influence, 1938." The last two mixed-media videos, in color and abandoning the avant-garde film referencing, are set "long after the Terror"; they tell how the Influencing Machine - seemingly clock time - was adapted by late capitalism and of the resulting covert control of the population that this allowed. A thematic questioning in TOC is thus first directed at mecha- nistic science and the analogous social systems it spawns, as one way in which humans attempt to subjugate and control space- time. For example, grids, those mathematical systems that ration- alize multidimensional space into a two-dimensional frame, appear frequently in the graphics of the text's Logos and Chronos sections. Euclidean grids represent the mechanistic logic of machines, which in this text are built by humans to thwart death (a hospital ventilator, an Influencing Machine that will order, rationalize, and compress time). Yet in TOC, these grids and machines seem always to undermine the human lives they were created to supplement and enrich. At one point in the Chronos section, in the filmic narrative about the Vogue model, we see a reproduction of Albrecht Dürer's etching Draughtsman Making a Perspective Drawing of a Woman (1525), an illustration of a "perspective machine" that allows a draftsman to view a naked woman lying on a table - with her feet toward his face and her fingers erotically poised above her vulva - in order to copy her image into two-dimensional perspective. The shocking effect and the eroticism of the picture lie in its stark portrayal of the domi- nating male gaze, sexual desire sublimated into a desire for abso- lute control enabled by the machine. (The text plays a trick on this argument for Euclidean perspective, rendering it three-</page><page sequence="30">ELIAS -767 dimensional through computer graphics and slowly rotating it, as if it were a planet or a star in deep space.) Hannah B. Higgins, in The Grid Book, argues that while Euclid- ean grids are frequently associated with mechanism and the spaced iron bars of prisons and cages ("with their attendant asso- ciation with penal codes and social regulatory systems" [276]), in fact different kinds of grids appear at different points in human history and each "has it own texture, uniqueness, indi- viduating features, capacities for creative enactment, and rela- tionship to other grids, as much as each person combines and utilizes a grid for him- or herself" (276).33 Grids are uniquely human constructs, part of a "complex and multisensory history [that] surrounds us" (277). This is the sense of grid critiqued by TOC, which aligns such grids with instrumentaliza tion and the chronometer. In TOC, people's desires for control similarly turn humans into "organic machines," such as the Vogue model's husband or - at least in the terms set out by this text - the pregnant model her- self, through which time relentlessly and pitilessly makes itself known and gives the lie to any sense of her own autonomy and control. Distinctions between the artificiality of the respirator and the naturalness of the human reproductive system are erased here. The apotheosis of the organic machine is the Influencing Machine itself, a time machine that requires a beating human heart in order to control time and bring order to the world. The Influencing Machine becomes an instrument of hyperrationali- zation, turning humans into near automatons regulated by clock time and free-market time. Significantly, creating this machine requires human death (the beating heart cut out of the female donor), and the machine explodes twice in the text, first causing untold misery and destruction in an apocalyptic end to modern history, and then again at the end of "The Island," implicitly destroying what remains of human civilizations and returning earth to cosmic time. Grids in TOC are thus superimposed over the seemingly true nature of reality - that represented by space-time. The concept 33. The Dürer woodcut is reproduced in Higgins's book (167).</page><page sequence="31">768 • CONTEMPORARY LITERATURE of space-time is aligned, as it often was for the high modernists and postmodernists, with a challenge to Euclidean time by quan- tum time - a representation of time as relative to space and speed, moving not uniformly forward but rather folding in upon itself, reversing its trajectories, slowing down or speeding up in relation to context. TOC' s opening tale of the struggle between Chronos and Logos, time and order, is rehearsed again and again in its stories and fragments. TOC analogizes the scientific prin- ciples of relativity in social and psychological contexts, exploring in numerous narratives and media how time is relative to space, speed, and human perception. But this "relativity" in fact signals a larger principle, the relative character of time itself.34 Here, relativity is a profoundly antihumanist operation, a fundamental principle of the cosmos that confounds human attempts at order and self-determination. If they have worked through "Chronos" as well as the first four sections of "Logos," readers are well prepared for another meditation on the nature of time in the Island sequence. For one other way that humans try to control Time is through myth. Users at the Island section are presented with a screen showing an island ringed by moons; clicking on any of the moons takes one to a screen telling of a particular (often mythic) belief of either the Tic or the Toe peoples, the island's inhabitants. One quickly realizes that half of the moons discuss the beliefs of the Tic and the other half of the Toe, and also that the stories of one tribe perfectly mirror those of the other. The primitive Toe people "believe that the present is an outgrowth of the past, and so by looking into the past one can see into the future. In this sense the past, present, and future are all of a fabric." This historical notion of time is shown to be ridiculous and linked to primitive mythology - absurd not only because the Tics' and the Toes' mythologies mirror one another in ideological terms and equally support provincialism and ethnocentrism, cultural paranoia, and inane spiritualisms that lead to cultural stagnation, but also 34. In her Electronic Book Review review of TOC, Gibbons writes that in this media novel, "two of the fundamental categories of narrative time are unsettled," namely, nar- rative frequency and duration.</page><page sequence="32">ELIAS -769 because time ultimately triumphs over them despite their rituals and beliefs. As a result, the text seems to mock any "primitive" understanding of time as symbiotically related to the human and also to undermine myth as another failed attempt to control Time that ultimately leads not to freedom but to increased surveillance and biopolitical control. It is no accident, either, that the Tic and the Toe represent the Eastern and Western blocs of the island; clearly there is a parody of cold war politics embedded in the presentation of their mirrored paranoias based in isolation and cultic ethnocentrism. The very last screen in the Island section in fact shows the Influencing Machine emerging intact at the heart of the island. After clicking through all of the moons/ narratives surrounding the island and completing the "story," the reader sees the machine explode and is taken phenomenological layer by layer up through space and back through time - from the island to the human cities that preceded it (the Twin Towers are prominent in this cityscape), to a shot of the earth, then the solar system, the galaxy, and, finally, deep space. The end has returned to the beginning, but not as in cyclic history or even as in the ecological time of living earth systems: here, time is that of impersonal mathematics and space-time, nonhuman time that makes a mockery of any human system to control, contain, order, or understand it. The text's central assertion that all myths are inadequate to Time was in fact foreshadowed in an epigram by Saint Augustine that was superimposed upon the opening screen-shot of deep space (to where, at the end of the text, we have been returned): "What then is time? If no one asks me, I know; if I want to explain it to a questioner, I know not." Unlike Danielewski's novel, TOC does not subordinate time to history, does not humanize time within mythological and eco- logical time. Rather, the human is subordinated to time, and space is cosmic rather than earthly. Pregnancy, for example - often figured as the human triumph over time, in the form of generation and continuity - is figured numerous times as time's invasion of the female body. The Vogue model pregnant with her twin brother's child experiences the triumph of time over flesh, for not only has her body been coopted by time - she cannot stop</page><page sequence="33">770 « CONTEMPORARY LITERATURE the unwanted but inexorable flow of time through her womb - but her sibling coupling has unleashed the true nature of time from its rationalized cage. Having sex with her twin brother - a "man of scientific bent" - returns her to a oneness with him, to the shared womb that was their beginning, and momentarily reverses time. "It was only through sex itself that she felt pro- pelled out of time," she says, like Oedipus "thrusting herself back to the source" of her origin. It is only through death - here the "little death" - that she connects to Time in the same way as does her husband, the organic machine. She notes at one point that "God's Time" is equated with the perfect stasis of the coma death of her husband - inhuman and horrific, if sublime. When in the opening vignette Ephemera gives birth, she bears neither human children nor mythological heroes but Chronos and Logos, the dimensions of human time that war in a zero- sum struggle. Yet while an opposition is immediately set up, by the framing narrative, between Chronos and Logos, ultimately both are overcome by a silent opponent always lurking in the background - Kairos, based in the vast, inhuman grid of space- time and sublimity. (Significantly, Kairos is not anthropomor- phized in the text as are Chronos and Logos.) The Vogue model, for example, realizes that her decision to have an abortion and her decision to unplug her husband from the ventilator are related, in that they both will be for her defining moments in time. As she realizes this, a male voice, like the voice of the Cho- rus in a Greek play, breaks into her narrative: "The Greeks had two words for time: chronos, which was passing time, as opposed to kairos, which was a static moment filled with significance" (22:40; punctuation added). Kairos here links the Kantian sub- lime to concepts of space-time, through their implied mutual participation in the extrahuman, the Real. Both stand outside of, and surround, any human comprehension. Kairos, like death and like the sublime, is static because of its sublimity, unlike Chronos or Logos, which order time within human logic and perception. God's time, the time of coma, the time of orgasm, the time of apocalypse - these shatter the illusion that the struggle between Chronos and Logos is at the center of things and give</page><page sequence="34">ELIAS -771 humans glimpses of the vast Otherness of space-time as well as their own unimportance within it. The model in fact realizes, as she contemplates her twinned dilemmas, that what fills the lacuna between TIC and TOC is narrative, "fiction, illusions that worked against the Second Law of Thermodynamics": And she realized that to understand even the first tic of a story, a life, a history, a person had to have a sense of the whole and complete narration. Unable to say, "Now I have the whole/' about the narration she was unfolding (as her own life, of course), she found herself guessing at its versions. . . . Oh poor us, she thought, cradling her belly, as long as her personal apocalypse lie on the next page, she knew she could only grope along, revising guesses at her end, and clinging to the hope that if at the end, her life did mean what she had thought, she will have understood it. But she also realized how complicated this explanation was, a sticky trick that depended on a switch in tense. . . . A chasm of incompletion opened beneath her, an opening that became not only infinite, but infinitely changing . . . what was wanted was a moebius twist, a union of time and desire. (TOC 23:48-26:53; punctuation added) The Möbius twist "of time and desire" is precisely what Danie- lewski's Only Revolutions enacts at the levels of plot and of form. The union of time and desire is, one could argue, history, both in its mythological and its historicist forms - a "sticky trick" of narrativized human time that looks backward with a sense of whole and complete narration, what Hayden White has called history's tropological maneuver. The implied assertion of the supremacy of Kairos over Chronos and Logos may be the reason why, for all of its twenty- first-century technology, TOC feels aligned with a modernist aes- thetic. The definition of time that wins out in TOC is the timeless moment in time, the still point at the center of existence, a cosmic time that can be approached only through the aesthetic (particu- larly the machine aesthetic) and through death.35 Ironically, the 35. In this sense, Hayles's discussion of machine time in "Tech-TOC" is particularly important and implies an alignment of TOC with movements within modernism that explored machinic aesthetics, such as brutalism, futurism, and constructivism. See Armand for a discussion of this connection between machine aesthetics and modernism.</page><page sequence="35">772 « CONTEMPORARY LITERATURE lush beauty of the text's graphics and illustrations does not con- front readers with art's mastery of reality or control of represen- tation but rather points to a sublimity, an excess. The text does not realistically reference human events, nor does it point inward, as the surrealists did, to psychological underpinnings of the real. Instead, it plays variations on a theme and draws imagery from all parts of human existence (science, art, politics, everyday reality) to create a collage that ultimately points away from humanized sociality toward Time-with-a-capital-T. The result is a thoroughly beautiful and engaging text but one with irony at its core: for all of its confrontations with the reader and demands for reader engagement, it ultimately asserts that human engagement doesn't really matter in the vast, inhuman scale of things. Universe Time finally triumphs over human time, the cosmic grid of space-time over the ecological grid of Earth time. Like Danielewski's novel, TOC is a highly conceptualized open form, and the different sections of TOC seem to address the time and space relation. However, while Only Revolutions specifically invokes a planetary chronotope and defines time and space as the meaningful embeddedness of human narrative within time (as love, as history), TOC seems preoccupied with cosmological space-time, the kind of time based in mathematical models that combine space and time in a single coordinate sys- tem (such as that coordinating height, length, and width with time to produce a grid of deep space). Like Danielewski's novel, the text of TOC spatializes history, is open and paratextual, is filled with formal games and puzzles emphasizing the technol- ogy of writing /text, and attempts to synthesize different onto- logical levels of reality. Like Danielewski's novel as well, the text seems to reject utopianism. But surprisingly, given its cutting- edge digital form, this text seems to participate in aesthetic mod- ernism's more conservative formalist bent; it does not reformulate an alternative in time to the crisis of history that it seems to diagnose. Time, not human history, is its focus. Oddly more open and writerly than this game-oriented, multinarrative electronic text, Danielewski's novel, I think, does do so: its myth- ological referencing and allegorical implications situate it in,</page><page sequence="36">ELIAS -773 rather than alienate it from, human time and posit again and again an ecological frame for time and space, an earthly situat- edness that seems to eschew irony. The largest frame for time in the novel is the mythological - itself a human construct. Space- time in Danielewski's text is irrelevant. What matters is human relation, based in the body, in chronological and historical time, and in earth cycles. US. The fascinating question is thus how the two texts are situated with respect to a notion of "relationality" or dialogism that has social implications and consequences - specifically, whether or not they participate in what might be called a "dialogical avant- garde" as it has been recently defined in the visual arts. Both are "interactive," deeply intellectualized, and open works, demand- ing significant physical and mental engagement from readers and refusing closed narrative plots and structures. Both incor- porate and/ or reference numerous art forms, though TOC' s for- mat allows for deeper immersion in the visual and aural and that of Only Revolutions deeper immersion in the textual. Both works imply that transformations of form, in the manner of experimentalism and interactivity, lead to transformations of perspective and meaning. Both are sophisticated, poetic, and quite beautiful pieces of art. Both construct historical time as a kind of Möbius strip, and both "spatialize time" through formal experimentation. Both reject a political utopianism of the kind characterizing some versions of the modernist avant-garde. Only Revolutions and TOC do not, however, point equally to the possibility of a dialogical avant-garde. Alienation and irony - and, through its form, confrontation - are at the core of TOC, and its language is a kind of academic poetry. In this sense, TOC might be aligned with the aesthetics of the Utopian avant-garde, but this media novel actually seems to embed a notion of time and space more characterized by aesthetic mod- ernism, the sublimity of formalism, than with a metanarrative of emancipation underlying Utopian avant-gardism. In contrast, Danielewski's novel seems oddly bereft of irony, entering the realm of play, and it eschews confrontation for implicit coop- eration at the level of form, characterization, and meaning. Only Revolutions may be anchored in a liberal notion of self and free-</page><page sequence="37">774 • CONTEMPORARY LITERATURE dom but seems also to reject the hyperindividualism of the self- contained monad that is found within some forms of liberal ethics and at the center of consumer capitalism. Oddly populist in spirit, Only Revolutions, for all of its allegorical and mytho- logical referencing, situates itself within human environs and historical constructs, even popular culture contexts and the ver- nacular of spoken-word poetry. It thus seems distanced from the ironic perspective on popular culture of formalist modern- ism - which used and referenced vernaculars largely in the ser- vice of high-art aesthetics and Utopian politics. The issue here is not which text is "modernist" and which "postmodernist" - that dreary debate yet again - or even if one of these works is "better" than the other (both are extremely provocative, beau- tiful, and complex artworks), but rather which may point to an earth-bound aesthetics similar to Bourriaud's relational aesthet- ics and an ethics of a dialogical avant-garde, a lateral aesthetics within ecological time. I think that neither work has arrived at such a form, but that Only Revolutions, sitting squarely on the earth and in human history, is on this track. One thing is clear: the claims that Bourriaud and others make for the centrality of form to relationality and public dialogics are certainly important to the literary form of relational art, and they map on to Eco's and others' definitions of literary open form. Open form engages the reader in a lateral interactivity that effects (or at least attempts) a leveling of influence and interpre- tive authority while also embedding a high-level conceptual apparatus constructed by the artist. Open form may also rely deeply on affect as a central mode of persuasion, and on dial- ogism as a central vehicle to ethical engagement. While the idea of "theme" in relational installation art is problematical - what is the "theme" of Marioni's Free Beer but that of sociality itself? - theme is central to any kind of literature and reveals the text's or implied author's claims about the world and the human condi- tion; it strongly skews a text toward or away from a dialogical avant-gardism defined in the terms of installation art. The dif- ferences between Only Revolutions and TOC are centrally differ- ences of theme, or shaping philosophical premises concerning the human in relation to the world/ universe, which are revealed</page><page sequence="38">ELIAS -775 through careful analysis of the textual elements chosen by the authors. Interpretation is at least as important as participation to this literary art. While much ink has been spilled concerning the levels and degrees of collaboration encouraged by "open works" of literature (particularly hypertext and interactive fictions such as TOC), analyzing such texts shows that to reach a degree of relationality as this concept is defined in the visual arts, literature would need to swerve not in the direction of the well-made object but in the direction of creative writing - truly open, col- laborative writing of an improvisational kind. A theory of rela- tionality or social dialogics for the novel in its many incarnations will need to take into account not only form but also the implied author, the implicit and explicit thematic claims. The chronotope of the literary text, however, may be what links it to visual art- works of the dialogical avant-garde. University of Tennessee WORKS CITED Agamben, Giorgio. The Open : Man and Animal.
