Palmer BYU-Hawaii In his book The Children's God, David Heller reports the results of his study of the images of God held by children. The sample included forty children, ranging from four to twelve years old, ten children from each of four different religious traditions: Catholic, Baptist, Jewish and Hindu. Heller conducted a session with each child that included doll play, story telling, drawings, and "letters to God" as well as interview questions. The transcriptions from these sessions, along with Heller's after-session notes, formed the body of data on which the study was based. Heller analyzed these data from a number of different points of view. First, he examined the themes that emerged in the interviews with the children from each different religious group. The God of the Jewish children seemed to manifest a concern for history, a special relationship to a chosen people and a concern for helping people deal with suffering. In the interviews with the Catholic children, family images seemed to predominate, along with a concern for guilt, purity and forgiveness. Baptist children seemed to portray a God who provided both physical nurture and spiritual order, but all from a somewhat greater distance. The God of the Hindu children was an object of intense devotion, deeply involved in the spiritual unity of the community, a God who seemed (somewhat paradoxically) to be at times the most anthropomorphic and at other times the least. Heller next organized the interview records by age and tried to see what patterns could be discerned in the different age groups. He seemed to find a more fun-loving God among the younger children. Among the middle group, God was often associated with sleep and dreams. The God images of the older group seemed to be best characterized by a fairly predictable increase in the children's sophistication in dealing with the subtleties of each tradition. In the next section of the book, Heller surveys common themes that emerged in the interviews with the male and female children. The male children reported a God who was more rational, action-oriented and distant. The God of the females was more passive, more intimate and more attuned to aesthetic sensitivities. In the last section of the book, Heller makes connections between the personalities of the children, the family situations of the children and the personalities of the Gods depicted. Here he concludes that the personalities in the child's family play an important role in shaping the image of God. Heller concludes the book by examining common themes that were present in all the interviews regardless of the differences in religion, age, personality, or family type. Some of</page><page sequence="2">90 the notions he found here included an association of God with light and an association of God with individual transformation. Heller also noted that fear, fascination, intimacy, and omni- presence were common themes as well. The book is written in such a way that it can be read and appreciated by anyone in the general audience of those interested in children, child rearing, psychology and religious studies. This book has the quality of an opening statement, an initial exploration of a new territory. Throughout his analysis of the themes that emerge in his data, Heller suggests connections to other studies and theories. But the connections are always suggested, never developed very far. Sometimes such an approach can be evocative and thought-provoking. Other times the connections seem sketchy and underdeveloped. Most of the strengths and weaknesses of the book coincide with the strengths and weak- nesses of the method the author has chosen. The sample is varied but not large enough to be definitive. The multimedia interview technique is more personal than a questionnaire, but the way the data are summarized never lets the reader see any one individual child in full depth and roundness. One of the greatest strengths of the book is the genuine sympathy and interest Heller demonstrates for the children he worked with. Whenever he recounts an incident from one of the interviews, I have a sense that Heller, as an investigator, has been able to maintain a difficult balance, approaching the children as fellow humans without sentimentality or condescension, while at the same time structuring the situation with the child's capabilities in mind. Since this is, as Andrew Greeley mentions on the cover flap, a "pioneering work," I found myself always waiting for the big surprise, something about what children think that none of us would have guessed. I was a little disappointed. Children seem to think a lot like grown- ups. But perhaps my expectations themselves are telling. In American culture we have always placed a very high value on newness and innocence. The child has been a convenient symbol for those values. Heller's study helps us to see behind images we create of children and childhood, to reaffirm the continuity between childhood and adulthood.
