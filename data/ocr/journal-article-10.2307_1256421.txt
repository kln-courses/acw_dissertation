Carolina Press (Humphrey Milford). 8" x 5k". Pp. xvii + II6. $2. DR. BECKWITH has done an excellent piece of work, following up several other volumes and articles by her on Jamaican folklore. She has familiarized herself with most of what has been written during the last 170 years about the island, as a basis for her own enquiries during four visits, and Black Roadways opens with an account of the land and a fascinating description in detail,-not neglecting even the street cries,-of the folk-life, in which can be studied the mixed culture resulting from the blend of African, Spanish, British, and East Indian. (There may even be a very slight Chinese influence, from a few shopkeepers; in a " three- metal " amulet given to me by the son of a Jamaican planter, one of the metals is represented by Chinese cash.) Like Pro- fessor Puckett,1 the author finds English and European influ- ence,-except, of course, in such matters as obeah,-surprisingly strong, but sea folklore is missing. Examples of adoption of English and West European beliefs are,-you must plant " to meet the moon ", the unbaptized dead child becomes a wander- 1 N. N.

IoI),-live in deep river pools and comb their hair on the banks. But the marriage of first cousins is thought "a good match ", though not so that of second cousins; it is not clear (p. 62) whether the objection is confined to second cousins who are the offspring of first-cousin marriages. Duppies (spirits of the dead) may be confined in bottles (pp. 96, 133, 136),3 and cannot hurt twins, especially if these are of opposite sexes. A dead man's ghost is " kept down " by plant- ing boiled peas or certain vegetables on the grave, and pre- cautions are taken to deceive and mislead any returning spirit. A chapter to which readers will turn with particular interest is that on Obeah (pp. Io4-41). The author gives instances of child murder in 1918 and 1922 to get parts of the body for obeah practices, and says " any unusual pet is, in fact, suspected of being kept for obeah purposes and often is in reality harbored for this reason alone " (p. 125). The obeah man uses things associated with the dead, such as grave dirt, and an example, perhaps not known to Dr. Beckwith, may be quoted here. Dr. B. Moseley, a physician at Chelsea Hospital, says in A Treatise on Sugar (2nd edit., 18oo, p. 197) :-" I saw the OBI of the famous negro robber, Three fingered JACK, the terror of Jamaica in I780. The Maroons who slew him brought it to me. His OBI consisted of the end of a goat's horn, filled with a compound of grave dirt, ashes, the blood of a black cat, and human fat; all mixed into a kind of paste. A cat's foot, a dried toad, a pig's tail, a slip of virginal parchment of kid's skin, with characters marked in blood on it, were also in his Obian bag." 4 The next chapter is on The Myal People, who are counter- workers to the obeah men, and to the references at its end might 2 A London lover refused such a gift a few years ago, and was highly offended at the offer, as he thought it prognosticated a parting. 3 Cf.

Clarke's account of " The John Canoe Festival " in Folk-Lore (vol. xxxvii, pp. 72-5), describing the performance in 1924 at Savanna-la-Mar, a place not visited by Dr. Beckwith. The index of Black Roadways is not impeccable: 51 under " Chinese " is an error for 5, " quality " under " sugar " should be " quantity ", and there are other mistakes and omissions. Black Genesis falls into quite another category. It has excited much attention, for what seems daring irreverence, in Press quarters unacquainted with the naive familiarity of the attitude everywhere bred in the peasant mind from the anthropomorphic conception of its deities.5 A god walking on the earth as a fellow-being naturally takes on human qualities, not all noble and dignified. But we have here to consider this book solely as a collection of folktales from the rice plantations of South Carolina. As an introduction there is an interesting account of the Gullah dialect in which the stories were originally told and which the authors claim, for reasons given, to be based on English of the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries; the dialect has, however, been considerably modified for printing (p. xxiv).6 The greater part of the volume consists of excellent animal tales of the kind made familiar to everybody by Uncle Remus, and paralleled in some cases in other collections.' The whole has been arranged in a sort of expansion and running commentary on the early part of Genesis, divided into " Books " with headings like Biblical chapter headings, and the stories fitted into a framework of Adam, Eve, Cain, and Abel, who sometimes seem quite superfluous accretions and no more essential than " Miss Meadows en Miss Motts en the gals ". One wonders howmuchof this appertains tothefolk and how much has been " written up "! As a free translation into dialect of a Scripture 5 Cf. supra, p. 62 (" La Pira More and La Pire Passet "). 6 Many Gullah stories have been printed by A. E. Gonzales in The Black Border (1922), and With ,Esop Along the Black Border (1924). 7 E.g., Book vi (" Why Br' Gator's Hide is so Horny ", pp. 87-97) is an expanded version of No. xxvi (" Why the Alligator's Back is Rough ") in J. C. Harris, Nights with Uncle Remus (Routledge, 1884), pp. 118-24.</page><page sequence="4">Reviews. 99 reading, the first "Book" might pass, but it does not "ring true" with the tales proper. The solemn warning that " No part of this book may be reproduced in any form without permission in writing from the Publishers " is probably intended to apply to the stories themselves, so we venture to quote from p. xxiv,- " All of the stories have some foundation of tradition. Several have been handed down for generations by family negroes. Two stand practically as originally told .... For them all we have tried to make our fictional development fill in the action and setting that the embodied beliefs or themes of these stories deserve ". In Uncle Remus the story is easily separable from its " setting ", which is not always the case here, but, if one feels that at present great caution is necessary for any comparative study, the tales themselves are delightful and a great acquisition. Perhaps later editions may tell us on what parts we may rely and what is " action and setting", much of which could be spared with advantage to the ordinary reader as well as to the folklorist. Congaree Sketches is a collection of 54 dialect " tales " selected by a white doctor and coming from the negroes near the swamps of the Congaree river in South Carolina. They are mostly anecdotes of white oppression and slavery days, negro sermons, and the like, which throw light on the negro mind but are hardly folklore. But there is also much of interest about restless spirits of evil white men and supernatural happenings, and many beliefs are noted incidentally,-e.g., pointing at falling stars is a great offence (p. 77) ; " Jack-ma-lanters " are " folks wuh ain't 'lowed in heben and can't get in hell " (p. 78) ; " every Friday jay-bird fly to hell and carry wood fer de devil " (p. 78), and it is bad luck to kill either that bird or the death owl, which " ain't no owl, and he ain't no bird " (p. 93). Perhaps the weirdest imagining is " de sperrit dogs an' de barkin snakes " (p. 92), which " come afore death an' in time of 'stress, an' dey tangles 'twixt de feets of men ". A. R. WRIGHT.</page></plain_text>
