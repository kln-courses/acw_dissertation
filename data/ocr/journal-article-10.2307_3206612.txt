<plain_text><page sequence="1">BELA KIRALYFALVI Lukues: A Marxist Theory of the Aesthetic Effect yorgy Lukics (1885-1971), a Hungarian Marxist philosopher and literary theorist, has been recognized as the person "with whom a systematic development of Marxist aesthetics commences."' In the early 1930s, insisting that Marxism has an independent aesthetic, Lukics set before himself the objective of developing, enriching and elaborating the Marxist world view in the areas known to him, particularly in the realm of art theory. His efforts since 1930 resulted in twenty-six published volumes, mostly in literary theory and criticism. Of these, only half a dozen have been translated into English and they do not include his most significant works in aesthetics. One impression that emerges clearly from Lukics' theory of aesthetic reflection is that he considers art a way of knowing. Art is not, however, simply an epistemological tool; its primary value is not social utility. He has said that art is man's "self-awareness" and "the memory of mankind," but these are much too abstract descriptions to satisfy. Only an examination of Lukics' theory of the prolonged and complex nature of the complete artistic experience can take one close to his meaning of the value of art. Such an examination reveals that Lukics considers pleasure to be an integral part of the aesthetic effect: It is not an exaggeration to say that art perhaps never would have come into being if pleasure were not an important, even vital, social constituent of the life of man. Man's habit of responding to certain phenomena of life positively or negatively within the outlines of pleasure is a crucial factor in the origin of every art.2 Crucial though pleasure is, it is not the major factor in judging whether something is a work of art. Lukics would not altogether accept Lessing's statement that "the only unpardonable fault of the tragic poet is this, that he leaves us cold,"3 which clearly implies the dominating importance of pleasure (emotion) as a criterion for judging a tragedy. Although Lukics accepts Plotinus' contribution in moving away from Plato's categorical rejection of pleasure (II, 491), the "ecstasy" principle of Longinus or the "intoxication" theory of Nietzsche are far too extreme for him. He points out that in artistic reflection4 it is possible for either content or form to arouse pleasure without Bela Kiralyfalvi is an Assistant Professor in the Department of Speech at Wichita State University.

He cites, on the one hand, detective novels and crime films whose contents give pleasure to certain segments of society and, on the other, such truly great works in form as the plays of Beckett, whose formalistic achievements are greater than those of many "deep and true art-works" and so arouse pleasure. Neither are art in the final analysis. Lukics states emphatically that "we must seek and find the final determining criterion of genuine art in its universality" (II, 516). One might argue that the works of Beckett are certainly universal, but to Lukics their universality is expressed too abstractly and allegorically. Universality in art, for Lukics, is arrived at only through the category of specialty, through the observation of the principles of type, totality and this-worldliness. Before describing the components of his theory of the aesthetic effect, Lukics makes it clear that he rejects both illusion and empathy as being important or unique parts of that effect. He contends that illusion, as a goal of the aesthetic effect, is basically a deception, cheating, which places art on the level of daydreams, because "illusion is merely subjective" and "starting from this subjectivity it wants to correct objective reality, that is, it wants to replace it with a better reality woven from subjective dreams" (I, 767). Lukics believes that we, the receivers of the art-work, are always aware of the difference between objective reality and the aesthetic world. He considers degrading to art the suggestion that the receiver might knowingly surrender himself to illusion. The only anthropomorphic reflection which is based on illusion is religion, because religion demands absolute belief. Empathy is not at all unique to art, for it is a common accurrence in everyday life. To make empathy the core of artistic experience means to drag artistic experience down to the level of everyday life. Moreover, an extreme form of empathic response is the Nietzschean "Dionysiac intoxication" which Lukics opposes very sharply with the following argument: This intoxication is the deperate gesticulation of those men who cannot find direction and content for their lives. The transcendence, which they believe they grasp in it, is the Nothingness of their own shattered and crippled personalities, the emptiness of their relationship with the world. When with feigned pride they refuse to embrace the world with the help of science and mimesis, they are merely deluding themselves.., but when they plunge back from the intoxication into everyday life, which now seems even emptier, the world still regains its rightful status. (I, 481) Whether it is Hitlers or drugs that cause these short excursions of people into "trans- cendence," Lukics believes they invariably have to come back to facing the facts of objective reality. He does not believe that theories of transcendence are verifiable on the basis of the best artistic accomplishments of mankind. If the essence of artistic experience were such "intoxications," then art would be as dehumanizing as the effects of drug addiction and alcoholism. Perhaps the clearest way to discuss Lukics' theory of the complete artistic experience is by way of stating first that he considers the ultimate effect of art to be ethical in nature. By this he does not mean that art seeks to interfere with the practical lives of men, that it serves out sermons, moral codes, or object lessons. He is talking about a long, subtle, uneven process (emotional and rational) that occurs in the receiver after the aesthetic effect proper. Collectively, this is a socio-historical effect of awakening man's consciousness to the fact that he "makes himself" and to the broadening of the concept</page><page sequence="3">508 / EDUCATIONAL THEATRE JOURNAL of the individual man as a member of ongoing humanity. The final effect, in Lukics' judgment, appears to fall somewhere between "disinterested contemplation" and direct, practical influence: There is a deep relationship between aesthetics and ethics, revealing the fact that a truly profound aesthetic development is not possible without regard to moral problems and feelings; in the realm of aesthetics, however, these feelings must remain contemplative (only after the aesthetic experience can they assume the form of moral practice), therefore, the problems remain problems, they "merely" broaden man's horizon and reveal conditions and consequences otherwise doomed to oblivion, without going over into practice in a direct manner. (I, 487-488) Keats summarized the final effect of art with the line: "Beauty is truth, truth beauty." Luk'ics finds this poetic expression of the complete union of ethics and aesthetics totally acceptable: "The identity of Beauty and Truth is indeed the direct meaning of the pure aesthetic experience, and this is why it is the eternal theme of all theories about art." (I, 489). The total artistic experience that results in this ultimately ethical effect consists of three parts: (1) the receiver's inner state before the effect, (2) the aesthetic effect (catharsis) itself, and (3) the after-effect. The state before the effect is extremely important because "the receiver never faces the art-work as tabula rasa,"5 rather he "comes from life, more or less loaded with impressions, experiences and ideas" (I, 749), all of which continue to play an important role both in the catharsis and in the after-effect. Every receiver comes to the work as a "whole man of life," an individual with his personal worries, goals and desires, but only journalistic, rhetorical or propagandistic works, whose contents (lacking aesthetic transformation through form) remain those of everyday life, are directed at such a state of being, because only such works aim "to ease directly the implementation of definite, concrete social tasks" (I, 751). Lukacs cites Aeschylus' The Persians, the plays of Aristophanes, Brieux and the early plays of Brecht as examples of rhetorical drama directed at the "whole man of everyday life." A true art-work's content, through its peculiar form (its "own world"), breaks into the "whole man's" soul-complex, transforming his inner state of being and causing him to "suspend his other concrete endeavors and to give himself solely to the effect of the art-work" (I, 749). This experience changes him temporarily from an isolated individual with particular concerns to a participant in "man's wholeness" with a concern for the destiny of humanity. The core of the aesthetic effect itself is catharsis or the purging of passions. Lukics is careful to make the reservation, however, that the aesthetic effect is not purely emotional. He shares Brecht's skepticism about all "merely emotional artistic effects," while insisting, as he believes Brecht also does, on the preservation of the "seed of catharsis" (I, 765). Lukics argues that events in real life, even scientific revelations (such as those of Copernicus or Darwin), are capable of arousing strong emotions in nearly every member of society due to their religious, political, and scientific implications; therefore, the achievement of heightened emotion is not in itself unique to art. Nor is catharsis comparable to the calm after the storm or to quiet resignation; in fact it has no s Gyorgy Lukaics, Miy'vszet is tirsadalom (Budapest, 1968), p. 326.</page><page sequence="4">509 / LUKACS AND THE AESTHETIC EFFECT negative or pessimistic connotations at all. Lukics quite clearly favors Lessing's definition of catharsis as "the transformation of passions into virtuous habits,"6 but he broadens the presence of catharsis to include the effects of every single art. The emotional effect, the purging of the passions in all arts has, in his optimistic view, a broadly humanizing influence upon the receiver: "That moving and shaking effect, that convulsion which is provided by tragedy, comedy, the novel, the good painting, the good statue and the musical creation, that purging of our passions, causes us to become better human beings than we were, to develop in us the readiness for the morally good."' Catharsis in art "evokes that moving experience which reveals how different, how new-at once more individual, more comprehensive, more universal-reality can be."8 Since the center of art is man, Lukics' concept of catharsis recalls Sophocles' words in Antigone, "The world is full of wonderful things/ But none more so than man," and Shakespeare's "What a piece of work is man" (Hamlet, II. ii). There is a definite sense of joy in the experience. By "forcing onto him a new 'world,' " the aesthetic effect changes the "whole man of everyday life" into one with a sense of "man's wholeness." By filling him with "new or freshly seen contents," he is made capable of taking in this "world" with "rejuvenated senses and thoughts" (I, 748). The consideration of the collision of the new and the old is very important to Lukics. During the artistic experience, he believes, there is frequently a battle in the receiver between his old experiences and the present artistic impressions. The effect of great art is precisely its capacity to make "the new, the original" victorious over the old experiences of the receiver.' The deeply moving, even shaking, aesthetic experience is necessary because only the most extreme trials can prove the individual's true being, "whether he is seed or peeling." Nothing exemplifies this more poignantly than Ibsen's Peer Gynt. At the end of a series of "extreme trials," Peer sits peeling an onion layer by layer, only to discover that it has no "heart," no seed, no substance (V. v). This symbolic summary of the tragic character's life illustrates what Lukics means by art's, especially drama's, probing for man's "intensive totality." Aesthetic experiences of extreme intensity can best evoke "the purging of passions" and the consequent "overflow into ethics" in the "after" stage of the aesthetic effect (II, 368). It is for this reason that "tragedy brings about the most succinct, most characteristic form of catharsis" (I, 760). Whatever else may be the value of an artistic work for man, its ultimate aesthetic value is its potential power to bring about this cathartic experience for the receiver in any succeeding age. Lukics illustrates this quite clearly through some comments on the Oedipus Rex of Sophocles: It is true that the Oedipus of Sophocles is loaded with information valuable to the ancient historian. But it is equally true that nine-tenths of the later viewers or readers of this drama know nothing or very little of such historical preconditions, and yet they are still deeply moved by its ' Hamburg Dramaturgy, p. 193. 7 Gyorgy Lukacs, A miivkszet mint felipitminy (A special publication of the Hungarian Cultural Ministry, 1955), p. 26.

It would be, however, another false extreme to believe that this effect is due exclusively to the "magic" of the perfect form. The perfect form is there . . but by itself it is empty and would arouse only a short-lived effect of suspense .... What moves the listener in the Oedipus is a typical human destiny, in which today's man, too, living through it-even if he is only capable of under- standing the concrete historical conditions in their crudest outlines-awakens directly, emotionally to the awareness of a mea causa agitur.' o The reason for the long-lasting life, the unceasing evocative power of all such dramas lies in this effect. They awaken man's own past, but not the personal past of a particular individual, rather "his past as a member of mankind."1 The transformation brought about by the aesthetic (cathartic) effect, of "the whole man of everyday life" into man's sense of wholeness as a member of ongoing humanity, is temporary, because after the cathartic experience the receiver goes back to his personal goals, problems and desires. What influence the art-work has had upon him is difficult to measure because the effect varies from individual to individual and is likely to be cumulative: "The effect of the art-work upon man after the experience remains almost completely imperceptible, and only a whole series of similar experiences will reveal visible attitudinal, cultural, etc., changes; though frequently, of course, a single art-work may bring a complete turn-about in a man's life." (I, 785) Not only do the individual man's interests for the most part change very slowly and subtly as the result of the aesthetic effect, but Lukics adds that any change at all is "only a possibility" and by no means a necessity. Further, whatever the size, the quality or the speed of the change may be, the change itself is "not the criterion of either the power of the art-work, or the depth of the catharsis" (II, 489). When the aesthetic effect does influence individual interests it is indirectly, because the cathartic effect directly touches only man's sense of wholeness and modifies individual interests only through it. Lukaics is careful to note that this does not mean that his theory is close to Kant or the advocates of "art for art's sake," who believe "that artistic experiences do not influence people's practical, everyday lives" (I, 775). Disinterestedness, according to Lukics, is only one factor, and not the essence of the aesthetic attitude. Participants in the artistic experience suspend their direct, practical goals only temporarily. Total disinterestedness is not possible because the mere fact that the receiver "embraces," takes in, the art-object is "inseparably linked with his affirmation or negation of it" (I, 606). The opposite extreme, that art is didactic and artists are "engineers of the soul" (as Stalin put it) is even farther from Lukics. He rejects Brecht's theories, because he believes that Brecht wants art to achieve during the experience what Lukaics says can only occur as an after-effect. " What Lukics concludes, then, is that the aesthetic effect does influence the receiver's practical goals and desires, but that the effect is not aimed at this directly and that the influence is not immediate. The aesthetic effect does not solve any of the ,0 Ibid., p. 324. * Gyorgy Lukics, A kiilonossig, mint esztktikai kategoria (Budapest, 1957), p. 239.

To translate this readiness into practical actions, the receiver must find the necessary tools in life itself. The real power of artistic evocation is that it enlarges the receiver's picture of himself and the world in which he lives. Thus, in the total aesthetic experience, there is no complete separation between life and art. In Lukics' metaphor, life is a great river from which the reflective forms of a higher order (art, science, philosophy, etc.,) branch off, achieve their own peculiar forms and "join once again the river of everyday life by virtue of their influence upon the lives of men" (I, 9). As a result of this unending historical process, both life and art are constantly enriched. The fact that Lukaics finds the ultimate effect of all arts to be ethical, that he accepts the thesis that truth and beauty are identical, does not mean that he wishes to impose external ethical standards on art. He has always rejected the critical methods of Plato and all other extrinsic criticism, agreeing instead with Aristotle's intrinsic approach: Aristotle has said that the aesthetic pleasure, the beautiful experience that occurs in the reception of the object, has nothing to do with whether we would welcome its (man, situation, event, etc.,) coming to fruition as a concrete reality in our lives. The essence of the aesthetic creation and its effect is that in the the artistic portrayal man embraces without resistance, even enthusiastically, all that he fears, abhors, or rejects in life. (I, 642) Lukaics is not a dualist, he spurns all theories that attempt to build a hierarchic ordering of natural and artistic beauty. Natural beauty is an element of life, which, like all other elements of life, has a form and content outside the realm of aesthetics. The artist does not create artistic beauty by merely transferring the beautiful from life into the art-work. He creates aesthetic beauty by making the elements of life integral parts of the total context of the art-work's own world. In this sense, natural ugliness can be aesthetically beautiful as well as natural beauty. But in a true work of art it is not perceived as natural ugliness because art is not judged by the standards of everyday life. Even in lyric poetry, which often seems to be merely the celebration of the beauty of nature, Lukaics believes that "the poetic formulation of spring or winter also betrays the position that the poet takes with regard to the truly great currents and battles of his age" (II, 595). Art is anthropomorphic, everything in it is related to man. In the novel and the drama this is even more clear: "The subject of these is not the mere experiencing of reality,.. . rather the human or social practice itself; the experiencing of nature becomes the proper subject of the structuring only episodically, tightly related to this practice" (II, 595). Lukics gives many examples of the occurrence of natural beauty in art in this fashion, citing especially Greek and Elizabethan drama. He stresses that it would be as much a mistake to say that the Greeks found storms at sea beautiful simply because such storms are often parts of aesthetically beautiful art-works, as to conclude that the storm in King Lear is not primarily music accompanying a human story "whose guiding motifs are given by the social-ethical problems" (II, 596). Beauty in art is the portrayal of the totality of man. In true art, Lukaics adds, this is not done in a roundabout manner; not, for example, by arousing pity and sympathy through elegiacally lamenting the past, the dying, or through taking revenge for its destruction by means of poetic irony-as Schiller had predicted would occur, and as</page><page sequence="7">512 / EDUCATIONAL THEATRE JOURNAL Luk~ics believes has indeed occurred, in modern bourgeois literature. The ultimate effect of the art-work should point to the future. Its beauty lies in its ability to rescue man from the distorting and destructive effects of class society through the "poetically direct portrayal of man's wholeness."'1 3 1 Gyorgy Lukics, Nagy orosz realistak, kritikai realizmus (Budapest, 1951), p. 47.
