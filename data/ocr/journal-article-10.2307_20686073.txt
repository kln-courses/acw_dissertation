The whole is the whole of movements maintaining its concrete identity in all its passages. G.W.F. Hegel, Encyclopedia Though ordinary thinking everywhere has contradiction for its content, it does not become aware of it, but remains an external reflection which passes from likeness to unlike ness, or from the negative relation to the reflection-into self, of the distinct sides. It holds these two determinations over against one another and has in mind only them, but not their transition, which is the essential point and which contains the contradiction. Intelligent reflection, to men tion this here, consists, on the contrary, in grasping and asserting contradiction. Even though it does not express the Notion of things and their relationships and has for its material and content only the determinations of ordinary thinking, it does bring these into a relation that contains their contradiction and allows their Notion to show or shine Qui Parle Vol. 10, No. 2 Spring/Summer 1997</page><page sequence="2">62 RAJ SAMPATH through the contradiction. Thinking reason, however, sharp ens, so to say, the blunt difference of diverse terms, into opposition. Only when the manifold terms have been driven to the point of contradiction do they become active and lively towards one another, receiving in contradiction the negativity which is the indwelling pulsation of self-move ment and spontaneous activity (Lebendigkeit). G.W.F. Hegel, The Science of Logic Traces of Hegel's metaphysics and shadows of his teleology of his tory haunt much poststructuralist thought. Hegel's ghost lingers in such works as Michel Foucault's Madness and Civilization (1961) and The Order of Things (1966), Gilles Deleuze's Difference and Repetition (1968) and The Logic of Sense (1969), Jacques Lacan's The Four Fundamental Concepts of Psychoanalysis (1964) and Ecrits (1966), Jacques Derrida's Edmund Husserl's Origin of Geometry: An Introduction (1961) and Of Grammatology (1967), Michel Serres's The System of Leibniz (1968), and Jean Baudrillard's Consumer So ciety (1970).1 This is a strange and controversial proposition. For these thinkers-among others-were responsible for a series of pow erful critiques; under explicit attack, were the humanist, metaphysical, and teleological foundations of the human sciences of the nineteenth and twentieth-centuries. In short, these thinkers dismantled some of the deepest presuppositions that underpin the "Philosophy of His tory." Thus how can one possibly substantiate a correlation between the critiques made by contemporary French thought and Hegel's 'metaphysics'? No doubt, 'poststructuralism' has left an indelible mark on our contemporary theoretical imagination and its opaque tempo ral horizon.2 But this mark also conceals a deep anxiety over Hegelianism and its legacy.3 For poststructuralism not only affects our attitudes on the 'historical present' but the question of how one temporalizes the historicity-or 'historical finitude'-of any philoso phy of history (Hegelian or otherwise). The 'poststructuralist' generation came of age after World War II. As students, some were witnesses to these events. The crystalliza tion of their academic philosophical training was overshadowed by</page><page sequence="3">SUPERSEDING DECONSTRUCTION 63 the after-effects of their war-time experiences. Their readings of Kant, Hegel, Marx, Nietzsche, Freud, Husserl, and Heidegger were wrought within a complex historical horizon, a certain existential orienta tion, and a rich Parisian intellectual scene that flourished from the mid 1940s through the 1950s.4 The patterns of thought witnessed among this generation of thinkers indicate an overarching tendency in twentieth-century thought-a certain disillusionment with tran scendental philosophy and ultimately speculative idealism to handle fundamental ontological questions concerning time, movement, epochs, and the historicity of History.5 No doubt, the philosophical generation that began in the 1930s and matured by the 50s formed a stratified bedrock of fundamental assumptions and key terms. This foundation was instrumental for the 'poststructuralist' outbreaks, which begin to flower in the 60s and thereafter. In incorporating and sublating its predecessors, the poststructuralist formation poses a difficult problem for the historian of ideas.6 Among other characteristics that one could describe, there seem to be four primary elements which comprise the epistemologi cal substrate of this decisive formation. These elements form a horizon by which we can analyze the transition from the intellectual genera tion of the 40s/50s to the poststructuralist departures with which we are familiar today. 1) We discover an intricate reception of Kant, Hegel, Marx, Nietzsche, Weber, Freud, Husserl, and Heidegger. Spe cific moments of their ideas or different relations between them blossomed in certain sectors of the human sciences, while other re lationships were obscured. 2) Differing translations of the German philosophical heritage, occurring at differing times, led to widely divergent forms of criticism. Previous French intellectual formations such as existential phenomenology, Bergsonian vitalism, Brunschvicg's critical idealism and positivism, and surrealism came under heavy attack. 3) We see a slow but steady institution of deter inate assumptions concerning the limited viability and eventual untenability of Western metaphysical projects: under scrutiny, were philosophy, theology, subjected-centered forms of aesthetic experi ence, orthodox (transparent) forms of human agency and praxis, faith in empiricism to treat fundamental problems in social and human</page><page sequence="4">64 RAJ SAMPATH sciences, positivistic theories of causality and causation, the priority of vision among the senses, and the possibility of non-linguistic con ditions for external criteria of truth. 4) We discover an opaque dissolution of the power of both transcendental philosophy and ide alist forms of 'speculation' to frame the fundamental ontological questions of metaphysics: particularly, the problem of time, causal ity, freedom, necessity, movement, transformation (change), and the essential historicity of human Dasein. Likewise, we find an increas ing anxiety over what may follow the 'post-transcendental age' accompanied this subtle process of dissolution. Hence certain in herited metaphysical questions (time, movement, origin, event, historicity) were neglected insofar as their retention in the staunch est thematic critiques of Western metaphysics and philosophy remained invisible and thus unnoticed. Given these four elements, one can hypothesize that a law of diminishing returns was established: the more the metaphysical tra dition was critically evaluated, the more a self-defeating split-eschatology was consolidated. This strange 'law' involves a com plex bi-polarization between two intricate phenomena: we discover the will to overturn all of the fundamental assumptions of the human sciences without necessarily destroying the eschatological will to answer their questions; and we find the increasing need to respond to the problem of the death of eschatology, humanism, and teleol ogy in History (or the question of what comes after 'Man,' 'Philosophy,' 'History,' 'Progress,' 'Capitalism,' 'Democracy,' in short 'Truth') while liquidating the powers of critical-reason to meet the growing exi gency of this virulent anti-metaphysical suspicion. Hence these conditions are polarized in terms of a positive and negative element. Indeed they form a relation. We discover a bi-polar relation between the eschatological will to answer after the question of eschatology has been destroyed and an anti-eschatology, which dismisses the possibility of answering the fundamental question (of Everything) while admitting the perdurance of its function. For the question of being, time, experience, and existence haunts even in its obsoles cence. The cross-wise fusion embedded in this law hides beneath all contemporary assumptions concerning the nature of 'con temporaneity' or the 'historical present.' It concerns the historicity of</page><page sequence="5">SUPERSEDING DECONSTRUCTION 65 History itself, the moment when History recognizes its own alleged 'finitude.' Of all the mid-twentieth-century French intellectual figures that influenced the 'poststructuralists' (Foucault, Deleuze, Derrida, Baudrillard, Serres, and Lyotard to name a few), one can argue that the iconoclast, Maurice Blanchot, along with the translator and com mentator of Hegel, Jean Hyppolite, and the byzantine archivist, George Bataille, played pivotal roles. In the thought of Blanchot, one discovers a direct and unrelenting confrontation with problems of eschatology, epochs, epochal transformation, and time-in short the deepest enigmas of the philosophy of history. Along with Hyppolite's translations and analyses of Hegel/Hegelianism, the ex traordinary eclecticism of Blanchot's writings constitute decisive moments in twentieth-century French thought; they form the un known quantity in the complex transition from one intellectual generation to another: that is, from Kantian 'critical idealism,' Husserlian 'phenomenology,' Heideggerean 'ontology', Nietzschean 'genealogy', Marxist dialectical and historical materialism, existen tialism, existentialist Marxism, structuralism, psychoanalysis, and hermeneutics to what is now called 'Poststructuralism.' Not only is this transition one of the most difficult theoretical problems facing the field of intellectual history today, it poses an essential ontologi cal question concerning the 'epoch and epochal transformation' in general.7 And by no means is this question implicated in certain already overdetermined faces of our 'historical present', such as our complex 'historical time,' historical moment, threshold, or eclipse, the historic break from History or the end of history, the ordinary resumption of continuity in the endless stream of time, the transition to another realm, or the fragmentation and entropy of time itself, the recurrence and recirculation of real and imaginary histories? It does not involve repetition or overcoming of the past and past futures, the embrace of new futures divorced from the comfortable continuity of the present and present pasts, the awaiting the arrival of another One, in short our 'closure.' Prior to and beyond all registers of signifying the 'historical present,' one must raise a certain question. But this is no ordinary question; it does not presuppose in advance a determinate position</page><page sequence="6">66 RAJ SAMPATH on or negation of the 'historical present.' Rather, we must ask about an intrinsically temporalized Relation: the relation between temporalizing the question of the epoch (and epochal transforma tion) and the temporal structure of the event that seeks its solution. Thus we ask about the relation between two forms of temporalization. For this relation is complex in its own right; it does not presuppose a particular thematic, ontic, hermeneutic, philological, disciplinary, transdisciplinary, institutional, non-institutional, cultural, political, social, ethnic, religious, national, or international horizon. Further more, it does not draw from the four-fold epistemological substrate that we revealed beneath poststructuralist forms of thought.8 Face to face, we encounter the enigma of the question of time, history, end, origin, transition, movement, event, eternity in and forthe historicity of History. The horizon of the question (historicity of History) is the temporalization of a relation. But the relation in itself raises a double problem: temporalizing a question (the question of epochs) and temporalizing the event, which gives birth to its own anticipated solution. However, the substance of the terms (question and event) of this relation are not given in advance. Nor is the relation founded on a transparent continuity of metaphysical assumptions of time or a stark, incommensurable discontinuity between the tradition of meta physics and what comes 'after'.9 The nature of the relation is not an a priori universal. Indeed the Relation between the relation and its terms becomes a question; hence an interrelation asserts itself. And this interrelation takes on the status of an event of thinking. Here we embark upon a most difficult task: reconsidering the deepest prob lem of time, history, eschatology, movement, end, and the transcendence of time/eternity in 'Absolute Knowing' in Hegel's Phe nomenology, and reconsidering the event of the so-called 'closure' of metaphysics, whose myriad texture is displayed in poststructuralism and its derivatives, such as 'deconstruction'.10 Here we launch into the secret void of a singularity: the interrelation. In this temporal zone, we are neither determined by the spiral ing complexity of the traditional view on the 'three-moment' Hegelian scheme (negation, negation of negation, synthesis) nor by a post Hegelian opacity 'beyond' any scheme, a 'beyond' whose witness is</page><page sequence="7">SUPERSEDING DECONSTRUCTION 67 deconstruction, a beyond that is an enigmatic, self-concealing 'fourth' side." Rather, we witness the silhouette of an event. The event is one of a different self-conceptualization of movement based on a hith erto unthought chiasmic form: we open the problem of an interrelational becoming." The interrelation is the relation between a relation and its terms: the latter-to recall-is the relation between temporalizing the question of the epoch and temporalizing the event of its solution. The interrelation is not what lies between the terms, but what is born out of the possibility of conceiving a new relation between any relation and its terms. Another logic is at work; neither the Hegelian dialectic nor the deferral/dissemination of its closure can help us here. The shadow of four descends on the three; it even engulfs the post-Hegelian eclipse of the three, which attempts to open a fourth side without presenting it as such. As we travel into this strange temporal warp, we summon a certain 'in between' as our guide. Blanchot's theoretical works are not simply Hegelian nor are they the immediate precursor to deconstruction. Between the alleged death of Hegel's speculative idealism and the opaque birth of Derrida's deconstruction, a certain dead-born potentiality haunts us twice-over. Neither born deconstructionist after the death of Hegel nor dead in/as deconstruction before the birth of a new Hegelianism, the 'in be tween' haunts itself in itself and for itself. However, the essential duplicity of this in-between does not claim either one of its poles as the source for deriving the whole; hence it does not repeat/return itself nor transcend/overcome itself. For this potentiality, this 'in-be tween', is irreducible to an inscrutable oscillation, which seems to determine moments of 'our historical present'-the unconscious swing between deconstructive attempts to attest to a 'post-Hegelian' condition beyond any unity, and the absorption of deconstruction back into a pre-critical and pre-ontological 'idealism'-or the search for a self-legitimating (unified) Concept of rationality itself. Neither a presupposition nor the opposite of an actual form, the potentiality we speak of is a type of movement already engendered. But it is a movement of 'two' towards their ownmost possibilities to be-move ment in their own irreducible ways; it is neither the unified movement</page><page sequence="8">68 RAJ SAMPATH of a relation, which harbors the double movement of its terms, nor an irreconcilable double movement incapable of being conceptual ized. Trying to spatialize this condition will destroy the potentiality's ownmost potential to move and be moved. The essence of its own secret risks an easy reduction of the problem of the 'interrelation': the relation between the relation and its terms-the terms of the temporalization of the question of the epoch and the temporal struc ture of the possibility of its solution. Thus any easy (sense-certain or linguistic) self-reflexive logic concerning the interrelation and the entity, which can intuit its event, must be foreclosed as initial pre cautionary measure. It is not that we are going to an unknown territory; rather, the unknown is the mode of our journey prior to its 'origin' and its 'destination.' We are stretched in the 'in-between' that sum mons itself to move and summons itself as movement: the split-origin of movement itself. * Maurice Blanchot is one of the most enigmatic writers/thinkers in twentieth-century France. Responsible for influencing dominant French intellectual figures, such as Levinas, Foucault and Derrida, Blanchot's critical and literary work spans nearly five decades.13 In addition to his fictional contributions, he offers a powerful set of philosophical reflections on the problem of time, history, and ep ochs. His magisterial L'Entretien /nfini (1969) is a good example.14 Although time, death, literature, and love are prominent themes in all his major literary and philosophical pieces, L'Entretien lnfiniraises these issues by way of the problem of historicity.15 For the most part, Blanchot is known for his powerful quasi phenomenological analyses of language and death. But his thoughts on time and history are peculiar testimonies whose complexities have yet to be unraveled in terms of their ontological breadth.16 Part I of L'Entretien /nfini opens its first section with a brief discussion of the history of philosophy. Blanchot centers his analysis around the prob lematic of philosophy's mode of presentation: in antiquity philosophy was about teaching; in the seventeenth century it was tied to method and discourse as a type of experience; and in the eighteenth century</page><page sequence="9">SUPERSEDING DECONSTRUCTION 69 (particularly France) philosophy was linked to writing and the letters (B, 4). In certain figures, such as Rousseau, all three modes of pre sentation seem to be at work (B, 4). But at the threshold of modernity, the late eighteenth century, philosophy becomes part of the 'institu tion'. The 'philosophical' embodies itself in the university professor, notably Kant and eventually Hegel. Even renegades like Kierkegaard and Nietzsche dealt with the problem of philosophy/philology at the university; they speak of the professionalization of thinking in which the philosopher is likened to a magistrate who begins to answer ques tions about his own cultural legitimacy (B, 4). Among the most startling manifestations of philosophy as simultaneous professional, cultural, and political institution is the case of Martin Heidegger (B, 5). Blanchot, an outsider, intervenes in this 'history' when he asks us to consider philosophy as 'speech.' Moreover, speech is tied to a "relation of infinity" (B, 6). The relation between the attempt to know and the unknown is a relation of "infinite distance" (B, 6). And to add to this abstraction, he suggests that this relation is never simply a pure "continuity" of estrangement between its two terms (knower and unknown) nor an absolute "discontinuity," which jettisons the relation (B, 7). The movement of thinking, which is neither continu ous nor discontinuous, can help us rethink the history of philosophy, which includes diverse figures ranging from Aristotle to the culminator of the system of Logic itself, Hegel. Blanchot argues, however, that to think the relation in itself, one can not repeat traditional forms of logic; one cannot oppose the two terms-which would presuppose a negation of their identity-launch the work of negation of nega tion in collapsing their difference, and then initiate the resurrection to a higher principle of opposition, as in Hegel's dialectic. Instead, he asks about the "between," for instance, in the opposition between "Being and Nothingness" (B, 7). He says that the 'between' is a "noth ingness more essential than Nothingness itself-the void of an interval that continually hollows itself out and in hollowing itself out be comes distended: the nothing as work and movement" (B, 7). Apparently for Blanchot, 'dialectical synthesis' halts this other move ment of 'distention' in/of the "interval," or "void," which is the "between" of opposites (B, 9). Or rather, in fairness to Hegel, he asks why certain 'misunderstandings' arise when "Hegelian movement"</page><page sequence="10">70 RAJ SAMPATH is equated with a movement of continuity, as in Surrealism, and not the movement of/as distention (distanciation).17Instead of despair ing over this misunderstanding and likewise blindly affirming 'discontinuity,' Blanchot asks us to consider another relation, one in which neither continuity nor discontinuity reigns over the other. It is an "entirely different relation" (B, 10). The closest Blanchot comes to conceptualizing the relation is the following: It is as though in the time-space of interrelation it were necessary to think under a double contradiction; to think the Other first as the distortion of a field that is neverthe less continuous, as the dislocation and the rupture of discontinuity-and then as the infinite of a relation that is without terms and as the infinite termination of a term without relation.(B, 74). Instead of plumbing the infinite mystery of this passage, we shall return to it in our analysis of Blanchot's section on time, epochs, and history, namely "The Most Profound Question." In "The Most Profound Question," Blanchot says that "we ask ourselves about our time" (B, 11). Immediately he plunges into a se ries of enigmatic statements concerning the temporal horizon under which we can pose the question of 'our time' to ourselves, namely the time of the question. In an infinite abstraction, he alludes to the vertigo of the question posed to itself as "the work of time": "time seeks and tries itself in the dignity of the question," "time is the turn ing of times"(B, 11). Ultimately, In a certain way, then, it is time-the movement of time and the historical epoch-that questions? Time, but time as a question, as that which through time, and at a cer tain moment in time, brings forth the questions as a whole, and history as the whole of these questions. (B, 11) For Blanchot, raising the question of 'our time' is not simply a ques tion which we can answer. Rather, the event of the question itself presupposes the question of why it is raised, ad infinitum. But the regress is not infinite since the event by which the question raises</page><page sequence="11">SUPERSEDING DECONSTRUCTION 71 itself, thereby raising the question of the question, etc., is 'always' particular. The question of time-our time, the whole of time in our time and our time in the whole of time-always presupposes an other question, and the latter distends the particular place of its imaginary resurrection. Like Heidegger, Blanchot is interested in temporalizing the historicity of the modern idea of irreversible, lin ear time based on something other than linear time and its traditional analytical-philosophical paradoxes. Furthermore, he is not interested in mastering the aporia of how one can know 'his time' if it is a part in the whole (relative time) or whether the part is nothing but the whole (eternity). Insofar as he converts time into the question itself, namely the question of 'our time,' time as question questions itself; and this time-"movement of time" and "historical epoch"-is a particular time even though the nature of its particularity is neither the part in the whole or the part as the whole. In a series of inescap able circles, "time as a question, as that which through time, and a certain moment in time," the non-infinite regress of questions re garding the question of 'our time,' "brings forth the questions as the whole and history as the whole of these questions" (B, 12). It seems for Blanchot that if one wishes to consider the histo ricity of any relation between being and time without presupposing a universal, ahistorical dimension to the relation, then time must be converted into a self-generating question. In its particularity, the ques tion governs its own horizontal regress (question of the question of the question, etc.) while dissolving its infinity into a different 'whole'. The event of the question is other than the part/whole distinction. The other whole is the singularized whole called 'history'. To historicize 'our time', which includes the modern concept of history and its linear, irreversible time, one must transform the event of historicization into the question itself; but in the conversion, we must not halt the internal-movement that makes possible the infinite tur ing back of the question on itself based on its non-transitive particularity. It is as if the temporal horizon of the event of the ques tion of time recognizes the question of the event's impalpable historicity; it recognizes the particularity of the event of the question on the whole without subsuming the particularity back into the whole,</page><page sequence="12">72 RAJ SAMPATH which is questioned. It leaves the event hanging, so to speak, in its own hyper-historical moment. The suspension "brings forth" the "whole of questions" and 'history' as the whole even though the singularity of this bringing forth does not admit itself whollyor other wise. The event of the question of time in which time itselfdissolves into/as the Question is the "most profound question." In the bewildering activity of its own contorted phenomeno logical dialectic, the "question of our time" as time itself becomes its inverse; the time of our question as the question itself. The Time of our "question of our time" is the historicity of time-any type of time in history, namely linear, circular, instantaneous, reversible, ir reversible, etc. Blanchot's re-ontologization, however, destroys itself. Rather, it 'hollows itself out,' in so far as his mode of thought, as infinite differentiation of the question of time turned on itself, con ceals itself. Its concealment manifests as the "most profound question." And this question, which does not want to capsize its singularity into an illusory whole or forsake itself in a relativistic obscurity, has a type of movement. But the question resists being temporalized in terms of the time-forms available in the history of time, or history as the whole of questions of 'our times'; thus it drops into a void, a distending interval. It is not simply that Blanchot wants to remind us in the face of our metaphysical tradition (being and becoming in/of time) or religious mystery (time vs. eternity) that time cannot be solved. Rather, by the ruses of historicity, or the imma nence of thinking in time in which the temporalization of immanence remains hidden, the particular event-or the question of our time converts itself; it turns itself into time raising itself as its own question. Simultaneously, though, this event of raising itself to self-conscious ness does not occur as movement of Spirit: it is not a self-annihilating preserving dynamic of increased revelation of consciousness, or Spirit self-conscious of itself as such. Thus it is not an overturning of Hegel but more of an inverting which preserves ironically a similar dilemma: how does one temporalize the whole by way of the particular event of temporalization, and likewise how does the whole event of par ticularization temporalize itself other than the particular event of temporalization, which is also never a whole? If this remains un solved in Hegel, despite the structure of all interpretations, it is</page><page sequence="13">SUPERSEDING DECONSTRUCTION 73 converted into a completely neutralized mystery in Blanchot. The great enigma in Hegel becomes a banal, unspeakable immanence which exemplifies its own self-conscious will of obscurity and unanswerability-namely the question of our time becoming time itself when time decides to be the only question that can be ques tioned incessantly without resolve, i.e., the "most profound question." This is by no means a surrender on the part of philosophy. In the case of Blanchot, we have a deeper problematic. It concerns the hyper-ontologization of the problem of historicity as immanence in time (void, interval-movement of distention) and the de-ontologizing event of converting the metaphysical question of time into Time it self; all the while, 'time itself' returns as a non-metaphysical question. In trying to push forth with the Heideggerean project of transcend ing historical being or a particular historical-time structure (linear or circular), while maintaining historicity as the ontological nature of being-historical, Blanchot produces two competing wills which seem to refuse reconciliation: thinking about the event of the question of time when time becomes question as void, interval, distending move ment; and withdrawing the temporalization of this event into an inverted yet preserved dialectic. The inversion of the dialectic is no longer the particular movement of thinking within itself and back to itself until it reaches absolute completion of its own self-conception as movement; rather, it is the absolute thinking of a movement in itself and away from itself in its singular non-completion. The non metaphysical thinking of movement is hyper-self-conscious of itself as an inherent, structural yet positive deficit of thinking when freed from the illusion of answering the question of time. Thinking is free in its own inherent limit since time is only question and question able, not the question. But then again, we can raise a question to Blanchot's conversion of the dialectic. One can ask if this attenuated thinking reveals a precarious sign of having deluded itself in the newly found 'time'. For Blanchotian time 'turns' time (into question), en casing itself in the susceptible, shadowy 'eternity' of a poignant freedom; the latter allegedly transcends the enslavement of being in the 'question of time,' or God's creation which is Man. Because when time becomes question, the temporal horizon of this event of con version reproduces new images that resist being temporal ized in the</page><page sequence="14">74 RAJ SAMPATH available forms of metaphysical oppositions: being vs. becoming, being vs. nothingness, time vs. eternity, etc. Voids and distending intervals are the treasured results of historicity re-ontologizing itself precisely when it comes face to face with the unrelenting problem of substance, the dialectic and the event of history's self-conceptual ization. Blanchot returns to the dialectic, which as he stated earlier cannot disappear even though it has been misunderstood. No doubt, Blanchot's moment carries a secret significance. When the historical present negates its own immediacy, and thus negates the derivation of its immediate shape from previous historical shapes (past shapes of historical present), when the historical present converts its own event into 'a time' of the whole's self-transformation while selecting itself as a part in a new movement of the whole, which is neither temporal nor eternal, when the whole's self-transformation returns to its singular self-occurrence and validates the transformation as true ('birth-time'), then the dialectic can be said to have emerged. But since the absolute transformation is the transformation of the time/eternity distinction itself within a movement-which claims neither one as its source of origination or ending for that matter then this 'having emerged'state of the dialectic remains obscure. If it is not an isolated singularity in the metaphysics of time or eternity, then can one ask what horizon governs the possibility of its own mode of self-occurrence? Then again, the event of the dialectic claims for itself the possibility of the supersession and the preservation of the great cosmic distinction in a moment contained within the move ment even though it has yet to reveal itself, i.e., Absolute Knowing. Blanchot intervenes in this alleged moment of the dialectic's self transcendence. He links the problem of historicity not with a dialectical theory of time and history, but with an unconscious dia lectic temporality, for a different, hyper-conscious non-dialectical sense of 'movement'. Blanchot sets up a subtle relationship between Hegel's dialec tic and his "question of our time" as time turned into a question, a question which is somehow temporal and moves. Yet the distending movement is unlike the movement of time in history-ahistorical</page><page sequence="15">SUPERSEDING DECONSTRUCTION 75 history of metaphysical questions of 'our time'; or the movement of history in time-atemporal historicist question of the 'time of his tory.' For Blanchot, when the question of time becomes the event of time as question, then the dialectic is put "into question" (B, 15). But, in fairness to the dialectic, this putting into question of the dia lectic is but a moment of the dialectic itself. The moment is singular since "the most profound question is but a moment in the general question," and "the moment is when the question believes that it is in its nature to elaborate an ultimate, final question-question of God, question of being, question of the difference between being and what is" (B, 15). The 'moment' (particular) is hypostatized as the self-reflective moment when the question has an inner-sense of itself as that which puts forth the final question (on everything). But the moment preserves its ownmost singularity by returning/retracting to its own self-transcendent event in erasing any particular distinction moment vs. duration, part vs. whole, etc. Thus the moment presupposes a type of presupposition-less event. Yet Blanchot raises a paradox when the self-recognition of the event of the question, which carries an inner-belief of itself as that which poses the final question, also recognizes that "for the dialectic there is no last ques tion" (B, 15). This paradoxical event is not an event but a movement, even though it is not an event in/of movement or the movement of/in an event. At this point, Blanchot concedes a "demand for circular ity ... a movement without end and yet always already completed. History is the infinite accomplishment of this movement that is al ways already realized" (B, 15). The problematic at hand is that which Blanchot acknowledges as the "critique" of the dialectic (B, 16). However, Blanchot does not mean here a critique based on a quasi-Kantianism: that is, a critique of the dogmatic version of Hegel's 'three-moment' dialectic conceived as a teleology or an eschatology. In considering the event of the question of the epoch, Blanchot's meditation implies a critique of particular thematic quantities of the historical present, such as thresh old, rupture, or discontinuity. Coupled with an opaque version of circular negativity, the secret problematic within the dialectic (event movement) does not disappear; it transmutes into the paradoxical</page><page sequence="16">76 RAJ SAMPATH possibility of completing the dialectic as an unraveling of its own aporia of incompletion. Aporia is the irresolvable impasse, or im possibility of any complete idea of incompletion or incomplete idea of completion. Absolute knowing transforms itself in eclipsing its own possibility, thus its actualization is also its dismissal. But Blanchot's thought does not admit to an incessant negativity which denies the absolute Concept. Rather, he decides to name the prob lematic relation between "the most profound question" and the event of the dialectic: he calls it "History." For Blanchot, history is re ontologized. But if the re-ontology takes on an aporetic function of the dialectic, where the 'particular' stages the question of the univer sal and fulfills the question by returning, obliterating, and carrying the particular into a Universal yet to be named, then the aporia of history itself is given an antithetical image: it is an always already completed event in a movement without end. As such, this image of history tantalizes the imagination to furnish a representation that can not succeed, whereas before, historicity nullified the transcendental will of the imagination outright, namely the legacy of Heidegger's destruction of metaphysics. In Blanchot's moment, historicity gath ers itself, or immanence-in-time, as the a priori of being-historical (which is neither particular nor universal), and attempts to temporalize itself; the result is a paradoxical conversion of the a priori into the aporia, which is simply named "History."18 Blanchot finally turns to the problem of epoch and his idea of History, or the 'real' paradoxical 'circle' of the dialectic. For Blanchot wants to take seriously the true paradoxical event-movement of the dialectic while re-ontologizing history. However, this re-ontology is not an ontology in so far as historicity brings back the dialectic in service of an aporia concerning History: completion-of-event-of movement-without-end. The result of this turn is a negative thinking of historical time, which Blanchot attempts. In trying to discern the relation between his "most profound question," in which the ques tion of time becomes time as question, and the dialectic and History, he states, "This is why 'the most profound question' is always held back, held in reserve until that turning of time when the epoch falls and discourse is complete" (B, 17).</page><page sequence="17">SUPERSEDING DECONSTRUCTION 77 To recall, "the most profound question" is a double problem. It is the "question of our time" turning back on itself. The event of turning back is an event in which time is turned into the singular question to avoid infinite regress while movement is maintained to avoid eschatological fulfillment, for movement is that which contin ues to conceal or postpone the nature of the "turning back" on itself (of the question of time). Additionally, for Blanchot, history is the aporetic event of the dialectic itself. The aporia concerns a paradox for thought: to think how the general question (of the universal) is staged in a particular moment of its own self-realizing movement is to recognize the structure of the 'moment' as part of a new aporetic temporality-an event-movement which is always complete but can never end. It is neither the whole in the part nor the part in the whole. How does Blanchot connect his "most profound question" and its bizarre constitution with the new relation between the dialectic and its aporia of History? What is the temporal horizon of this relation? In other words, how does the question of time, which turns into time as the question, intertwine itself with the aporia of History? How does the aporia, or impasse, preserve the dialectical structure of movement-general as a moment in its own process of self-revela tion-while destroying its contents in a completed event which can never end as such and such quantity, this or that 'epoch'? What we find is a very precarious, contradictory construction that binds two particular forms together. On the one hand, the "most profound ques tion" by its own instituted necessity cannot reveal itself. But on the other hand, the question qua itself (or question) emerges in the "turn ing of time," or rather historical time, "when an epoch falls and discourse is complete." Hegel's moment returns in mutated form, as now, in Blanchot's final gesture, we find an attempt to consider not time but historical time since it is the problem of 'epochs' and not physical time that is turning. Blanchot's last gesture initiates a certain dilemma. The 'our time' becomes the question that conceptualizes itself as unanswer able. But since the dialectic is also retrieved within a new construction of an event-movement, "the aporia of history," the question of how one knows his time as the moment of the whole's self-realization</page><page sequence="18">78 RAJ SAMPATH becomes its inverse; the retention of the non-conceptual, unanswer able nature of time's question as the question (the most profound question) becomes the hope of the turning of the historicity of Time itself. The historicity of Time (and not historical time) is not the turn of an epoch within an atemporal history (linear, irreversible time) or the turn of history within a trans-universal epoch-the temporal whole of historical worlds, which subsumes all their time-forms, circular, linear eschaton, endless duration. It seems for Blanchot that the "turn ing of time" is not Hegel's problem of Absolute Knowledge. Blanchot prioritizes the reserve of the question, or that which keeps itself from itself. Since the paradoxical possibility of the self-revelation of the reserve as reserve is the non-conceptual nature of the most profound question, then the 'turning' of time can only reveal itself as that which can not be revealed. But what does this event look like? Or is it the 'event of looking' looking back at itself as an event? The dialectic turns on itself and swallows itself whole while offering its disappear ance as the only sign of the singular event of its self-betrayal. Since the question of time 'is' time as the question, and the event of the question takes seriously the dialectic, it makes History the alibi of a type of completed-event/endless-movement. This double-edged idea of movement denies nevertheless the self-revelation of the "most profound question" as Time revealed as such, namely revealed Time as a new kind of visible movement. Caught between a rock and a hard place is the plight of historicity: between the problem of how the question of time (metaphysics) turns time into question (ontol ogy) while regaining the true essence of the dialectic by way of the historical finitude of History's linear time. It is caught in the straight jacket of the aporia of a completed event whose movement cannot end. Polarized in the middle, the concept of historical time quite literally vanishes in a single turn. It must. At most, when "discourse is complete," when "Language," or "'poetry' in the turn of writing," happens, then one can understand the 'turning of time' (B, 23). Blanchot's case sets up a very specific construction of historic ity. It is a movement of thinking which fails to destroy the basic antinomy of time, yet carries the project of thinking 'movement' anew in terms of historicity--that is, in terms of the historical finitude, or immanence-in -time, which does not delude itself in a final question</page><page sequence="19">SUPERSEDING DECONSTRUCTION 79 of transcendence (over time vs. eternity) or accept a relativistic oblivion (in an atemporal particularity of being-in-time). And this movement applies to all distinctions, including synchrony vs. diachrony, system vs. history, nature vs. history, etc. But unlike other zones of indeterminacy, Blanchot's question introduces the problem of the 'interrelation' under a double contradiction. Returning to the mysterious passage introduced in the beginning of our analysis of Blanchot, we can proceed to breakdown the assumptions beneath the "most profound question." If we recall, Blanchot raised the problem of the "interrelation" (B, 74). The interrelation is a complex relation that in fact splits itself into two relations while binding them together. But any relation is a relation of 'infinite distance,' which does not presuppose the pure continuity or negative discontinuity of its terms (B, 6). This applies as well for the interrelation; thus we do not have continuity or discon tinuity between two relations which form a relation, or the inter-relation. Hypothetically, we can say that the interrelation is com posed of two specific relations: the most profound question, which is the relation of the question of time (metaphysics) converting itself into time as question (ontology) and the impossibility of revealing the event of conversion; and the relation between the true essence of the event of the dialectic-the general staging itself in the particu lar moment of the process of its own revelation-and the new aporia of history as the completed event of unrevealed movement without end. But for Blanchot, the most inconceivable interrelation of these two relations can only be thought as a "double contradiction" (B, 74). On the one hand, the interrelation must be conceived as "Other," a continuous relation of rupture, and on the other hand, it is an "infi nite relation without terms and an infinite termination of terms without relation" (B, 74).19 To recall, the interrelation is between the relation (infinite distance) internal to the most profound question and its im possibility of being revealed, and the relation between the true paradox of the dialectic and the aporia of history. Now if we insert the interrelation into the abstract formulae of the double contradic tion, we derive a number of strenuous inconsistencies. These contradictions are indicative of a particular moment of historicity's manifestation in its short history.</page><page sequence="20">80 RAJ SAMPATH If we consider the interrelation as nothing but a continuous relation of rupture between the "most profound question" (time as question which hides itself in order to reveal itself) and the relation between the dialectic and the aporia of History (completed event of movement without end), then historicity itself forks into the static possibility of a double conflation. First is this confusion: converting the question of 'our time' into time as question (without infinite re gress) takes the place of the new aporia of history: infinite accomplishment of a movement which is always, already complete. The second confusion is this: the conversion of the question of 'our time' takes overthe dialectical imperative of the movement of think ing, which starts from the particular's internal belief that it is staging the general question (of everything infinite, God, being, truth) in re turning to itself, destroying itself and suspending its death in a process towards completion. But in taking over the dialectical imperative, the conversion of our time into time as question reverses the prin ciple of dialectical movement: thinking of movement, which cannot be thought as a conceptualizing movement because thinking is al ready complete, while the movement of its completion cannot end as absolute Concept. And the only way one can consider the possi bility of this double conflation is through the infinite relation without terms and infinite termination of terms without relation. In other words, once 'our time' raises its own question precisely by convert ing the metaphysical project of thinking time-our time or universal time or both or beyond-into an unanswerable question, it commits itself to a revitalized dialectic. But in this turn, 'our time' has to con vert the a priori of History-as movement to an end-into the aporia of completed event whose movement cannot end. The aporia is not an endless movement but a double contradiction: the infinite rela tion without terms is where the "most profound question" is no longer separated from the terms of its movement (origin and end) which cannot be conceptualized; and the infinite termination of terms with out relation is where the dialectic comes to defeat itself (its terms-time vs. eternity) incessantly, but it does so without admit ting to the external movement of a higher Time that realizes itself in relation to its own self-destruction. This is why, for Blanchot, the most profound question ('our time') has to hide itself insofar as the</page><page sequence="21">SUPERSEDING DECONSTRUCTION 81 invisible historicity of the modern concept of history (and its linear time) is maintained until the dialectic works itself out based on a new aporia: it is not the movement of events in time towards the End but the completed event (time as question) whose movement can not end, "History." If some thematize history in terms of an End (Christian), if oth ers ponder something beyond the temporal and the supra-temporal (mystic), and still others argue for the 'threshold' as either beginning or end (deconstruction), Blanchot introduces another dimension. He is concerned with time as question. However, his anguish does not stem from the 'our time' as the end, continuation, or transcendence of a movement (linear or circular). Rather, it is precisely when histo ricity tries to temporalize itself on the basis of a new commitment to the dialectic without its metaphysical armature (time, movement, being, becoming, origin, end, occurrence, eternity) that it links itself to an unrealizable idea of historical time-the discursive 'turning' of epochs. Unfortunately, it cannot recognize this impalpable idea un less it negates time as question-the most profound question-and offers the negation as an answer to 'our time.' Thus for Blanchot, the enslavement to an indefatigable 'Other' passes itself off as a natural form of immanent transcendence; the latter concerns the uncanny problem of the historicity of the modern concept of history and its linear time. All the while, this conundrum must refuse the offer of another concept of historical time. The 'our time' is by no means an end even though it tries to end the hope for an End by concocting another hope: the possibility of revealing an epochal turn not in time, history, eternity, the self, or anything else, but by way of the non revelation of the "most profound question" within the "poetic turns" of Language.20 The non-revelation confuses the historicity of the modern concept of history's linear, irreversible time with what it as sumes to be a genuine response to the dialectic; atemporality is mistaken for the most authentic temporalization insofar as a true concept of historical time is proffered but denied. Any 'new' con cept has to be rejected given the instantiation of a new aporia of History, which by nature cannot be solved; and this is not a move ment which presupposes completion based on an originary event,</page><page sequence="22">82 RAJ SAMPATH but the completion of an event whose movement cannot end be cause movement is no longer tied to time: our time, the time of the whole, the time of their union, the time of their reciprocal annihila tion become obsolete. Historicity disappears into a non-conceptual void. In the abyss, it imagines a false freedom against the law of the time/eternity distinction while affirming the law of an even more dubious freedom: freedom against the dialectical movement of the intransigent distinction of time/eternity towards its annihilation completion. Paradoxically, it is precisely because the 'our time' has reversed its own question back on itself that a non-reflective, eternal yet non-metaphysical, linguistic, counter-eschatological sense of his tory is born: endless movement (not in and of time) as a completed event, which cannot be revealed, only the non-revelatory 'turning of times,' which is the poetic spin of Language. Yet another manifesta tion of Nietzsche's great dilemma of a transvaluative 'overcoming,' the 'our time' prides itself on its newly constituted singularity. Para doxically, its position is its illusory non-locality in time, history, eternity, or beyond; an eminently secular unhappy consciousness, it shelters itself in the hollowed-out forest of divine Language, i.e., the poetic. Metaphysical eternity absorbs itself in the eternal singularity called the figural opening of language; historicity marks this unnamable absorption within the unanswerable persistence of 'our time.' In trying to temporalize an authentic relation with the dialec tic by way of a non-dialectical movement, in resisting the temptation to posit negation-as in negating the impossibility of answering the question of Time-in, therefore, thwarting the commencement of movement towards the Solution of the greatest metaphysical ques tion, the 'most profound question' turns on itself. 1 Michel Foucault, Madness and Civilization, trans.

Suffice it to say, a few standard works can be consulted: Quentin Skinner, ed., The Return of the Grand Theory in the Human Sciences (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1985); Mark Poster, Critical Theory and Poststructural ism (Ithaca: Cornell University Press, 1989); Frederic Jameson, Postmodernism or, The Cultural Logic of Late Capitalism (Durham: Duke Univer sity Press, 1991 ); Poststructuralism and the Question of History eds. G. Bennington, D. Attridge (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1987). 3 There are a number of works that illuminate the Hegelian roots of twentieth-cen tury French thought and poststructuralism in particular; these works vary from standard intellectual-histories to different forms of criticism, which expose the interplay between Hegelian ism and the critique of Hegel in this century. See Mark Poster, Existential Marxism in Postwar France (Princeton: Princeton University Press, 1975); Vincent Descombes, Modern French Philosophy, trans. L-Scott Fox and J.M. Harding (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1980); Michael Kelly, Modern French Marxism (Baltimore: Johns Hopkins University Press, 1984); Barry Cooper, The End of History (Toronto: University of Toronto Press, 1984); Michael Roth, Knowing and History (Ithaca: Cornell University Press, 1988); Judith Butler, Subjects of Desire (New York: Columbia University Press, 1987). 4 It is best to draw from the testimony of these thinkers. In a number of interviews and collected essays, they express quite candidly the impact of the war on their educational development. See Michel Foucault: Politics, Philosophy, Culture and Other Interviews 1977-1984, ed. Lawerence Kritzman (New York: Routledge, 1988); Michel Serres, Conversations on Science, Culture, and Time, trans. Roxanne Lapidus (Ann Arbor: The University of Michigan Press, 1995); Jacques Derrida, Points : Interviews 1974-1994, trans. Peggy Kamuf (Stanford: Stanford University Press, 1995). For a comprehensive look at the history of this generation within a broad contextual framework, see Francois Dosse's mammoth two-volume, The History of Structuralism (Minneapolis: University of Minnesota Press, 1997). 5 A few examples will suffice to glimpse the complexity of French intellectual his tory from the 40s to the 50s, certain examples of which carried over into the early 60s and beyond. Jean-Paul Sartre's early phenomenological existentialism led to an eventual fusion of existentialism with Marxism. In the case of Sartre, France saw the ascendance of probably its most dominant intellectual figure in modern times. Drawing from a dense anthropological tradition that dates back to Durkheim and extends to George Dum?zil's comparative methodology, Claude L?vi-Strauss launched his 'structuralist' enterprise. In incorporating the ideas of the Russian formalists (Propp and Jacobsen), structuralism was yet another major effect of the linguistic turn in the twentieth-century. Moreover, L?vi-Strauss ventured a radical critique of the ethnocentrism and general anthropomorphism of the human sci ences. Through his critical techniques of analysis, he revealed a miraculous universe</page><page sequence="24">84 RAJ SAMPATH of relational forms. In myriad ways, these deep relations conditioned over-arching dichotomies, such as the 'primitive' vs. the 'civilized,' 'magic' vs. 'religion,' and ultimately, 'reason' vs. 'myth'. In responding to the existential humanism of Alexandre Koj?ve's reading of Hegel and theories of economy from Marx to We ber, Georges Bataille presents another interesting example of mid-twentieth-century French thought. This heteroclyte archivist undertook what he called a 'Coperni can're-evaluation of the functional nature of economy, utility, and human exchange. By way of a certain Nietzscheanism, and some of its 'irrationalist' predecessors, like the de Sade, Bataille tried to overcome the metaphysical residues of Surrealist forms of aesthetic subjectivity; he questioned their quasi-psychoanalytic orienta tion to 'experience' and the 'unconscious.' Emmanuel L?vinas launched his philosophical career with an innovative reading of Husserl on the problem of subjectivity and intuition. His early work tried to assess the general viability of Husserl's transcendental phenomenological enterprise. Levinas's early phenom enological period was followed by a series of critical evaluations of the limits of Heidegger's ontology of Being. L?vinas questioned the ability of Heidegger's phi losophy to treat ethics, time, the death of others, Being, and the possibility of a post-humanistic/post-ontological orientation towards history. Maurice Merleau Ponty, also influenced by Husserl and Heidegger, reflected on everything from the nature of mid-twentieth physics and psychology to theories of language, percep tion, and aesthetics. He even offered a startlingly original investigation on the phenomenological forms of the Body. Fusing Husserl ian phenomenology with the existentialist philosophies of Karl Jaspers and Gabriel Marcel, the early work of Paul Ricoeur represents a unique analytical sensibility. No doubt, his matured quasi-formal ist orientation to problems in hermeneutics has been highly influen tial. Drawing from Bachelard's theme of the 'epistemologica! break,' Georges Canguilhem's genealogical investigations in the history of science (particularly medicine and the life sciences) were innovative in their own right: they shattered a number of common assumptions concerning the evolutionary perfection of sci ence and historical knowledge. Canguilhem's studies exposed unfounded a priori constructions of the 'normal/pathological'distinction; in turn, he argued how these distinctions concealed the arbitrary constitution of historical truths on human sub jectivity and the sciences of 'life' in general. Louis Althusser's sfri/cfura//sf-Marxism garnered a wide-spread international reputation for destroying a number of as sumptions on nineteenth- and twentieth-century philosophies of history; his decisive critiques of phenomenology, existentialism, the humanism of Hegel and orthodox Marxism, and his celebrated 'epistemologica! break' between Hegel's dialectic and Marx's theoretical materialism stir controversy to this day. Another prominent thinker, Lucien Goldmann, offered a unique Marxist reconstruction of the human sciences. In particular, he tried to articulate a method for reading literary and philosophical works back to their material contexts without presupposing a banal form of causality, i.e. the traditional dichotomy of 'base vs. superstructure.' His studies were important for subsequent intellectual developments in France and abroad. Although Henri Lefebvre began his work in the 20s while briefly engaging Surrealism, he ultimately developed a unique cultural-theoretical criticism with its own eccentric vocabulary. In the philosophical personality of Lefebvre, we have yet another iconoclastic example of twentieth-century French intellectual</page><page sequence="25">SUPERSEDING DECONSTRUCTION 85 life. Lefebvre's thought is characterized by several key patterns: the erosion of the Hegelian metaphysical underpinnings of Marx's developmental idea of history, a Nietzschean will to transvaluate and overturn common assumptions in philoso phy, sociology, anthropology, and history, and a complex critique of previous strategies to think the fundamental distinction between "synchrony and diachrony." If time permitted, we could provide other examples of intellectual produc tion in the 40s and 50s, such as the phenomenological poetics of Gaston Bachelard, the pioneering theories of literary form by Georges Poulet, the quasi-Christian existentialism of Gabriel Marcel, the bio-metaphysical scientism of Teilhard de Chardin, the Catholic humanism of Jacques Maritain, the ambiguous phenom enological dialectics of Raymond Aron and Georges Gurvitch, subsequent research by members of the Bataille's then defunct Coll?ge de Sociologie (Roger Ca?llois, Michel Leiris, Pierre Klossowski), the communist philosophy of Roger Garaudy, the non-Soviet existential Marxism of Socialisme ou Barbarie (Castoriadis, Lefort) and the Arguments group (E. Morin, P. Fougeyrollas), the literature of Camus, and the criticism of Roland Barthes. 6 Works such as J.G. Merquoir's From Prague to Paris (London: Verso, 1986) show the difficulty of attempting an intellectual history of poststructuralism that also aims to challenge some of its fundamental presuppositions. Critical work such as that of Merquoir's and B. Palmer's indicates to us that there are still major gaps in our understanding of the basic traditions from which poststructural ism drew. Para doxically, poststructuralism perpetrated its radical novelty or break from past intellectual formations precisely by drawing from their marginal edges and least detected impulses. 7 The transition to poststructuralism does not mean that the past (Hegel) as well as the aforementioned twentieth-intellectual movements are divorced from the present, or annulled by a discontinuity that poststructuralism may or may not proclaim. Conversely, we are not restating the obvious?that poststructuralism still presup poses many of the assumptions of previous intellectual traditions. Thus temporalizing the question of transition or transformation resurrects the ontologi ca! question of passage in general; it raises the problem of the temporalization of that being which raises the possibility of temporalizing the question of passage. 8 Having been influenced by the likes of Foucault, Ricoeur, Derrida, Walter Ben jamin and Hannah Arendt, people like Jean-Luc Nancy have undertaken the task of articulating the conditions for thinking the philosophy of history in the wake of poststructuralism. See his "Finite History," in Birth to Presence, trans. Brian Holmes (Stanford: Stanford University Press, 1993); and more recently, 'The Surprise of the Event," in Hegel After Derrida, ed. Stuart Barnett (London: Routledge, 1998). Work such as Nancy's presupposes, among other things, the hidden intellectual historical relations which determine the origins of poststructuralism and deconstruction. But above and beyond these silent determinations is the com pletely unrecognized problem of temporalizing the relation, the passage, the transition, the movement, the unknown quantity?or what I call the inheritance of the bifurcated problem of Hegelian eschatology and its inscription or mark in the 'birth' of poststructuralism. 9 Our attempt at the theory of relation is by no means oblivious to the achievements of modern analytical philosophy. Bertrand Russell's logical atomism for instance</page><page sequence="26">86 RAJ SAMPATH challenged at once traditional logic based on two-term subject/predicate rela tions, metaphysical logic grounded in universal aprioris, and speculative idealist logic which tried to surmount oppositional terms by the movement of the dialec tic towards an incomplete third term. For Russell, relations can have more than two terms, including three, four, five on up. Moreover, there are different kinds of relations, each with different sets of forms (symmetrical, asymmetrical, non-sym metrical and transitive, intransitive, and non-transitive for instance). However, Russell's 'Logical Atomism' is a non-apriori method of philosophy: it involves the continuous discovery of different atomic forms of propositions; but the process of discovery is delimited strictly by the capacity to verify empirically statements based on the ordinary, everyday usage of language. One can construct hypotheses from infinite possibilities, which can be applied to analyze increasingly complex struc tures of "facts." Russell's method is close to the inductive methods of modern science. In spite of the great strides that analytical philosophy has made in its triple critique of traditional or classical logic, the history of metaphysics, transcen dental philosophy and speculative idealism, the logical analysis of the structure of relations based on the study of propositions differs from our project. We are link ing the theory of the relation with the ontological problem of time, movement, and the question of the historicity of history. Therefore, we do not intend to con trovert analytical philosophy; if anything, Russell's theory of relations is quite useful. Rather, we are staking out a different terrain based on an entirely different ques tion. Our projects are incommensurable. 10 No doubt, we will not read from the section on 'absolute knowing' in the Phe nomenology; this would require quite literally an eternity of time. Rather, we will focus strictly on Blanchot's comments. Furthermore, we are not presupposing what 'closure' means or how it functions for poststructural ism. Thus we are not simply accusing poststructuralism for ascribing a determinate quantity to 'closure', such as the 'end of metaphysics' or the 'end of history.' We acknowledge the great ambiguity that surrounds this question and thus, for some, is the Question of our 'historical present.' 11 In an intense encounter with the possibility of overcoming the three-moment scheme of the dialectic and the back and forth movement of Socratic logic in general, Derrida considers a 'fourth-side' in his work of 1969, Dissemination, trans. Barbara Johnson (Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 1982). Alan Megill gives us an illuminating discussion of Derrida's obsession with four and fourness in The Prophets of Extremity(Berkeley: University of California Press, 1985), 272 75. 12 Again, our speculative treatment of the problem of movement is by no means oblivious to the great contributions made by the metaphysical tradition beginning with Aristotle's treatises, The Physics, The Metaphysics, and De C?elo (On the Heavens). If anything, we draw inspiration from his power to make wondrous distinctions (between movement, motion, being-in-motion, the thing in motion, the sphere of motion, the mover, the moved, the unmoved mover, succession, change, continuity, becoming, rest, etc.). But admittedly, we are not concerned with a philosophy of movement; the nature of, the essence of, the truth of. Rather, we are responding to the legacy of the transcendental break (Kant) from the his tory of metaphysics, while trying to tailor a specific question (epochal</page><page sequence="27">SUPERSEDING DECONSTRUCTION 87 transformation) in accordance with a set of conditions to, understand the enigma of the historicity of History. If anything, our task is to understand the relation be tween the problem of movement (given the history of its conceptions in the metaphysical and scientific traditions of the West) and the ontological question of the historicity of History. Moreover, our task is to temporalize this relation based on the conditions of a different logic. 13 For a general introduction to Blanchot's life and thought, see in particular Jeffrey Mehl man, "Blanchot at Combat: Of Literature and Terror," Modern Language Notes, French Issue 95 (1980), 808-829.

But the full speculative-philosophical en counter with Heg?l, time, and history is offered in the later essays published in The Infinite Conversation. We will focus on the later writings, because there we can witness a powerful relationship between historicity and the problem of his torical time. If anything, the earlier essay is a germinal statement on what would come to fruition in the late 60s and beyond. 16 There are a number of interpretative essays which tie Blanchot's thoughts on time to the problematic of writing. Indeed Laporte's work is very suggestive in this direction. However, a full philosophical exploration of historical time is what we are after. For Blanchofs ideas on time, see in particular, John D.
