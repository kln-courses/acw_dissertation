In a pointed form he gives expression to a problem that had been felt for a long time, the paradox of Homeric anthropomorphism: the gods of Homer in their unforgettable individuality who had become so important for the whole of the Greek world view were found to be too human or even below human standards.1 We all know the much older and more radical in- vective of Xenophanes against Homer and Hesiod who "put upon the gods everything that is shame and reproach among men, steal- ing and committing adultery and deceiving each other" (Frag. B 11). With Xenophanes there was already developing a system of pos- tulates of what a god should be like: without needs, not only immortal but ungenerated, all-knowing, omnipotent, and hence exempt from any sexual, thievish, or cunning activi- ties.2 In more modern times we have wit- nessed the breakdown of idealistic con- structs, and as in our world of chance and ne- cessity there is hardly a place left for a being that "knows everything and controls every- thing," we may more easily sympathize with the restricted yet lively and realistic aspects of Homeric gods. Nevertheless the problem remains of how, at the crossroads of religion and poetry, this special picture of divine beings came to be drawn that was to form both a model and a contrast for developing human consciousness. Why are the gods of Homer so human, and why are the Greeks from an early date both so impressed by and so critical of them? In the following reflections I shall avoid delving into the problems of Hesiod, whether succession myth, Prometheus myth, or the personifications of abstract entities such as Dike; instead, I shall concentrate on the epic texts that were to become familiar to every educated person in the Greek world, from el- ementary school to advanced studies - that is, on the Iliad and Odyssey. I freely use the name of Homer with reference to both, al- though I think they are the works of two dif- ferent composers elaborating on the achieve- ments of a long oral tradition. I will present three theses: 1. To present gods in an unheroic, all-too- human vein is a traditional form of narrative, to be understood from its function within he- roic tale, developed in Greece under the in- fluence of oriental models. 2. Even in Homer the unquestionable seri- ousness of religion is not based on such tales, but on traditional ritual, which is essentially nonanthropomorphic; it nevertheless enters narrative as an effective element of epic style. 81</page><page sequence="3">3. Homeric anthropomorphism is just slightly connected with the spreading use of anthropomorphic images in cult, especially in temples, which we know took place in the eighth century b.c. "Human" Gods in Traditional Narrative Credit is due to Walter F. Otto and his book The Homeric Gods3 for showing how a truly religious approach to Homer's gods is still possible. Yet rereading Homer after reading Otto's work, one will still be struck by the amount and degree of those all-too-human elements in the encounters of the gods with one another. The gods are free of heroic con- straint, and it is a relief for poet and audience to get off the battlefield now and then; and whatever the postulates of theology, it is right that Zeus should feel violent compassion for Hector, and even have tears for Sarpedon. Yet family affairs in the house of the gods are not only nonheroic and human, they are not sel- dom beneath the level of civilized conduct. There is in particular a kind of children's per- spective that is developed with gusto. Take a scene in the fifteenth book of the Iliad.4 Hera, after violent scoldings and threats by her de- ceived husband, returns to Olympus. She is greeted by all the other gods with deference; her lips smile, but her eyebrows remain tense and angry, and - handing on anger, as it were - she tells Ares that a son of his has just been slain in battle. Ares starts with a howl to throw himself into battle, although father Zeus has strictly forbidden any intervention of this kind. Athena therefore jumps up in alarm to hold back her brother; she takes off his armor and addresses him as a crazy fellow who has no ears: if he disobeys Zeus, she tells him, father "will come to us in Olympus to wreak havoc, he will catch hold of one after the other, guilty or not" (15,136-137). This is catastrophe in a children's world, as Hypnos (Sleep) has depicted it before: on an earlier occasion Zeus, deceived by Sleep, had in- dulged his anger at Olympus, "hurling around the gods in his house, and it was I whom he was seeking foremost of all; ... I ran away and reached Night; so he finally stopped, though he was quite angry" (14, 256-260). It is here especially that we find the children's perspective of the family tyrant cuffing his children while searching for the real culprit. This scene is experienced with shivers and yet a bit of triumph: "so he finally stopped." Less fortunate is Artemis in the Battle of the Gods when she dares to oppose Hera: "And she - Hera - seized both her hands at the wrist with her left hand, but with her right hand she took the bow from her shoulders, and right with this she thrashed her by the ears, smiling, while Artemis was writhing here and there, and the swift arrows fell from the quiver,- with tears in her eyes the goddess ran away" (21, 489-496). This is how way- ward children are disciplined by a step- mother; it is left for mother Leto to collect the arrows strewn around.5 It is clear, I think, that a scene like this is not meant to be sub- lime but just funny; Hera's smiling is a hint on how the audience should react. One may be tempted to say that gods are masks of an oppressive superego, as religion is bound up with awe in most civilizations; it seems natural that people should now and then take their revenge by putting to ridicule those superior powers. This is not serious re- volt but a form of relief that serves in fact to strengthen the system. It is probably more to the point, however, to note the narrative function of divine burlesque. In a situation of oral storytelling everything depends upon catching and holding the attention of the au- dience. It is difficult to do so by describing common life,- whatever is uncommon, amaz- ing, or thrilling will be more effective. One option is what we call the heroic - tales about men above the normal level, which are apt to raise admiration with imaginative identifi- cation. The situation is different with gods: for gods, praise and wonder are just normal, routinely developed in hymns that tend to be- come tedious and dull. What a chance to catch attention by the inverse, portraying glo- rious gods in banal family situations or even in a childlike position. The remark of Pseudo- Longinus about the inverted roles of men and gods in Homer thus is seen to reflect a basic narrative strategy. The horrible and barbarous punishment of Hera mentioned by Zeus6 may be seen as an inversion of the second degree, inhumane behavior in the humane sphere, the abnormal versus the mock normality of the divine household, in order to retain the stunning grandeur of the ruling god. It is remarkable that this kind of narrative is not restricted to Homer's Iliad, but has an- 82 BURKERT</page><page sequence="4">alogies in oriental epic. The most solemn of these texts, the Babylonian New Year's epic Enuma Elish, relates the victory of Marduk against Tiamat the Monster of the Sea. It de- velops all kinds of high style to praise the gods, but amidst the horrible stories of fights for succession we do find those traits from the children's world. When from Apsu and Tia- mat several generations of gods have come into being, "they banded together, the broth- ers, the gods . . . with joyful play in the abode of heaven. Apsu did not control their noise" (1 2i, 24-25), so he angrily decides, "Their be- havior has become grievous unto me" (I 37), and sets out to kill them all. "Tranquillity shall be restored: well, let us get sleep our- selves!" (I 40). 7 His plans backfire, however, and it is Apsu who is laid to rest in conse- quence. How this could have been told in an- other mood is seen in the Hesiodic parallel: Uranos does not allow his children to come to light, so Gaia summons them to rebel, with Kronos taking the lead: "for he - Uranos - was first to plan unseemly deeds" ( Theogony 172). Here we have an argument about guilt that justifies revenge, while the Babylonian poet chose to introduce the picture of a noisy gang of youngsters driving to despair an old and sullen grandfather. He even repeats the motif in the next generation: when Marduk is bom, most wonderful of divine children, his grandfather Anu (Heaven) creates the "Four Winds," a kind of ball, and says, "My son shall play with it" (I 106). 8 The boy of course does this, and he does it so effectively that Tiamat, the Sea, is profoundly disturbed and becomes so angry that she prepares the fearful battle, which is finally to install the kingship of Marduk. Thus we find the tradi- tional concept of the "storm god" artfully transposed into the children's world, in strange but meditated contrast to the huge cosmic struggle that is to ensue. Another example comes from a well- known scene of Gilgamesh :9 when Gilga- mesh has slain Humbaba, and has washed his hair and polished his weapons, "great Ishtar lifted her eyes to the beauty of Gilgamesh: . . . 'grant me your fruit as a gift'," she says (VI 6.8). But Gilgamesh brutally refuses her proposal, giving the catalogue of her lovers all of whom she has loved and destroyed after- wards. "When Ishtar heard this, Ishtar burst into a rage and ascended to heaven. Ishtar went and wept before Anu, her father, before Antu, her mother, her tears were flowing: 'My father, Gilgamesh has grievously in- sulted me! He has enumerated my insults, my insults and curses!' Anu opened his mouth and said, to great Ishtar he spoke: 'You your- self did incite the king of Uruk, therefore Gil- gamesh enumerated your insults, your in- sults and curses' " (VI 80-91). Compare a scene from the Iliad : Aphrodite has been wounded by the spear of Diomedes, her blood is flowing. "Beside herself she went off, she felt terrible pain" (5, 352); Iris and Ares help her to reach Olympus, "and illustrious Aphrodite fell into the lap of Dione, her mother, she took her daughter into her arms and patted her with her hand" (5, 370-372,). She asks, "Who has done such things to you, dear child?" (373); Artemis answers that it was Diomedes. Mother begins to console with mythical examples, wiping off the blood, and the pain is fading. Athena and Hera, who are on the other side in battle, begin to make sarcastic remarks. But Zeus smiles, calls Aphrodite to him, and advises her to keep out of battle and rather to pursue the desirable works of marriage. The smile of Zeus is mediating between touching com- passion and scornful jokes,- it is once more a hint for the audience on how to react. It is clear, I think, that this scene, so very "Ho- meric" in style, is basically identical with the scene from Gilgamesh. In both, there is the same situation and the same mood of the fam- ily scene with the crying child, the consoling mother, and the wise and somewhat dis- tanced father. And there are exactly the same characters: the sky god Zeus alias Anu, his wife Dione alias Antu, and their common daughter the goddess of love, Aphrodite alias Ishtar. The most curious fact is that here, and only here, in Greek literature Zeus has a wife at Olympus whose name is just a variant of his own, Dione, just as Antu is the feminine form of Anu. This mother of Aphrodite has brought well-known complications into Greek mythology. I think this is a case of lit- erary borrowing, even if we cannot identify the intermediate texts that must have ex- isted; there were enough places for contacts from Al Mina through Tarsos or Cyprus to Euboea and Ischia in the eighth century. It should be added that the very idea of an as- sembly of the gods as well as the divine mountain in the north is well established in Hittite and Ugaritic epic, too. This is not the BURKERT 83</page><page sequence="5">place, however, to give more details.10 The logical conclusion seems to be that the narratives about gods in Homer, including their human or all-too-human characteris- tics, use traditional strategies of oral tales, while taking certain traits - especially what I have called the children's perspective - from literary models. The models are those of the superior civilizations from which the system of writing, and thus the chance to pro- duce literature in the full sense, was adopted just then. The lack of seriousness of the genre thus was reinforced by its foreign proveni- ence, which meant distance from the closed sphere of domestic religion with its attendant obligations and beliefs. This is not to deny, but rather to throw into relief, the fact that the composer of the Iliad has used this tradition to create a new and highly original structure for his monumental poem. How skillfully the main scenes on Olympus are placed in his composition, how delicately the ease of the gods' life counter- balances the unmitigated cruelty of heroic ex- istence (an ironic mirror, so to speak), and how the intersection of these two planes makes up the totality of the Iliadic world: all of these have been noticed by many inter- preters and cannot be pursued here in detail. We are left with a miracle of crystallization out of various traditional elements. The structure of the Odyssey is different; this is one of the important arguments for assuming that it had a different composer.11 The Autonomy of Ritual If tales about gods in Homer are meant to pro- voke smiles rather than to edify, it does not follow that religion is not a serious affair in the world of the epic. The fear of gods is pres- ent, as is also seen in the old word Geouôqç, 'god-fearing/ which becomes anti- quated after Homer. Yet the seriousness, the gravity and solemnity, of religion is bound not to the tales about gods but to the insti- tutions of ritual, which are mainly sacrifice, libation, and prayer. These are well known to the singers and their audience, they appear in typical scenes, and they make effective mo- tifs at important turns of the narrative. But they are not dependent upon the anthropo- morphic picture of the gods as drawn in the Olympic family scenes; they would indeed be reduced to the absurd by any consistent ap- plication of anthropomorphic ideas. It is only by not pursuing these lines or asking perti- nent, or rather impertinent, questions about the gods' relation to ritual that Homer can give a picture of serious cult and piety. Take a scene in the hut of Eumaeus: the swineherd is honoring his guest, Odysseus (incognito), with the kind of feast he can offer, slaughtering a piglet ( Odyssey , 14, 420-453). "And he did not forget the immortal gods, be- cause he had a good mind," he knew what to do. So he first throws hair from the animal's head into the fire, praying to "all the gods"; when the animal has been butchered, he "places on thick fat raw pieces, taking the be- ginning from all limbs, and throws them into the fire, sprinkling them with barley" (427- 429); when the meat is divided for those pres- ent, he puts aside one portion "for the nymphs and Hermes," praying once more; then, before starting to eat, he burns "first offerings for the immortal gods" (446) and pours out a libation of wine; and so they start to eat. This description presents several prob- lems to historians of religion: which divini- ties are concerned with each act, and why and how?12 In fact the poet does not tell us what those "raw pieces" are for, or how the nymphs and Hermes are to get their "por- tion," or why they have to share just one. It is the ritual action per se that in a demon- strative way interrupts the practical proceed- ings again and again to show that Eumaeus is indeed a very pious man who "does not forget the immortal gods." Much more grandiose, at the beginning of the Iliad, is the image of Apollo approaching with his bow and tingling arrows, moving like night, a god terrible and pitiless. This de- scription is a piece of literature,- it may even have an oriental background, as the arrows of pestilence appear in Hittite as well as in He- brew tradition.13 Seen from the perspective of real life there would be, first of all, the plague, the burning pyres, and a seer who says that this has been caused by the mistreatment of a priest. One should not be rash about sanc- tuaries and priests; this is a rule of "caution" (euAaßeia), which is so characteristic of Greek religion. The remedy is to comply with the demand of the priest and to give back Chry- seis, and the rest is ritual: purification of the army and sacrifice to Apollo right at Troy 84 BURKERT</page><page sequence="6">(i, 313-317), sacrifice and daylong dancing with singing of paian at Chryse (1, 430-487). "And the god rejoiced in his heart, hearing it ," "and far-shooting Apollo sent them a pros- perous wind" to return from Chryse to Troy (1, 474, 479). 14 That a god should enjoy music is an idea in accordance with the most sub- lime Christian speculations; but from where exactly is Apollo to hear the song and to re- lease the wind? He should be at the fringe of the earth with the Ethiopians, if we believe the account of Thetis that comes in between the two sacrificial scenes (1, 423-425). So what is he doing with the hecatombs pre- sented "to him" both at Troy and at Chryse? These are exactly the questions that are not to be asked. "The smell of burnt sacrifice [Kvioq] reached heaven, whirling around the smoke": this is the end of the first description of sacrifice (i, 317), an image that is as im- pressive as it is realistic; but what a host of problems it presents for speculative imagi- nation, and what opportunities for a satirist such as Luciani Three conflicting localities for the gods - the sky, Mount Olympus, and the abode of the Ethiopians by the Okeanos - and what is Apollo to do with smell and smoke at Troy or Chryse while he has dinner in the other place? It is the tactful art of the epic singer that glosses over these problems. The experience of the rising smell and smoke concludes the ceremony of sacrifice: this is an experience familiar to singers and audi- ence, turned into a symbol by poetry, a sym- bol of connection restored between 'below7 and 'above'. At Chryse it is the effect that is felt, as the prosperous event, the smooth re- turn, is interpreted as having been caused by the god. This is enough in a practical world, and it will be close to the real attitude and practice of Greeks at that time. That some people asked questions about the share of the gods in sacrifice, or rather about the fact that only bones were burnt on the altars while nearly all the meat was con- sumed by men, is seen in Hesiod's Prome- theus story.15 Homer is skillfully vague about these matters. In the Odyssey Poseidon seems to be a full member of the feasting community in Ethiopia (1, 25-26); the Iliad is less explicit as to this marginal people (1, 423). Athena alias Mentor arrives at Pylos and evidently gets her share in the meal "of Poseidon" (3, 32-66) - who, incidentally, should still be dining with the Ethiopians right then - when the big sacrifice for her is prepared by Nestor (3, 418-472), she has left Pylos again. Yet here, for once, it is expressly said that "Athena came to meet the sacred ceremony" (ipwv ávxiócooa, 435-436); one might even translate this, "to take her share."16 Gods may be thought to be present at sacrifice - but the audience should not think too much about it.17 The paradox of ritual, if it is seen in an- thropomorphic terms, is even more apparent in the two oath sacrifices described in the Iliad.18 In the third book the duel of Menelaos and Paris is prepared by solemn oaths. The Trojans are to present two sheep, one white, one black, "for Earth and Sun," the Greeks one "for Zeus" (3, 103-106). For the cere- mony wine is distributed; Agamemnon takes the lead, cuts hair from the victims' heads, speaks the solemn oath in the form of a prayer to Zeus, and slices the throats of all the sheep, while the others pour wine from their goblets and join in prayer. Then Priam, who has been present too, withdraws, not forgetting to take the sheep - the two of his, probably - with himself to Troy, evidently to be used in the kitchen (3, 268-312). So what is their relation to "Earth and Sun" for whom they were to be offered? One might say that Earth has re- ceived the blood, but Helios? Again, these are questions that should not be asked. Cere- mony is ceremony, and things are just done this way - at least in the plain of Troy. In the nineteenth book Agamemnon takes an oath not to have touched Briseis. The her- ald brings a boar, Agamemnon cuts hair from the victim's head, speaks his oath to Zeus while turning his eyes to the sky, and cuts the throat of the victim, which is hurled into the sea by the herald (19, 250-268). There is no mention of any deity here "for whom" the animal is slaughtered. It is just the irrevers- ible act of killing that marks the new begin- ning. The poet is able to turn realistic imagery into symbol even here: the corpse is hurled "into the big gulf of the grey sea, whirling around, a prey for fish" (267-268); as it dis- appears, the menis should be buried likewise in the depths of the sea. The ritual that is least explicable in an- thropomorphic terms is libation.19 Liquids, and especially wine, are poured right on the ground, "for the gods": cui bono ? Nonethe- less it is one of the most common and wide- spread rituals in the Near East and in Greece, BURKERT 85</page><page sequence="7">and it especially accompanies prayer, as in the first oath ceremony just mentioned. The most memorable use of this ritual is made by the poet of the Iliad when Achilles is about to send Patroclus to battle (i6, 220-253): Achilles takes a special goblet from a coffer in his tent, cleans it, washes his hands, and draws wine into the goblet. Then he takes his stand in the midst of his court and pours out the wine while looking up to the sky - and Zeus takes notice of him. It is a great prayer to Pelasgian Zeus of Dodona that Achilles speaks, asking for victory and the safe return of Patroclus. Only the first part, however, is granted by Zeus. The poet does not forget to tell us that the goblet is carefully put back into its coffer. The contact evidently is with Zeus high up in the sky, yet it is the circum- stantial dealings with the precious cup that make the encounter a ceremony. Wine flow- ing to the ground, hands lifted to the sky: this is the experience and the image of prayer. Thus ritual enters the narrative as a decisive element to mark the noble and heroic life. This is why sacrifice is included in the "typ- ical scenes of Homer":20 as the formulas fol- low each other, ceremonial actions take place in the order and fashion that ought to be, as befits that noble race immortalized by epic song. In a similar situation the Odyssey has a scene of prayer that has proved to be confus- ing to historians of religion. When Penelope learns about the risky journey undertaken by Telemachus and the suitors' plot to kill him, she first bursts into tears and complaints. Then, calming down, she washes and dresses in clean clothes, and goes to the upper story, together with her maids. She takes barley corn in a basket and prays to Athena for the safe return of Telemachus; she ends with an inarticulate and shrieking cry (òÀoÀuyq, 4, 759-767). Both the basket with barley corn and the cry have their proper place in san- guinary sacrifice, but their use in this scene is unparalleled elsewhere. So scholars spoke either of an "abbreviation of sacrifice" or of an otherwise unknown ritual of vegetarian of- fering, possibly an invention of the poet, if not due to the incompetence of the "redactor."21 I think there is another, perhaps surprising, explanation for the peculiarities of this scene. In Gilgamesh it is related how, when Gil- gamesh together with Enkidu is leaving to fight Humbaba, his mother "Ninsun enters her chamber, she takes a . . . (special herb), she puts on a garment as befits her body, she puts on an ornament as befits her breast . . . she sprinkles water from a bowl on earth and dust. She went up the stairs, mounted the upper story, she climbed the roof, to Shamash (the Sun God) she offered incense, she brought the offering and raised her hands before Sha- mash." Thus she prays, full of distress and sorrow, for a safe return of her son (III ii 1- 21 ).22 The situation of a mother praying for an adventurous son is not a special one. Yet in its details the scene from the Odyssey is much closer to the Gilgamesh text than to the comparable scene of Achilles' prayer in the Iliad) in fact, it comes close to being a translation of Gilgamesh. Whereas the ritual is peculiar in the Odyssey, none of these pe- culiarities is found in the passage of Gilga- mesh. Burning incense on the roof is a well- known Semitic practice,23 and it is especially appropriate when turning to the sun god. Cer- emonial prayer in the women's upper story is otherwise unheard of in Greece. It seems the poet knew that burning incense was out of place in the heroic world, so he took as a sub- stitute the female part in normal sacrifice: oulochytai and ololyge. Homeric scholars will have difficulties accepting such a per- spective. Suffice it to state that even the use of religious ritual as an effective motif within epic narrative has its antecedent in the ori- ental tradition. Divine Images in the World of Epic The problem of anthropomorphism has al- ways been connected with the problem of idols. The Christian invectives especially concentrate both on the immoral conduct of the gods and on the absurdity of venerating manmade objects of wood and metal.24 The question of Homer's relation to the use of cult images is of special interest since we know that a new situation was emerging in the eighth century with the definite installation of temples and cult images. There was an older and special tradition in Cyprus and Crete, but the findings of archaeology show again and again that many cults and temples began in the eighth century b.c. and per- sisted.25 The oldest Greek temple with cult images actually found still seems to be the 86 BURKERT</page><page sequence="8">temple of Dreros, Crete, dating to the end of the eighth century.26 At this time the art of fabricating human figures out of metal, wood, or clay was rapidly developing; the problems of which of the surviving figures are to be in- terpreted as divine and which as human, and of whether they were votives or objects of cult, can just be mentioned here. Let us also note in passing that the existence of perma- nent temples was to create a new problem for speculative anthropomorphism as to the whereabouts of gods: the gods now had to do a lot of traveling between Mount Olympus, the sky, and their local temples. Curiously enough the Hymn to Demeter has Demeter residing in her new temple at Eleusis exactly when she is angry with the other gods, and leaving Eleusis for Olympus when she is rec- onciled.27 There is no doubt that temples are found in Homer. The word vqóç seems to be well established in the epic dialect. It is strange, though, that the prayer of Chryses to Apollo in the Iliad, "If ever I have roofed a temple for you/' seems to imply that he has done so repeatedly, possibly as often as he has burned sacrifice, which he also mentions (i, 39- 40); 28 this might refer to a hut constructed again and again for the festival. Besides this case there are two temples at Troy mentioned in the Iliad-, the temple of Athena, to which I shall return,- and a temple of Apollo where Aeneas is cured (5, 446) and where Hector hopes to hangup looted weapons (7, 83). In the Odyssey it is especially in the city of the Phaeacians - the idealized colonial town, as has been said - where the founder, together with walls and houses, has established the "temples of the gods" (6, 10). Apollo, though, has his "grove" at Ithaca (20, 277- 278). It is more interesting that twice a goddess is said in the Odyssey to return to "her" sanc- tuary: Aphrodite, after the scandal with Ares, withdraws to Paphos "where she has a te- menos and a fragrant altar" (8, 363); Athena, from Scheria, leaves for Athens and "enters the solid house of Erechtheus" (7, 81). It is evident in both cases that realities of cult are in the background. The temple of Paphos is well documented by excavation; it had been in existence since the twelfth century b.c. Some form of common temple for Erechtheus and Athena must have existed on the Acro- polis of Athens by the epoch of the Odyssey, and probably the "old image" had been set up by then. Now, as to Paphos, we know that Aphrodite was represented in that temple by a stone, which has survived;29 so in this case there is absolute incongruity between Hom- er's imagination and the real image, even if the singer knows about the sanctuary's ex- istence. Things are more complicated with the Athenian Acropolis. In fact the poet of the Odyssey seems to know more details about the local cult: the lamp carried by Athena in a famous and controversial scene (19, 34) seems to come right from the Athenian tem- ple, as Rudolf Pfeiffer has recognized.30 Ath- ena is once described as revealing herself in her "real" form, in epiphany (13, 288-289): "a beautiful and big woman, fit for wondrous (textile) works." This however is hardly what the image at Athens can have been like; it was characterized by a bowl, an owl, and in all probability by a helmet as well.3 1 So the imag- ination of the poet seems to owe nothing to looking at a cult image. Compare the epi- phany of Hermes in both Iliad (24, 347-348) and Odyssey (10, 278-279): a handsome young man, with the first traces of a beard. From all we know, Archaic Hermes statues must have been quite different. Yet Homer gives the picture that was finally to prevail in Greek art from the fifth century on.32 The conclusion seems to be that there is more in- fluence from Homer's text on Classical Greek art than from early images on the text of Homer. This calls for some remarks on the noto- rious problem of the epithets ßocomc; nóivia "Hpq and yÀauKÕmic; 'Aörjvq.33 I think this problem has become more complicated than ever, since it is no longer possible to refer to some nebulous "origin," now that so many centuries before Homer are archaeologically well documented. The old hypothesis that cow-faced and owl-faced should refer to some "originally" zoomorphic conception of the re- spective goddess does not find much support in the iconography of the Bronze Age and Early Iron Age. On the other hand, the for- mula "Hpq 'Apyeiq seems only to make sense from the middle of the eighth century on- ward , from what we know about the devel- opment of the Argive Heraion. We are left with the dilemma of some very old, even pre- Mycenaean derivation34 or some relatively re- cent construct. I do not pretend to solve the age-old puzzle. BURKERT 87</page><page sequence="9">Mention must still be made of a most in- triguing case of divine images, the gods Aeneas takes with him at his escape from Troy. It is true that the earliest testimonies for this act of pius Aeneas are in Hellanicus (4 F 31) and Lycophron (1262-1263); there is also an Etruscan scarab of about 490 b.c.35 It is still highly probable that the tradition goes back to the oldest stratum of the Aeneas leg- end, to the epic kyklos, even before Stesicho- rus. It definitely is not a ubiquitous motif; it has not become attached to any of the other Trojan or Greek emigrants who went west. In fact this is a use of gods that has hardly a parallel anywhere in the Greek evidence: movable gods, to be carried into exile in a cof- fer. We know colonists used to take áíjnópúiiaTa from their metropolis, but these are tokens of a different kind.36 There are three directions in which to look for expla- nation: ( i ) some Anatolian custom among the descendants of Aeneas,-37 (2) some oriental motif (the Teraphim of the Old Testament, family gods that appear in novelistic con- texts, to be stolen, or hidden under a skirt, have been compared);38 or (3) the old situa- tion just before the installation of cult images in temples, when small statues, ancestral or imported, must have existed in Greece and been kept and venerated in chieftains' houses as household or family gods.39 The real problem that remains is the tem- ple and statue of Athena at Troy. Three epic texts have to be taken into consideration: the sixth book of the Iliad ; the abduction of the Palladion by Odysseus and Diomedes as con- tained in the "Little Iliad77 (p. 107,7 Allen); and the rape of Kassandra at the xoanon of Athena by Ajax the Locrian according to the Iliou Persis (p. 108,2-6 Allen).40 In addition there is the fact that the Greek city of Ilion did have a central temple of Athena, who was indeed the city goddess. I do not propose to disentangle the complex web of myths and rituals in this case. It is startling to see that the para-Homeric tradition, the tales from the kyklos, has become much more important for the Greeks than the text of the Iliad ; they have both become integrated into the realities of cult. The crime of Ajax, culminating as it does in sexual and religious transgression, looms large in Archaic imagery and literature, and it is connected with that strange ritual of the Locrians who had to offer girls to the tem- ple at Ilion.41 The Palladion was claimed to be in the possession of Athens, Argos, and Rome, among others.42 The two stories evi- dently deal with different images of Athena, though one may ultimately have evolved from the other. It is more relevant in our con- text to note that in the story of the Palladion we find the divine image in a role that is un- common in Greece: it does not represent the deity as being accessible in her temple, but ensures, by its very presence, the existence of the polis through magical effect. Such an image should rather be hidden and not shown to anybody, as later elaborations about Pal- ladia have it. Here again, as in the case of the gods of Aeneas, it is possible to embark on considerations about a non-Greek or else a very early tradition that comes to the surface, earlier than the regular establishment of tem- ples and cult images of the eighth century b.c. It is different with the famous scene in the sixth book of the Iliad. The ritual described there must have looked familiar to the nor- mal hearer or reader even in later centuries. A peplos is to be presented to the goddess as an extra gift; there is the queen together with the elderly ladies of the city to form the procession; there is the temple and the pries- tess appointed by the polis; key and temple door,- and of course a statue on whose "knees77 the peplos is to be laid. One should perhaps not be too realistic - eni youvaoi may come in as a formula - and one should be reminded that the offering of clothes has a much more primitive antecedent in hanging textiles from sacred trees. But still this is the most vivid picture of normal Greek cult to be found in Homer, with temple, statue, and priest; the Panathenaeic procession of course comes to mind. Without indulging in Homeric analy- sis,43 it may be stated that the function of this scene is in fact to make the transition from the Diomedes book (Book 5) to that most touching piece of Homer's, Hector and An- dromache. Both pieces may well have had their own prehistory in oral epic, so that the need to connect them only came in with the monumental composer, who chose to moti- vate one by the other through the supplica- tion to Athena. This might indicate that this scene belongs only to the final stage of the text as we have it, and is an especially elab- orate case of using ritual to create impressive narrative, to bring to life the situation at Troy and the people with their fears and their fate. What is most striking is that the whole of the 88 BURKERT</page><page sequence="10">cultic effort is discarded as futile in the end: "And Athena said no" (6, 311). The pompous and expensive apparatus of ritual may just be for nothing. This attitude of enlightened skepticism, if we dare to use such a word with regard to so early an epoch, seems well to match the ironic structure of the whole poem, which contrasts the labors of humans with the easy ways of humane yet light-living gods. Let us call it the mark of Homer. NOTES i. For Homeric bibliography, see David W.
