<plain_text><page sequence="1">FUNCTION AND EXPLANATION David Hirschmann and A. R. Manser I-David Hirschmann I It has been said that the three main biological problems are function, causation and evolution.1 There are biologists who maintain that knowledge of the function of a part of an organ- ism is a necessary step towards the discovery of its cause or evolution. Whether there are a priori grounds for this claim, the prevalence of the functional approach in biology warrants an investigation of the concept of function and the kind of understanding which a functional analysis may produce. This is part of the groundwork required for a philosophical assess- ment of the stronger claims of 'organismic' or anti-reductionist biology. In this paper I discuss certain general features of statements about function. I give an account of a model which is intended to show what is common to functional statements about organisms, artefacts and societies, and I show (a) that such statements are testable according to normal scientific canons, (b) how they are related to, although different from causal statements, and (c) that there are reasons why not every physical entity can be described functionally. Finally, I argue that discovering the function that something serves in a physical system yields an explanation. II The following are examples of functional statements; "the function of chlorophyll in a plant is to produce starch", "a func- tion of the kidney in man is to remove urea from the blood stream", "the function of egg-shell removal by a black-headed gull is to reduce predation on its young", "the function of the spark is to ignite the gas". 19</page><page sequence="2">20 I-DAVID HIRSCHMANN These statements result from an empirical analysis of a spatio- temporal object, such as an organism, machine or society, which is, roughly speaking, conceived as a whole with parts. I shall call such objects systems. A function may be attributed to any item-an object, substance, activity, property, process or event-which is a part or feature of a system. The function of the item of a system is something which contributes to the production of a certain state of the system. The production of starch is required if a plant is to continue living, the protection of the young chicks from predators is normally required if a gull family is to survive until the young reach a certain level of maturity, the ignition of gas in an engine is required for the engine to produce power. In general, if an item has a function in a system, then it is required for the proper functioning of the system in its normal environment. By the proper functioning of a system, we mean that the system has a certain character- istic, a special state or disposition. A functional statement, then, is one which is about a relation which holds between a system S, a feature of the system i, the (or a) function of the feature F, and a characteristic C of the system. Because the range of features which may be said to have a function is so varied and because features of a system may have more than one function, there is no simple general form of a functional statement. I shall take "the func- tion of i in S is F relative to C" as the standard form of such statements. The account of the functional relation given below is in terms of this standard form. III At this point someone might argue that there are important differences between functional statements about artefacts and organisms which prevent any general analysis of the concept of function. "Whereas a statement about the function F of a feature of a machine implies both that the machine was designed and the feature was designed with the purpose of its having that function, a statement about the function of a feature of an organism should not imply that the organism and feature were designed. So, either there is a difference in meaning be- tween the two uses of 'function' or the biological concept of</page><page sequence="3">FUNCTION AND EXPLANATION 21I function is, in a pejorative sense, anthropomorphic (un- scientific)." The argument is unsound. First, a functional statement about a machine implies that the machine was designed only if a machine is an artefact, something made for the purpose. So if the implication holds it is because the statement is about an artefact and not because it is about a function. Secondly, it is false that if i is a feature of a machine with function F then i was designed to have that function. Someone might build a machine and subsequently discover that some feature i had a function without, when designing the machine, knowing that i was a feature of it. It may also be argued, against the claim that there is a general concept of function, that some functional statements imply statements about consciously intentional activity. However, although it may be true that the function of a crash-helmet is to protect a motor-cyclist's head and true that normally a motor- cyclist wears a helmet in order to protect his head, it is not obvious that the first statement implies the second. There are special issues raised in cases where that which is said to have a function is something used by the system (here an agent) but not a feature of it. I shall not discuss these here, but I believe that, at the most, a statement to the effect that an agent intends that his actions on an item external to him should have certain effects provides some evidence for a statement about the function of the item. Because these cases require a more detailed discussion, I shall restrict the discussion to those cases where the item which is said to have a function is a feature of a system; that is, the item is a part of the system in a sense to be explained. IV In order to show that there is a concept of function which both has biological and non-biological applications and is scientific, we must determine how functional statements can be tested. I shall propose a set of conditions necessary for the truth of a functional statement of the standard form. Each condition is itself testable if not absolutely falsifiable or verifiable. The first condition is that a statement of the form "the function of i in S is F relative to C" is true only if a statement of</page><page sequence="4">22 I -DAVID HIRSCHMANN the form "Sometimes i is (part of) the cause of F" is true. Where i is an object or substance, the causal statement may have to be modified appropriately. Thus, the function of the heart is to circulate the blood only if sometimes the heart's beating causes the blood to circulate. I shall assume that causal statements of this kind are testable. Now, although this condition applies for all biological state- ments of function, there are other contexts in which a functional statement may be accepted, but the related causal statement is at least problematic. For example, in cricket, a function of the square-leg umpire is to dismiss a batsman whom he judges to be run out. But it is arguable, in a particular game of cricket, whether sometimes the umpire's judging a batsman to be run out causes (or is part of the cause) of his dismissing the batsman or of the batsman's being dismissed, for reasons may not be causes. In order to circumvent this debate, I shall consider only those systems which are described deterministically and, in particular, only those functional statements for which an answer to the question, "How is i related to F?" is, in part, causal. Even with this further restriction, it will become apparent how a large variety of functional statements are both scientific and explanatory. V Those objects whose items have functions are wholes, for ex- ample, organisms, machines and societies, that is objects which exhibit not merely complexity but an organisation as well. We recognise a difference between the vehicles in a street, a pile of stones and a mass of clouds on the one hand and a cell, a bridge and a family of ducks on the other. Electrons differ from molecules, stones differ from cats. But the distinction that we want to indicate by contrasting examples remains obscure. Rivers and mountains hover unhappily between the two kinds of object we attempt to distinguish and the differ- ences between objects said to be of the same kind may seem of more importance than the similarity we claim to detect. And yet 'being a whole' or 'being organised' does seem to be a characteristic an object must have if it is to have items with functions.</page><page sequence="5">FUNCTION AND EXPLANATION 23 Now the relation between a system and its features (what is meant by saying that the item with a function is in the system) cannot be the simple whole-part relation for some features of systems are not objects. However, by distinguishing basically two different kinds of collections of objects, we can explain what is meant by a system and its features. What I shall pro- vide is a minimal account of physical objects which are wholes which is intended to be sufficient to distinguish these objects from others. A collection of objects, collected according to some spatio- temporal criterion, will have properties or be in some state, which may or may not be different from the properties or states of the objects in the collection. If some red, triangular cards are put together to form a rectangle, then the collection is red as are the objects, but the shape of the collection is different from the shape of its objects. A collection of stones has a different weight from the weights of each of the collected stones. These properties have one thing in common. Relative to some analysis, if one of the cards changes in shape or colour, then the shape and the colour of the collection changes, but the other cards do not; if one of the stones changes in weight, then the weight of the collection changes, but the other stones remain the same weight. (We must say relative to some analysis because although in everyday situations we treat weight as a simple additive quantity, at a more sophisticated level we do not.) However, if we increase the weight of one stone in a pile, then the other stones may, as a consequence of that change, change their positions. I shall call a state or property of a collection of objects causally independent if (i) the state depends upon the state of at least one of its objects, (ii) the state is changed by a change of the state of at least one of its objects and those changes do not cause the remaining objects to change. It is true that if the position of one card A in the collection of cards changes its position, then the position of the other cards relative to it also change. But the change in the position of A does not cause the change in the spatial relations of the other cards (although whatever causes the change in A causes these changes in the remaining cards.) For if A changes its position then, necessarily, the spatial relations of the rest to A change, unless they are moved as well.</page><page sequence="6">24 I-DAVID HIRSCHMANN 1 shall call a collection whose only states or properties are causally independent a pure collection. There may in fact be no such thing as a pure collection. Let us suppose that an array of cards on a table is a pure collection. The statement that the function of one card in lying at one place is to make the collec- tion rectangular and the statement that that card lying in that place causes the array to be rectangular are equally bizarre. In contrast to causally independent states, there are other states that a collection of objects may be in which I shall call causally dependent states. A causally dependent state of a collection is one (a) which is causally dependent upon the state of at least one of its objects X, and (b) which is such that a change in the state of X causes a change in the state of the remaining objects of the collection. For example, suppose we identify some magnets as a collection of objects, then the magnetic field of the collection will change if the magnetic field of one magnet changes and this change will cause changes in the other magnets. I shall call a collection of objects all of whose states are causally dependent a pure system. It is an abstraction, for every physical system has at least one causally independent state. By a system I mean a spatio-temporally locatable collection of objects which has at least one causally dependent state. Objects may be collected according to various principles, so whether a state of the collection is causally dependent or not will depend upon the principles employed in the analysis. I have assumed that collections of objects may be in states where these states are caused by the states of the objects. A reductionist or nominalist would seek to replace statements about the states of collections by statements about the relations between the objects and their states. Thus, he would replace the statement that the cat is alive by a statement about the states of the objects forming a cat. The possibility of achieving reductions of this kind will not need to be discussed here. In recent years a number of writers have given accounts of systems within a subject known as General Systems Theory. von Bertalanffy gives a simple illustration of a mathematical definition of a system.2 It is an example of what I have called a pure system. Let p, (i = 1,2, . . n) be the elements of the system S</page><page sequence="7">FUNCTION AND EXPLANATION 25 Let Qi be the measure of pi. Then S is defined by the set of simultaneous differential equations: dQ, - = f. (.. , ........Qz) This definition is only an illustration (a) because other sets of equations may be used to define a system, and (b) because the elements of systems we are concerned with have qualitative as well as quantitative states. It is of interest to note that in the definition there is no Q, which is a measure of Q. For this reason it is applicable to only those systems whose states are reducible. Recognising the limitations of a formal theory of systems, we can still make use of some of the ideas developed in this field even though the systems we are concerned with are not pure systems as they will have both causally dependent and independent states. A system may be classified in two distinct ways. We may define a system of species k either in terms of the elements of the system or in terms of states or properties of the system itself. A system of species k is defined structurally as a collection of elements a, b, c, .... n where a has F,, F, ....., b has G,, G, ..... , c has H1, H2. . . etc. (F, G,_H are properties, relations or states) or it is defined functionally as an object which has elements and which has properties, A, B,... N and states u, v, w .... The first definition can be given for an array of cards, the second for a water pump (something capable of pumping water). We can also have a mixed definition of a system, that is a defini- tion in terms of the kinds of elements and states or properties of the system. Such a definition is satisfiable only if it is em- pirically possible for a system with these kinds of elements to be in the states or have the properties referred to in the definition. Now it is a familiar and confusing fact about the wholes we normally describe that they remain of the same kind in spite of great variation. Thus a cat remains a cat even if it can no longer catch mice, hunt birds, purr, or if it loses an ear, tail, fur or kidney. But beyond some point, which remains unspeci- fied, we have a collection of objects or even a whole object which is no longer a cat. Although we lack precise criteria for many systems, particularly organisms, I shall assume that we have some method available for deciding when a collection</page><page sequence="8">26 I-DAVID HIRSCHMANN of objects which was a system of species k is no longer of that species and when an element which was of species g is no longer of that species. I therefore ignore one of the crucial problems in the philosophy of biology. We may distinguish two kinds of physical systems which have causal states or properties, namely open and closed systems. A closed system is one where no energy or matter comes into or leaves the system. An open system is one where there is inter- change of energy or matter between the system and its environ- ment. The behaviour of many physical systems can be studied and explained by assuming that they are closed. It is a feature of organisms, but not organisms alone, that their behaviour cannot be explained if they are treated as if they were closed systems. In general, the distinction between a collection of objects, qua system, and its environment is theory dependent. The theory may be rejected because the distinction it draws leads to false descriptions. It is a feature of a closed deterministic system that the state of the system at one time is determined by the states of the ele- ments of the system at an earlier time. So, given the states T of the elements at one time, the system cannot fail to be in some state U at a later time, if T determines U. The only ways that the system could fail to be in U are contrary to the hypothesis of a closed deterministic system; either there is some interference from outside the system or at least one element of the system changes from one species to another without being caused to do so by the prior states of the elements. An open deterministic system, however, can fail to be in a state V, even though, given the states of its elements at an earlier time, it would have been in V if it had been a closed system. The environment can effect a system in the intervening period. Suppose that the definition of a species of open system k is a mixed functional and structural definition. Then we can distinguish those states and properties of a system or its elements without which it will no longer be a member of k and those which it is causally possible for it not to have without ceasing to be a member of k. I shall say that the second kind of property or state is one that a system or its elements can fail to have. Systems have two kinds of property of special interest. First there are capacities which they have all the time or for</page><page sequence="9">FUNCTION AND EXPLANATION 27 long periods of time. A railway bridge is a system capable of supporting trains up to a certain weight, an ammeter is capable of registering the current in a wire, a rabbit is capable of reproducing, a heart can pump blood. Each of these objects is a system, a collection of elements recognised as having some kind of unity and characterised by a capacity to do something. The capacities characterising the bridge, ammeter and heart are definitional and, as such are examples of functional defini- tions. The capacity characterising a rabbit is not. A sterile rabbit is still a rabbit. A heart which can no longer pump blood is, unless it can be repaired, no longer a heart, but its remains. A system can fail to realize and fail to have a capacity. A C-state of a system is the realisation of a capacity. The C-states may be particularly striking features of a system and an explanation of something a system does may involve showing that the system is so composed that it is capable of doing that thing. Another feature of a system which can be of particular interest to us is that it is in a state either throughout its existence or for large parts of it. For example, a bridge may be in a stable state for many years and an elephant breathes throughout virtually all its life. Sometimes our attention is fixed upon these main- tained states, either because the system is designed to have them, or because they are characterisic of that kind of system, but not by design. (Whether 'being alive' is a maintained state is problematic. An organism is alive if it has certain capacities at that time and it is alive only if certain processes occur at that time. But are the processes necessary for the capacity of being alive or are the capacities sufficient conditions for the state of being alive?) M-states are maintained states which can fail to obtain in the required sense. Now a system S can fulfil a capacity or maintain a state only if certain environmental conditions are satisfied. But a system may have a capacity without it being in an environment causally necessary for its fulfilment. Indeed it could have a cap- acity without ever realizing it. We must therefore distinguish between (a) the environment in which the system exists and (b) the environment required fobr the fulfilment of some capacity or the maintenance of some state. Let us call the former the normal environment and the latter the causal environment. 2</page><page sequence="10">28 I-DAVID HIRSCHMANN Then we can say that the causal environment obtains some of the time, all of the time, frequently, etc., in the normal environment. The final point I shall make about systems is this. A system S may have an element e which is itself a system. e will then be a sub-system of S and if S is open so is e. We can now say that a feature of a system is either (a) an element of the system, that is a spatio-temporal object, or (b) a sub-system, or (c) a property of the system, sub-system or element, or (d) an action or activity of the system, sub-system or element, or (e) some matter or stuff located within the spatial bounds of the system or (f) an event which is caused by some action of the system, sub-system or element or an interaction between them. We may sometimes determine that an item is a feature of a system by discovering that if it is considered to be a feature then it has a function within that system, but this is not true of all items which are features of a particular system. Thus, although we cannot explain why all items are features of systems independently of the notion of function, we can introduce the idea of a feature independently of function. In the following section I shall apply the notion of an open system to an analysis of the concept of function. Throughout the discussion, I assume that organisms and other systems which have parts with functions are deterministic systems. I believe that the analysis can be extended to indeterministic systems, but I shall not discuss this here. VI I have assumed that a functional statement implies some causal statement. Thus functional statements about physical systems are only acceptable if there are circumstances in the normal environment where the item is causally sufficient for F, its function. So 'the function of the heart is to circulate the blood' is true only if 'there are circumstances in the normal environ- ment when an action of the heart is sufficient to cause the blood to circulate' is true. We should notice that where the normal environment of an organism is such that some item never causes that which is the function of the item, but we have reason to believe that in the past it sometimes did cause F,</page><page sequence="11">FUNCTION AND EXPLANATION 29 we say that the item had the function F, implying that either the environment in which the creature lives is such that F is no longer required, although it once was, or that in a creature historically related to one of this kind, F was required for it to survive. The relation between the function F of an item and the characteristic of the system to which it is related also requires that a causal relation holds between F and the characteristic. Thus "The function of a thermostat is to maintain the tempera- ture of the water within certain limits" is true only if "In the normal environment of the central heating system, the temp- erature of the rooms it heats remains between certain limits only if the temperature of the water in the system remains between certain, different limits" is true. The necessary condition here is a causal one.3 I now propose the following as necessary conditions for the truth of "the function of i in S is F relative to C". (i) i is a feature of S (ii) i is sometimes present or occurs in the normal environ- ment E of S (iii) F is a feature of S (iv) i is a member of a set of conditions causally sufficient for F in the causal environment E, (v) Sometimes in E, i causes F; that is E, is sometimes a factor of E (vi) F is a causally necessary condition for the characteristic C of S (vii) Sometimes S has C (viii) S is an open system (ix) C, F and i can fail to obtain. This condition is qualified below. (These conditions must be suitably modified if it is true that only events can be causes.) The reasons for adopting conditions (i)-(vii) have already been indicated. The reason for introducing (viii) and (ix) is that they provide grounds for excluding apparently well- formed but unacceptable functional statements. "The function of the sun is to enable the planets to maintain their characteristic orbits." No one allows that this statement is of any value, Indeed, it is sometimes argued by analogy that</page><page sequence="12">30 I-DAVID HIRSCHMANN as our knowledge of the physics and chemistry of organisms increases, so we will be less inclined to use functional language in biology. The argument either ignores the prevalence of functional language in engineering or assumes without reason that functional statements in this area are equivalent to state- ments about human designs and purposes. For reasons alluded to at the beginning of this paper, I wish to locate the difference between this example and accepted functional statements elsewhere. First, the solar system, in which the sun has a 'function' may be treated as a closed system. In this case, the characteristic of the system cannot fail to exist in the sense of failure intro- duced above. But it is a feature of those statements we do accept that the systems referred to can fail and do fail to be in their characteristic states. Organisms can fail to reproduce, bridges become unstable, computers get the wrong answer. They do not thereby cease to be organisms, bridges or computers, although, in the circumstances the systems may subsequently cease to be of these kinds. But, conditions (i)-(viii) are insufficient even to explain why we reject this example. For the solar system can be studied as an open system. However, the characteristics of this system which interest us do not seem to be such that they can fail to occur without violation of a law or without the system becoming one of a different species, within the analysis. The kind of system we say has an item with a function is such that when it fails to have the characteristic associated with the function, it does not, for that reason alone, cease to be a system of species k. Thus, for any system which is referred to in a functional statement, it must be possible for it to be broken, defunct, not working. F and i are included in condition (ix) as we want to be able to make the same kind of judgment about the elements and sub-systems of the system. The objection may be made to condition (ix) that it rules out functional statements about artefacts where the characteristic chosen is part of the definition of that kind of artefact. For example, if the definitional characteristic of a crane is to lift loads, then a crane which cannot lift them is strictly no longer a crane. This result is intolerable if the truth-conditions are meant to apply to any functional statement about any causal</page><page sequence="13">FUNCTION AND EXPLANATION 31 system. However the criticism can be avoided. For the defini- tional characteristic of a crane applies to cranes of all types, namely, that the system can lift some load. This, of course, is not a sufficient characteristic. But a characteristic of any particular crane may be more specific, namely, that it can lift loads up to a maximum weight. And the more specific characteristic is not part of the definition of a crane. It is easy to see that the characteristic 'being alive' when applied to organisms has the same feature, for the more specific characteristics associated with a bacterium being alive are different from the more specific characteristics of a mammal's being alive. Let D be a definitional characteristic of a system and D' a non-definitional characteristic which entails D. Then we may qualify (ix) by (x) D is a characteristic of a system only if D' is a character- istic of S and S can fail to have D'. Condition (v), that sometimes in E, i causes F, is required to distinguish functional statements from statements of the form "i can cause F in S where F is necessary for C". Suppose that there is a butterfly with certain white markings and that this insect is introduced into an experimental environment in which there are predators which hunt the butterfly visually and in which the markings serve as effective camouflage. The markings would then be (part of) the cause of the insect's being un- detected by the predators and this effect is necessary for the insect to survive. But the markings would have this function only if the insect's normal environment contains (or perhaps once contained) such predators and contained background cover of this kind. It is sometimes very difficult to determine whether these conditions are fulfilled, but in many cases it is possible to provide good evidence for the claim that E, is a factor of the normal environment. None of the conditions stated so far show why we select some characteristics of a system rather than others in a functional analysis. It is true that an inspection of a wide range of cases will show that the characteristics chosen are always capacities which the system can fail to fulfil in the normal environment or M-states which can fail to occur in this environment. But this allows the possibility of taking death as opposed to life as the characteristic or organisms. What is wrong with the "function of the aorta is to rupture" ?</page><page sequence="14">32 I-DAVID HIRSCHMANN Let us suppose that if the aorta ruptures then the circulation system will no longer transmit a minimum quantity of oxygen and without interference, less than the minimum supply of oxygen is necessary for death. (The qualification, without interference, applies to all functional statements.) The statement is unacceptable because the item is a ruptured aorta. If something is ruptured then it is broken or malfunc- tioning and it is absurd to say that a malfunction has a function. Of course, when something within an organism breaks or mal- functions, a repair mechanism may then begin to function, but the breakage or malfunction is not part of that sub-system. The concept of a ruptured aorta is parasitic upon some func- tional description of the body which has an intact aorta as an element. If a description of the ruptured aorta can be given which does not imply that it is broken or, more generally, mal- functioning, then one necessary condition for a functional state- ment with death as the characteristic is fulfilled. But this possibility is prevented by the descriptive language of our biology. It is a feature of physiology and, as Beckner has shown,4 much of morphology too, that the elements of an organism are described and often defined in functional terms. For example, a heart is an organ which can pump blood. The shape, for example, of the organ is unimportant; what matters is what it does, or what function it has, in the organism. Similarly, although blood vessels sometimes have additional holes in them an intact or normal vessel will be one which enables the blood to travel along certain required routes. Even if an ingenious scientist preoccupied with death could describe the organism of his choice in terms which did not presuppose that the characteristic was to be alive, he would face one further problem at least. Our present concept of death itself is parasitic upon our concept of life. We may grant that the concept of biological life is vague, but it has been given some scientific substance through discovery. First, it is judged that living things are members of certain classes, this judgment being made without specific criteria. Then it is discovered that the members of some of the classes are deemed to be alive if certain conditions are fulfilled and only if others are. Then these conditions are elevated to criteria. The ingenious</page><page sequence="15">FUNCTION AND EXPLANATION 33 scientist must start again if he is to avoid using a concept which implies failure. This may explain why functional statements about systems whose characteristic is death are unacceptable, but it does not explain why we select the characteristics we do in functional analyses. The formal account given so far leaves a wide range of possible capacities and states to choose from. The character- istics for a functional description of an artefact will be deter- mined by the intentions of the designer or the use to which it is put. But for a natural system the characteristic appears to be determined by historical factors alone. I do not believe that this is necessarily so. At least one reason apart from tradition can affect our choice for a given system. It is brought out by Tinbergen when he writes, "How is it possible that living things do not succumb to the omnipresent destructive influences of the environment? How do living things manage to survive or maintain themselves?"6 The question is not naive. It is the fundamental problem with which functional biology begins and the fact that organisms do sur- vive in an indifferent if not hostile environment becomes increasingly surprising as our knowledge of physics increases. In the long run we are all dead, but why is the journey so long ? We begin to make some progress towards answering this when we discover that parts of organisms have r6les to play, relative to survival and reproduction. We then find support for the hypothesis that it is in virtue of their organisation that organ- isms will survive by discovering that a large number of the features of the system have functions relative to this character- istic. (Notice that there is no reason to assume that every ele- ment or feature has a function. The ear-lobe of a human ear has a use but no function. It is not clear why some functionalists in sociology have assumed that every element or feature has a function.) So, in general for a natural system, the characteristics for a functional analysis can be selected as a result of a certain kind of puzzlement, often marked by a question of the form "How is it possible that the system does not X?" where we are sur- prised that X does not happen. And the choice of character- istics is justified through the success of the functional analysis in showing how the system is organised to avoid X or to achieve</page><page sequence="16">34 I-DAVID HIRSCHMANN T (where X and r are contraries). A crucial factor is the dis- covery that X is avoided or Y is achieved only if certain condi- tions obtain. In the case of a living mammal, these are the so- called vital functions. One problem I shall mention, but not discuss, is this. "The function of the heart beat is to produce a pulse." "The function of the pulse is to circulate blood." Neither statement is accept- able, although it may be true that in a human, not subject to interference, the heart beats if and only if there is a pulse. The concept of cause which I have assumed must be such that if A causes B and A is materially equivalent to C and B to D it does not follow that C caused B or that A causes D. It is well- known that there are difficulties of this kind for any purely extensional account of causality. Similarly, if the function of egg-shell removal is to reduce predation on its young and nature is such that predation on young gulls decreases if and only if predation on young shrews increases, it does not follow that the function of egg-shell re- moval is to increase predation on young shrews. A low probabi- lity of predation on young gulls is a state of the gull-family system, but a high probability of predation on young shrews is not. My account therefore presupposes adequate criteria for a state being a state of a system. VII Whether or not the conditions which I have given are sufficient for the truth of a functional statement, they demonstrate that these statements are not about the determinants of the item. An answer to the question, "What is the function, if any, of i ?" does not explain the cause of the presence or occurrence of i, although I believe that a comprehensive explanation of the presence or occurrence of an item with a function in a system depends upon a knowledge of that function. That is, an adequate answer to problems of evolution or causation depends upon a solution to a problem of function. The truth conditions do bring about the import of functional statements, namely that they are about open systems and their characteristics. A central feature was stressed in the explana- tion of why we select certain characteristics. A functional</page><page sequence="17">FUNCTION AND EXPLANATION 35 statement states the r61e that an item has in relation to a characteristic of a system. The description of the wayin which a system is organised varies as different characteristics are chosen in an analysis. What we seek to find is that set of charac- teristics which yield an optimum analysis of the organisation of the system. In other words, the more features of a system that have a function relative to some characteristic the better the analysis. It is a presupposition of the functional approach in biology that the characteristic associated with being alive will yield the optimum analysis of the organisation of organisms. It follows that Nagel is wrong when he claims that the dif- ference between a statement about the function of an item and a statement about what it causes is one of selective attention and not assertive content.6 For a statement about the function of the item and one about what the item causes (or can cause) will have different implications. "The function of i in S is F relative to C" implies "S is a system so organised that it can achieve C in its normal environment". "x causes (or can cause) y which is necessary for object 0 to be in state C" does not imply that 0 is a system which can be in C. Even if the ten conditions I have given are necessary and sufficient for a functional statement, then there is still a difference between these statements and causal statements of the form "x causes (or can cause) y which is necessary for 0 to be in C". For func- tional statements will then be equivalent to a conjunction of causal statements and statements about O's being a system. VIII There have been conflicting views about the explanatory import of functional statements. The cause of the conflict has been a narrow and incorrect account of scientific explanation, the hypothetico-deductive theory. The two features of this theory which are implausible are that explanation and prediction are symmetrical and that all scientific explanations are answers to why-questions. They are central to Hempel's argument that functional analyses are either unsuccessful or uninformative as explanations.7 First, he assumes that the analysis is intended to explain the presence of the item at a particular time. He writes, "The kind</page><page sequence="18">36 I-DAVID HIRSCHMANN of phenomena a functional analysis is invoked to explain is typically some recurrent activity or some behaviour pattern in an individual or group."8 Although he continues, "And the principal objective of the analysis is to exhibit the contribution which the behaviour pattern makes to the preservation or development of the individual or group", he assumes, in accord- ance with the 'covering law' theory, that the analysis is intended to effect the explanation by deducing "item i is present in S at time t" from an explicans. He rightly concludes that such attempts are doomed to failure, but does not then reconsider whether functional explanations are intended to show what determines the presence of i. I do not believe that any functionalist in biology would seriously contend that "i is present in S because it has the function F required for C". But this belief is foisted on them by Hempel's account of explanation. In Aspects of Scientific Explanation, he says that a scientific explanation may be regarded as an answer to a why-question and that although explanation-seeking questions sometimes have a different mode of formulation, (e.g., "what caused p?"), a why-question always provides an adequate, if sometimes awkward standard phrasing.9 The fact that many questions of the form "Why is it that p ?" can be answered by citing propo- sitions from which p is deducible is seductive. For it is easy to move from this observation together with the observation about explanation-seeking questions to the conclusion that all adequate answers to why-questions are ones from which p can be deduced. But the conclusion does not follow, for not all explanation-seeking questions can be rephrased without ambiguity as why-questions. Even "what was the cause of the explosion ?" can only be rephrased as "why did the explosion occur?" on the understanding that the why-question asks for the cause and not the purpose. More to the point, Hempel should have noticed that the question "What is the function of i?" cannot be expressed by a why-question. There is no intel- ligible candidate. The question, "Why is i present?" is am- biguous at least between "What caused i to be present ?", and "What is the function of i?". These are very different questions. And unless the context determines the sense of the question, the questioner will have to rephrase his question in one of these forms or some other.</page><page sequence="19">FUNCTION AND EXPLANATION 37 This is why Hempel takes the explicandum of a functional explanation to be the presence of i. But when he argues correctly that the explicans, as he construes it, would not enable one to predict the presence of i, this too should make us doubt his construction. For if a functional statement is an answer to the question "What is the function of i ?", then it is true whether or not i is present at the time. In some cases perhaps a suitably axiomatised theory of an open system may enable one to predict the presence of i at time t, but those statements required for the prediction will not be the same statements as those required for the deduction of "the function of i is to F". There may be predictions which can be made given the function of an item in a system, but they cannot be made on the basis of a functional explanation alone. A functional analysis or statement is explanatory because it shows the role that some item has in a system organised with respect to some characteristic. The discussion so far has shown that the crucial statements in the analysis are testable, if not strictly falsifiable, and that the claim that a system is organised with respect to some characteristic (the optimum set) is empirical, too. The analysis is therefore scientific and it is explanatory because it makes intelligible or enables us to understand something we did not understand before, namely, that the item has a functional r6le in the system. The understanding gained is both theoretical and practical. There is an unjustified belief that, for scientific explanation, "p is explained by q" is equivalent to "p because of q" which in turn is equivalent to " 'p' is deducible from 'q' ". It rests, in part, upon the mistaken belief that in science the only explana- tions sought are those which show what determines a phenom- enon. Beckner has written, "Only the most Palaeozoic reactionary would maintain that 'Plants have chlorophyll' is explained by 'Plants perform photosynthesis'." x0 But an ancient philosophical view may become distorted over the millenia. By removing the distortion, we may find that what appeared reactionary is liberal if not revolutionary and what looked progressive is in fact conservative.</page><page sequence="20">38 I-DAVID HIRSCHMANN REFERENCES 1 N.

Manser I Mr Hirschmann regards his paper as a contribution to the philosophy of biology, considering one of the 'three main biological problems', namely 'function, causation and evolu- tion'. He is right in stating that much use is made of the term 'function' in biology, though I do not think he gives adequate attention to the reasons why many scientists, some of them biologists, find the notion problematic. For if the standards of explanation in most other sciences are accepted as paradig- matic, it would appear that there was no room for teleological or functional explanations. In the past such explanations were frequently employed, but the rise of modern physics is cor- related with the abandonment of these concepts in the inorganic realm. Consequently, it does not seem unreasonable to think that biology will only become a full science when it has got rid of these notions. Indeed, many practising biologists would accept that they were no longer necessary. This claim need not involve a reduction of biology to physics, but merely a rejection of a reliance on teleological notions. Hirschmann says little about teleology, for he seems to believe that it is possible to discuss functional statements without reference to that idea. He is trying to produce a model which shows 'what is common to functional statements about organisms, artefacts and societies' (p. I9). I shall argue that the attempt to lump these three together is one of the sources of confusion in the paper. Hirschmann's general aim might be said to show that functional statements are explanatory and hence that those who demand a monolithic pattern of explanation for all sciences are wrong. A large part of his paper is taken up with con- structing a 'model' or definition of such statements, though he 39</page><page sequence="22">40 II-A. R. MANSER himself admits (p. 33) that the formal account he gives needs supplementation. Hence I shall not say much about this aspect of his paper, except to remark that I have doubts about such a method of procedure. Certainly we can produce a formal definition of 'function' which will reflect the way in which it is normally used, and Hirschmann succeeds in this. But the danger of this technique is that it leads to the omission of the philo- sophically interesting points. Definitions are seldom of help in philosophy, and one of the dangers of the 'philosophy of science' is that it leads to a concentration on such formal aspects and hence to the belief that there is an area of philos- ophy which is the province of specialists. I do not believe that philosophy can be so divided up and dealt with by experts in separate fields. Fortunately it is clear that the problem that Hirschmann and I are discussing is an aspect of a more general and important philosophical one. He expresses this in terms of the claims of an 'organismic' or anti-reductionist biology (p. I9), and I will follow him by taking mainly biological examples. But, again like him, I shall be concerned with the notion of function in general and with the belief that the existence of functional explanations shows that there is something different about living organisms, that the language in which we talk about such organisms cannot be reduced to the language in which we talk about mere matter. This belief is related to, though not the same as, a further contemporary claim that the language in which we talk about human actions and behaviour is irreducible to that in which we talk of animals and plants, and of course still less reduc- ible to the language of mere physical processes. That this belief echoes the old notion of the 'Great Chain of Being' is not in itself an argument against it, though the presence of such a feature is surprising. I shall argue that, contrary to Hirschmann's claim, functional statements are not necessary in biology. The implication that perhaps intentional statements are not necessary in dealing with human behaviour I have no space to discuss, though my general argument may be relevant to that also. The reason why this point is not generally accepted is that philosophers have confused two different positions. It can be established, as Hirschmann does, that there can be no exact</page><page sequence="23">FUNCTION AND EXPLANATION 41 translation of functional language into that of physics. Any attempt to do so will fail to preserve the full meaning of the original. But it does not follow from this that the functional language was necessary for an adequate description of the phenomenon. That such language is necessary does not seem to follow from the fact that it is ordinarily used. Changes do occur in ways of talking, conspicuously and suddenly in the case of scientific language, more gradually in the case of everyday speech. In the case of science, these changes are sometimes referred to as 'revolutions'. But any revolution, political or scientific, is going to dispense with features that upholders of the old order thought were essential, otherwise there would be no reason to characterise it in such a way. Whereas the sup- porters of the new concentrate on the freedom or whatever that has been gained, the 'reactionaries' stress what has been omitted. However in philosophy nostalgia is no substitute for argument. To show that the new way of talking is deficient in some way requires a proof that essential features of the phenomena have been left out. Ex hypothesi the revolutionaries do not find these features essential. Sometimes it may seem that there are empirical facts which could provide a proof. Before the synthesis of urea it might have been pointed out to a chemical reduc- tionist that there was an important difference between organic and inorganic chemistry, for organic compounds could only be synthesised by living things. After many organic compounds had been successfully made in the laboratory, such a distinction was no longer tenable. I suspect that those who wish to assert that functional language is required would not be satisfied with the empirical fact that biologists now use it (if they do), any more than those who wish to say human intentions are irreducible are prepared to grant that new psychological discoveries might render such ways of talking otiose. What is needed is some kind of metaphysical proof that there is a category difference between the two things, which is why I referred to the 'Great Chain of Being' which would seem to be an example of such a thing. It is not enough to claim that certain modes of speech are employed, for the history of man- kind in general and science in particular is littered with aban- doned ways of talking. Some of these may still be current</page><page sequence="24">42 II---A. R. MANSER though in a rather different sense from that in which they were originally used, e.g., the sun's rising and setting. Thus my thesis is that we do not have to use the concept of function in biology, even though biologists find it convenient to do so. By saying that it is merely convenient I wish to imply that it is always possible to dispense with it without any important loss of meaning. Hirschmann regards functional statements as explanatory. Certainly we often do accept 'The function of i is to F' as explaining i. Often, but not always, for some functional statements are unsatisfactory and can be shown to be such. But, Hirschmann claims, functional statements are not causal; in other words that an item has a function does not explain the presence of that item. Normally it would be thought that this was true of biological functional statements but not of those about machines or human activities. Because he does not want to tie functional statements to biology but to what he calls 'open systems' in general, including at least organisms, artefacts and societies, Hirschmann is forced into some con- fusion about machines and human purposes. The confusion is important because it reveals a failure to submit the notion of function to sufficiently precise analysis. He criticises an argu- ment that increasing knowledge of the physics and chemistry of organisms will reduce our dependence on functional state- ments by saying: The argument either ignores the prevalence of functional language in engineering or assumes without reason that functional statements in this are equivalent to statements about human designs and purposes (p. 30). Certainly such statements are common in engineering, but this is surely because it is an area where human designs and purposes hold sway. A biologist may mistake the function of a feature of an organism, but such an error can hardly occur when the device has been constructed by us. We can claim to know that the function of the carburettor is to produce an appropriate mixture of petrol and air because it has been designed for the purpose. To explain the function of the carburettor is at the same time to explain its presence, and I suspect that one of the reasons that people are satisfied with functional explanations is that they think that being told what</page><page sequence="25">FUNCTION AND EXPLANATION 43 the function of something is also telling them why it is there. This is particularly so in areas where certainty about the function can be achieved. In the case of human products which have not been deliberately designed, and here I am thinking of such things as myths and political and social institutions, functional statements often seem less explanatory and more dubious. This is because these items have grown historically as the locus of a variety of conflicting intentions and there is seldom agreement about their functioning, or even whether they actually possess a function at all. One argument commonly used against functional statements in biology is that they imply teleological statements about the 'Architect of the Universe', just as functional statements about machines imply teleological statements about human designers. Either their use in biology is anthropomorphic (or theistic) or there must be two senses of 'function'. I must confess that I fail to follow Hirschmann's argument against this in Section III of his paper. He wishes to maintain a single concept of function and to deny that it has any connexion with human or divine intentions. Consequently he is led to say that it is false that 'if i is a feature of a machine with function F then i was designed to have that function'. I cannot imagine an example where we would both want to say that something had a function in a machine and yet this function was unintended. Certainly there might be situations where a machine designed for one purpose was found to be suitable for a quite different purpose and that some non-functional piece of the original machine turned out to have a central function in its new use. There might also be an artefact, e.g., a piece of 'kinetic art', which was not designed to do anything but which turned out to be usable for some purpose. But in these cases the person who recognised the new use would be in a sense a (new) designer and he would be able to state with certainty what the function of any part was. (And any part which did not have a function in the new use would be superfluous.) If we come across an artefact whose purpose we cannot fathom we are precluded from making any functional statements about its parts but, so long as we assume it was not intended as a work of art, we assume that it must have a purpose and we may try to discover the purpose by suggesting functions for those parts.</page><page sequence="26">44 II--A. R. MANSER Because it is an artefact, i.e., shows evidence of having been designed, we have confidence in the possibility of a successful outcome, just as in the days of belief in a detailed Divine Providence there was confidence that every creature had a function in the economy of the whole universe. It has been pointed out to me' that there are some examples which apparently run counter to my claim that artefacts can have unintended functions only as the result of some sort of 're-design'. These are certain psycho-analytical explanations, e.g., 'The function of carrying a gun is to reinforce a defective male image'. This explains the subject's behaviour in cases where we would not normally feel that a gun was necessary in its primary function. However, it is presumably because the gun has the primary function it has that the subject can use it in the way he does, and the psycho-analyst would be able to specify the way in which this came about; 'It is because a gun is an aggressive weapon that it can function in this manner.' Of course the question still remains open whether this is a cause or a reason, though I do not wish to enter into this problem here. What this example does reveal is that there may be a difficulty over specifying the function of an artefact in a particular case, even though we know perfectly well what its normal function is. There is perhaps a parallel with the difficulty of specifying an action. In most cases we accept the agent's description of what he is doing though we cannot do so in all or there would be no possibility of attributing mistakes, errors and negligence to him. But unless we had a concept of action which was that of the agent doing what he intended, these other concepts could not get off the ground. Similarly, unless most artefacts did fulfil the function for which they were designed, we could not talk of such things having a function at all. In general, however, statements about the purposes and functions of artefacts seem necessarily connected. Because the machine has a purpose we can say that its parts have functions. Further, the machine has a purpose because we confer one on it, are beings who have purposes of our own. We could not describe machines adequately without the use of such terms. In other words, there is a concept of function which applies primarily to machines. If we accept that the universe is not an</page><page sequence="27">FUNCTION AND EXPLANATION 45 artefact and that most of its parts are not such, then it would seem that a different concept of function, or none at all, would be applicable. This is not to deny that biologists frequently make use of a concept of function, though I shall argue in Section II that they do not have to. That the use of such functional language seems natural arises from the fact that we normally attribute certain goals or purposes to organisms, namely those of survival and reproduction. Hirschmann quotes a question of Tinbergen's: 'How do living things manage to survive or maintain themselves?' (p. 33). This certainly seems to attribute the 'goal' of survival to organisms. The fact that many people would accept such an idea is evidence of the extent of teleological thinking. One biological caveat must be introduced, however; the 'goal' is not survival per se but only until reproduction of an adequate number of offspring. After that survival may be to the disadvantage of the species as a whole. For biological goals, if there are any, belong to the species, not to individuals. The fact that the species may best be served by a relatively short life-span allows for the possi- bility of a feature whose function is to end the life of a particular organism (or a class of organisms). Hirschmann's failure to distinguish between individuals and species, partly brought about by the use of the word 'system', leads him to find difficulty with functional statements that imply death. But with the addition of a clause such as 'after n years of life' such a statement as 'The function of the aorta is to rupture' is not obviously silly. And it could be added that we are all too familiar with the notion of 'built-in obsolescence' in artefacts. I do not think that Hirschmann's definition of 'function' will exclude statements which involve (apparent) failure. If it does, then these examples show that it is inadequate. My worry about the use of the definitional technique, however, is wider. It fails to cope with what seems an obvious difference between functions of machines and of organisms, as I have shown. Although condition (v) rules out some false functional state- ments, it is still possible to construct fictitious functional ex- planations. For what shows that such an explanation will not do is not the application of Hirschmann's definition but detailed analysis within the particular subject. Indeed, an examination of medieval thinking will reveal the ease with</page><page sequence="28">46 II-A. R. MANSER which functional explanations can be found for a wide variety of phenomena. This fact, coupled with the difficulty about the attribution of purposes to living organisms, should lead philos- ophers to be suspicious of such statements. II In this section of the paper, I want to examine a particular example from biology which will bring out in detail some points about the use of functional analyses in that subject. The paper I discuss is "The Functional Significance of Aerenchyma in Plants".2 (It is perhaps not without significance that the title of the volume in which the paper occurs is Mechanisms in Biological Competition.) Aerenchyma, or tissue with large air spaces, occur exclusively in plants living in wet habitats. This feature had been explained by saying that the air spaces pro- vided a supply of oxygen for the tissues which were submerged, because water contains much less oxygen than does normal soil. Here we have a functional explanation, which could be expressed as 'The r61le of aerenchyma is to provide oxygen for the tissues', and this could easily be expressed in terms of Hirschmann's definition. The authors, however, go on to argue that if this were the function of aerenchyma then they are not very well constructed for the purpose because of the slow rate at which oxygen could diffuse from one chamber to the next. (I am simplifying the argument slightly, but not I think falsifying it.) Hence they produce a new 'primary function' for the air spaces, 'primary' because they admit that the older suggestions may well account for a subsidiary function. This is a mechanism for anchoring the plant firmly in the soft soil which forms its environment. They argue: "A submerged system based on the massive lines of land plants will not serve; for if it is mechanically adequate its oxygen requirement will be too high, and if the total amount of tissue is reduced to overcome this difficulty, it will not be mechanically adequate. What is required, therefore, is a structure which, for any given diameter, provides the greatest possible strength with the least possible amount of tissue" (op. cit. p. 140).</page><page sequence="29">FUNCTION AND EXPLANATION 47 This is a honeycomb structure such as is provided by aerenchyma, and they argue that only this function will explain the quantity of aerenchyma in plants with aquatic or marshy habitats. The authors conclude: "The relevance of these observations to a symposium on competition will be obvious: any structure which enables an organism to thrive in a habitat lethal to many others may be thought of as conferring a com- petitive advantage on that organism" (op. cit. p. 143). Thus aerenchyma enable plants to live in areas where others cannot, and this seems to us an advantage. The story is both functional and purposive. The method used in the papers is hypothetico-deductive in one sense of the phrase, for the authors deduce certain consequences from the hypothesis that aerenchyma serve primarily for oxygen transport and then show that these consequences do not occur, so the original hypo- thesis cannot be true. In other words their method is similar to that used in other sciences. But nothing is said in the paper about how certain species come to possess aerenchyma; as Hirschmann says, a functional explanation does not explain the presence of the item whose function is discussed. In fact the argument of the paper on aerenchyma is quite compatible with a belief that God had created some plants with this feature in order that they might live in marshy habitats where others would not survive. Another way of putting the same point would be to point out that the burden of the argument of the authors could be put in the form of 'How to design a plant to live in wet areas'. In this context it is significant that they close with thanks to a Professor of Civil Engineering 'for his extremely helpful comments on the mechanical design of plants' (id p. 143). His remarks were doubtless based on the methods engineers use to support buildings in such environ- ments. This seems to reinforce the link between functional and teleological statements to which I have already referred. But it is also clear that the authors do not believe that organisms were designed or created by a Deity. Indeed, one of the authors (W. T. Williams) remarked to me that although it might be necessary for a biologist to conduct his research by thinking teleologically, he should get rid of all such notions when he came to write up the results.</page><page sequence="30">48 II-A. R. MANSER If we accept that functional statements answer a question of the form 'How ... ?', we still seem to be left with a 'Why ..?' In the case of artefacts there is no problem in providing an answer, though in many cases this is so obvious that the question is never raised. If we learn that the carburettor is essential for the working of the engine, we are not tempted to ask why it came to be part of it. But in the biological case the functional explanation is incomplete precisely because we can no longer believe that organisms are the result of conscious design. It may well be that people frequently are satisfied, in the sense that they stop asking questions, when they are told the function of an organ, but they have no right to be satisfied if what they are seeking is a scientific account. Hirschmann thinks that func- tional explanations are complete and can stand on their own. No doubt biologists often appear to think the same thing, but I believe that this is a result of a failure fully to understand what they are doing, or what they are entitled to claim. It should not be forgotten that it was because Nature seemed to reveal so many examples of function that the Argument from Design seemed for so long unassailable. Indeed, it is even possible to construct functional statements about features of things which are neither living nor artefacts as part of a description of the 'Economy of Nature'. For example 'the function of the change in specific gravity of water at 40C is to allow it to solidify from the top down instead of from the bottom up'. If water, like most liquids, continued to grow denser as it approached the point of solidification, it is probable that the oceans of the earth would freeze solid. In that case, life as we know it certainly would not have developed on this planet. The earth can be considered as a single system, it is now claimed by many ecologists. This is not obviously silly when the complex interrelations between various factors are seen. And in Hirschmann's sense the earth clearly is an 'open' system, for it does depend on an 'environment', in particular the radiation of the sun. Thus it would seem that my suggestion about the freezing point of water is a functional statement in accordance with Hirschmann's definition on p. 29. It is markedly different from his example of a pseudo-functional statement, 'The function of the sun is to enable the planets to maintain their characteristic orbits'. This is defective partly</page><page sequence="31">FUNCTION AND EXPLANATION 49 because the sun obviously has other 'functions' in respect of the planets and, more important, because 'planets' can only be de- fined in terms of a 'sun', as well as for the reason he gives. He would no doubt claim that 'the characteristics of this system which interest us do not seem to be such that they can fail to occur without the violation of a law or without the system be- coming one of a different species, within the analysis' (p. 30). The earth would continue to be an open system even if there were no life on it, and even though we do think of the behaviour of water as law-governed I am not sure that this is adequate to rule out the suggestion. I would agree that (almost) everyone would want to rule this out as a functional state- ment, though not because it fails to fulfil a definition. III However, if something like the Darwinian account of evolution is accepted, it is no longer necessary to think of nature as the product of a designer. Indeed, one of the objects of Darwin's work was to account for the existence of a large number of species well adapted to their environments without the need to invoke a Divine Creator. But getting rid of teleology also affects the status of functional statements about organisms by depriving them of their foundation. No doubt it is still possible to invoke the ghost of the abolished Creator in the form of some 'vital element' which belongs to all living things and to no non-living ones, and there have been many biologists who have claimed that 'vitalism' or some such doctrine of the essential difference between living and non-living was required. Of course one problem for such a view is how to distinguish between the organic and the inorganic; at the level of the simplest organisms the line of division appears arbitrary. Tougher-minded biologists have maintained that there was something unscientific about the introduction of such an element which could not be scientifically discovered. Clearly I am on the side of the tough-minded here. Vitalism, or some similar doctrine, is adopted mainly in order to be able to talk in functional terms. It explains the apparent difference between biology and the rest of science.</page><page sequence="32">50 II-A. R. MANSER The object of the theory of Natural Selection was to give a 'naturalistic', or scientific, account of the way plants and animals came to be as they were. Darwin had noticed how men bred (or 'designed') animals and plants for their own purposes; he realised how a similar process could occur without the intervention of any outside agent and without the postulation of any 'striving' towards a goal by the organism. I have argued elsewhere3 that the essence of the Darwinian revolution was to show that the methods of science were applicable to living things, and this is equivalent to claiming that functional statements are not irreducible. Consequently, I think that Hirschmann is wrong when he says: 'an adequate answer to problems of evolution or causation depends upon a solution to a problem of function' (p. 34). Rather it is the case that answers to problems of evolution and causation eliminate the need for functional statements. This can be seen by a brief account of how plants of some species came to acquire aeren- chyma. In general any organism produces offspring like itself. However, there do occur random variations (mutations) so that some differ from the parent. Most of these do not survive. One such mutation might involve hollow roots. A plant with such airspaces would be less fitted to a normal environment because the roots would not have the mechanical strength to penetrate firm soil. If one such plant happened to grow in damp soil, where the parent could not live, it would flourish. Further mutations in the same direction in succeeding gen- erations would eventually result in a new species only adapted to thoroughly wet environments. It may still appear that there is a teleological element in this account, because of the occurrence of such terms as 'fitted', 'adapted' and 'flourish'. It looks as if we are attributing goals and success in reaching them to the species. However, this is an illusion due to the fact that our explanation runs from the present to the past. What is to be explained is the existence of this species having a particular functional feature, or the cause of the functional feature itself. That this does exist is a datum. What is forgotten is the enormous number of other variations that failed to survive, which no longer exist to require ex- planation. The seed of a plant with aerenchyma that falls on normal soil will not manage to take root. Among the mutants</page><page sequence="33">FUNCTION AND EXPLANATION 51 that fail to survive there are many which no doubt would have lived if the environment had been different. Because from the point of view of the organism, as it were, changes in the en- vironment are random, random variations in offspring will increase the chance of its having viable descendants. This again looks like attributing a goal to the organism, but the same idea could be expressed by saying that we are unlikely to encounter living things which breed absolutely true for they are not going to survive changes in their environment. And because they are, in Hirschmann's terms, 'open systems' the environment has to be taken into account. Because of the kind of account which is given by evolutionary theory, there is a lack of symmetry between explanation and prediction. Hirschmann rightly points out (p. 35) that normal science considers the two things to be in a sense equivalent. It is clear that even if we are satisfied with the explanation of how some species came to possess aerenchyma there is no possibility of reversing the explanation and predicting that these would develop. This is ruled out by the random nature of mutations. For there is no contradiction in the idea that plants should not live in wet environments. But I do not think that this lack of symmetry itself establishes that biology requires explanatory principles of a different type from those used in the rest of science, any more than the difficulty of prediction at the quantum level does. In other words, explanations in biology may not be as complete as those in physics. If it is accepted that evolution involves as a random element, then they cannot be. This feature is not due to a simple lack of knowledge which could be remedied; any predictions which were made would be so hedged with conditions as to be tautologous. If aerenchyma are the only means whereby plants can colonise wet habitats, and this would not be easy to prove, and if there were no plants living there at a particular time, all that could be predicted would be that unless some mutants with aerenchyma turned up those areas would remain without plant life. Of course it could be claimed that the process of evolution is long enough for almost all possible mutations to arise, but this again is not like a prediction in physics. However this differ- ence between physics and biology is of no help to the anti-reductionist case, for what would be required would be</page><page sequence="34">52 II---A. R. MANSER not just functionalism but a full-bodied teleology which seriously maintained that organisms had goals and strove to fulfil them. In fact there is no place for a 'functional biology'. Functional statements are necessary in explaining machines and other human products, and are there genuinely explanatory because they have human purposes as their foundation, purposes which are normally too obvious to need mention. If a biologist does not wish to accept an external teleology, he is forced to accept something like the Darwinian account of evolution which has given a method of explaining not the functions of organs but rather the causes of the presence of such organs and has thereby removed the need for functional statements except as a con- venient short-hand device.
