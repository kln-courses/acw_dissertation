      <p>Capybaras capture the imagination because of their unusually large body size (for a rodent) and piglike appearance. Scientifically, the capybara's semiaquatic lifestyle, social organization, and tendency to harbor diverse parasites make them good study organisms for various questions. Economically, capybaras are an important source of income in Colombia and Venezuela. Thus, the comprehensive review of capybaras presented in this book is warranted.</p>
      <p>The author uses the scientific literature and personal observations to discuss a wide range of topics, including anatomy and physiology, behavior, natural history, and conservation. Lord also includes data from a longterm census study in Venezuela. The incorporation of such a breadth of information, personal experiences, and original data is a strength of the book.</p>
      <p>In an attempt to reach a broad audience, however, this volume may not completely satisfy any audience in particular. Scientific readers will be disappointed with the lack of rigor in the treatment of data and use of anthropomorphic language. Casual readers will appreciate the unique characteristics of capybaras and the author's enthusiasm. However, regardless of scientific background, most readers will lose focus of the message because of Lord's tendency to use scientific terms without defining them and his overly descriptive writing style. Moreover, the book is poorly organized and lacks continuity. The writing is redundant with frequent referrals to preceding and future chapters. In particular, Chapter 3 does not flow well and includes information that should be in other chapters. For example, the lens technique, an interesting method of estimating an individual's age, is discussed in the context of mortality in Chapter 3. The details of the technique are not introduced until Chapter 5, leading to some confusion. Additionally, the topic of mortality is out of context in Chapter 3 and should have been introduced in Chapter 5.</p>
      <p>Despite its significant weaknesses, this volume could be a good starting point for scientists looking for background information and literature on capybaras. The book includes a thorough reference list and helpful index, allowing readers to find information without getting lost in the text.</p>
