This development has also influenced recent academic approaches towards the study of 'rock-art' of people living as hunter and gatherers or in a hunting and gathering tradition. We argue here that attempts in this direction so far are generally compromised, because they fail to take Indigenous philosophies and intellectual contributions seriously. Any concern with Indigenous material expressions, including so-called rock-art, has to involve a critical re-assessment of academic discourse itself and a challenge to the primacy of Western scientific and literary, academic methodologies. With reference to the 'rock-art' and the world-view of the Ngarinyin (Kimberley, Northwest Australia), we present some preliminary thoughts for the development of an alternative interpretative framework, while offering a (much needed) legitimacy to another more balanced epistemology. Keywords Rock-art • Australia • Animism • Ontologies • Phenomenology Introduction 'Animism' is usually defined as the belief that inanimate objects are animated by some life-energy, that they can act like 'persons' and participate in social interactions. Furthermore, it is also used to describe the belief in non-human persons, such as spirits that "possess souls, life-force and qualities of personhood H. R.

E. B. Tylor introduced animism in this form in the nineteenth century. Tylor (1871) regarded 'animism' as a primitive, childish and false mode of thought and the original form of religion. This understanding of 'animism' played an integral part in the social evolutionistic construction of human history and humanity's assumed progressive cognitive development (Kuper 1988). Despite these problematic connotations basic elements of Tylor's version of 'animism' have remained intact for the larger part of the twentieth century (Bird- David 1999, p. S68). In the field of anthropology and hunter-gatherer studies, N. Bird-David started a new phase of engaging with this topic in the late 1990s, most prominently through a number of contributions based on her own field work among the Indian Nayaka and comparative studies (e.g. Bird-David 1990, 1992a, b). She suggested that it is not knowledge of the economic practices of hunting and gathering that affords a fundamental understanding of the life of these people. Rather, she argued for an understanding of their much more inclusive attitude towards the whole environment based on principles of 'sharing' and 'giving' that include humans, animals, plants and other (spiritual) agents. It is therefore this 'culturalist' element (Bird-David 1992b) that gives hunter-gatherer groups social stability and cohesion even while engaging in different economic activities. This general line of argument was further developed in the revisiting of Tylor's concept of 'animism' by Bird-David (1999) as a primitive mode of human thought. Here, she comes to the conclusion that 'animism' has to be understood as an expression of a relational idea of human-environmental relationships. These arguments were built on earlier contributions and ideas, such as the concept of the 'dividual' developed by Strathern (1988, p. 68) that denotes "a person constituted of relationships" and which is set in opposition to the Western concept of the individual. Bird-David also integrated elements of 'ecological approach to visual perception' by Gibson (1979) and the view of 'affordances' by Ingold (1992) in the establishment of human- environmental relationships. She also drew attention to conceptual links with the analysis by Holloway (1960) of Ojibwa ontology, behaviour and world- view. Bird- David's conceptual and comparative engagement with the most widely accepted understanding of 'animism' marks a crucial turning point in the discussion about the subject, because it shifted the attention explicitly to the importance of ontological and epistemological issues in dealing with non- Western people in general and hunting and gathering people in particular. 'Animism' could no longer be viewed in isolation and without questioning basic assumptions about human-environment relationships, perception, knowledge and epistemological procedures. In recent years, some of these themes have become popular in archaeological contexts and debates in an attempt to question Western and Cartesian notions in the scientific discourse. For example, one line of exploration takes the notion of 'materiality' as a central focus to break down the Cartesian distinction between mind and matter (DeMarrais et al. 2004). Another line of enquiry reviews the similarities and differences between 'art and archaeology' (Renfrew et al. 2004) in an attempt to integrate elements of subjectivism and indeterminism into academic archaeological theories and methods. Within this field of unstable boundaries between the material and the mental, the animate and inanimate, and actors and reactive materials, it is perhaps not surprising that a new interest has developed in archaeology in the non- Western concept of 'animism' and the relational ontological concepts that have Ô Springer</page><page sequence="3">'Rock-art', 'Animism' and Two-way Thinking 163 become attached to it (Alberti and Marshall 2009; Brown and Walker 2008; Groleau 2009; Haber 2009; Helvenston and Hodgson 2010; Wallis 2009; Zedeño 2009). For the field of hunter-gatherer and rock-art studies, Dowson (2009) has recently argued that 'animism' can also integrate the concept of 'shamanism' and can therefore dissolve issues that have plagued discussions about the reading of hunter-gatherer rock-art for more than two decades. To a certain extent, 'animism', in its updated and recent form, seems to be currently regarded as a most valuable concept to approach non- Western material expressions and practices by an increasing number of authors. In this contribution, we want to critically examine these developments and their value in the context of understanding hunter-gatherer rock-art, imagery and material culture. We recognise that the developments mentioned above represent significant avenues towards a more appropriate acknowledgement, appreciation and under- standing of the practices and material culture of people in a hunting and gathering tradition. They are especially relevant in opposition to the widespread evolutionary- ecological approaches that traditionally dominate hunter-gatherer archaeology and anthropology as well as Palaeolithic archaeology (Gamble and Porr 2005; Kelly 1995; Panter-Brick et al. 2001; Porr 2001). However, in this contribution we want to draw attention to the fact that these views also contain the danger of a fetishization of an animistic hunter-gatherer world-view as a distinct and essential mode of thought that represents an alien way of perceiving and experiencing the world. By this means, contemporary knowledge holders of this world-view are excluded from participation in the generation of knowledge and insights that is assumed by academics to be connected to academic writing, theoretical frameworks and methodologies. We therefore argue that most of the theoretical developments mentioned above fail to recognise the fondamental challenges that are involved in adopting a relational epistemology in their analyses and in accepting and acknowledging a relational Indigenous world-view or philosophy in opposition to an essentialist understanding in the Western Cartesian tradition. These challenges not only relate to methodological issues in a narrow sense of the term, but they have to have a deep impact on the discourse itself in which we present and represent the results of our engagement with the material evidence, its meanings and its connections with practices and ideas (Clifford and Marcus 1986; James et al. 1997; Marcus and Fischer 1986). We illustrate our argument with reference to an understanding of the world-view, philosophy and metaphysics of the Ngarinyin of the Kimberley (Northwest Australia) and how these are imbricated in visual and material representations. However, it is our explicit aim to present these views not as being elucidated purely by our modern and anthropological methodology and theoretical framework; rather, we attempt to show that the insights that Indigenous viewpoints offer have to be taken seriously in a more flexible, more inclusive framework. We argue for a dialectical and complementary approach in this context; an approach that recognises the validity of Indigenous viewpoints to contribute to the understanding of human material expressions in their own right. Furthermore, we acknowledge the necessity to introduce a phenomenological element into our discussion, which is a consequence of the importance of situated and corporeal experience. Therefore, this paper consists of alternating parts, each reflecting the contextual experience and discourse of the writer. While Porr conforms to the conventions and standards of fì Springer</page><page sequence="4">164 Porr and Bell academic discourse, Bell invokes the flexibility of the phenomenological discourse in creative non-fiction to represent direct experience. This structure should emphasise that we do not argue for the abandonment of Western scientific methods and theories, but rather for a complementarity and dialogue between Western and Indigenous viewpoints. We regard this mutual enrichment as an important element of the anthropological or archaeological endeavour in the field of engagement with hunting and gathering people that has been somewhat neglected. We can also make the observation that in many respects Indigenous contributions and views have much in common with particular Western strands of social theoretical and philosophical thought. As we will discuss below, within the fields of anthropology and hunter-gatherer studies Tim Ingold (e.g. 2000) has made a number of highly significant contributions in this respect and the implications of these have yet to be fully taken into account in the respective academic discussions. However, we also think that his work stops short of providing insights that can be gained by integrating views and expressions beyond academic forms of expression and discourse. To ' cross the bridge ' as it were , into the world of the hunter-gatherer needs another kind of discourse. I offer an alternative epistemology that echoes the Goethean phenomenological way of knowing because it is most reflective of the way my Ngarinyin friends experience being in the world. This participatory epistemology legitimises the role of imagination and intuition in the experience of ' knowing and contributes to a holistic world-view by providing knowledge that is attuned within the physical-metaphysical world. It is an epistemology that focuses on process and relationship and allows for intuitive perception of direct knowledge of the world ' (Wahl 2005, p. 59). This approach converges with the observation that the Ngarinyin imaginatively perceive the form of phenomena as 'an expression of the process of its own transformation , moving through its history to its present and into its future ' (Wahl 2005, p. 65). My second reason for departing from the conventions of academic or scientific writing is that it silences the Indigenous voice. The academic disciplines of archaeology and anthropology do not exist in hunter-gatherer cultures ; in fact , the concept and institution of 'an academy ' does not exist. This is not to presume that hunters and gatherers do not observe , analyse and synthesise information relating to what Westerners call archaeology and anthropology, because they most assuredly do. However such knowledge is reckoned for different reasons, by different means, and in different contexts. Tribal knowledge holders are acknowledged and respected for their knowledge , role and function within their own social group ; however there is no self contained, discrete institution that presumes to prescribe, define, control and accredit cultural knowledge according to selectively crafted rules and conventions that validate an elite, while simultaneously excluding all other knowledge holders and the means by which they acquire knowledge. A consequence of the absence of an equivalent institutional accreditation system is that hunter- gatherer knowledge holders are culturally and structurally excluded from participating as equals in Western academic discourse ; their status is at best, one of trusted informant, and at worst, dismissed as unreliable witness. Their Ф Springer</page><page sequence="5">'Rock-art', 'Animism* and Two-way Thinking 165 knowledge , offered in trust to academic inquirers, is re-languaged to conform to specific methodological conventions and protocols in order to privilege the recipient and his/her institutional context. By this culturally determined means, Western inquiry and thought structurally and permanently objectifies hunter- gatherer ontology and its epistemology, thereby maintaining its own primacy as the only valid and legitimate repository and conveyor of knowledge. Once translated into the acceptable languages and methodologies embedded in (often competitive) academic discourses, properly accredited Western knowledge-seekers focus on their own area of interest, in which they (hopefully) gain broad acknowledgement for their exploration and under- standing of a fragment of knowledge gleaned from the subject of inquiry. The following dialogue demonstrates a typical Ngarinyin experience of Westerner curiosity and its inherent epistemology. The context was informal, set in a sociable gathering of visitors and Bush University teachers in the remote Maranbabiddi camp deep in the Gardner Plateau of the Kimberley region of Western Australia. Ngarinyin teachers were always obliging and generous in their responses ; however, it is the embedded ideologies in the questions on the one hand, and the equally embedded Ngarinyin ontology and epistemology on the other that is of interest here (Bell 2009, pp. 54-55): Bush University guest/academic: Question to a group of Ngarinyin men and women. In your culture are men the head of the house- you know ... boss? Old Man: We boss. Old Woman: He boss ... only ' e don't know anything. Womans ... we living water. We tell 4m. He gotta listen. Q: Is that right? (to Old Man) Is that how it works? Old Man: We gotta listen to her. She our Mother. We fear those womans (laughter). She make us sick if we don 't listen. Get sores. Ulcers. Q: Do you believe in God? Old Man: Missionary gave us God ... we believe that God, little baby Jesus .... yeah, 'e orright. We got dance for that li'l baby. Mowaljarlai: Y' see that Christian God, Jesus, 'e come from wunggud. I know that thing. One time I'm in hospital ... really sick ... and I'm see Jesus. I'm see the whole company of heaven. There was hangels descending and upsending in light ... the whole glory of God. It was really beautiful ! Gala we call that thing. That light. But you know ...we don 't have that milli milli ... that Bible. Our law ... 'e written in the land. Nobody can write that story ... 'e fixed in the land. We can 't change that story. That s our law. Q: How do you feel when researchers come and ask you about your culture? Old Woman: Well, they write down all about our relations ... but we know already where we come from. I'm think they come to help us. But ... I dunno ... Why they do that? Old Man: We take 'em hunting, feed 'em up. Really good tucker. Those mob write 'im in little books. Write 'im down all 'a time! (laughter) Ô Springer</page><page sequence="6">166 Porr and Bell Mowaljarlai: You know one time that university mob come 'ere with millions of bags ... plastic ones like supermarket bags. They arks us, ' Can we catch your shit? ' (shrieks of laughter and shhh-ing) True story ! What they want our shit for!? Eh ... d 'they arks you? They arks me! My shit!!! (more hoots) ' You want my shit? I tell 'em. ' You got big bag? Cos I got really big shit! ' These sometimes-invasive questioning techniques reveal inherent preconceptions that render knowledge acquisition by experiential absorption all but impossible. Yet it is precisely this quality that most closely characterises ' hunter-gatherer being in the world'. For a culture whose people experience being alive as being in life itself who have no written language ; no concept of fiction, and no formal intellectual tradition, the Western ways of seeing and understanding are incomprehensible. Yet there can be no doubt that the concepts and under- standings, expressed in art, dance, body painting and lingo (Aboriginal English), convey a far-reaching and profound apprehension of the way the world works. Echoed in the sixth century ВС Heraclitean universal notion that the real world consists in a balanced adjustment of opposites in which lies a hidden harmony (because nature loves to hide), senior Ngarinyin lawman Bungal (David) Mowaljarlai reveals a profound understanding of the seen and unseen worlds, and comments on the process of knowledge acquisition: Learning to understand, travelling across large spaces, talking, listening, all that ... it's like sand between the stones in a dry river ...no water, no flow, no direction. You can't see it's a river (Bell 2009, p. 58). In the phenomenological grain my colleague and I discussed how this article might be written, and two seemingly incompatible cognitive processes and styles became evident. While both of us are framed in our Western cultural heritage, each of us has been shaped by our different experiences of living in the world. I have been immersed in Australian Indigenous (particularly Ngarinyin) culture and society for forty years, while my colleague's context has been predominantly Western-European culture, with his work now focused in its academic tradition. We therefore experience the world in two vastly different, sometimes opposing ontologica I and epistemological traditions. While our cultural conditioning and experiences are different, we converge in our interest in, and intention to explore the relationship between a particular Indigenous, hunter-gatherer society and their so-called rock art. The challenge has been to combine rigorous, objective, evidentiary, academic scholarship with authoritative, experiential, subjectively derived yet intellec- tually processed knowledge. I have opted to include the Indigenous voice, expressed in its own structure, style, syntax, and cadence, to speak for itself. I then explicate meaning from my own experience of shared time, place and space with the Ngarinyin, and the knowledge gained from this long-term experience of living in relationship. This approach represents a significant departure from conventional scholarly discourse; yet, by exploring a living hunter-gatherer society through personal relationship and experience, greater understanding of these societies in the deep past can be enhanced. Ф Springer</page><page sequence="7">'Rock-arť, 'Animism' and Two-way Thinking 167 The academy demands certain conventions be observed in the structure of a discourse. As is evident in my colleagues contribution to this article, scholars need to identify the focus of the discussion, summarise prior contributions that deal with the subject, demonstrate their insufficiency with quotes, justify the current discourse in terms of countering, adding or amplifying other positions, then develop the discourse itself with evidence and argument. This is conventionally achieved by presentation, and objective analysis, of evidence. Writing is almost always in the objective third person, the language of academic discourse. These conventions strangle the personal or experiential and Indigenous voices, both of which communicate in the first person, and with Indigenous, in the present tense. The use of present tense first person is fundamental to the oral tradition and the Indigenous way of being in the world; a world in which, not only past and future exist in a holographic map of existence, it includes the mythic realm. In speech, all Western grammatical rules are suspended ; 'hard' information, mythopoetic concepts and terms, and uniquely applied syntax mix and mingle seamlessly with eye focus, head tilt, body language, physical separation, not to mention subtle gesturing, cadence, pause and silence, and gender authority, to convey understanding. This communication style and speech pattern presumes face- to-face connection; to simply take a transcript of the actual words is to leave out significant content and depth of the communiqué. Presence is necessary in the present. In his discussion on the Goethean approach to science, Craig Holdrege suggests the use of the metaphor of conversation as it ' brings to consciousness that doing science is a back-and-forth between partners in an ongoing process', and that 'Nature is my partner in the conversation ... (it) is something in its own right' (Holdrege 2005, p. 31) . The relevance of this metaphor is brought to life in Mowaljarlai s early morning campfire new day reverie : I want to tell you about morning. ... When daylight starts, it wakes me up. ... It wakes the whole body. So I turn round and have a look. ... Morning gives you the flow of a new day - aah! ... the sun is coming up, with that glow that comes straight away in the morning. The colour comes towards me and the day is waiting. You have a feeling in your heart that you 're going to feed your body this day , get more knowledge. You go out now, see animals moving, a trees, a river. You are looking at nature and giving it your full attention ... Your vision has opened you and you start learning now. When you touch them, all things talk to you, give you their story ... (Mowaljarlai and Malnic 1993, p. 53). You understand that your mind has been opened to all those things because you are seeing them; because your presence and their presence meet together and you recognise each other. These things recognise you. They give their wisdom and their understanding to you when you come close to them (Mowaljarlai and Malnic 1993, p. 54). Ф Springer</page><page sequence="8">168 Porr and Bell Here, Mowaljarlai is enjoying a face-to-face conversation with the day and all it holds. At the same time he is revealing Ngarinyin ontology ; which might be called animism , and more importantly ; the means by which their epistemology is developed. He listens to the day ; attributes nature with the ability to communicate , and claims living relationship with all elements and processes within his habitat. As Holdrege acknowledges , 'through the weaving interplay of focused observation and open awareness you come to know the phenomena (Holdrege 2005, p. 35). The ontology ; which is fundamentally premised on being fully present in the present , relies on prior experience, sensory and extrasensory responses including observation, and openness to the gestures of non-human others who share being in the world. 4 Animism' in Archaeology. Recent Approaches Most recently, two major archaeological journals have published special issues dedicated to the topics of 'subjects, objects and alternative ontologies' and 'archaeology, animism and non-human agents' respectively (Alberti and Bray 2009; Brown and Walker 2008). Together with another recent contribution on the subject of 'animism' (Helvenston and Hodgson 2010), we want to use these examples to critically discuss current views on the subject in archaeology and their implications for future work and interpretations. Subsequently, we will relate these issues to hunter-gatherer and 'rock-art' studies and develop suggestions for a more balanced and richer epistemology. In their introduction to a special issue of the Journal of Archaeological Method and Theory , Brown and Walker (2008, p. 297) define 'animism' as "an ontology in which objects and other non-human beings possess souls, life-force and qualities of personhood". The authors acknowledge that this understanding can be traced back to Ту lor (1871) and his book Primitive Culture. According to the authors, the importance of the notion for archaeological thinking today is twofold. First, a lot of ethnographically known people seem to integrate some forms of 'animism' into their lives, rituals and thinking. Consequently, it is very likely that people in the past did the same and archaeology needs to take this into account in explanatory models. Second, ethnographically known descriptions of 'animistic' belief systems or those that integrate non-human agencies provide cases for a re-evaluation of fundamental notions and dualisms of Western intellectual thinking "that slice apart animistic, relational, and indigenous perspectives, and, in the process, devalues peoples' lived experiences" (Brown and Walker 2008, p. 297). 'Animism' in the definition above is important for archaeology, because the subjects that are studied or have produced archaeological remains were guided by 'animistic' beliefs and this would have resulted in particular patterns in the archaeological record. As the focus of archaeology is material culture, the authors also identify 'object agency and animacy' as the most important aspects that were discussed by the authors in the volume. These two concepts would help "to identify archaeological patterns not recognised in other theoretical perspectives" (Brown and Walker 2008, p. 298). At least in this introductory chapter, the idea of 'animism' that is proposed here seems Ф Springer</page><page sequence="9">'Rock-art', 'Animism' and Two-way Thinking 169 to be comparable to Tylor's original proposition. It is understood as a distinctive non- Western cognitive framework, in which it is accepted that certain inanimate objects are infused with life or energy and are consequently treated accordingly. As such, this attitude needs to be taken into account in the systematic analysis of archaeological remains. The individual authors in the issue all draw their case studies from American contexts. Zedeño (2008) explores the roles and interactions of ceremonial bundles of objects among the North American Blackfoot. She views these complex objects in relation to their potential to either 'incite or modify human behaviour' (agency) or their potential to possess 'life force or soul and conditions for personhood (animacy)'. The author discusses different forms and classes of objects (bundles), which mediate social relationships in different ways. The cases can be described as examples that could help archaeologists to "bridge the gap between Western and non-Western ontologies by expanding and reformulating the study of material culture" (Zedeño 2009, p. 376). Direct statements by Indigenous informants are absent from her analysis. Mills and Ferguson (2008, p. 338) relate their understanding of 'animism' directly to E. B. Tylor's "pioneering work" and define it as "attributing spirits (foundational sentient agency) to materials", whereas 'spirits' are viewed as "mental models of reality to which the imagination has granted volition". These statements seem already to imply that the authors draw a dichotomous distinction between material and mental phenomena and also distinguish between 'reality' and 'imagination' in the context of animistic beliefs. The authors provide a detailed account of 'shell trumpets and ritual networks in the Greater Southwest'; their analysis combines ethnographic, ethnohistorical and archaeological evidence to show the role of shell trumpets in rituals and ritual exchanges. It consequently remains on a formal objectified level and the concluding remarks on 'material signatures of nonhuman agency' (Mills and Ferguson 2008, p. 355) remain rather vague. Their assertion that "objects that are considered animate are imbued with special qualities through their incorporation into practices that attribute powerful forces to objects" demonstrates their conviction into the Western dualistic thinking and that objects cannot 'really' be animate and active. In this sense, all authors mentioned seem to subscribe to a Tylorian version of animism and the methods by which this belief system can be analysed and objectified. They are firmly situated within a dualistic framework that distinguishes between mental and material phenomena that cannot be blurred. Therefore, for all contributors 'animism' is understood in a dualistic fashion in which a mental (or spiritual) quality is added by Indigenous non- Western people to a material entity that actually does not have this quality. There is a clear tendency to imply that these Indigenous views are indeed imaginative but ultimately false beliefs because they inappropriately mix 'real' categories such as 'alive' (beings) and 'dead' (materials, matter). Similarly, in a recent article (Helvenston and Hodgson 2010) 'animism' is also ultimately seen as a system of thought that is in need of explanation in opposition to other supposedly more objective ones (such as the Western analytical). 'Animism' is here viewed from an evolutionary neuropsychological perspective and "primordial animistic beliefs will thus be considered by way of deep elemental roots of evolutionary biology in relation to perception/response systems" (Helvenston and Ô Springer</page><page sequence="10">170 Porr and Bell Hodgson 2010, p. 61). Here the authors are apparently content with agreeing that their own definition of 'animism' is consistent with the views put forward by Tylor (1871), Hallo way (1960), Bird-David (1999) and Guthrie (Guthrie 1993), who in fact propose vastly different concepts and respective methodologies. In the end, the 'technically complex' argument boils down to a version of a neo-Darwinian 'false- hypothesis' argument, which suggests that it is safer for an organism to hypothesize something in the environment as 'alive' (and potentially dangerous) rather than assume it is 'dead' (Helvenston and Hodgson 2010, p. 71). This assertion rests on a particular definition of what it means to be 'alive' and the assumption that this distinction can indeed be correctly made in a universal sense. In this sense and despite different claims, they consequently also see animistic beliefs as a specific set of cognitive mechanisms that have "a very archaic provenance in relation to the biological and cultural evolution of Homo sapiens " (Helvenston and Hodgson 2010, p. 63). 'Animistic' views are consequently not a product of conscious reflexion and rational thought, but atavistic, basic responses to early evolutionary pressures. While the above-mentioned authors openly or inadvertently reproduce social evolutionistic ideas of the nineteenth century, which place objective scientific methods above other ways of thinking, the concept of 'animism' has also recently been used to critically review and question some of the foundations of Western thought. In an interesting testimony to the malleability of the concept, the editors of a special section of the Cambridge Archaeological Journal (Alberti and Bray 2009, p. 337) state in their introduction that this section is supposed "to actuate the idea of animism as a way to think through core theoretical issues in archaeology around the nature of matter, ontology and agency". In doing so, they position their contributions in opposition to the special issue of the Journal of Archaeological Method and Theory mentioned above, "which aimed to identify material signatures of animist practices in the archaeological record". The editors identify "four main themes that cross-cut the individual contributions: (1) what to do about modern 'dualisms'; (2) the nature of relational ontologies; (3) the problematic of 'object agency'; (4) and the methodological implications of researching relational and other ontologies" (Alberti and Bray 2009, p. 338). The authors take their inspiration from a number of authors in anthropology and sociology, most prominently Tim Ingold, Eduardo Viveiros de Castro, Philippe Descola and Bruno Latour. Despite some crucial differences, these authors share a common interest in the foundations of non- Western ways of knowledge and the consequences for Western scientific and academic thought. They take issue with a number of fundamental assumptions of the latter, such as the distinctions between nature and culture, subject and object or mind and matter. These authors consequently are critical of the Western and modern essentialist orientation towards reality and aim to replace it with a 'relational ontology' (and respective epistemology), which are supposedly prevalent in non- Western contexts. Alberti and Bray (2009, p. 338) are therefore confident to state that "animism is now commonly understood to refer to a way of engaging with the world that is ontologically distinct from that of 'the moderns'". However, one of the main and influential proponents of this strand, Bruno Latour, did not actually develop his relational perspective of unclear boundaries between objects and subjects along non- Western systems of thought, but through an analysis of the sociology and history of Western science and society. Latour (1991, 1993) Springer</page><page sequence="11">'Rock-art', 'Animism' and Two-way Thinking 171 formulated the challenging statement some twenty years ago that 'modern' society and science have indeed 'never been modern'. In this respective work and subsequently Latour (1999, 2005) argued that even in so-called modern societies 'no a priori distinction can be made between persons and non-persons when considering the constitution of society', while 'objects need to be treated as equal partners in the constitution of society and the production of agency' (Alberti and Bray 2009, p. 340). Latour indeed argues that the Western distinctions and dualisms between objects and subjects, nature and culture are but illusions and a product of the restrictive Western scientific world-view. In the end, we are all relationally constituted and this is indeed what other authors, such as Ingold (2004, 2006a), argue as well in this context. How can a boundary between 'modern' and 'non- modern' societies be upheld? Indeed, it cannot. If one accepts a relational ontological framework in which relations and processes of becoming take pre-eminence over fixed entities, then a distinction between 'modern' and 'non-modem' or 'Western' or 'non-Western' becomes meaningless. Consequently, in perpetuating the view that 'animism' is just the world-view of non- Western people, the archaeological and anthropological endeavour only continues to reproduce the divisions of the social evolutionist project of the nineteenth century, which claimed to be able to objectify and explain other people's being-in-the-world. The relational perspective on the formation of the social is not another type of method. It leads towards 'perspectivism' and accepting that knowledge is local and dependent on local embodied conditions of knowledge acquisition. It is indeed an epistemological 'bomb' that threatens the foundations of the Western universal scientific endeavour (Latour 2009). 'Animism' and the Study of Hunter-Gatherer Rock-art. Recent Approaches Hunting and gathering people hold a special position in Western history and thinking (e.g. Barnard 2004) because of their apparent 'closeness' to nature. While the engagement with hunters and gatherers has undergone much change in past centuries, approaches in the last decades have been mostly dominated by ecological frameworks, which are inspired by evolutionary biology (Bettinger 1991; Binford 2001; Kelly 1995). We agree with Ingold (e.g. 2000, pp. 27-39) that the narrow current biological paradigm has to be rejected, because it leads to a range of contradictions and inconsistencies in dealing with the variety and complexity of human life. While this orientation has a number of theoretical consequences that cannot be adequately addressed in this contribution, we want to stress here the profound consequences for excluding the authority of hunting and gathering people themselves and their viewpoints in academic contexts and discourses. For example, neither the extensive treatment of global 'diversity in hunter-gatherer life ways' by Kelly (1995) nor the monumental 'Constructing frames of reference' by Binford (2001) contains any direct statement by a hunting and gathering person. As a consequence, local 'culture' and 'cultural goals' appear as distractions and distortions that can easily be left out of the analysis and subsequent presentation. Indigenous perspectives are implicitly perceived as secondary or irrelevant for understanding and explaining the actions of the people and their material culture. Ö Springer</page><page sequence="12">172 Porr and Bell Within the study of hunter-gatherer rock-art, approaches in the ecological tradition have also been strong (e.g. Barton et al. 1994; Gamble 1991; Jochim 1983; Mithen 1991). The whole field itself is, of course, structured by the fact that, for most of the rock-art that was made by hunters and gatherers, no direct oral accounts are available. Most prominently, this latter category contains the famous Palaeolithic parietal and mobiliáry art from Pleistocene Europe. Nevertheless, this situation apparently has not obstructed the development of approaches that cover a wide range of anthropological theories (e.g. Clottes 1998; Conkey 1989, 1997; Conkey et al. 1997; Sauvet et al. 2009). In recent years, the 'shamanistic' or 'altered states of consciousness' perspective gained considerable support and influence, although it also drew fierce criticism. Using ethnohistorical Indigenous accounts, this approach was originally developed to understand rock-art imagery of the Southern African Bushmen, but it was subsequently extended to different parts of the world and bodies of rock-art, such as the parietal and mobiliáry Palaeolithic art of Europe (Dowson and Porr 2001; Lewis- Williams 2004; Lewis-Williams and Dowson 1988). There can be little doubt that the shamanistic hypothesis has been very valuable in drawing attention to the need to interpret rock-art and other artistic expressions in relation to variable cultural concepts that also include differential perceptions of the environment. More recently, the concept has been expanded to include other societies and their rock-art (Lewis-Williams 2010; Lewis- Williams and Pearce 2002) and has moved beyond linking 'hunter-gatherers' and 'shamanism'. However, it also needs to be recognised that the shamanistic hypothesis continues to contain problematic mechanistic and essentialist elements that in our view distort the reading of the evidence. The transfer from the Southern African to European Palaeolithic contexts was made possible by the hypothesis that, in shamanistic imagery, universal features of the human brain are expressed that are experienced during different forms of trance. In this sense, the original formulation of the shamanistic hypothesis proposes a mechanistic and dualistic view of the human mind and body. As one of the main original proponents of the shamanistic hypothesis Dowson has recently expressed dissatisfaction with this theory and has also stated that it was unsuccessful because it "did not go far enough in eschewing our essentialist notions of shamanism, notions that are founded in Cartesian principles of being in the world" (Dowson 2009, p. 379). He consequently calls for a radical re-evaluation of the concept of 'shamanism', which "must have at its core a critical reappraisal of how the shaman operates within so-called 'indigenous' ontologies" (Dowson 2009, p. 379). The 'solution' in this case involves a rethinking of 'shamanism' as a reflection of a much more encompassing attitude towards the world that is "not predicated on the divide between nature and culture (or subject and object)" and within 'hunter-gatherer ontologies' in which "intentionality and reflexive consciousness are not said to be exclusive attributes of humanity but are available to all human and non-human beings in the universe" (Dowson 2009, p. 380). Dowson concludes with the assertion that he agrees with the 'persuasive argument' of Ingold (2000) that "there is a hunter-gatherer way of perceiving the environment that is quite different to the Western way of thinking about nature and culture" (Dowson 2009, p. 384). However, this "hunter- gatherer way of being cannot be formulated into a general framework that allows us to predict or determine the exact nature of co-existences of specific human and non- Ô Springer</page><page sequence="13">'Rock-art', 'Animism' and Two-way Thinking 1 73 human beings in their environment" (Dowson 2009, p. 384). The acceptance of this position consequently allows removing 'Western ontologies from our constructions of hunter-gatherers past and present and 'to escape the essentialist notions of hunter- gatherers that have prevailed thus far and produced global schemes of understanding' (Dowson 2009, p. 385). This conclusion, however, appears unconvincing and contradictory, because although Dowson claims to have overcome Western essentialism, he creates an essential category with his acceptance of a distinct 'hunter-gatherer way of being'. This 'way of being' is supposed to underlie the various expressions of hunter- gatherer rock-art, but remains itself untouched and original. Furthermore, the hunter- gatherer way of life and thinking is supposed to exist in opposition to Western thought in a dualistic manner. As Dowson does not question his own Western academic ways of the production of data, knowledge and discourse, his argument leaves the door open to explicitly or implicitly regarding the hunter-gatherer world- view as an pre-modern way of knowing or relating to the environment. Despite the very different intentions, this fetishization of the 'hunter-gatherer world-view' does not actually depart from the Tylorian vision of 'animism'. It effectively replaces one vision of an alien way of thinking with another, while leaving the actual assumption that this way of thinking can be objectified with Western scientific methods untouched. This cannot be regarded as a 're-animation of hunter-gatherer rock-art studies' as the author implies. Wallis (2009) has also recently argued for a 're-enchantment of rock-art landscapes' by engaging with 'animic ontologies, nonhuman agency and rhizomic personhood'. He makes more explicit reference towards the relational character of Indigenous ontologies and ways of knowing than Dowson. However, he also states that "'animic' ontologies conceive of certain material (culture or otherwise) as "alive" or more accurately with agency and personhood, a priori (to human cultural activation), and offer an effective disruption to the modern Western distinction between animate/inanimate, subject/object, what or who has agency, and conception of landscapes as straightforwardly encultured through rock art (and other human agency)" (Wallis 2009, p. 48). This view is of course similarly in danger of actually providing an essentialist version of 'animism' in dualistic opposition to Western ways of knowing and scientific practice. However, Wallis (2009, p. 62) also sees the uneasy relationships between the academic Western ways of knowing and Indigenous world-views as he acknowl- edges that the former clearly "disenfranchises indigenous epistemologies". He also quotes Graham Harvey to state that "[modernism] cannot succeed because our bodies and our material surroundings are resistant... [W]e have far too many experiences of the aliveness of the world and the importance of a diversity of life to fall in step completely with Cartesian modernity" (Wallis 2009, p. 62). Finally, he also refers to Latour (1993) and acknowledges that modernity is but an illusion because we also, as Western people and scientists, have indeed 'never been modern'. At the same time, Wallis (2009, p. 62) nevertheless keeps the distinction between 'animists' and 'us' in place. He argues that "while we are not required to be animists ourselves, engaging with animic relational epistemologies enables a broadening of the interpretative frame, theorizing how rock art is constituted, and theorizing the nature of embodiment, personhood, and materiality, as well as the active negotiation Ф Springer</page><page sequence="14">174 Porr and Bell of these in terms of agency and social relations (which are not restricted to humans)". The author apparently wants to have his cake and eat it at the same time. Both Dowson and Wallis are playing with the bomb of 'relational epistemologies' (see above) but they are not prepared to acknowledge the fundamental consequences for their own practice. In this context it is significant that both authors actually give no indication how the 'engagement with relational ontologies' should actually take place. It is unclear how both the realisation of the relational character of Indigenous ontologies as well as the relational foundations of our own existence should impact our methodologies and ways of expression within the academic discourse. In continuing the practice of academic discourse virtually unchanged, they both contradict their aims of 're-animation' and 're-enchantment' of rock-art and rock-art research because they in fact exclude exactly those ways of knowledge acquisition and expression that makes both possible. Earlier in this paper, I commented on the means by which Indigenous knowledge and the Indigenous voice are excluded as valid participants in academic discourse. John Shotter addresses this obliquely when he notes , 'something very special happens when living bodies interact with their surroundings, and that we have not (explicitly) taken this into account in our current forms of thought or institutional practices ' (Shotter 2003, p. 8). For those educated in the Western grammar and style (Shotter 2003, p. 9), it is often difficult to ' hear ' what is expressed in lingo, partly because it does not translate well to textual form, partly because it derives from a different, usually unexplained ontology, and partly because the epistemology is embedded in mythopoetic concepts when spoken. In other words, direct questions are rarely answered in a familiar grammar and style or even form . A response to a question may be a story that is sometimes described by the Western listener as a parable. In this perception they are wrong. The story is part of a much larger cosmology that in its own right reflects a fully coherent epistemology in which all beings, visible and invisible, are alive and enliven the animate world. This is ' law '. Law abides in language and literatures wherein story is not about the law. It is law. '... stories do not tell us what to do, externally ; but transform who we are, internally. And the most powerful, or perhaps the most complex and ambiguous, or perhaps again the most flexible, of these stories become ... a vibrating string which sets in motion a hundred harmonic frequencies whose connections have been built up over many generations ' (Manderson 2008, p. 5). In other words, law is a living, dynamic process in which all expressions of creation are participants. Immersion in the Ngarinyin world-view for almost 40 years has taught me to think 'two ways '. This is more than 'bicultural* because, rather than relying on the detached, often abstract intellectual thought processes that Western languages and discourse demand, the Ngarinyin way of seeing and interpret- ing the world is primarily sensory and experiential, and includes the imaginai and meditative. In Ngarinyin language, the world is communicated pictorially where each word conjures an image that relates to a story. For example, the meaning and use of the Ngarinyin word for caterpillar, 'guriwa', not only includes the grub itself but also the bag nest that contains it, and the story that Ô Springer</page><page sequence="15">'Rock-art', 'Animism' and Two-way Thinking 175 'if a young man passes near the nest his genitals will grow long and big like the nest itself, so they are to be avoided ' (Coate and Elkin, quoted in Bell 2009, p. 62). The way that Ngarinyin use their own language finds its way into spoken English, where rules of grammar, syntax and meaning are imbued with layers of meaning, often barely explicable. Similarly, the Ngarinyin use of the Standard English phrase, " There are always two ... " can be easily misunderstood to infer a discrete state of 'two -nes s ', an essentialist notion, whereas- in Aboriginal English, it means much more, hence my use of the ellipsis (...) instead of a full stop to signify its dynamic conceptual movement and meaning. In Aboriginal English it refers, not only to moiety, but also to, for example, gender and dynamic (changing through maturation) gender function, the activity of right and left brain function and handedness, balance in dynamic relations between and within the seen and unseen, the known and unknown and so on. Its meaning is fluid, dynamic and ultimately ineffable. I think in this 'lingo* in my interactions and movement in country with Ngarinyin family and friends. It generates a different experience altogether from the Western way; time warps, colours brighten, the mind s focus is, not on naming and classifying, or even on beauty or aesthetic appreciation, but on patterns, relationships, subtle energies, and food. We move slowly through the land, quietly, alert for sounds, cloud movement, sun position, smells, wind shifts, evidence of animal, insect and bird activity, the taste and texture of water, all the while observing the human relationship system s obligations in physical position, gender, age, authority, forms of address and much more. With the exception of danger warnings, communication is seldom spoken; rather it takes the form of pursed lips in a particular direction, a range of hand gestures, and eye messaging. If I ask a question, the walking stops. No meanderings of the mind into meanings or abstractions, issues, the past or the future are entertained. Walking is simply this; being mindfully, fully present in country. As Mowaljarlai told me, "When we walk, we walk. When we talk, we talk. That way you respect all your (non-human) relations ", while leaving some of yourself in the continuous processes and cycles of change. Rock-art Research as Cultural Critique The approach that we advocate in this contribution aims to take the challenge of Indigenous ways of knowing just as seriously as a critical re-evaluation of the Western scientific endeavour. In fact, both of these aims are inseparable, because they are different aspects of the acceptance and application of a relational constitution of the world überhaupt. In a sense, this has been recognised by most of the authors discussed above who have engaged with 'animism' and related approaches in sociology and anthropology. They have not, however, fully realized the wide reaching consequences for the academic discourse on different levels, including ways of representation and writing. This is of course a problematic development, because it undermines the critical dimension of adopting a relational perspective. In archaeological and prehistoric cases, such a failure might not appear Ô Springer</page><page sequence="16">176 Porr and Bell as particularly relevant because it remains within the mostly closed circles of academic discourse. As a consequence, material evidence will only be subjected to a restricted reading and understanding; however, an impoverished version of the past is created. Our Australian experience makes us acutely aware of the fact that the application of scientific procedures, methods and expressions with their intrinsic claim of universal truth often results in alienation of Indigenous people from their rock-art heritage. In the Kimberley, Northwest Australia, Indigenous imagery has been appropriated almost since the earliest colonial forays into the region, and this has continued ever since. The Kimberley has an extraordinary rich record of Aboriginal art forms that extends back tens of thousands of years. In the Kimberley, currently, the oldest known traces of artistic material expressions on the Australian continent are found. At Carpenter's Gap, a slab with red ochre pigment has been found in Pleistocene occupation levels and dated to ca. 41,000 BP (O'Connor and Fankhauser 2001). Furthermore, a very early example of personal ornamentation was also found in the Kimberley, which also points to the long-distance transport of these non-utilitarian objects during the Pleistocene (Balme 2000). In terms of figurative rock-art, the Kimberley contains one of the most complex records anywhere in the world, which in the Western academic dialectic is usually divided into the Wanjina- Wunggurr and the Gwion Gwion traditions. But it needs to be acknowledged that the overall sequence is much more rich and complex than this dualism suggests (e.g. Layton 1992; Morwood 2002). The Wanjina-Wunggurr tradition is the dominant expression of Indigenous figurative art in the region. It is restricted to the western and northern regions of the Kimberley and "specific to the Wororra, Ngarinyin and Wanumbal peoples who trace their own descent from Wanjina spirit ancestors" (Ryan and Akerman 1993, p. 10). Most recently, a Wanjina made from beeswax on a rock surface has been dated to 3780±60 BP (AMS Ref: OZC434; Morwood et al. 2010). As Wanjinas are still being painted and re-painted today it seems fair to say that this indeed forms one of the oldest continuous art traditions in the world. This does not, however, mean that the art, as well as the concepts, ideas, functions and relationships associated with it, remained unchanged over this time period. However, these past processes are so far virtually unknown. In contrast, more is known about the contemporary Indigenous meanings and narratives associated with these images as well as their relationships with the social landscape (Bell 2009; Blundell 2003; Blundell and Layton 1978; Blundell and Woolagoodja 2005; Crawford 1968; Layton 1985; Mowaljarlai and Malnic 1993; Petri 1954; Utemara and Vinnicombe 1992; Vinnicombe 1992; Vinnicombe and Mowaljarlai 1995). In the northwest and central Kimberley the Gwion Gwion art form is distributed and extends in the northeast beyond the Wanjina-Wunggurr cultural landscape. It mostly consists of slender, elegant human representations, depicted with consider- able detail and paraphernalia (e.g. spears, personal ornaments, hair dress etc.). These figures are now monochrome, although possibly this is a product of weathering processes. Stylistically, Gwion Gwion art would appear to be largely unrelated to Wanjina-Wunggurr art. The former very often depicts anthropomorphic figures engaged in a range of activities. The origins and the age of Gwion Gwion rock imagery is a topic of great contention. In 1997, radiometric dates were published from mud-wasp nests overlying human figures (which were superimposed on hand Ô Springer</page><page sequence="17">'Rock-art', 'Animism' and Two-way Thinking 177 stencils; Roberts et al 1997), which ranged between ca. 17,500 and 16,500 BP. This, of course, means that these forms of art were painted well before the last glacial maximum and considerably pre-date the Wanjina-Wunggurr tradition. However, these results have so far not been replicated for other examples of Gwion Gwion rock-art (Watchman et al. 1997). In the literature, a certain degree of uncertainty as well as confusion exists about the place of Gwion Gwion art in Kimberley Aboriginal mythology and narratives. It is frequently presumed that this form of art did not have the same significance as Wanjina-Wunggurr art, because evidence of regular retouching or repainting seem to be very rare. In addition, no accounts of these images feature in the nearly anthropological literature (Blundell and Woolagoodja 2005, p. 226). However, Aboriginal people do indeed have stories for these images. In some contexts, it is said that the imagery was made by a "gooyorn (small bird), occasionally seen fluttering along shelters and at the mouths of caves catching insects. Gooyorn is said to have pecked its beak on the rocks until it bled, then painted fine lines with the blood, using both its sharp beak tip and a feather from its tail. Other Wanumbal people point to the role of the Gwion Gwion as helpers of the Wanjina ancestral beings, to whom they are of secondary importance" (Ryan and Akerman 1993, p. 14). Therefore, while it seems to be clear today that Gwion Gwion rock paintings represent a very old artistic expression in the Kimberley that does not have the traditional dominance of the Wanjina-Wunggurr , they are indeed an integral part of the local social/physical universe or cosmogony. In the light of the available evidence of radiometric dates and superimpositions of rock-art, 'the focus of living connection certainly shifted long ago to the Wanjina , but the Gwion form an ever-present and living sense of identity for contemporary peoples in much the same way that the early paintings are overlaid by, but seldom entirely obscured by, the Wanjina ' (A. Redmond, in Blundell and Woolagoodja 2005, pp. 227-229) George Grey was the first European to write about Wanjina images and he also produced some remarkable drawings that have shaped the perception of this art for a considerable time. In March 1938 Grey came across paintings near the Glenelg River, which were later identified to be in Wororra and Ngarinyin territories (Elkin 1948). The identification of the actual rock paintings by Aboriginal elders finally also exposed the extent of George Grey's ethnocentrism in his interpretations (Donaldson 2007, pp. 6-7). In his 1841 report, he wrote that the 'paintings were far superior to what a savage race could be supposed to be capable of (quoted in Blundell and Woolagoodja 2005, p. 50). He experienced the paintings as an encounter with "something silent, nameless and unfathomable" (quoted in Ryan and Akerman 1993, p. 11). His descriptions and drawings emphasised in a fascinating manner his predispositions, which led him to search for resemblances and origins elsewhere. The sketch he presented seemed to show 'a robed and haloed priest, apparently of some recent foreign origin' (Arndt 1964, p. 161). One of the headdresses was supposed to contain traces of an ancient script (with distant resemblances to Hebrew). Grey's description produced many speculative theories in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries and Wanjina art was "deemed to be the product of a succession of alien cultures - Egyptian, Phoenician, Chinese, Japanese, Hindu - even to represent knights in armour or strange visitors from outer space" (Redmond 2002; Ryan and Akerman 1993, p. 1 1). It needs to be stressed that Springer</page><page sequence="18">178 Porr and Bell all these early authors made their statements without any fieldwork in the Kimberley and simply trusted Grey's report and drawings. Clearly, they were very comfortable to deny any link between the art and the Australian Aborigines, simply on the grounds of the accepted ideas about global human cultural evolution and the position of 'art' in this context. In Australia, the situation was further complicated by the prolonged legal fight for rights to land and resources between the state and vested interests on the one hand and traditional owners on the other. Redmond (2002) draws attention to the fact that, not only does European speculation about the origins of the Wanjina coincides with the time of the first hundred years of colonial occupation of the region; the revival of some of the more bizarre theories, such as "Von Däniken's (1969) populist 'science fiction' (and the 'New Age' incorporation of Indigenous religions into amalgams of the 'great traditions' that has followed it) emerged at the same historical moment that the question of Indigenous Australian land rights entered into the mainstream of Australian political life" (Redmond 2002, p. 56). However, from the 1970s onwards these ideas remained on the fringe of the debate as the number of ethnographic and Indigenous contributions grew that showed the relevance, complexity and longevity of the Wanjina-Wunggurr cultural complex. This situation has possibly contributed to a shift in European interest towards the other major art form, the Gwion Gwion , which became the focus of a similar intense debate in more recent decades. Joseph Bradshaw became the first European to see this as a distinctive class of rock-art and report about it at the General Meeting of the Royal Geographical Society of Australia in September 1891. The images subsequently became known as 'Bradshaw figures'. However, the traditional custodians of the rock paintings (Ngarinyin, Wororra, Wanumbal) refer to these images as Gwion Gwion (Döring 2000; e.g. Mowaljarlai and Malnic 1993). Joseph Bradshaw travelled west through the Kimberley in 1891 in search of suitable land for pastoral use. While he was not successful in this endeavour, he reported subsequently about different aspects of the country and the rock images he encountered. During his travel his party was constantly observed by Aboriginal men. Although no major confrontation developed, no contact was established either. Bradshaw (1892, p. 99) described the men as tattooed and painted and also mentioned their "imposing head-gears ... extending upwards and obliquely outwards from the top of [their] heads". During his investigation of rock shelters in the region of the Prince Regent River, he found "native paintings" of human figures, which were in some cases life-size, "the bodies and limbs very attenuated, and represented as having numerous tassel- shaped adornments appended to the hair, neck, waist, arms, and legs" (Bradshaw 1892, p. 100). He continued to emphasise that the "most remarkable fact in connection with these drawings is that wherever a profile face is shown the features are of the most pronounced aquiline type, quite different from those of any natives we encountered" and that "one might almost think himself viewing the painted walls of an ancient Egyptian temple" (Bradshaw 1892, p. 100). In contrast, he described other imagery that was painted over and alongside these paintings as 'crude forms'. Finally, he reported noticing "alphabetical characters, somewhat similar to those seen by Sir George Grey in nearly the same latitude, but many miles westwards on the Glenelg River" (Bradshaw 1892, p. 100). Ф Springer</page><page sequence="19">'Rock-arť, 'Animism' and Two-way Thinking 179 Obviously, Bradshaw was very aware of the findings of George Grey and his interpretations. He also appeared to imply that the 'Bradshaw figures' (so named after him) have their origins outside of Australia. It is interesting in this respect that Bradshaw did not notice the similarities between the paintings that he described and the adornment of the Aboriginal men he encountered. Although this is a field that still needs to be looked at more systematically, it is clear that in Gwion Gwion rock- art numerous references exist to material cultural items, as well as ritual paraphernalia of the local Indigenous groups (e.g. Redmond 2002, p. 58). One might suspect that Bradshaw's interpretation is a typical product of the dominant evolutionistic and racist narratives of the nineteenth century and suggest that they were put to rest in the course of the twentieth century. However, as was mentioned above, this is not the case, as crucial elements of this perspective were resurrected in the last decades and continue to play a role in recent conflicts about land rights and Native Title claims. For many years, research and recording of Gwion Gwion rock-art has largely been associated with the work of the late Grahame Walsh. Before he died in 2007, he amassed what is possibly the largest collection of photographs and recordings of Gwion Gwion rock-art, as well as publishing two visually stunning volumes on the subject (Walsh 1994, 2000). However, he was also the author of highly controversial interpretations of the Gwion Gwion , suggesting that they were the product of a pre- Aboriginal 'race' - an argument which potentially could have critical implications for Indigenous rights and Native Title in Australia, and places "Aboriginal people in the position of having to demonstrate cultural authenticity and legitimacy" (McNiven and Russell 1997, p. 807). The development and steadfast defence by Walsh (1994, 2000) of an explanatory scheme of Kimberley rock-art, which sought to locate Gwion Gwion rock-art outside of Aboriginal art traditions, garnered considerable national and international popular media attention (e.g. radio and television interviews). However, his failure to recognise the incredibly diverse nature of rock-art styles across Australia, explore other possibilities regarding cultural significance and/or stylistic links from within Australia, and consult with other Indigenous groups in the area resulted in a skewed interpretation of Gwion Gwion rock-art. Furthermore, Walsh's critics (Lewis 1997; McNiven and Russell 1997; Redmond 2002) have pointed out that the treatment of Gwion Gwion rock-art can be understood as part of a long tradition of disempowerment and alienation within a colonial and racist discourse. In a modern context, these ideas made an appearance in the argument by Walsh (1992) that no claim of Aboriginal descent could establish curatorial rights over cultural heritage that is supposed to belong to all humanity (Mowaljarlai et al. 1988). Walsh's views take on an additional dimension when they are placed in the post- colonial contexts of the socio-political environment in the Kimberley today. The latter is very much characterised by conflicts over the access to land and its use. The Australian Federal Court's recognition in 1992 of the possibility that Aboriginal groups can claim Native Title rights over their lands has lead to a large number of Native Title claims all over the continent. It needs to be stressed that Indigenous Australians can only achieve the recognition of Native Title over a particular tract of land if they can demonstrate a continuous and integral cultural association with it. It is clear that such a determination would be very difficult on different levels, Ô Springer</page><page sequence="20">180 Porr and Bell especially given the disruption of Aboriginal lives in the last 200 years, as well as considerable population displacements. Obviously, Aboriginal ontology and episte- mology revealed through oral histories, stories and narratives play the most important element in this context. In the Kimberley the existence and continuing relevance of rock-art for Ngarinyin, Worrora and Wanumbal people is a major factor in this context. Consequently, Walsh's claims of a disassociation of Aboriginal beliefs and Gwion Gwion rock-art take on a different significance, as his interpretation could have considerable detrimental consequences in the determina- tion of Aboriginal claims to their ancestral country (Redmond 2002, 2005). Walsh's work and the popular larrikin representation that he created of himself constitute a very interesting mosaic that fits very well into the imagination of certain groups of white Australians. There is a clear correspondence between the habitus that he presented and the theories that he put forward. He presented himself as the incarnation of the irreverent Australian 'white bushman' that sets out alone against the forces of nature to conquer the wilderness. This image has powerful meaning in the construction of white Australian identity (see Ward 2003). Walsh was also sometimes portrayed in opposition to academic archaeologists who often did not have the same depth and longevity of field experience (Schmidlin 2009). In this way, Walsh also transported a vision of nature and the wilderness as a foreign and distant place with hidden secrets and civilisations. While this view fits well into the Western imagination of nature (e.g. Cartolili 1993; Ingold 2000), it is completely alien to Indigenous Australians. As was outlined above, for Aboriginal Australians the Kimberley is familiar country with a well-known elaborate social and cultural geography. The latter, however, also needs to be seen in relation to different cultural and social restrictions that influence and order Aboriginal relationships and these are not immediately obvious or even accessible to the Western viewer. As Redmond (2002, p. 58) points out, the "importance of the Gwion to local cosmogony emerges most strongly in the restricted walungarri ritual context, since it was the Gwion who are said to have introduced the 'circle dance' for initiation, as well as the stone-tipped spear; a technology that is intimately bound into Ngarinyin concepts of 'making men' from boys". In addition, because Aboriginal informants attempt to protect culturally restricted knowledge, statements by them quoted in the literature cannot be taken at face value, they need to be carefully considered in their social and discursive context. For example, when asked about Gwion Gwion art, an Aboriginal elder is said to have remarked that these were 'rubbish paintings', but this could mean a number of different things. The term is sometimes used to describe "someone who is very old and maybe no longer active" but it can also mean "not dangerous, friendly" or even "someone who is too young and inexperienced for an important political role" (Redmond 2002, p. 58). Consequently, the combination of these factors with a particular cultural disposition and the willingness to misinterpret or be selective with respect to the available evidence can lead to serious misrepresentations. Walsh's ideas appear to be a dangerous romanticism that simplifies the complexity of the existing archaeological and ethnographic evidence. His search for an 'Erudite culture' that supposedly preceded the Wanjina-Wunggurr cultural complex (which was regarded by Walsh as artistically and culturally inferior) connects to a reductionist idea of culture in general. It also reflects a unilinear idea of cultural &amp; Springer</page><page sequence="21">'Rock-art', 'Animism' and Two-way Thinking 181 development that sees the ethnographic present as a degeneration of an imaginary Golden Age. In this sense, Walsh and his supporters became the victims of their own imaginations and narratives that they were following (Smith 2006; Wilson 2006). These examples make it clear that in the context of Australian rock-art, European interpretations have always tended towards dominating and ignoring Indigenous viewpoints. This is of course related to the colonial power relationships in which these developments have taken place, as well as the universal dominance and privileging of Western scientific thought. These structures have persisted until today and they are not limited to Australia, but are mirrored by similar developments in other colonial and epi-colonial contexts (e.g. in North America or Southern Africa; Nicholas and Andrews 1997; Ouzman 2005; Watkins 2005; Zimmerman 2001). The application of scientific methodology and discourse continues to exclude Indigenous people from participating in conversations and debate about the 'art'. In turn, any challenge to the narrow 'scientific' view of rock-art that takes seriously Indigenous viewpoints and philosophies as equally important and relevant perspectives, turns 'rock-art research' into a form of cultural critique that acknowledges that "rhetoric is itself an exercise in power" with the potential to deny 'subjects the right to express contrary views' (Marcus and Fischer 1986, p. 1). To apprehend the place rock images hold in Ngarinyin, Worrora and Wanumbal ontology and epistemology they have to be experienced in situ over time, with members of these language groups. To view images as merely paintings, or to research a particular type of image as a discrete form or expression taken out of its narrative context is to glean but a fragment of information about a major, coherent, continuous story of a living culture. When the Western epistemology classifies rock images as ' rock art' and studies it according to various academic disciplinary methodologies where the focus in Australia is predominantly on chronology, and materiality - the age of the paintings and the kinds of materials used in their execution, even to record the stories that attach to the images - the process subjugates the Indigenous narrative to an alien scrutiny that inevitably fragments meaning, and denies its contemporary relevance to their living relational ontology. In a public lecture, Mowaljarlai drew attention to the culturally different way of apprehending the images and their meanings. In an impassioned explanation of the place rock paintings have in his people's law and culture, he said, We have never thought of our rock paintings as 'Art'. To us they are images. IMAGES with ENERGIES that keep us ALIVE- EVERY PERSON, EVERYTHING WE STAND ON, ARE MADE FROM, EAT AND LIVE ON. Aborigines know that they stimulate the energies that bring increase and renewal by retouching sacred objects , painting or repainting, talking to the images, and dancing and singing at important sites. Instead of talking about 'Rock Art', we should be thinking about our responsibility to keep all things of Nature alive, to STIMULATE those places the way Aborigines have always done in the past.

We all come from the earth , live from the earth and go back to the earth. Unless we learn that and respect those sites, Nature and Man will get hopelessly sick or die. This is my statement about ' Rock Art '. (Mowaljarlai et al. 198 8^ The canon of paintings in caves and shelters of the Ngarinyin, Wororra and Wanumbal tribal lands is described as a timeless and living record of law and society in their culture, 'our copyright in the land '. Mowaljarlai asserts that the images are considered living evidence, and living communiqués of, not only natural law, but of the forces and energies that create, sustain and revitalise law (see above). Over tens of thousands of years, law is understood to have emerged in the form of paintings, rock arrangements, and nature itself. All these exist in an ever-changing, ever-adapting dynamic of relationships that need to be respected and renewed. Their conception comes from Wunguud. Ngarinyin ontology holds that cosmic law, or Wunggud, is latent consciousness ; a dynamic rather than an entity, which ' clones ', or projects the idea of itself into physical existence. It therefore infuses all implicit and explicit relationships, which are energetically connected in the medium of sacred water. The blueprint for human culture is implicit in cosmic law, and becomes a reflection and projection of it. Cosmic law defines the pattern of relation- ships on which human culture was founded. "We call this (cosmic law) 'Wunggud'. Wunggud was there before the world (the universe) began. Wunggud is the idea of creation, which made itself into Creation. Wunggud has no words ... it is beyond our understanding. " (Personal conversation with Bell, 1996) Images in grand galleries comprise layer upon layer of paintings, each layer representing the emergence of particular law in the life of the people. The most faded, sometimes buried images are of now-extinct animals and birds, then considered allowable food sources. Spirit-human figures called Gwion Gwion overlay these early images. These figures waft up rock faces, their shapes often following oxidized root stains, sometimes reflecting the shape and behaviour of local grass seeds or the heads of the ancient Livistonia Palm. Solitary images 'evolve' to pairs of figures, man and woman, and groups whose hands seem to be joined. In these latter images, there appear to be objects passing along the lines, and between groups of figures. This is said to signify the source and beginning of the law of sharing or social responsibility, and the beginning of inter - and intra-tribal ceremony. Right up to present time countrymen and women apply the same Gwion Gwion headdresses and other decoration for djumba or ceremony. Gwion Gwion also ' brought ' stone tool technology, spears and dilly bags, all created in images derived from the natural world. In this manner, a cohesive system of jurisprudence that embodies natural law gradually emerges. It is evident that the layering of paintings reflects change; Springer</page><page sequence="23">'Rock-art', 'Animism' and Two-way Thinking 183 amendment and repeal of older forms are overlaid or overpainted by new law. However the old is not deleted; it is absorbed into the new. As with all ancestral entities, the 'early ones ' retain their place in a living, continuous present. With the sharing system in place, tools and food resources established, ceremony and ritual determined, and the tribes all living in ' early ' law, 'reveal er s and teachers ' of ' modern ' law came to ' walk the earth ' and painted themselves in the shelters of their ' resting places' ("....became a painting.") This process marks many millennia in which these entities imprinted themselves in hundreds of caves and rock shelters throughout a discrete region of perhaps 200,000 square miles, plateau country surrounded by arid lands, islands and archipelagos, and the Indian Ocean. They represent independent, yet interactive powers that influence life on earth who 'paint (manifest) separately' in the landscape. Wunggud Snake, who forms and shapes the land, is especially associated with sacred waters of rivers, waterholes, and rainbows, the womb of the earth. Wanjina is the source of all rain/storms, regeneration, and ' increase ' in the food resource. These manifestations of Wanjina are also represented as a Chosen Animal and are important in the metaphysic and ceremony. Agula is a 'spirit ' presence who stalks and walks the earth, and travels 'between the worlds ', night and day, death and life, light and dark. Within Creation, people had to learn how to live together in land. The story of Wodoi and Djingun reveals the emergence of a highly sophisticated, comprehensive, and totally coherent ascription of Creation and culture into two powerful yet indivisible energies. With this story, the marriage relationship system came into being, and, after a grand meeting at the original Stone Table of human culture, the law of 'there are always two ... ' was ratified by the attendant Wanjinas, Chosen Animals, and humans. This comprehensive 'wunan law ' is applied, not only in the kinship/marriage system, but the land system, totemisation, or 'naming', and sex roles and functions within and between social groups. The law of wunan again reflects natural law (in the obvious and subtle characteristics and behaviours of plants, animals, weather systems etc.), and beyond that, cosmic law. Wunan can be seen as Wunggud incarnate. The story of Dumbi the Law Owl in rock paintings coincides with a period of time when there was some kind of catastrophic flood in the Kimberley, possibly within the last thousand years, possibly earlier. The Dumbi story reveals a new Law or covenant between the Wanjinas and his peoples, whereby the Wanjinas, having vented their anger at the corrupt behaviour of the young boys ' outright disobedience of their parents and the Law, drowns most of the tribesmen. They then promise never to take such drastic action again, however Agula would punish lawbreakers and their parents in secret and unexpected ways. Any attempt to extract from Ngarinyin a chronology on the emergence of law through the painted images is impossible because time is not measured or acknowledged as a linear construct. The best that can be achieved is to see time as a map that all past, present and future events inhabit contemporane- ously. Mowaljarlai might say, 'before our time', or simply 'before' to Ô Springer</page><page sequence="24">1 84 Porr and Bell contextualise an event in time , while still claiming it to be in the present. It is important to recognise this concept of 'timelessness' because it blurs the distinctions Western thought makes between the physical, metaphysical and imaginai According to Mowaljarlai, dream and dreaming, imagination and memories, physicality and the mythic, inhabit and are projections of The Dreaming. Rock-art Research in a Relational World In contrast to the various approaches that have been put forward in relation to 'rock- art' or 'animism', we propose an epistemology and methodology that rests on a relational understanding of the world in which relationships and processes take pre- eminence over fixed entities and essential qualities. This general orientation is in agreement with our experiences with Indigenous ways of knowing and being-in-the- world. Within the academic sphere, we believe that Tim Ingold (see below) has so far provided some of the most relevant contributions in this respect and below we will follow his argumentation in criticising 'animism' as an identifiable hunter- gatherer world-view. However, we also see some shortcomings in his work that are mostly connected in his failure to expand his analysis, methodology and writing to include phenomenological and experiential elements that in our view are crucial for the appreciation of Indigenous viewpoints. Furthermore, Indigenous views and concepts have to be included as independent and recognizable voices. Indigenous voices consequently cannot be simply excluded because they do not conform to the conventions of the academic discourse. Rather, they have to be understood, contextualised and taken seriously just as are contributions from within the academic field. We therefore argue for a complementary epistemology that equally integrates and recognises the potentials and limitations of different approaches of analysis and understanding. The most important elements of this project are a relational understanding of human existence and life, the relevance of perspective, experience and corporeal involvement in the world. The creation of a 'hunter-gatherer world- view' or 'animism' masks fundamental qualities of human existence and erects boundaries that are in fact based on an implicit essentialism and are therefore incompatible with a relational reading of the evidence. The way we present our arguments could be interpreted as cementing the divide that separates Indigenous and scientific or analytical ways of knowing. We would like to stress, however, that although we present different voices, we also demonstrate a number of convergences between them. In this way we hope to stimulate new forms of inquiry and dialogue while acknowledging that a lot needs to be done in this respect. It seems, nevertheless, of critical importance to expand the theoretical and methodological framework of archaeology and rock-art studies both because of ethical as well as epistemological considerations. At the moment, we believe that the most important task is to create spaces for informed and balanced dialogues in which the Indigenous voice has presence. This might in the future lead towards a transformed archaeology or a new 'third space' that seamlessly integrates Ô Springer</page><page sequence="25">'Rock-art', 'Animism' and Two-way Thinking 185 elements of Western and non- Western strands of thought (see below). The apparent convergences certainly seem to make such a development possible and it might be that Indigenous archaeologists and other researchers will particularly be able to move matters further into this direction (Carbaugh 2007; Harris 2005; Nakata 1998, 2002; Smith and Wobst 2005). In the following, we will follow recent arguments by Tim Ingold that will demonstrate that the adoption of a relational epistemology must lead to the rejection of an identifiable 'hunter-gatherer world-view' as an illusion of Western imagination. At the heart of the latter is the Western idea of essentialism, i.e. that the essence of any element can be found within its core. In contrast, Ingold proposes a relational perspective, where all elements are constituted by their specific relationships with each other. The inference is that human and non-human organisms are not simply specialised entities that develop according to codes of information that define them before their actual development. Rather, that their characters are developmentally dynamic, continuously constituting themselves actively within and with their environments. Clear-cut boundaries become redundant in such radical ecological thinking, especially boundaries between environment and organism. We concur with Ingold, that organisms in general become nodes of relational activity; micro-ecologies that are constantly shaping and reshaping themselves and their material surroundings. From this perspective, environments are not colonised or encountered, but inhabited and dwelled in (Ingold 2000). In the perspective of the dwelling organism, what does it mean to make and create objects, artefacts or art? At the centre of this understanding is a dynamic and active organism that is constantly in interaction with an equally dynamic environment. In this interchange, the boundaries between organism and environment become blurred, just as the distinctions between practitioner, tool and material as well as the acts of making and perceiving. This is exactly at the heart of the making of objects from materials in skilled practice. The term and the character of 'skill' are of particular importance in this context and for Ingold's arguments. To illustrate this in greater detail, Ingold (2006b) uses in one case the example of the sawing of a plank in the context of the making of a book case. On a superficial level, the act of sawing is, in its repetitiveness, very similar to the operation of a machine sawing planks from wood. However, "like going for a walk, sawing a plank has the character of a journey that proceeds from place to place, through a movement that - though rhythmic and repetitive - is never strictly monotonous" (Ingold 2006b, p. 67). Skill is here the ability to master this process in which the body reacts and adjusts continuously to the responses of the material. In turn, the material reacts to the actions of the human person so that both form an intimate dialogue, which will never be repeated in exactly this form. Skill is then not the use of a set of information about the external world and its materials. It is the ability to feel and find the right way through the always slightly different intricacies of a specific material. The above-mentioned comparison with the movement of walking is of course no coincidence. The act of making an artefact - sawing a plank - is just an extension of the character of organic involvement in the world that proceeds through time and through the environment. During every organism's journey through the environment, it becomes more and more skilled. This process might artificially be divided into different phases, but it does not have a strict beginning or an end. Tools and Ô Springer</page><page sequence="26">1 86 Porr and Bell artefacts, just like humans and organisms, have histories and narratives attached to them, which define their character in specific terms and not in relation to abstract functions. The skill of using a specific tool also means knowing about and being entangled in its history (Ingold 2006b, p. 71). In this sense, tools can also themselves be described as narratives, which reflect their origins, construction and creative uses. The generation of these stories are themselves poetic activities (Ingold 2000, pp. 406-419). "In the history of the Western world, however, the tactile and sensuous knowledge of line and surface that had guided practitioners through their varied and heterogeneous materials, like wayfarers through the terrain, gave way to an eye for geometrical form, conceived in the abstract in advance of its realisation in a now homogenised material medium" (Ingold 2010a, p. 92). It is certainly no accident that there is a close correspondence with a dualistic view of the body and the mind, where the mind holds and contains abstract concepts that are imposed onto the material environment in practice. However, the skilled practitioner does not impose a design onto the material. He or she enters into a dynamic dialogue with the material, in which both shape each other. In the skilled splitting of timber with an axe, the experienced woodsman has to navigate the Variable undulations and torsions of the fibres' and in doing so needs to be 'surrendering to the wood and following where it leads' (Deleuze and Guattari, quoted in Ingold 2010a, p. 92). Making and producing things is therefore not about bringing together ideal form and specific matter, but it is about recognizing and acknowledging the "fields of force and currents of material wherein forms are generated" and "the ability to find the grain of the world's becoming and to follow its course while bending it to their evolving purpose" (Ingold 2010a, p. 92). This orientation is also expressed by artist Paul Klee, who asserted that artistic practice is not about representing ideal objects or objects in the real world. 'It seeks, rather, to join with those forces that bring form into being', to make visible and not represent the visible (Ingold 2010a, p. 91). This engagement with the environment has to be understood within specific relations and not as abstract. Ingold (2007b) makes this point by drawing attention to the distinction between 'materials' and 'materiality'. The latter term has acquired some popularity among archaeologists and anthropologists in recent years (DeMarrais et al. 2004), but it has also led away from the multiplicity and variability of human creative entanglements with different kinds of materials and their qualities. Rather than thinking about culturally specific concepts of 'materiality' it would therefore be better to examine the specific ways people have interacted with substances, media and surfaces. "Like all other creatures, human beings do not exist on the 'other' side of materiality but swim in an ocean of materials . . . The forms of things, far from having been imposed from without upon an inert substrate, arise and are borne along - as indeed we are too - within this current of materials" (Ingold 2007b, p. 7). Following the ecological approach to visual perception by Gibson (1979), Ingold argues that we have to think the physical and material world as environments of organisms, which continuously interact with substances, media and surfaces. The environment cannot be thought of independently from organisms; it is a 'world that continuously unfolds in relation to the beings that make a living there" (Ingold 2007b, p. 14). It is therefore a world of different materials that present certain potentials and limitations as the organism or person proceeds through it. The Ф Springer</page><page sequence="27">'Rock-art', 'Animism' and Two-way Thinking 187 properties and qualities of materials are therefore never fixed and cannot be wholly determined, but they are relational and processual attributes that arise from the specific engagement of an organism with his or her environment. In this sense, material attributes are the consequence of the story on an organism and "to describe the properties of materials is to tell the stories what happens to them as they flow, mix and mutate" (Ingold 2007b, p. 14). To learn how to make things in the world is to learn how to interact with the flow of materials and to direct this flow according to intentions and ideas. The latter are not imposed onto the materials, but rather they are constantly adjusted during the process of making. Again, there is no clear-cut boundary between the mental and material involved as the process of making involves an inseparable and ongoing dynamic intertwining between the human body and the material world. Are the products of these processes objects that are animated after they have been created? According to Ingold (2007b, p. 12), this idea again suggests a separation between the 'mental' and 'material' in which the former is added to a lifeless materiality in an act "of adding to them a sprinkling of agency". In contrast, material creation and 'bringing things to life' rather has to be understood as restoring things "to the generative fluxes of the world of materials in which they came into being and continue to subsist" (Ingold 2007b, p. 12). Now, this general interpretation of the creative human process is "entirely consistent with the actual ontological commitments of peoples often credited in the literature with an animistic cosmology" (Ingold 2007b, p. 12). Here, there are no distinct objects as such or things that even could be animated. The world is alive, not because life as a separate force enters inanimate objects. The world is alive, because it consists of substances that are caught up in constant circulations and movements. Organisms are but one form of possible nodes, through which the surrounding media and materials circulate "that alternately portend their dissolution or - characteristically with animate beings - ensure their regeneration" (Ingold 2007b, p. 12). In this sense, life is not in objects or organisms; but objects and organisms are in life. It would, however, be a mistake to see this now as a distinctive world-view of a distinctive group of people. It is not an essential quality, but a quality of the relational constitution of organisms and humans. As such, it finds its expression in other contexts of human creative activity as well. In a recent contribution, Ingold (2010b) explores exactly these convergences that also follow from his explorations of the comparative anthropology of the line (Ingold 2007a). He draws here on fundamental similarities between different forms of image making, reading and experiencing, and illustrates this with a number of examples drawn from seemingly very different cultural contexts. In the case of medieval reading, writing and illustrating, it becomes apparent that medieval scholars do not draw a clear distinction between these activities and practices. They are all seen, not as descriptive, but rather as prescriptive and revelatory activities that enable the viewer to experience the inner structures of the world. Travelling through a landscape or a building is very much regarded as equivalent experiences. "Buildings and landscapes as well as texts could summon up the structures for inventive meditation" (Ingold 2010b, p. 18). In this engagement painting, writing and speaking become interchangeable, as written words invoke images in the minds of the viewer- readers while pictures also speak and are spoken. Accordingly, in medieval Springer</page><page sequence="28">1 88 Porr and Bell illuminated manuscripts, words and images "were strictly equivalent and even interchangeable" (Ingold 2010b, p. 18). Creating or travelling through a manuscript consequently was very much like travelling through a real physical landscape, with encounters of "interwoven depictions, stories, sightings and observations, not one of which was ontologically prior to any other, and all of which - taken together - opened up pathways to the experience of God" (Ingold 2010b, p. 18). The revelatory quality of so-called art is also at the centre of Wassily Kandinsky's view of painting. Here, also the motivation behind the practice of painting is not to produce a faithful representation or depiction of another thing, but to reveal its deeper meanings. This is why Kandinsky produced paintings that were unequivo- cally 'abstract' and non-figurative, but were nevertheless saturated with content. "By 'abstraction', Kandinsky meant the removal from the work of art all those figurative elements that otherwise imprison it or conceal its true nature from us, and that are incidental to its existence as art, so as to release it into the fullness of being" (Ingold 2010b, p. 21). The art work consequently gains in significance the more it loses its figurative outer qualities and the more it concentrates on the qualities of materials and substances. Significantly, Kandinsky's dialectic between abstract and figurative elements can also be found in quite a different body of art, of the Yolngu of Arnhem Land, Northern Australia. The distinction between two levels of painting - 'figurative' and 'geometric' - among the Yolngu was introduced by Morphy (1991). Figurative paintings always tell stories of ancestral beings and their actions during the Dreaming. It contains recognizable elements such as animals, anthropomorphs, items of material culture or trees and rocks. The viewer would 'read' such images just like a medieval manuscript, travelling along its different elements and features. "Yolngu people would inhabit their paintings much as the monastic practitioners of medieval Europe would inhabit scriptures, walking in their minds the original, creative walk of the ancestors and, in doing so, bringing it forward into the present so as to give sense and direction to their own lives" (Ingold 2010b, p. 19). In contrast, geometric paintings are apparently devoid of figurative elements, but what they lose in terms of outer appearance they gain in content and significance. "What could be more abstract, for example, than an oblong shape with a straight line down the middle? Yet the initiated Yolngu would ask: what could be more dense" (Ingold 2010b, p. 19)? This form of knowledge can only be acquired through a lengthy learning and initiation process, where the novice starts from the relatively superficial outside knowledge enshrined in figurative paintings and works his way down towards the much more fundamental forms of knowledge that are concentrated in the geometric art. "In essence, inside knowledge consists in an understanding of the underlying unity and coherence of different orders of experience" (Ingold 2010b, p. 19). In the same spirit, Kandinsky states that "I like the line better than the fish - at least in my painting" (Ingold 2010b, p. 22), because the line in its simplicity and reduction holds much more potential as "a visible form that vibrates with inner life". These examples demonstrate an important convergence that links the practices and attitudes of culturally very different people. There seems to be a principal agreement that different kinds of creative activities, the making of objects, artefacts, but also music and painting "open the mind to inner truths that are ontologically Springer</page><page sequence="29">'Rock-arť, 'Animism' and Two-way Thinking 189 prior to the outward forms of things. By a principle that Kandinsky called 'inner necessity', these truths - the 'abstract content' of the work of art - directly touch the soul and set it in motion. This principle corresponds, of course, to what Yolngu people call the Dreaming, and to what medieval monastic thinkers saw as the hand of God" (Ingold 2010b, p. 21). 'Animism' is not a particular belief system that actually animates inanimate objects. It is rather an awareness of the fondamental condition of life itself, which is only brought to the fore within societies and contexts in which experience and perception are not restricted and impoverished, but are allowed to flourish and be expressed in their extraordinary complexity and indeterminacy. If we take Indigenous philosophies and views of their art and the world as seriously as the statements of Western artists, we realize that what is usually described as 'animism' or 'a hunter-gatherer world-view' is in fact an awareness of the fundamental condition of "life itself in continually bringing forth the forms we encounter, whether in art, through reading, writing or painting, or in nature, through walking in the landscape" (Ingold 2010b, p. 23). The concepts of a distinctive 'hunter-gatherer world-view' and 'animism' are consequently problem- atic illusions, which serve to alienate Indigenous people from participating as equals in academic discourses. Both concepts contain the danger of imposing an abstract and alien concept of being and creating in the world onto Indigenous perspectives. It is in this deeper sense that Indigenous art is indeed 'art' and deserves to be recognised, valued and appreciated as such. It can be viewed along the paintings of Vermeer, Kandinsky or Picasso as long as it is realized that all of these forms of material expressions do not represent, but make visible and take part in their own form of the education of attention. For half a century, Mowaljarlai and the Ngarinyin have tried to share their experience and knowledge of the world, their world-view in fact, with Westerners. In this time, many academics have enjoyed their cooperation and hospitality as information is sought and given. However, the agenda has rarely been theirs. As noted earlier, researchers (still) arrive armed with theses, methodologies, even sample bags, but to the despair of the informants, none of their knowledge has appeared in readily accessible form or media until the 1990s. Mowaljarlai expressed, not just his frustration in, We got a gift we bin trying to give you ... but you blocked from receiving it! ' (Bell 2009, p. 164); but also his recognition that Western ears are blocked to a world-view that the Ngarinyin consider a gift. We wanted to be faithful to the government people, white people, properly talking to us. And then we can talk to each other and get things going properly. And this is what upset us all the time, Aborigine people. The people that they are talking with now, they went through education and college because they know the way of white people, because they stick to those mob, see. They don 't stick to us. This is the problem that we see. What we see is, all the white people that were born in this country and they are missing the things that came from us mob , and we want to try and share it. And the people were born in this country, in law country, Ô Springer</page><page sequence="30">190 Porr and Bell from all these sacred places in the earth. And they were born on top of that. And that, we call wunggud - very precious. That is where their spirit come from. That's why we can 't divide one another, we want to share our gift, that everybody is belonging ; we want to share together in the future for other generations to live on. You know? That's why its very important (Bell 2009, p. 164). Ngarinyin ontology and epistemology is clearly embedded in this passage in that it alludes to the idea that environment is inhabited, dwelled in, by all human and non-human forms in a relational ecology of being in the world. Mowaljarlai points to a perception that Indigenous people who go through Western education lose the ability to properly inhabit their belonging place, preferring to adopt the white people's' modus operandi, cultural protocols and institutions. Ngarinyin see this as a great loss, a problem, because the young, educated countrymen miss the real meaning of belonging. Being born in Wunggud is to enter the world as a participant in its action; that includes belonging in relational balance with everything else that exists, seen and unseen. Of particular importance is the maintenance of the integrity of the natural world. The earth cannot be dug up, blown up, destroyed in any major way because to do so is to seriously disrupt balance in the land. Such violent disruptions traumatise the power circuits intrinsic to rock, and to the painted images in the shelters, both of which afford energy and life. We have the power there, the images in the rock and the paintings in the cave. And these are sacred places that give our energy; it comes from there. Its very important. Because of destroying that, we feel sad, because digging holes and blowing up all our powerful places, because there is a symbol like a woman's body image lying down, and a child's image there, and a man's image, and that's why its very precious. That thing is going to be blown out and we can 't give any evidence or story, because it's not there. And that's what we get pain from, that sort of thing that happened (Bell 2009, p • 131). Catastrophic disruptions also have grave impacts on the patterns of organisms that inhabit the lands and rock shelters. These include wallabies, birds, insects, reptiles, plants, lichens, root structures that squeeze their way through narrow fissures, humans - in fact everything that belongs in the physical and metaphysical ecology of existence. When disruption comes, the pattern of relationships has to reweave itself, find new 'grids' in which to reconnect everything up in its proper relational balance. Ngarinyin tell me that the pattern in life is, however, a self- healing phenomenon. The earth has known ice ages, floods, earthquakes and meteor collisions, all of which appear in the Ngarinyin narrative that spans millennia (Morris 2007/ The pattern in life is 'mapped' in the relationship system itself, in which all organisms and earth features belong. Ngarinyin know and see the pattern as an inner template that they can project out to any situation or geography in order for them to find their 'right place '. Springer</page><page sequence="31">'Rock-arť, 'Animism' and Two-way Thinking 191 In their ontology, everything that exists does so in the image of something or everything else. Hence, the image of a woman's body lying down, the child's image, fire in the form of hibiscus flower, the spongy, soft pink tree bark in the image of the womb that is made into a baby-carrying coolaman (basket), the djambarra (hole in the earth) that is the ' nose-hole ' through which the earth provides new breath and is the story for the development of the didgeridoo, all attest to the ontological certainty that nothing exists whose template is not already in the earth: See those trees ... they dancing hip to hip. You can see they all the same ... apart same space because they know how that energy works. That energy travel under the ground. They all connected in that energy grid, like electricity grid. E come from lightning, that energy. Lightning Brothers. Bang ! First 'e go up, then 'e come down ... travel under the ground ... fill up everything with power. That's how power communi- cates. Trees know how to grow right place because of that energy. Same for us. We know our right place too (Bell 2009, p. 115). This is a relational epistemology that is carried as a dynamic inner template that is in a constant state of renewal. It is communicated in a narrative that spans millennia, is represented in painted images whose appearance in rock shelters over time reflects the evolution of awareness, social organisation and what Westerners call scientific knowledge, and is sung and danced into life daily. Mowaljarlai calls the images 'our copyright, our evidence. ' In my living in Ngarinyin consciousness it has become increasingly evident that the study of so-called rock art encourages researchers to view Aboriginal (Ngarinyin) culture in a conceptual framework that is defined by, and limited to, a European Palaeolithic past. This view can blinker researchers from seeing the reality, that Australian hunter-gatherer Aborigines were not overwhelmed by settler societies until a few hundred years ago, and that their culture continues to evolve as hunting and gathering peoples despite the British occupation and declaration of sovereignty in 1 788. For the Ngarinyin, the impacts of colonisation were not felt until well into the twentieth century. Thus, their record or ' evidence ' in images continues unbroken from the Palaeolithic past up to present time. Just as European human and non-human organisms, their ecologies and cultures evolved through climatic, geological and geopolitical change so did Aboriginal societies in the island of Australia. Many significant changes in such consciousness and awareness are evident in the canon of law as reflected in the imagery and iconography of rock paintings. This process continues into present time as Ngarinyin adapt to the new materials, technologies, geopolitical boundaries, knowledge and knowl- edge systems with which they are confronted. They are no less themselves - hunter-gatherers whose world continues to change - as they find ways of continuing to live in relational balance with their context. By becoming familiar with the extant Ngarinyin way of seeing and being in the world it is possible to draw some inferences about extinct hunter-gatherer societies, in particular the once-universal ontology of relationality as expressed in the archaeological record.

The main problem lies in the fact that if we take the relational perspective seriously, then it indeed makes no sense to speak of a particular hunter- gatherer ontology. What is perceived as a hunter-gatherer world-view is the product of the ongoing relational engagement of people with their environment. Certainly, this is different from Western and urban academics, but it also cannot be seen as a particular fixed ontology that can be located in certain mental or perceptual schemes. In arguing for the existence of a particular hunter-gatherer world-view we are in constant danger of reproducing the Western mind-body dichotomy and its different expressions. The construction of a particular world-view also serves to objectify hunting and gathering people and their philosophies and contributes to the impression that 'they' need to be interpreted by 'us' with scientific and objective methods. In contrast, we argue that indeed there are extensive convergences between certain Western schools and strands of thought and one form of traditional thinking, Ngarinyin philosophy, that do not justify a clear-cut separation between them. To move these explorations forward, we have concentrated on a small part of the writings of Tim Ingold, but as we have stressed above we recognise the necessity to include phenomenological methodology, including other means, methods and modes of communication, as well. These explorations have to acknowledge that the importance of so-called art, poetry, song and narratives among non- Western people is no accident, but it acknowledges the openness and dynamism of life and living expression. These expressions do not attempt to control the environment but to find their way through it in a constant dialogue. These are of course insights that have relevance for all humans everywhere, because they reflect fundamental character- istics of humans as living organisms. As a consequence, academic discourse has to be complemented and expanded to include elements and methods of expression that usually lay outside of its accepted boundaries. Only in this way it will be possible to embrace the dynamics and indeterminacies of human beings and living organisms. In the case of rock-art studies this means taking Indigenous perspectives and expressions much more seriously than this has been done before - just as we have attempted here in this contribution. Two-way thinking has to mean entering a dialogue that aims at establishing perspectives on a particular phenomenon. This dialogue can lead to complementarity, obviation or incompatibility. This cannot and should not be assumed from the start. Mostly, it cannot be assumed from the outset that academic methodologies, expressions and discourse rules always take priority (Clifford and Marcus 1986; James et al. 1997; Marcus and Fischer 1986). There can be little doubt that this is a difficult process, but without doubt a necessary one. Ideally, such a process will lead to a much richer reading of the evidence and, for example, in the case of 'animism', to a recursive and critical reflection of elements of 'animism' in every human practice. Such an exploration is of course not at all new Ô Springer</page><page sequence="33">'Rock-art', 'Animism* and Two-way Thinking 193 (Latour 1991), but it seems not to have penetrated deeply into the study of material culture, rock-art and the engagement with people who live in a hunting and gathering tradition. In the case of living traditions, the objectification of Indigenous people can easily lead to their exclusion from the discourse and the disappearance of their voices when obviously they have much to reveal. All of these considerations do not mean that there is no room for reflection and contextualisation of statements, expressions and views. This process, however, has to go both ways. It has to take the challenging journey of critical, reflective intercultural understanding and translation (Carbaugh 1990, 2007). The most profound challenge to Western academics and thought is to recognise the extent to which their agenda are unconsciously shaped and defined by their own cultural ontologies and epistemologies. It is not a level playing field when the curiosity of one culture results in the definition and justification of the methodologies and languages that are applied to another culture in the search for knowledge. This is particularly so when the subject group s experience of the other is historically characterised by oppression , disenfranchisement, dislocation and dissolution, where their law has been legally rendered obsolete, their lands usurped, and their status subsequently defined as ' disadvantaged ', where all policy has been executed in overwhelming ignorance of the way the subject society actually works. In the course of implementation of such policy, the subject groups have been exposed to discourse-specific languages, primarily the bureaucratic languages of housing and habitation, law and justice (policing and the court system), welfare, education, municipal management and employment, largely in punitive contexts. When it comes to academic inquiry the subject group is already well-conditioned into a perception that 'whitefellas ' (Westerners) hold both authority and power over most of their lives. In the field of research, financial and consultative arrangements with informants have generally been tokenistic at best. Equal collaborations and partnerships represent a relatively recent, usually individually focused and financed pursuit. As a consequence Indigenous people have had neither the experience nor sense of authority to seek or expect a mutually respectful two-way dialogue. Two-way thinking is based on the precept that two cultures can collaborate as Mowaljarlai says, 'side-by-side, not one on top the other '. As Indigenous people have been significantly more exposed to Western cultural ontology and institutions and languages than the converse, Westerners would appear to have the greater learning curve. If two-way thinking were to be entertained, then Western academic (and policy makers) would become immersed in a hunter-gatherer thinking mode and way of experiencing the world. Phenomenological methodol- ogies offer this opportunity because phenomenology has many similarities and confluences with, for example, the Ngarinyin way of seeing and being. In an initiative designed to redress some of the inequities in the relationship between Westerners and themselves, Ngarinyin lawmen and law women embarked on a joint venture partnership in 1997, to 'teach up whitefellas' in the Ngarinyin way of being and seeing. When they first tried to register the learning experience as a 'Bush University ', Ngarinyin met fierce objection from Springer</page><page sequence="34">194 Porr and Bell the state government because the word 'university' signified an accredited place of learning, which, according to the authorities, this educational experience clearly was not. The Ngarinyin then registered and copyrighted the title as a trading name. The term is now widely used throughout Australia as signifying traditional hunter-gatherer educative or cultural tourism. For the first time in their relationship with Anmorra (non-Indigenous), countrymen and women who continue to live in a hunter-gatherer tradition had the means, including financial independence, to go back to their homelands, teach their children in country, live in and maintain their lands and sites. Their business partner operated the Western elements of administration, logistics, accommodation and food, while the Ngarinyin set and delivered the experience and learning in country. It was a two-way thinking venture to which each cultural entity brought their knowledge and knowledge holders in both a collaborative and equity partnership. To travel to a rock painting site as guests of Ngarinyin lawmen and law women is a very different experience from being a part of an academic research team. Visitors are out of their comfort zones in many subtle and obvious ways. The semi arid, rugged landscape is unfamiliar and threatening, water is scarce, wildlife is potentially dangerous, communication technology is non-existent, and help is hundreds of miles away. Clocks and schedules are irrelevant. Visitors are challenged on many emotional and intellectual levels because their ' civilised ' world ceases to exist. The impact of these conditions on visitors exposes them to an unfamiliar vulnerability through which their senses become heightened and attentions become alert. They sink into this alien experience and start to see the world through Ngarinyin lenses. The normally fanciful or romantic notions of a ' hunter-gatherer ' lifestyle become real and lived. I describe such an experience thus (Bell 2009, pp. 127-128): An eventful day begins sunny and bright, except for a few puffy clouds away to the north. The Ngarinyin teachers declare that we will spend the day visiting Nyandat Tatayas Wanjina site, an 80-km drive along corrugated gravel roads and boggy tracks through swamplands. En route, the OKA stops as a huge, extremely poisonous King Brown snake crosses the track. Everyone gets out for a closer look, but the snake has gone under the vehicle. This is a potentially dangerous situation, so visitors are asked to get back on board. The vehicle moves off slowly, taking care to avoid the snake. The lawmen look at each other in silent acknowledgement that this is a sign. The track into the site is too boggy to take the vehicle, so everyone must walk the last 600 m through 2-m-tall spear grass, following a barely visible cattle track. Nyandat leads the procession in single-file. He stops abruptly, looks towards the rocky ridge, and starts calling out to the Wanjinas. In his own language, he tells them that these people are visitors who come from far away to learn about living in the land. He exhorts the Wanjinas not to be angry about his long absence. After a few moments of silence, he signals to everyone to follow closely. Within a few yards, there is an audible gasp as the visitors suddenly catch sight of a string of 20 Wanjina heads peering over a rocky ledge. Reverently, they carefully climb up the boulders until Ô Springer</page><page sequence="35">'Rock-arť, 'Animism' and Two-way Thinking 195 they reach the ledge. These Wanjinas are Mogoyad, his father and their wives. They were returning to their home in the north from the big battle at Wanilirri when, injured and tired, Mogoyad and his father lay down for a rest. Here, they became a painting. Nyandat tells the story of a battle, then points out other paintings of the Lightning Brothers, of the wunan figures passing sacred objects from one to another, and the mystical, floating figures called Gwion Gwion, who gave to the tribes stone tool technology and ceremony. There are layers upon layers of animal and plant paintings, retouched Wanjinas, all distributed up three more ledges. Nyandat looks at the sky and notices that the clouds are now building. Time to leave this incredible sacred shelter with its very cool, thin air. He must complete the smoking ritual to ensure that none of the Wanjina spirits follow anyone out of the shelter. We are told that sometimes, because Wanjina is so happy to see his people, his spirit tries to attach to someone and leave the cave. Smoking the shelter by burning fresh leaves of the sacred ironwood tree keeps the spirits in their place. Because the clouds are becoming threatening, Nyandat decides to use the branches of a more convenient tree for this ritual. Alas, this will prove almost disastrous. Walking back to the vehicle, two Bush University visitors become disoriented and take a wrong track. It is an hour before they emerge from the long spear grass. The Ngarinyin law women ask if we smoked the cave. We say yes, we have. The vehicle then gets bogged in the oily, wet black soil. With the second vehicle, we winch it out. Another visitor becomes mysteriously ill with a fever. We rush her to Drysdale Station for evacuation, but she gets better when we leave the Mogoyad area. On the return journey to the campsite, Nyandat, driving the teachers' Toyota, navigates the extremely narrow, winding track through trees, over rocky ground, a pitch-black sky. Suddenly, he accelerates, passes through the gears, spins around bends and crashes into a fallen tree. Agula ! he whispers. Agula, the trickster spirit who preys on the careless, has entered his body. Nyandat moves the vehicle off quietly, and travels very slowly for the remainder of the journey. We all return to our camp at Maranbabiddi, exhausted from the days events. The next morning an uncharacteristic, dense fog envelops the camp and waterhole. This is wilmi, say the old Ngarinyin women. Must be Wanjina 'ere, now ! They ask us again if the cave was smoked. Again we say yes. Then the senior law women ask if we used the right leaves. No, we respond. We used something else. The women jump up and immediately walk out in every direction to collect ironwood leaves. When the fire is lit all participants are asked to walk through the smoke. The vehicle is smoked. All the tents are smoked. The whole campsite, suffuse with smoke, is ' cleaned out'. Miraculously the fog lifts, evidence that the Wanjina spirits have been sent back to their cave. The next time we visit Mogoyad, his father and their wives, we smoke the cave, in fact the whole rock face, with ironwood leaves. No Wanjina spirits, no agula join us this time! From this passage, it can be seen that the viewing of so-called rock-art is, in fact, a complexity of ' being alert to the day ', recognition and observation of; Ô Springer</page><page sequence="36">196 Porr and Bell men s business and women s business, the relational world in which images, their spirits, events and circumstances, sightings and signs, weather, and correct behaviour are all alive and active in the experience. There is a seamless blend of aliveness and movement in human and non-human organisms, the physical and metaphysical, in fact an experiential relationality in which all enlivened dynamics exist in a timeless, subjective present. In this context, ' rock art ' ceases to be static galleries of ancient paintings. Instead, the images are interactive players in a continuous and continuing way of life - animate and inanimate - that need to be experienced in their human and cultural context, in accordance with the law they represent. This is two-way thinking. It has significant implications for the ways in which universities do research, and present information. It necessarily challenges the enculturated and habitual customary operating paradigms including cultural attitudes and behaviours, academic methodologies, assumptions, values and judgements, and finally, funding and organisational arrangements that research proponents currently employ. To work ' side-by-side ' modern people who continue to live in a hunter-gatherer tradition has the potential to open up Western thought to a parallel, equally knowledgeable epistemology and insightful ontology that have, not only many confluences with Western scientific thought, but insightful knowledge and understanding of the relational world. This body of knowledge, recorded and expressed in very different language forms, potentially holds considerable relevance and benefit to contemporary global issues. When the Indigenous knowledge holders can enjoy equal status with Western academic knowledge holders, and attract the same pecuniary rewards for their knowledge, time and work, we will have begun the journey out of the residual, subversive aspects of social Darwinism that continue to subtly infer that hunter-gatherer societies are a prior, less evolved expression of human culture. The 'Third Space9: Material Agency, Variable Ontologies and Methodologies When travelling with the Ngarinyin, it is difficult for a rational logical intellectual thinker to change, or add to their way of thinking in order to yield a satisfactory explanation to questions that arise. To my consternation, many questions are answered in a different and sometimes puzzling discourse. For example, at a rock image gallery my questions would include, why has this site been chosen to create an image? Why are new images painted on top of existing images? Who is or was the artist? Why does the same image repeat itself in all the shelters? What tools and materials are used to create images? What is the story of this image? How old is it? What do people feel about the images? Are the painted shelters sacred places and spaces? Do countrymen occupy them at any time? And so on. In this dialectic my questions relate to agency and structure, however they fail to acknowledge agency of the structure, or the structuration in the relationship of and between agents, the Ф Springer</page><page sequence="37">'Rock-art', 'Animism' and Two-way Thinking 197 process of agency and structure. Nevertheless, were the questions answered, I would have gained sufficient information to ' know ' and write something about rock-art in compliance with a specific Western discourse. My questions reflect a culturally defined concept of painting as Art within a Western dialectic that presumes the inanimacy of ' art ' that is created through the agency and consciousness of an ' artist ' In this discourse, the artist is an individual gifted with a talent that imbues him/her with cultural authority to create original artefacts from a range of materials, generally for display in a public domain. Any agency ascribed to the artefact is based on culturally determined criteria of scarcity (economic value), by the artist as a process of creative expression that involves the choice of and structure of materials, by site selection, ritual and function that attaches to certain ' sacred ' works and iconography, and by the viewer/owner who personally interprets and appreciates the artefact for meanings. Yet little of this dialectic is relevant or appropriate to arriving at an understanding of so-called rock-art. In my view, apprehension of rock images can only be gained by approaching it phenomenologically. I have touched on some of the dynamics at play when visiting a painting site. To delve further into the experience it is not possible to use the language of academic inquiry - this can be explicated by my colleague. As I approach a site, my questions run amok. They are quickly silenced by an explosive exhortation by the Lawman to the Wanjina to ' not be angry for not visiting lately ', 'this mob come 'ere to see you, they right this mob, they Anmorra (whitefellas) from everywhere, they want to pay respect. ' He only glances at the shelter ; his gaze takes in all the surrounds. The questions that want to be asked include, 'what did you say in language? How do you know if and when Wanjina accedes to your exhortation? What if he doesn 't? Is there a ' correct ' distance from the shelter to utter the exhortation? What would happen if you didn Ì call out? ' At the rock face the Lawman walks along the ledge mumbling what he thinks is a Western explanation of the paintings. ' This one Mogoyad, 'e lay down after that Waniliri, he too tired, became a painting. ' I wanted to know the chronology, sequence, time taken for this process, details of Waniliri, a profile of who is Mogoyad, his sons, why they chose here, did they all die, couldn Ì they have got home to their own country, why are they painted over Gwion Gwion and Chosen Animals, who was the artist? As the group walks along the gallery another Old Man is perched on a rock and is digging what looks like impenetrably hard ground. I sit down next to him and focus on the activity. 'Cheeky yam ... (e right down ... sweet that cheeky yam ... skinny root right down in rock ... gotta be careful. See that one there? 'E bush tucker too, little bit native mint that one. Too much bush tucker 'ere, plenty tucker for everyone. ' We sit in silence as he chips away unyielding clods of dirt. I think what a lot of effort ! I hope its worth it. He looks up at the clouds, notices and names the birdsongs. 'Good place this one. In that rainy time (e safe 'ere. No flood catch us. Wallaby come right up outa rain. Kangaroo too. Everybody get outa the rain. We catch 'im too easy now. Everybody really happy. Full belly ! ' More silence and digging. Then he asks, 'What that Anmorra really want? What they lookin for? ' 'They want to learn about Wanjina, ' I reply. I see by his Ô Springer</page><page sequence="38">1 98 Porr and Bell facial expression that he knows more than this , and that I have not really answered his question . He knows by their campfire questions that they are looking for ' meaning perhaps even to somehow absorb their sense of identity and belonging . He knows that I know, but we respect each others cultural space without comment. More silence as we focus on the little pipehole he has dug, now almost a meter deep. The wind whips up, grasses bend over ; Old Man notices this and digs. Sentences are short and infrequent. As we sit there, focused on the digging with anticipation at what he will pull out of this utterly unyielding ground I have a sense of being in a different reality to the other visitors who chatter, climb layers of shelters, ask questions, point, surrepti- tiously touch, analyse and discuss the paintings. Our spot is not simply yielding a very small, hairy cheeky yam; the whole environment is down- loading itself into my being, my awareness. I experience a glimmering of connectedness - with birds, grass, dirt, wind, clouds - and strangely, with the story of the space, its history, function and energy. I am conscious of the expanse of Wanjina images at our backs, and feel ' watched Alone with Mowaljarlai at another shelter, he sits on the ledge looking out across the plain. Its not an empty plain ; he sees and thereby acknowledges tall grass, trees ' dancing hip to hip ', wildlife in abundance, but too small to see at this distance. A little way from him, I stand before a faded image of Wanjina, wondering how old it is, who painted it- all the usual questions. Much time passes and the image becomes clearer in my mind's eye, perhaps on the rock face too. But such thoughts are immediately dismissed as fanciful. I notice the way the red ochre has completely blended deeply into the rock as if staining its presence into it. The thought occurs to me, could the image be in the rock and is then painted by a human as if it were a template? The nearby Gwion Gwion images bear a remarkable resemblance to old root and water stains - could the Wanjina images originally have been seen in the rock itself? I ask Mowaljarlai how the paintings got there originally. 'We don't make that image ... e paint himself. E tell us and we listen. That man who listening, 'e prepare himself- quiet time, no hot food, he listening. mE putting that ochre when 'e listening. We not responsible for that image. Wanjina become a painting. ' I return to the image and gaze some more, only now, with slightly unfocused eyes. After a time the image seems to pulse. Startled, I immediately restore focus and rationalise the experience away as illusion or aberration. I return to the unfocused gaze again, curious now. The pulsing eventually returns as the image seems to project itself out of the rock. Later I discuss this experience with Mowaljarlai. He is not surprised, and claims it is a common experience that everybody has. All the countrymen. ' That's why we gotta look after these places. They living images, images with energy'. In this experience I learned that time, unselfconscious presence and unfocused gaze are necessary to ' see into ' the structure and be seen by it. Self-observation and analysis during the process takes you out of the experience. It has unpredictable and unexpected impacts on body and mind; the experience is difficult to explain, is not provable or necessarily reproducible and is therefore suspect in academic inquiry. I can communicate the experience of engagement with image/rock/environment in poetic language, but not apply a dialectical because nothing is resolved. Ô Springer</page><page sequence="39">'Rock-arť, 'Animism' and Two-way Thinking 199 The question , how are the Ngarinyin so apparently comfortable and able to ' see ' or experience their environment in this way as a matter of course may have its answer in their sociocentricity, as opposed to Westerners' egocen- tricity. It is more than simply the absence of egocentricity with its individual self consciousness. Consciousness of the whole human and non-human ecology in which the self is but an aspect of the totality diminishes if not prevents the propensity to individuate and therefore become self or ego- centred. Inside this way of seeing, while self awareness is absent, awareness of the whole environment or ecology of relationships is present. I make this observation because shifting out of self consciousness and self awareness is necessary to ' see ' into the rock and experience being seen by it. It also goes some way to explaining relational balance and relational ontology as experience-based. These experiences and others like them answer most of the questions I have constructed as a rational, logical thinker. But the answers are in the experiences themselves and the stories I can tell afterwards, not in the analysis and understanding of the intellectual concepts and processes at work. But I now understand why the Lawman talks to the Wanjina on his way into a site, why the sites are chosen, who (human and non-human) occupies the sites and when, how the paintings came into being, what the process of painting is and how it makes sense that Wanjina ' became a painting ' despite its seeming contradiction with the idea of a painter who is certainly present as agency rather than agent, how Wanjina communicates with his peoples, the presence of chosen animals in image sites, and more. Apprehension and appreciation comes from being in place phenomenologically, where one experiences experience in the continuing presence of the present. Several contributions at the intersection of anthropology and archaeology have recently explored related issues of material agency and the interdependent structuration of people and their environment (Castañeda and Matthews 2008; DeMarrais et al. 2004; Hicks and Beaudry 2010; Knappett 2006; Knappet! and Malafouris 2008; Renfrew et al. 2004). These contributions draw on a number of intellectual strands that appear to be particularly suitable to start a productive dialogue between academic archaeology and Indigenous ways of perceiving and ways of knowing. As such, they are extremely valuable as they also address the socio-political framework in which the integration of academic and Indigenous perspectives has to take place (see esp. Castañeda and Matthews 2008). However, a common limitation seems to be that they do not include a reflection of the fundamental ontological and related methodological as well as discursive implica- tions, which we have specifically stressed. Therefore, we believe that the danger remains of an implicit persistence of the view that the Indigenous perspective is not as ontologically justified as Western science and its discourse. We believe that the potential for a productive dialogue and reflective integration has barely been realized and in writing this paper in the present form we are arguing for a more substantial and radical integration. The search for a formal literary structure that might support this littoral of cultural convergence is made extremely difficult by the nature, structure and use of Ф Springer</page><page sequence="40">200 Porr and Bell languages and the cognitive frameworks that occupants bring to it. Thus far it seems that the 'third space' cannot be a discrete, defined structure, because it lacks boundaries and is dynamic in its livingness. The metaphor of a littoral zone between cultures, a 'cultural littoral', is perhaps most apt in demonstrating the problem; like a shoreline, the interface is at once land or sea, or land and sea - dynamically of both yet discretely separate and different. We have attempted to emulate this littoral in the structure of our paper by interweaving academic discourse, voices and experience. At the same time, we recognise that our means is written Standard English, our method is academic discourse, and our mode is publication, all of which are Western constructs. To embrace more of the Ngarinyin content we have attempted to incorporate their 'littoral' use of English language through which to reveal their ontology. The phenomenological experience of the intercultural littoral reflects both the Ngarinyin poetic relational world-view, and the reflexivity necessary to understand the dynamics of the 'third space' in order to reproduce it within an academic discourse and publication. These considerations finally also make clear why it is difficult to develop a general interpretative framework for all so-called hunter-gatherer rock-art, which could then serve as a theoretical and methodological tool kit for contexts where 'informants' and 'teachers' are not available, i.e. prehistoric materials. However, one of us (Porr 2010a) has recently made some suggestions in this direction in relation to European mobiliáry Palaeolithic art and for the development of a 'phenomenological ecology' to explore the inter-relationships and mutual constitution of figurative art, humans and animals in an archaeological context. This contribution builds onto a related analysis (Porr 2010b) that also views Palaeolithic art in a non-mechanistic fashion related to the construction of corporeal practices, social identity and cultural memory. The idea of a 'phenomenological ecology' mirrors the use of different strands of evidence and their differential interpretation and presentation as outlined in this paper. The reconstruction of a former environment has to be complemented by an exploration of the range of possible experiences that people could have had within them (e.g. with animals, the weather, plants etc.), which in turn has to be related to respective artistic and other material expressions. Art has to be taken seriously, as a result of situated reflection and engagement within a particular environment. In the absence of dialogue partners, the researcher has to build onto the insights that we can gain from engaging seriously with the relational ontologies and ways of perceiving of non- Western and Indigenous people and a critical reflection of the mechanisms, strengths and limitations of his or her own ways of knowing. This process has only just begun.
