<plain_text><page sequence="1">on our sides CIARAN McKEOWN finds religious difference deeper than suspected EARLY IN THE current 'troubles', the late Cardinal William Conway, Archbishop of Armagh and Primate of All Ireland, declared that the conflict had nothing to do with religion. This pronouncement from Ara Coeli elicited nodding assent from all but the extremes. But it is possible to dissent so extremely from the Conway dictum as not even to register on the spectrum. In a society where, according to circumstance, killing other people finds widespread support?from the justification of terror to the more terrifyingly commonplace justification of war?anyone who does not admit circumstantial deviation from the prin ciple of not killing must face and endure the consequences of conscientious eccentricity. If such a person is genuinely a Protestant on the Luther plane of 'for I can do no other', there can be the comfort of general affiliation to the tradition of dissent itself, a rather poor imita tion of belonging to a living community secure in its time-tested tradition across many cultural frontiers. If, however, such a person digresses from war-justifying Roman Catholicism, the conse quent eccentricity implies the loss of spiritual communion, the very thing which allows such diversity within Roman Catholicism itself, even across many doctrinal differences. To such a person, clumsily labelled the theisticpacifist, the statement that life is sacred is simple and total: the perception of a divine dimension to human experience overwhelms any other judgement and the conscience cannot encompass, manipulate or quantify that divin ity in relation to oneself or another person. Out of that perception, one is called to a reverence for the sacredness of one's own life that is inseparable from reverence for every other person's life. This demands a regard for oneself and for others that can scarcely begin to be fulfilled; but it excludes in advance any action deliberately taken or anticipated, which diminishes or threatens to diminish one's own life or another's. Any such action, being a denial of access of the sacred to oneself or to others in a free relationship of love is, in the most profound sense, a lie. If consciously done, it is blasphemy; less conscientiously, it is an unwit ting act of anthropomorphism of the divine. Either way, it cannot be sustained by any thorough-going theism. Any form of human conflict, therefore, involves religion in its simplest, its most profound and its most effective dynamic?the law of love. Since mainstream Christianity, Judaeism and Islam, in their various denominations, all tolerate and indeed bless killing and the constant preparation for killing, according to certain humanly derived rules and agreed circumstances, all?to that degree?either blaspheme or seek to anthropomorphise the ineffable reality of deity. Orthodoxy, by its own local cultural demands, seeks to express the inexpressible to its adherents, to its 'chosen people'. To the extent that orthodoxies and cultures inevitably diverge, the nature of deity is diversely evoked, yet each orthodoxy believes it has the 'true' 'God' to itself and regulates the practices of its adherents accordingly?and in contrast to other forms. One may speculate and hope that divine mercy is infinitely tolerant of this foggy human endeavour, although one might equally quake in awe before the possible judgement of such activity. What is beyond speculation, as a matter of recorded human tragedy, is that millions of humans have killed each other, kill each other and prepare to kill each other and the entire planet, in the presumption of the lightness of their orthodoxy. Faced with utter human inadequacy in the celebration ofthe divine in human experience, two broad reactions may de described. One is to have a multiplicity of attempts, all more or less tolerated within a single orthodoxy, to develop rules and rituals thought likely to encourage the human soul in a way of life appropriate to its r?m*-~--""-" Stuffed with imagery: the Catholic imagination ultimate destiny; the other is to have a comparably broad tradition based on the recog nition that the individual's relationship to this destiny is the most accessible aspect of all human experience and that no one has any right to transgress upon that personal, individual relationship with deity. In crude terms, the first of these modes corresponds to the Roman Catholic, while the second corresponds to the Protestant. Both, as collective traditions, act at one remove from the reality of deity; or, more accurately, they are essentially modes of reaction?for the divine is, always and everywhere, the prior actor. The outworking of these divergent reactions can be seen clearly in the divergent forms of worship, of church organisation, of rules and rituals. At such levels, the work of ecumenism may well make considerable and very welcome progress in eliminating the cruder forms of mutual misunderstanding, without ever touching the deeper misunderstanding between both forms of mainstream Christianity. But when the operations of the human psyche, in its internal structures and modes of expression in reaction to the shock of divinity, are examined clinically?literally?a divergence is detected which makes mutual understanding between adherents of these streams profoundly difficult and, for many, well-nigh impossible. Historically, Jung has been the scientific prophet on this topic, in seminal observations which might ultimately be of more benefit for human survival than the contributions of Einstein and Heisenberg to physics, or of Gandhi to the possibility of a non-violent alternative to power politics. Jung found simply that mentally ill Catholics, their psyches positively stuffed with imagery, were generally more amenable to psychotherapy, since archetypal imagery is more readily evoked in imaginations accustomed to svmbols. The Protestant suffering from mental illness was not so easily treated, for he was, in a very immediate sense, alone with his God, his psyche deliberately stripped of imagery, save that of an intimidatingly wrathful God. Jung also found that the Catholic pastor, having the ritual of secret confession at his disposal, could care much more effectively? or, at least, with more evident satisfaction? for souls, and that the task of the Protestant pastor was much more difficult, having no compa rable reserves of symbolism at his disposal. He says much more, of course, being Jung. But it is neither a leap of imagination nor of logic to extrapolate from the basic predisposi tion and modus operandi of both the Catholic and Protestant psyche?whether actively religious or not?to see that the diverse orientations towards the very meaning and purpose of human destiny are bound to create an enormous gap in understanding between the two. A culture underpinned by an orthodoxy which is highly imagistic, verbal and ritualistic will diverge steadily from one which is stark, cautious to the point of silence and deeply suspicious of appearing to express anything which cannot be proven by reason alone. Within the limits of this reflection, one may simoly point to the different rhythms, 2</page><page sequence="2">touchstone images and forms of Catholic and Protestant culture in Ireland, especially in Northern Ireland, to see that there is a problem. The word 'justice' offers an easy example of divergent resonance: justice to the Catholic is a living principle, rooted in and flowing from divinity itself?in more senses than one, it has God on its side. Justice to the Protestant is a fair and reasonable arrangement of human ^relations, democratically arrived at and embodied in law?law which the God-fearing, law-abiding citizen will obey, for God is on its side ... It is in this sense that the late Cardinal Conway could not have been more wrong. The 'troubles' have everything to do with religion.
