<plain_text><page sequence="1">THE BREAD THAT EVERY MAN MUST EAT ALONE ROBINSON JEFFERS: A POINT OF VIEW GEORGE G. GATES' Frequently the poetry of Robinson Jeffers is dismissed as the work of a nihil- ist, a Fascist, a romantic. Quite frequent- ly, too, his poetry is taken literally as a complete denouncement of all men. There is a tendency, too, on the part of some to describe his poetry as an either- or. By some, though, Jeffers is consid- ered too powerful as a writer to be ac- cepted as either one thing or another or completely ignored. His point of view, regardless of any question of its validity, is now being voiced wittingly or unwit- tingly by some who sense deep worldly wrongs. Raoul de Roussy de Sales, for instance, writing in a recent issue (March, 1942) of the Atlantic Monthly, urges an exami- nation of the milieu of the German peo- ple as a means of understanding the source of inconsistency between the indi- vidual in Germany and his national mi- lieu and of the incompatibility between the German people and other peoples of the world. Robinson Jeffers raised long ago a similar question on a similar prob- lem: the inconsistency and incompatibil- ity of the individual in relation to a mi- lieu of humanity. What Jeffers suggests for the individual has never, it seems to me, been fully stated. Without judg- ment, this discussion attempts to give an understanding of Jeffers' point of view. To understand Jeffers' poetry and his point of view it is necessary to scrutinize his major thesis. Like the motif in a piece of music, this major thesis recurs again and again. From Tamar and Other Poems (1924), through Roan Stallion (1925), The Women of Point Sur (1927), Cawdor (1928), Dear Judas (1929) Thurso's Landing (1932), to his latest Be Angry at the Sun (1941), his major thesis remains the same. Stated briefly that thesis is this: The necessity for the individual to plant him- self above and beyond humanity by his own "strength and substance." This is done best, he seems to say, by a proper balance of the universal power found in the objective external world and the ele- mentals of human life found in such per- sons as herdsmen and pantheistic poets. Though undefined by Jeffers, the term "humanity," by inference from his use of it in his major poems, means probably 28 Op. cit., p. 281.

Such are bad, thinks Jeffers, for these things, if coun- tenanced by the individual, lead to deg- radation and decay-something he be- lieves has happened since man became aware of his humanity. More specifically in a metaphysical sense, as Jeffers no doubt uses the term, the word "human- ity" relates to man's consciousness of himself as human in kind only and as cut off from the objective and external world. This attitude of man looking at himself as human to the exclusion of the objec- tive external universe is the thing that individuals must break away from by their own "strength and substance." Such must be, Jeffers would say, if I read him rightly, because such an atti- tude of man looking at himself as a hu- man only is a form of introversion-ra- cial introversion-and introversion is as- sumed to be unwholesome, unhealthful. Introversion is undesirable because man contains dry rot, man embodies impuri- ties; man, in short, is corruptible. Intro- version feeds upon these impurities in man and results in the further growth of these undesirable attributes. Therefore, an attitude contained in the term "hu- manity" must be annulled if the individ- ual is ever to attain sounder virtues. In Roan Stallion and Tamar and Other Poems Jeffers states his thesis explicitly. Humanity is the start of the race; I say Humanity is the mold to break away from, the crust to break through, the coal to break into fire, The atom to be split.2 To make clear his thesis Jeffers fre- quently makes use of incest as a symbol to show the evil effects of introversion in the race; a result of an attitude of hu- manity, as he sees it. Incest and its con- sequences stand, as he employs them, in the same relationship to a family as does an attitude of humanity for all men. For both are introvertive in the sense that they are a kind of turning-inward, a proc- ess of invagination, as the zoalogist and biologist might speak of it. In the poem Tamar, for example, are shown the evil effects of incest in the Cauldwell family. Years previous to the opening of the narrative, David Cauld- well and his sister Helen have committed incest. In the poem itself Tamar, the daughter, in turn commits incest with her brother Lee and then seduces her father into an implied incest. To read the poem as an incestuous narrative only would stop short of its probable intended meaning. The incest is a symbol of the evil of introversion of a race that has an attitude of humanity only. By such an attitude, Jeffers seems to be saying all mankind is realizing a degradation and decay as certain as that among the Cauldwell family. Flooding the whole poem is an atmos- phere of predeterminism. For Tamar re- peatedly iterates that she is subjected to a pattern of life that was begun by her progenitors. In point she says: .... Life is an old story, repeating itself like the leaves of a tree Or the lips of an idiot [Tamar, p. 1431]. Then again: .... It [incest of the father and sister] makes me nothing, My darling sin a shadow and me a doll on wires [Tamar, p. 12M]. Then Helen, the dead aunt and sister: .... A trap [incest] so baited Was laid to catch you before the world began, Before the granite foundation. ,.. [Tamar, p. 12]. This acceptance of determinism, Jef- fers seems to affirm, is present not only 2 Modern Library ed., p. 13.</page><page sequence="3">172 COLLEGE ENGLISH in the Cauldwell family's attitude to- ward incest but also in the attitude of humanity among men. Consequently, he sees incest and racial introversion, the re- sult of an attitude of humanity, be it al- ways remembered, as' something old as the race itself and an indigenous part of man's evolution. Incest is used again as a symbol in The Women of Point Sur. Barclay, a min- ister, loses faith in his work with his con- gregation, goes to the West Coast, and later commits incest with his daughter. Here again Jeffers implies how strongly ingrained in man is this attitude of hu- manity. For Barclay, though trying to accept a nonanthropomorphic attitude toward his universe (Jeffers' attitude), succumbs in the end to an anthropomor- phic one and thinks of himself as God and the ranch folk as his disciples. Incest, with its evil consequences, Jeffers tries to say again, is a symbol of the introver- sion that results from an attitude of hu- manity exemplified in Barclay and his anthropomorphic philosophy. Of the poem itself, Jeffers says that he tried: i. To strip everything but its natural ugliness from unmoral freedom. 2. To show in action the danger of that Roan Stallion idea of "breaking out of humanity," misinterpreted in the mind of a fool or lunatic. 3. To present a satire on human self-impor- tance, and a judgment of the tendencies of our civilization. 4. To attempt to uncenter the human mind from itself.3 Barclay, therefore, represents the per- son who. misunderstands and misinter- prets Jeffers' idea of breaking away from the mold of humanity. Holding to his an- thropomorphic philosophy, a thing Jef- fers rejects because of its unhealthful connotations for man, Barclay lives and advocates an unmoral freedom. As he tries to show in the poem, Jeffers in ad- vocating a breaking-away from human- ity is not at the same time advocating an unmoral freedom, license of the individ- ual. Rather he is saying that unless man can give up his attitude of looking at himself as man only, he will continue both an unmoral freedom and an intro- version of which incest is the essential symbol. In short, Jeffers is saying that the indi- vidual must subject himself to a rigid dis- cipline and must use a strength that he can get not from other human beings but from the power of the external world. This major thesis is summarily given in a short poem "The Answer" in the volume Such Counsels You Gave to Me (Collected Poems, p. 594): Then what is the answer?-Not to be deluded by dreams. To know that great civilizations have broken down into violence, and their tyrants come, many times before. To keep one's own integrity, be merciful and uncorrupted and not wish for evil; and not be duped By dreams of universal justice or happiness. These dreams will not be fulfilled. To know this and know that however ugly the parts appear the whole remains beautiful. A severed hand Is an ugly thing, a man dissevered from the earth and stars and his history .. .. for con- templation or in fact .... Often appears atrociously ugly. Integrity is wholeness, the greatest beauty is Organic wholeness, the wholeness of life and things, the divine beauty of the universe. Love that, not man Apart from that or else you will share man's piti- ful confusions, or drown in despair when his days darken. This wholeness, Jeffers says, is at- tained through a balance. That balance he sees as a combination of the universal s Lawrence Powell, Robinson Jeffers: Th'e Man and His Work (Los Angeles: Primavera Press, 1934), P. 44-</page><page sequence="4">THE BREAD THAT EVERY MAN MUST EAT ALONE 173 power as found in objective external na- ture and the elementals of human life ex- emplified in the herdsman and the pan- theistic poet, never of the objective uni- versal with the humanity of cities. This point of view is stated in part in the poem "Still the Mind Smiles." Still the mind smiles at its own rebellions, Knowing all the while that civilization and the other evils That make humanity ridiculous, remain Beautiful in the whole fabric, excesses that bal- ance each other Like the paired wings of a flying bird. It is necessary to remember our norm, the un- altered passions, .... the changed lives of herdsmen and moun- tain farms Where men are few, and few tools, a few weap- ons, and their dawns are beautiful. From here for normal one sees both ways, And listens to the splendor of God, the exact poet, the sonorous Antistrophe of desolation to the strophe multi- tude.4 Here is stated Jeffers' ratio for the norm. The whole of the universe must be viewed. Of that whole, external nature should be much in quantity, while men should be few, for men en masse, as in cities, lose the balance by overweighting the scales with humanity. That is the evil of civilization. Again Jeffers expresses this ratio of the universal power in the objective ex- ternal world and the elementals of human life in the poem "The Place for No Story," page 125 in Thurso's Landing. The coast hills at Sovranes Creek: No trees but dark scant pasture drawn thin Over rock shaped like flame; Human presence here could do anything But dilute the lonely self-watchful passion. Again in "Battle" in Be Angry at the Sun, page 130: . . . . It would be better for men To be few and live apart, where none could in- fect another; then slowly the sanity of the field and moun- tain And the cold ocean and glittering stars might enter their minds. As long, therefore, Jeffers seems to say, as a balance of the universal power of.the objective external world with the elementals of human life can be main- tained, so long is man breaking through the crust of humanity. To understand this fully, it is impor- tant to know Jeffers' theology. As Yvor Winters says in his essay in Zabel's Lit- erary Opinion in America, page 245, Jef- fers is essentially a pantheist and like Wordsworth sees nature as deity. But Jeffers' God, or nature, is "the nature of the physics textbook .... a kind of self- sufficient mechanism." Such a theology, since Jeffers tips the scales in favor of ex- ternal nature as God, and since nature or God is a self-sufficient mechanism to him, and since he sees the world of man and his civilization (humanity, that is) gradually decaying, causes him to cling to the external world. For there is found the example of strength and self-suffi- ciency-two values that Jeffers prizes. As one therefore reads and reflects upon Jeffers' longer poems, one inevita- bly sees his characters degrade them- selves and decay. Their degradation and decay come when they either are unable to see and to maintain this balance of the power of the objective external world and the elementals of human life or refuse to act it out once they do see it.

They are to a large extent symbolical of all mankind. Like them, mankind, because of its in- cestuous humanity, too will "go the old way down," as E. A. Robinson says. Jef- fers seems to agree, too, with the Robin- sonian phrase: "It's the bread that every man must eat alone." The question raised by Jeffers eight- een years ago and reiterated specifically by De Sales today-How can an incon- sistency and an incompatibility of the in- dividual with his social milieu be re- solved?-faces us realistically.</page></plain_text>
