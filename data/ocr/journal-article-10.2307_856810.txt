<plain_text><page sequence="1">THE PLACE OF WILLIAM BLAKE IN ENGLISH ART P BY ROBERT ROSS M 'To one who fixes his eye on the ideal goal, the greatest art often seems the greatest failure, because it alone reminds him of what it should have been. Trivial stimulations coming from vulgar objects, on the .contrary, by making us forget altogether the possibility of a deep satisfaction, often succeed in interesting and winning applause.' -Santayana. ' HAT every great school comes to an end with the birth of the founder' is the unconscious testa- ment of William Blake, because the world could never tolerate any dis- ciple of his, and criticism which found it difficult to estimate or even comprehend the master might become justly impatient of any attempt to found a tradition or evolve a theory of painting on his com- plex and unequal art. That he influenced many of his contemporaries is of course obvious. Notably those fascinating and unappreciated artists, Edward Calvert and George Richmond. Both, however, pos- sessed an individuality and temperament which developed on entirely different lines. It is among later English draughtsmen that we must look for the influence-not a very fortunate one-of this great and singular man, who enjoys an isolation similar to that of Milton in English litera- ture ; for by his poems, his mysticism and criticism, no less than his painting, he is after all a back-water, having little relation to the main stream of English art and letters. Forty years after his death he was still a memory, a kind of sacred memory to those who had been privileged to know him, though to the world scarcely more than a name until Gilchrist published the life in 1863, when there sprang up a kind of cultus, fostered by the Rossettis, Bell Scott and Mr. Swinburne, for the man and his work. Enthusiasm has developed into scholarship, and Blake is now fair sport for the maker of footnotes. His prophetic books have their interpreters. The text of his poetry having suffered somewhat from the art of Onomacritus, has been re- 150 stored to its original purity in the Oxford edition and that of Messrs. Ellis &amp; Yeats. Indeed it is chiefly among literary people that his reputation has steadily increased. The marvellous illuminations with which he embellished his prophecies and poems have long been highly prized by book col- lectors, who welcome in his unique deco- ration a peculiar sweetness and beauty else- where only found in mediaeval manuscripts, of which they are derivative. But they are entirely original in treatment and con- ception, bearing no comparison to the skil- ful modern pastiches of an obsolete art. The designs for the Book of Job are accepted not only as Blake's masterpiece in engraving, but as one of the world's masterpieces of illustration. No finer consecutive series of designs to any book exists. A series too often varies in merit, one falling short of another ; whereas in the Job illustrations the execution and idea are evenly balanced and sustained through- out. Rewarded by posterity as mystic, poet and illuminator, his place as a painter is still undetermined in the English school. Let us examine the shrine at any rate for ourselves, and then correct or verify our impressions by consulting the learned oracles issuing from the Cumean caves of criticism. Those who dislike Blake often dislike intellectual manifestations in fine art, and those who admire him indiscriminately and are tickled by his oddity not infre- quently know nothing about art in any form. Yet painting, however aristocratic it must always be in its aim, can be demo- cratic in its appeal. No scholarship is necessary to appreciate the obvious quali- ties, at all events, of a work by Van Eyck or Sargent, to take instances very remote from each other except in the kinship of</page><page sequence="2">ALN /' IJ . .

A natural per- ception, a taste (despite Reynolds), is in- herent in many people, without any edu- cation or cultivation ; whereas a relish for literature is the result either of education and environment, or that servile imitation of dominating personalities which consti- tutes Fashion. Now Blake requires, and it may be counted to his advantage or disadvantage, a certain amount of culture before he can be appreciated; he is pre-eminently a literary painter, to use the fashionable slang of fifteen years ago; and his admirers claim with somejustice that he must be approached on all sides of his extraordinary genius, as painter, designer, poet, philosopher, pro- phet, mystic, and man. So you must look on this imperfect mass of intelligence, William Blake, as you would look on some vast gothic cathedral, irregular in its archi- tecture, unscientific in its construction, lacking the unity, the harmony, of a basilica, where you find the colours are sometimes beautiful, at others harsh and crude ; in- scrutable in its symbolism, monstrous and grotesque in its accessories, yet so stupen- dous in conception. And you may experi- ence a feeling of disappointment till, as when halting before a side chapel the glimpse of a picture rouses you from de- jection, some flash of colour and glint of gold woo you to seek interpretation of un- familiar symbols in Mrs.Jamieson (Baedeker for the nonce having failed); so, too, in the case of William Blake, Mr. Archibald Rus- sell, Mr. Yeats, or the indispensable Gil- christ, will initiate you a catechumen into the fascinating arcana of the artist. The intolerance of the convert, however, must not prevent you allowing many of those gifted with an exquisite perception and a wide knowledge of art to turn aside from Blake and all his works as unsympathetic. It would be difficult to imagine a French- man or anyone whose mind was exclusively Latin and objective in its proclivities, be- stowing even curiosity, much less admira- tion, on such disturbing transcendental art. In the heaven of painting there are, fortu- nately, many mansions, and they were not all designed by Whistler and R. A. M. Stevenson. The consideration of all deceased mas- ters from an historical point of view is a tedious but necessary preface to their study even when, as in Blake's case, the subject is a side issue of the English school. From Hogarth till Turner's death in I85i you can trace a regular tradition in painting which closes with the transfor- mation scene and pyrotechnics of the Pre- raphaelites. Since then every painter has gone his own way: some to France, some to the open air, while others have entrenched themselves in the fifteenth- century fortresses, where for want of other nourishment they gnaw the skeletons of D. G. Rossetti and Burne-Jones. That seems a fair bird's-eye view of English art, but it requires expansion! It is still a popu- lar error to suppose that the Reformation, which ruthlessly destroyed so many beau- tiful objects, is responsible for the poverty of Early English painting. The school of English illuminators and that of the em- broiderers (unsurpassed at one period by anything on the Continent) was stifled long before the close of the fifteenth century. Architecture alone of the arts seems to have flourished as a background for the wonder- ful literature which was to follow. I do not care to hazard what we might have achieved in painting had the Armada landed in England and our brains become fertilized by a Spanish invasion, but I sometimes think that the failure of that ingenious project was a blow to English art from which it still reels, and that the Rokeby Velazquez might have been painted by an Englishman. From whatever loss or cause, art remained an exotic until Hogarth. A few years later the programme of the new English school '55</page><page sequence="5">JIilliam Blake in English dArt was promulgated by the cultivated SirJoshua Reynolds. But the policy of the Discourses was never carried out ; or, when carried out, led to very disastrous results, particu- larly in historical and religious pictures. Turner and Gainsborough, to take two typical, and perhaps the two greatest pain- ters of whom we can boast, were splendid contradictions to the theories which they advocated. This does not impugn the soundness of the theories, but it explains to some extent our too short-lived tradition. It was by his painting, not by his precepts, that Reynolds crystallized the trend of our style and strengthened the tyranny of the eighteenth century under which Blake chafed. ' Classicality,' says Mr. Claude Phillips, or what people were pleased to accept as such, was in the air radiating not so much from France as from Italy .... That this peculiar phase of pseudo-classicism if not born in England flourished and ac- quired increased proportions on English soil is undeniable.' Against that pseudo- classicism Blake's art is a protest and a revo- lution; but it was a revolution in which, in painting at least, there was only one con- spirator. The various friends or painters who recognized Blake's genius could do nothing but sympathize, like Mr. Michael Finsbury. They did not understand: to them a tear was not an' intellectual thing'' but HO emanating from the eye of a sen- timental female attitudinizing over a cracked urn; while' the bitter groan of a martyr's woe' Dr. Johnson would have pointed out was not 'an arrow' whatever else it might be. Some of them, like Fuseli, admired and influenced the frightful side of his art, one of its least admirable qualities shared in common with other contemporaries; but Blake is the first Englishman prepared, like Dante, to paint an angel or spirit: the only eighteenth-century painter, you may say, who visualized the host of heaven. More- over, I think he is the one artist who has presented the anthropomorphism of the Supreme Being without a tinge of pagan- ism; and since Michael Angelo, without a tinge of absurdity. When against the tyranny of the eigh- teenth century came the gothic revival, originated by Walpole and Beckford, Blake with Chatterton might have expected to share some of the doubtful glory associated in the movement, on account of his critical appreciation of a despised mediaevalism, to which he stands much in the same relation as Winckelmann does to antiquity. Any- one knows, or can find out, more about mediaevalism than Blake, but working as a boy in the dim chapels of Westminster for the engraver Basire, he absorbed the spirit and realized the aesthetic value of primitive art, which the cultured Sir Joshua and every other painter and almost every critic of the time failed to do, even when they went to Italy; or perhaps be- cause they did so. At the same time it must be remem- bered that Blake constitutes no link in English painting. Without Gainsborough, Cozens, Crome, and Constable, the English school would have lacked as much as if there had been no Hogarth, Reynolds, Turner, or Rossetti (to separate momentarily the forces, from the bases of English paint- ing). Blake, on the other hand, did not change its character, and for this reason he has been overlooked. He is an exquisite accident. It is idle to scold his contem- poraries for not appreciating him. Even his biographers and friends admit he was ' difficult,' and in later life he obtained more patronage than you would suppose an artist who was neither an old master, a por- trait painter, nor a mediocrity, could ever receive in England. It is still a matter of conjecture whether the function of a painter is to express himself or become the 156 1 For a tear is an intellectual thing And a sigh is the sword of an angel King And the bitter groan of a martyr's woe Is an arrow from the Almighty's bow.

The mediae- val artists were never asked their opinion: they were paid to work out the thoughts and beliefs of ecclesiastics, republics, and sovereigns. It was Julius II who allowed craftsmen to become individuals. The modern patron, bullied by his own archi- tect or artist, might opine that the system was not without its advantages, and I think Mr. MacColl has pointed out that some of Turner's greatest landscapes were the com- missions of self-willed noblemen who in- sisted on a point of view of their own selection for the artist's easel. In the eighteenth century, at all events, and for a long time afterwards, artists wil- lingly or unwillingly reflect their age, its fashions, its follies, its bad taste. Blake is an exception. He only ex- pressed himself and the views of mystics and a few middle-class spiritualists. How startling to compare his pictures, of which the motive is a religious one, with any other work of analogous motive executed between I750 and his death in I824. One of the most interesting is that of the Nativity in the collection of Mr. Sydney Morse.2 No other European artist has dared to represent the actual miraculous parturition. Though he seems to endorse a gnostic heresy, Blake has given us the most tender and beautiful presentation of the greatest subject in the world. It is a significant fact that the reckless circulation of the Bible which followed the Reformation did not suggest to the painters of Europe any fresh or satisfactory convention for the stories in scripture which can be said to have superseded the work of their Catholic predecessors with this single exception. In horrible presentations of religious themes the modern Catholic painters have, I fear, far excelled their Protestant contemporaries. Charles Lamb, one of Blake's admirers, complained that the English were too Protestant to paint the Madonna. But Blake has painted her very often. Not as the coarse model posing at one shil- ling an hour, but as a type of dignity-- the dignity of living art, no less than the symbol of a living faith. In the Central Park Museum at New York is one of his more exquisite water colours-a Riposo which evinces the delicate precision of an early Chinese drawing and that sacrosanct aloofness from probability necessary in pictures intended for devotional purpose. Blake invests the great stories of the Bible with his own atmosphere, just as when he is illustrating Milton, Gray, or Shakespeare he offers an interpretation entirely his own and does not attempt to act as middle-man between the poet and the reader. His significance, however, as an imaginative artist can better be under- stood if we recall Sir Joshua Reynolds's famous portrait of Dr. Beattie, in which the Angel of Truth routs the demons of unbelief, one of whom is represented by Voltaire. Goldsmith had the great good taste to rebuke Reynolds for this perform- ance. Compare it with Blake's Spiri- tual Form of Pitt guiding Behemoth, now concealed somewhere in the National Gallery, and it will be seen that with the limitations of Sir Joshua commenced the range and scope of Blake's genius. But symbolism is not art, and our old friend technique-the Mesopotamia of a critic's vocabulary-must be taken into account. Blake's power of design, of filling an empty space, his skill or want of skill in articu- lating forms or ideas, should be carefully examined quite apart from their poetic and mystic impulses. For composition, the original treatment of the Crucifixion may be specially noted; only Rembrandt in his etching and Tin- toretto at San Cassiano in Venice, have surpassed the intensity of this design. 2 Reproduced in the BURLINGTON MAGAZINE for March 1904. N 161</page><page sequence="9">William Blake in EnglishA vrt Unless on the ceiling of the Sixtine Chapel, where can you discover a worthy prece- dent for the divine epilepsy of generation Blake renders in the Elohim creating Adam? It is terrific, like some great chorus from Atalanta. For rhythmic grouping you can scarcely find in Puvis de Chavannes or Burne- Jones anything finer than the Hecate. And in the decorations of the prophetic books, on which butterflies might have fought duels and stained the pages with their life's colour, Blake sometimes seems to have con- jured from posterity the enchanted palette of Mr. Charles Conder. Fascinating as it may be to dwell on his poetry and mysticism, it is merely as an artist in pigment that he concerns us for the present.3 Like every sane4 healthy Englishman, who despised what he could not do himself, Blake derided the use of oil, in which he was never proficient. That most refractory of mediums has proved an insurmountable difficulty with many of our great artists. But in water-colour (the tank to which the whale of British art criticism retires when at bay) he executed delightful works. The method he called 'fresco' and used in the Canterbury Pilgrims was admirably adapted to his severe and archaistic style. It was not fresco at all, in the real sense of the word, but according to Linnell 'water- colour on a plaster ground (literally glue and whiting) . .. They come nearer to tempera in process than anything else, in- asmuch as the white was laid on and mixed with the colours which were tempered with carpenters' glue. And he would 'pass a very thin transparent wash of glue water over the whole parts he had worked upon and then proceeded with his finishings.' 5 Rossetti hailed his primitive practice of placing tints side by side in their utmost force, and like Rossetti and many an artist of the British school he is wofully inaccu- rate in his drawing, although its felicity and daring startle you into accepting the peculiar convention-the adroit illusion of correctness. Himself quoted oddly enough the criticism of Gravelot, 'De English may be very clever in deir own opinion, but day do not draw.' Failure made Blake vain ; he would never use models. To understand his attitude towards nature -an intensely subjective attitude-his philosophy must be studied. It was not that of M. Rodin or Sidney Cooper.6 He would certainly have delighted in the Japanese practice, yet he seldom arrives at the realism of the oriental artists, although you think him the most oriental of all occi- dentals in his forms and ideas. His 'illuminated prints' must not be con- fused with the rather foolish eighteenth- century colour prints now so dear for col- lectors and dealers. Tatham supplied Ros- setti with the following description of their process : Blake, when he wanted to make his prints in oil took a common millboard and drew, in some strong ink or colour, his design upon it strong and thick. He painted upon that in such oil colours and in such a state of fusion that they would blur well. He painted roughly and quickly, so that no colour would have time to dry. He then took a print of that on paper, and this impression he coloured up in water colours, repainting his out- line on the millboard when he wanted to take an- other print. This plan he had recourse to because At a gallery (with which I have the honour of being con- nected) there is being held during June and July an extensive exhibition of his works, far more comprehensive even than the show held in 1904. The Nativity is unfortunately absent, but Sir William Stirling Maxwell sends the superb Canterbury Pil- grimns, the finest of all Blake's I fresco' pictures. Sir Charles Dilke and Mr. Graham Robertson are among other generous contributors, while the entire undispersed portion of the Butt's Collection makes this the most representative exhibition of Blake's art ever held in England. For the first time a com- plete set of the colour prints (exclusive of those in the prophetic books) have been brought together. 4 A discussion of Blake's sanity would be out of character in the BURLINGTON MAGAZINE, however suitable to the pages of The Lancet, where, as in Hamlet's case, it might be extended to conjectures of whether the commentators are mad, or only pre- tend to be; either view may be adopted. Blake's art, however, certainly lacked the noble sanity we envy in the Greeks, though the materialism of the Dutch is happily absent. - Nollekens Smith. 6 When M. Rodin was entertained at a congratulatory ban- quet in England he delivered as his message to contemporary English painters, 'Copy nature.' A few days previously the veteran Sidney Cooper was asked to give a message-it was his. last-to the younger generation; he replied, and the coincidence. is significant, ' Copy nature.' 162</page><page sequence="10">ntt T4,1 iP i44 PICTURES BY WILLIAM BLAKE, PLATE V.

As a pioneer of process he should appeal to my friend Mr. Joseph Pennell. Mr. Graham Robertson, who has him- self produced skilful copies of the illumi- nated prints and charming designs of his own by the same process, informs me that Tatham's account is fairly accurate. Very few people read the letterpress of an art magazine, but a few words must be added in regard to the illustrations repro- duced here. The Adam7 is one of the finest and best preserved examples of the fresco method. The type of head faintly recalls some cast of the antique, unusual in the ostro-gothic Blake. It is signed and dated I8Io. Pity 8is a characteristic illustration of the lines in ' Macbeth' : And Pity, like a naked new-born babe, Striding the blast, or heaven's cherubim, horsed Upon the sightless couriers of the air. No one but Blake would ever have seen in this passage an occasion for a picture. Queen Catherine's Vision (1807)9 is an ex- ample of the more objective illustration to which he condescended occasionally, and with such delightful results. The River ofLife,Ioin the opinion of many judges Blake's most beautiful water-colour, is a characteristic illustration for the last chapter of Revelation. The Sacrijfce of 'ephthah's Daughter (1803)I" is a striking example of Blake's mystic actuality, and may be compared with the more usual presentations of the subject. Many of us will recall the way in which the rather gruesome incident is 'explained away' in the little manuals which purvey simple Bible teaching to children. ' Learned commentators' (no name stated) ' believe that Jephthah placed his daughter in a kind of Sisterhood.' The hated alternative of nunnery would have been a worse contingency than the text implied. In Blake's drawing there is no doubt whatever as to the termination of the tragedy; it is as plain as the Bible narra- tive. The Compassion of Pharaoh's Daughter 12 is chosen for its calm Byzantine naivet6. It is typical of the violent contrast existing between Blake's treatment of a scripture theme and the ceracious religiosity which passes for sacred art. It is unjust, as I have suggested, to ac- cuse the English of neglecting their great men. They only suspect them. This is particularly noticeable in regard to those who distinguish themselves in different arts. The reception accorded to Rossetti is an instance of what I mean. Blake is suspected of being a poet by painters, and of being a painter by the critics of poetry. If he had only been a prophet they would have taken him seriously with John Wes- ley, Whitfield, and Edward Irving. Except at Oxford and Cambridge no one is al- lowed to be a double first, and then it is always supposed to refer to some event in the university sports. A contemporary painter of my acquaintance, who is re- garded by many people, including myself, as the Dr. Jekyll of art, is in secret a Hyde among jewellers, but he tells me he would be ruined in Hatton Garden if his real profession was discovered. I will not spoil his chances at the Academy by betraying any coincidences for identification, but I trust that the study of William Blake's life and William Blake's art in all its phases may lead some of us to take a less sus- picious attitude towards the great men who have chosen many instruments for re- vealing their genius and impressing their personality on an iron age and an ungrate- ful people. 7 Plate I, p. 151. 9 Plate III, p. 157. 11 Plate V, p. 163. 8 Plate II, p. 154. 10 Plate IV, p. i6o. 12 Plate VI, p 166. 167</page></plain_text>
