Jewish teachers and scholars may not have developed their theology in a systematic fashion, but have long wished to speak about the God to whom they pray. And they continue to attempt to understand and articulate something of the relationship in which they stand to that God. That women may also wish to speak about God, understand their own experiences in relation to the Divine, should not surprise us. A feminist theology is, quite simply that. Women speaking about God and about themselves in relation to their religious tradition. Why should we wish to do this? The edifice of Judaism is massive, all-encompassing. There is not one area of Jewish life that is not addressed - childhood, education, marriage, divorce, illness, death. And time, too, is measured out from year to year, week to week, day to day: daily prayers, the Sabbath, festivals, all have their laws, their prescriptions. Even the space we inhabit, the societies of which we are a part - our homes, our schools, our synagogues, our places of work, our relations with fellow Jews and non-Jews, not to mention man's relationship with woman, these have all been prescribed and written down over the centuries as Jews have, often dynamically and creatively, struggled to integrate contemporary life with their Judaism. So why another theology? And why a feminist theology? The American scholar of Jewish liturgy, Lawrence Hoffman, once described Judaism as a "half-empty bookcase", because, he explained, the sources of Judaism - the Hebrew Bible, the Mishnah, the Talmud, the Codes, the prayerbooks - are all written by men and, therefore, offer a male perspective on the world. The voices of women are silent, absent from the Jewish construction of the universe and God. That there is an entire order of the Mishnah devoted to women (Nas him) is quite astonishing. Why is there not an order called Anashim (Men)? Virginia Woolf once described an experience she had while doing research at the library of the British Museum. Looking under the entry "Woman" in the card catalogue, she discovered numerous entries - books about women's psychology, women's literature, women's nature and so on. But when she looked under the entry "Man", she discovered nothing - no cards and not even the classification. This observation by Woolf and many others has led to the formulation of a critique, largely, though not exclusively by women who present the following argument. It is clear, they reason, that our society, its institutions, its language, its perceptions are male European Judaism, Vol, 26, No. 2, Autumn 1993 (Issue 51) creations. These are termed as normative, absolute. Anything on the edge of these cannot be termed normative, but "other". This is how Simone de Beauvoir, in The Second Sex , expresses it: Just as for the ancients there was an absolute vertical with reference to which the oblique was defined, so there is an absolute human type, the masculine . . . She is defined and differentiated with reference to man and not he with reference to her; she is the incidental, the inessential as opposed to the essential. He is the subject - she is the Other.1 Mary Daly, in Beyond God the Father , takes the argument a little bit further: Women have been extra-environmentals to human society. We have been foreigners not only to the fortresses of political power but also to those citadels in which thought processes have been spun out, creating a net of meaning to capture reality. In a sexist world, symbol systems and conceptual apparatuses have been male creations. These do not reflect the experience of women, but rather function to falsify our own self-image and experience.3 Not only is patriarchy, then, seen as normative, but it falsifies women's self-image and experience. And so Mary Daly exhorts women to live "on the boundary of patriarchal institutions." "To exist humanly is to name the self, the world and God." Feminism is no more than this - the right of women to think, speak and name for themselves - about their own experience, about the world they live in and about God. Two major difficulties emerge once you subject Judaism to a feminist critique. One, is that there is no going back. Once you have discovered that a sharp distinction exists between the labels put on women by men and between the labels placed by women on themselves, there is an oceanic discovery that a male assessment and placement of the female character is tantamount to the non- Jew who seeks to define the identity of the Jew. Rabbinic adjectives used to describe women are not flattering. We are described as haughty, eavesdroppers, tale-bearers, gadabouts, gossips; we are strident and envious. In a sense, the truth of these labels is unimportant. They are, in any case, hardly objective, dispassionate labels, but highly charged accusations which say something about 5</page><page sequence="3">Jewish Feminist Theology Alexandra Wright women stepping out of line with the "male norm" or with a male expectation of what a woman and her role should be. The discovery goes beyond descriptions of a woman's character to her legal status in Judaism. Susanna Heschel, in her article, "Jewish and Christian Feminist Theologies," understands a woman's role in Jewish legislation in this way: Women enter the male-authored discussions of rabbinic texts only when they affect a man's life - when he marries or divorces, for example. Men stand as the subjects of rabbinic law; it is the man who acquires a wife in marriage or issues her a divorce . . . she remains the object of Jewish legal concern, rather than the subject who formulates, interprets, and regulates the legislation.3 Women's physiological differences - times of menstruation and childbirth - subjected women to very strict laws of separation for periods of time when women were said to be ritually impure. The morning blessing recited by men that praises God for not having made them a woman expresses perfectly the self- perception held by men. A man fits perfectly into the halakhic structure - he is brought into the covenant with circumcision, he is educated and has access to all texts, he becomes Bar Mitzvah and therefore subject to all the laws, he takes a wife and can divorce her; upon his shoulders rests the obligation to perform all the positive and negative commandments, including the duty to propagate. Finally he, and he alone is permitted to recite the prayer of mourning on the death of a near relative. The woman does not fit so easily into this structure, but then it is not made for her. She can be the high priestess of her own home, but she is exempt from certain positive, time-bound commandments, which means that she is often excluded from important moments of celebration. And as important, her status as a member of the congregation of Israel is not considered to be equal. Anyone who has been in a house of mourning or at a funeral where there are no close male relatives will notice how a daughter or widow is passed over in the search for a male to recite Kaddish. Women were, indeed, still are in some circles, associated with three mitzvot which define their sphere of activity and interest as far as men are concerned: they are to observe the commandment of separating the challah , the laws of menstrual purity {niddah) and the lighting of the Sabbath candles. To the woman was universally applied a verse from Psalms (45:14) "All glorious is the king's daughter 6 within" which was interpreted to mean that a woman's honour was upheld by the desirability for seclusion and privacy in her own home and certainly not by mixing in society. Once you have reached the awareness that woman are not considered to be shapers of Jewish tradition, once you realise that the principles applied to women are not of their own making, then it is very difficult to return to the myth of the Jewish woman as "king's daughter". The second problem that arises from a feminist critique is even more threatening. Feminist studies of Judaism touch on every aspect of Jewish scholarship - Biblical, halakhic, aggadic , ethical and theological; and every aspect of Jewish life-prayer, ritual, rabbinic work and so on. What will be the outcome of this critique? Surely we will end up with a Judaism that we scarcely recognise? Feminism's detractors ask: does not feminism taint Judaism, and weaken the very institutions that have been our monuments for three and a half thousand years? If this question sounds too extreme, it is meant to. Part of the suspicion and fear about feminism emanates from a feeling that Judaism is sustaining an assault on the very principles that define it. For example, the Jewish liturgy is composed of blessings addressed to God, to whom we speak using metaphors of maleness such as King, Lord, Shepherd and so on. Cynthia Ozick rebukes those feminists who, she says "tinker with the language of liturgy" and who would like to substitute "Queen of the Universe" for "King of the Universe" in an attempt to make the liturgy gender-free, or at least admitting metaphors of femaleness for God. The answer stuns with its crudity. It is preposterous. What? Millennia after the cleansing purity of Abraham's vision of One Creator, a return to Astarte, Hera, Juno, Venus, and all their proliferating sisterhood? Sex goddesses, fertility goddesses, mother goddesses? The sacrifices brought to these were often enough human. This is the new vision intended to "restore dignity" to Jewish women? A resurrection of every ancient idolatry the Jewish idea came into the world to drive out, so as to begin again with a purifying clarity? The answer slanders and sullies monotheism.4 Ozick argues that pursuing this argument is the result of asking the wrong kind of question. It is just as absurd European Judaism, Vol, 26, No. 2, Autumn 1993 (Issue 51)</page><page sequence="4">Alexandra Wright Jewish Feminist Theology to speak of God using male metaphors as it is using female anthropomorphic imagery. "It is," she says, "as foolish to refer to the Creator-of the Universe as He as it is to refer to the Creator-of the Universe as She". The nature of the divinity, she continues, is a theological question "and Jews traditionally have no theology. Concerning the nature of God, we are enjoined to be agnostic, and not to speculate. "You will see My back, but My face you will not see." And when Moses asks God about the nature of the divinity, the reply is only: "I am that I am." I do not find this line of argument particularly satisfactory. Apart from side-stepping the crucial issue of what language we should use to address God, it is illusion to suggest that Jews have no theology and that the humaij task is simply to be decent to each other. I would argue that our decency to each other is not simply a humanistic imperative, but is directly underpinned by our theology and by our understanding of how God works and what we think God wants of us. Judith Plaskow's refutation of Ozick's argument represents another strand of Jewish feminism. "Religious symbols," she argues, "are significant and powerful communications. Since through them, a community expresses its sense and experience of the world, it cannot allow missing pronouns to determine its sense of reality. The maleness of God is not arbitrary - nor is it simply a matter of pronouns. It leads us to the central question, the question of the Otherness of women, just as the Otherness of women leads to the maleness of God." "Here," she continues, "we confront a great scandal:" the God who supposedly transcends sexuality, who is presumably one and whole, is known to us through language that is highly selective and partial. The images we use to describe God, the qualities we attribute to God, draw on male pronouns and male experience and convey a sense of power and authority that is clearly male in character. The God at the surface of Jewish consciousness is a God with a voice of thunder, a God who as Lord and King rules his people and leads them into battle, a God who forgives like a father when we turn to him.5 Language is not the only issue here, but it is absolutely crucial and forms a central part of the feminist critique. Both Judaism and Christianity are based on the religious principle of imitatio Dei , that God provides a "model" for humanity. In traditional European Judaism, Vol, 26, No . 2, Autumn 1993 (Issue 51) terms this is expressed through the idea that just as God rested on the seventh day, so also are we enjoined to rest on the Sabbath; just as God raises up those who are bent low, feeds the hungry, cares for the widow and orphan, heals the sick or makes peace in the highest, so also are we bound to perform these ethical acts that will bring our world to a state that more readily reflects the wholeness of its Creator. When you apply this analysis to male images for God, says Plaskow, "They both claim to tell us about the divine nature and they justify a human community that reserves power and authority to men. When God is pictured as male in a community that understands "man" to have been created in God's image, it only makes sense that maleness functions as the norm of Jewish humanity.6 The outcome for women is two-fold; status and character are defined in quite specific terms. For example, the Biblical law of divorce is expressed in this way: "When a man takes a woman and possesses her ( b ' alah ), if she fails to please him because he finds something obnoxious about her, then he writes her a bill of divorcement, hands it to her and sends her away from his house." (Deuteronomy 24: 1) Similarly, in the case of a man who marries a woman and then takes an aversion to her, making up charges against her that she was not a virgin when he married her, evidence must be brought by the woman's parent of her virginity. If the charges are false, then he is flogged and fined a hundred shekels which are given to the woman ' s father and she must remain as his wife. (Deut. 22: 13-19) The laws of slavery (Exodus 21) give one set of laws for a manservant and another set for a maidservant "who does not go free in the manner of male slaves." What happens to her is determined by whether her master finds her pleasing or not and is further complicated by whether he or his son decides to marry her or not. The point of these laws is not only that they reflect the subordinate social position of women in Biblical times (a position that has altered) but that the language describing the relationship between man and woman is one that contradicts the Jewish ethical principle of egalitarianism. Why when slavery was seen to be an unnecessary and immoral institution, did commentators and shapers of Judaism not acknowledge the subordinate, indeed subjugated position of women? The first stage of Jewish feminism was to redress the balance, literally to liberate women from a different and inferior position within the structure of halakha. And so, certainly within non-orthodox Judaism, we are 7</page><page sequence="5">Jewish Feminist Theology Alexandra Wright counted in a minyan , we are called to read to the Torah, we do wear kippah and tallii, we study Talmud and we are ordain/ed as Rabbis. That which was previously male terrain has been made available and possible for women. This accessibility to the male created religion has undoubtedly altered our status within Judaism. The other aspect of our "liberation" is to do with character and identity. Who are women, is the question that feminists attempt to answer in response to the evidence from our sources that state what men would like women to be, or who men think women are. If women were not idealised in rabbinic aggadah , they were put down or denied the status accorded to them in the Bible. Deborah is one such example - a woman who is exalted in biblical narrative and poetry, but denied her position as Judge in rabbinic literature. Beruriah, the wife of the second century R. Meir, is a celebrated case of a woman renowned for her scholarship and learning. A cruel mediaeval interpretation of her life sees her as a seductress, punished for claiming too much knowledge in a man's world. The examples multiply. Writing our own books to fill the "half-empty bookcase" is one way in which women are trying to answer that question about identity, about religious life and spiritual quest. It is inordinately difficult to bring a woman's life into the sphere of ritual, prayer or celebration because those events that have been important in women's lives, such as childbirth or miscarriage have stood outside the halakhic structure. They have not been seen as part of humanity's spiritual search for God. And yet, these events are central, indeed life-transforming for a woman and often for a man. And isn't it natural that we should want to try to understand how we stand in relation to God as we go through our natural cycles? And there is no shortage of metaphors for a nurturing, caring and loving God which can be drawn from Jewish tradition. Where the metaphors are inappropriate, then women will write their own midrash , their own prayers and devise their own rituals and celebrations - as indeed we have done already. Feminist theology, like all theology, begins not with God but with the self. How do I see God? What do I believe God wants from me? I am engaged in a dialectic that wrests from me an understanding of how I should act in this world, indeed what I should think and believe. I was brought up in a synagogue that espoused the ideology of classical reform Judaism. Its prayer and ritual was, and still is, refined; its emphasis on the ethical, and its sparseness of symbols gave it an 8 austerity that apparently suited my own temperament. "Man" was so small and so insignificant compared to the sovereignty and power of God. "For what are we? What is our life, and what our piety? What our goodness, and what our strength? What can we say before You, О Lord our God and God of our fathers...?" For all its liberalism, God was still that dominating, transcendent, kingly, authoritarian, father-figure who demanded moral excellence from His servants. Here was a religion that demanded self- abnegation. Man, in the words of the Yom Kippur confessional liturgy was seen as an arrogant, deceitful, hard-hearted, authoritarian, lustful, malevolent and ambitious creature. I returned to this synagogue as its rabbi and found myself increasingly troubled by the language of the prayerbook, not only the use of the generic terms of "man", "brothers", "fathers", but also the portrayal of humanity and anthropomorphic male images used of God. I was moved by the beauty of the liturgy, by the way our prayerbooks use Biblical quotation to exhort us to return to God, by the way it gave expression to the poverty of humanity's attributes compared to the might and compassion of God. But I found the image of man foreign, and his sins not necessarily the sins and weaknesses I found in myself. I wanted to confess the sins of self-depreciation, of feeling too much guilt, of failing to acknowledge the validity of my feelings; of failing to act when treated too condescendingly or with too much contempt. It is not difficult to find language to express such prayers. Nor was it difficult for me to articulate my praise and thanksgiving of new life when my children were born, though it was a scandal that no ritual existed to acknowledge and sanctify the miraculous event of birth. It is more difficult for me to deal with the issue of the language of God. I am uncomfortable with the constant use of male pronouns and metaphors in the Hebrew, and yet still loyal to the formulation of an ancient liturgy. Translations can work wonders and do a marvellous cosmetic job on the Hebrew, but they cannot change the essential meaning and implications of the Hebrew prayers. However hard we struggle for a neutral sounding English word, the patriarchal, male Hebrew word or phrase will remain - God as the "Commander of the hosts", Shepherd, King, Father, He, Him, You - in the second person masculine singular. Can I live with these words and metaphors? Perhaps that sounds like an arrogant question. It is not meant to be. Perhaps what will happen will be a rejection of patriarchy completely, to be followed by European Judaism, Vol, 26, No. 2, Autumn 1993 (Issue 51)</page><page sequence="6">Athalya Brenner Poetics of Pornography an acceptance of a liturgy enriched by metaphors and phrases that are drawn from both male and female imagery about God. Why is feminist theology so crucial to Judaism? It has opened up an entirely new dimension of spiritual creativity and thought that can only have a regenerative and renewing influence on Judaism. The Judaism that survives the feminist transformation will be a truly strong Judaism for the future. And above all, it will be a Judaism that honours completely the prophetic ideal of a broken society renewed and made whole through the vision and action of humanity in partnership with God.
