<plain_text><page sequence="1">BOOK REVIEWS-ISIS, 88: 3 (1997) This book is worth reading for Potter's voice-that of a thinker who has taken the ideas he writes about to heart and measured their weight by their usefulness in questions as ab- stract and intellectual as the relationship of phi- losophy to science and as personal as whether anthropomorphic conceptions (of God) are better or worse for being anthropomorphic. PATRICIA TURRISI Charlotte G. Borst. Catching Babies: The Pro- fessionalization of Childbirth, 1870-1920. xiv + 254 pp., figs., tables, app., index. Cambridge, Mass./London: Harvard University Press, 1995. $39.95. This meticulously researched and engagingly written contribution to the history of American midwifery is a fascinating account of the role midwives played in women's lives at the end of the nineteenth century and beginning of the twentieth. Charlotte Borst is impatient with the various historical narratives on the subject of childbirth that have assumed much with little ev- idence, and she sets the record straight on a num- ber of historical issues in a study that is sensitive to gender, ethnicity, race, and class. Her book is a significant contribution to our understanding of the experience of birth in this country and of the professional and social contexts in which it oc- curred. The local study (of four counties in Wiscon- sin) is essential to the author's ability to trace with great precision the transition from midwife to obstetrician, and Borst is especially adept at weaving qualitative and quantitative evidence together without interrupting the flow of her story. Beginning with a detailed description of the midwife in her social and ethnic milieu, Borst demonstrates the extent to which the entire birth- ing process was embedded in traditional com- munal and gender relationships. She argues that although by the end of the century reliance on neighbor women who had received informal training gave way to deliveries by more educated practitioners, some of whom actually attended new midwifery schools, midwife deliveries were always distinct in their social and economic meaning from the practice of either medicine or nursing, both of which had begun to become pro- fessionalized by this period. Distinguishing midwifery from medicine and nursing, especially in her discussion of the meaning and outcomes of professionalization, enables Borst to explain a great deal about the decline of midwifery in the twentieth century, contradicting historians' romantic assumptions that midwifery was suppressed from above by angry doctors who were determined to repel en- croachments on their professional territory. Al- though Judith Leavitt's work has already called into question previous scholarly assumptions about doctors' domination of patients, Borst shows us why, from the perspective of midwives themselves, there was little impetus to profes- sionalize. Her work offers an alternative ap- proach to the interaction between medical pro- fessionals and other birth attendants at the turn of the century, reevaluating assumptions about power relations and female agency to create a much more complex portrait than we have had heretofore. Especially noteworthy is her contri- bution to our understanding of the relationship of ethnicity, acculturation, and medicine. Thanks to Borst's sensitivity to the ethnic context, we see how communal ties among various urban and rural ethnic groups, together with traditional gender assumptions, shaped the fate of mid- wives. Unlike interpretations presented from the doctors' perspective-in which the persistence of midwifery into the first several decades of the twentieth century signified ignorance and lack of adequate acculturation-Borst's account traces a gradual transition from midwife to doctor, a tran- sition tempered by communal ties and one that doctors could only imperfectly regulate. Even when ethnic women willingly visited a physi- cian, they chose a doctor who shared their back- ground, ethnicity, and social outlook. Also intriguing is Borst's assessment of the effect of physician education on the transition from midwife to doctor. She notes that in ob- stetrics the professionalization process was slower than in other specialties, so that, for one disjunctive moment, while elite obstetricians called loudly for the suppression of midwifery in favor of physician-managed care, medical education could not keep pace. General practi- tioners were often no more skilled than mid- wives. According to Borst, the medicalization of childbirth was a two-step process: general prac- titioners entered the arena first, and specialists who practiced almost exclusively in hospitals then followed. Catching Babies is a fine study, a contribution not only to the history of medicine and science but to women's history and ethnic history more broadly. REGINA MORANTZ-SANCHEZ Christopher Goetz; Michel Bonduelle; Toby Gelfand. Charcot: Constructing Neurology. xx 557</page><page sequence="2">BOOK REVIEWS-ISIS, 88: 3 (1997) + 392 pp., illus., tables, bibl., index. New York/ Oxford: Oxford University Press, 1995. In this splendid book, the first full biography of Jean-Martin Charcot in almost forty years, Christopher Goetz, Michel Bonduelle, and Toby Gelfand have affirmed the central significance of the French neurologist for the history of the mind/brain sciences and of medicine. Seeking to break away from a hagiographical tradition that has presented the great man Charcot as the "mas- ter of hysteria," whose neurological interest in the disease inspired the young Sigmund Freud, the authors have reenvisioned Charcot as the builder of a new scientific discipline and profes- sional medical specialty, neurology, in the con- text of nineteenth-century Paris. This highly detailed, painstakingly docu- mented, and compellingly written biography is the product of a four-year collaboration between Goetz and Bonduelle, neurologists at Rush Uni- versity in Chicago and the Universite de Paris, respectively, and Gelfand, a historian of medi- cine at the University of Ottawa. Despite the dif- ferent disciplinary affiliations and native lan- guages of the authors (Bonduelle' s chapters were translated into English by Goetz), the collabo- ration has come off seamlessly; it is impossible to tell who wrote which chapter, and the book seems the product of a single mind. In fact, it is evident that the authors' diverse origins have ac- tually strengthened their work: their explana- tions of technical neurological concepts are ex- tremely clear, and they have consulted a tremendous range of primary sources, including Charcot's private correspondence and case his- tories heretofore untouched by scholars. Goetz and Bonduelle have both published numerous ar- ticles on Charcot; Gelfand has been writing on Charcot, Freud, and Paris medicine since the 1980s. The authors have presented Charcot as "con- structing neurology" in three senses, each treated in one of the three major sections of the book. In the first sense, Charcot constructed neurology as a medical specialty, the study not only of hys- teria but of a whole range of nervous and mental diseases, including multiple sclerosis, locomotor ataxia, the amyotrophies, and aphasia; and as a specialty pursued by his distinctive anatomo- clinical method, in which each disorder was as- sociated with a specific lesion in the brain or nervous system. In the second sense, Charcot constructed neurology as a profession, with its own journals and its own institutional base at the Salpetriere Hospital in Paris, where Charcot spent most of his career, from the 1850s to his death in 1893. Finally, the authors present neu- rology as "culturally constructed" as it devel- oped around Charcot's image and authority in nineteenth-century French and interational high society. In the first of the book's three parts, Chapters 1-2, the narrative traces Charcot's childhood, his early education, and the development of his medical career. Chapters 3-6 focus on Charcot's choice of neurology as a specialty: the specific topics he worked on, his therapeutic treatments, and his turn toward the study of hysteria. The last part of the book treats Charcot at the height of his career, describing his international fame, his personality, and his private life, especially in his later years, and considers his legacy. The au- thors include a helpful bibliographical essay as- sessing the current state of Charcot scholarship and a time line of Charcot's life and career that connects them with contemporaneous events in science, medicine, politics, and society. Throughout the book, Charcot is presented not only as a scientist and physician but as a person. From his own words and those of his contem- poraries, readers of this book will begin to un- derstand his rigid authoritarianism in his treat- ment of both his patients and his colleagues; his interest in artistic representation as a hallmark of the Salpetriere school, and his use of photogra- phy and visual images in his work to underscore its status as an unblemished mirror of scientific fact; his thoroughgoing belief in the hereditary nature of nervous diseases; and his privileging of the clinic as the only reliable site of knowl- edge production. This book gives an excellent sense of Charcot in scientific and medical con- text, exploring his relationships with such im- portant contemporaries as John Hughlings Jack- son and Louis Pasteur and showing as well how thoroughly integrated Charcot's life and work were with French politics, art, and literature in the late nineteenth century. Charcot: Constructing Neurology is, in short, a book that should find a place in the library of every serious historian of the life sciences, and one that sets a standard for biographical schol- arship in all fields.
