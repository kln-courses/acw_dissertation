<plain_text><page sequence="1">THE INTERPRETATION OF ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR By DB. J. A. BIERENS DE HAAN The University , Amsterdam In the April number of this Journal Dr. Zuckerman 1 has given an interesting exposition of his views on the interpretation of animal behaviour, the topic of a discussion in a joint session of the sections of Zoology and Psychology during the Aberdeen meeting of the British Association for the Advancement of Science in September 1934, in which he took an important part. I am much indebted to the Editors for giving me an opportunity of expounding my views on this point in the same journal, and at the same time to make a few remarks on Dr. Zuckerman's views, the more so as, at the Aber- deen meeting, I was invited to open the discussion, and therefore had no opportunity to teply to his criticisms. I believe that, with regard to the interpretation of the behaviour of animals, three main tendencies exist, which we may distinguish as the physiological, the behaviouristic and the psychological.2 The first of them consists in an attempt to analyse the actions of aniinals into as complete a number as possible of simple reflexes, in the belief that in enumerating the reflexes that built up these actions, the actions themselves are explained. So Szymański tried to analyse a part of the mating behaviour of the snail Helix pomatia into a few simple reflexes, and Peters to analyse the action of a spider catching its prey in its web into five such reflexes. Doflein went 1 S. Zuckerman, " The Interpretation of Animal Behaviour," Science Progress, 1935, XXIX, 639. 2 I believe this distinction between three tendencies in the interpretation of animal behaviour is preferable to that of Zuckerman, who only distin- guishes a " mechanistic " from a " vitalistic " school* Especially the denomination of this " vitalistic " tendency seems tô be rather inappropriate : one can be a vitalist, i.e. believe that the phenomena of life cannot be analysed without remainder in co -physical and chemical processes, without admitting psychical phenomena as an explanation of animal action. So Driesch was a vitalist in his biology, but was an objectivist in the explanation of animal behaviour. 243</page><page sequence="2">244 SCIENCE PROGRESS even further and believed himself able completely to interpret the behaviour of the ant-lion, making its sand-crater and capturing and killing its prey, by admitting nothing more than the working of three simple reflexes. As to the latter case, it could be shown by other investigators on closer examination that the behaviour of the ant-lion included a number of elements of quite a different nature from simple reflexes, such as spontaneity, purposeful varia- tion and persistence of the action, memory and simple emotions, which make it probable that in the other cases too a closer examina- tion would reveal in the behaviour elements that are of essentially different nature from reflexes. But let us rather put the question in a more essential form : suppose we were able to split up without remainder the behaviour of an animal into a number of simple reflexes, would that give us an interpretation of the behaviour of the animal, satisfying our scientific requirements ? Of course, I am not referring to the needs of the nerve-physiolo- gist, who in the study of the reception of stimuli by the sense organs, their conduction through the nervous system, and their action on the effectors, finds the sole aim of his investigation. I am speaking here about the man who tries to understand why the animal acts as it does. Let us for the sake of clearness suppose an analysis of this kind were offered as the result of an interpreta- tion of human conduct. We know that our movements, too, con- tain a number of more or less simple reflexes, and that, e.g., the act of walking requires the functioning of a number of such reflexes. Yet everybody will admit that the enumeration of these reflexes would give only a very poor and unsatisfactory interpretation of, say, our running to catch a train. We feel that by this analysis we at best come into the possession of a number of parts, the link making the parts into one whole being absent. There is something lacking, and we feel we want something of quite a different nature. Is the case different, when we are attempting to interpret the behaviour of animals ? Dr. Zuckerman did not fail to face this argument of the inade- quacy of physiological analysis as a mode of interpreting animal behaviour. His argument against it is, first, that we have no right to admit that " science has already uncovered all the reflexes, tropisms and other basic mechanisms of behaviour that it can ever possibly unfold." This may be true. But a discovery of some dozens of new reflexes will never make up for the " discrepancy between the sum total of the separate items, such as reflexes, that have come out of the investigation, and the primary behaviour material that was put into the investigation." For we feel, as I</page><page sequence="3">THE INTERPRETATION OF ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR 245 said before, that, if we wish really to understand the behaviour of an animal, we need something of quite a different nature from these reflexes and tropisms. And when Dr. Zuckerman remarks that this argument regarding the inadequacy of physiological analysis is based upon a misconception of the intention of scientific investi- gation, which is directed to the isolating of parts in a system, then we would answer that we can only agree with this, as long as such " isolates " are not merely of a physiological nature, but when psychological phenomena also may be regarded as a possible result of such an analysis. If this is the case, we shall certainly find that after this analysis it will not be impossible " to reconstruct the gross phenomena of experience by the recombination of hypos- tasised scientific isolates," as was the result of Zuckerman 's physiological analysis. But let us consider the other ways of interpreting the behaviour of animals. They differ from the first mentioned tendencies chiefly in the fact that they do not go so far as to analyse that behaviour into such elements as reflexes, but try to interpret it by means of more complex phenomena. Here again we may distinguish between two antagonistic tendencies. The first, which we may call the behaviouristic interpretation, attempts to do this by describing it in terms of objectively perceptible phenomena, such as the stimuli that act upon the animal and the reaction the animal shows as a response to each stimulus. The other, the psychological one, does not content itself with this one-sided point of view, but thinks it desirable and necessary to take a broader standpoint, and also to take into account phenomena, which we know influence our own actions, so that they cannot be neglected when we attempt to interpret our own behaviour, although they are not directly per- ceptible to others. These are the so-called subjective or psychical phenomena, subjective because they are bound to ourselves in so far as we are experiencing subjects, psychical because they are immaterial and do not belong to the world of matter. The question now arises whether the former interpretation satisfies our scientific requirements when we set ourselves to understand the behaving animal, and, if not, whether the latter interpretation is possible, or, although preferable, is impossible for a priori reasons, viz., that such subjective phenomena do not exist in animals, or that, if they do exist, they are not knowable to us to such a degree as to be used as elements in a scientific interpretation. It will be clear that if such an interpretation in terms of sub- jective phenomena is possible in the case of animals, if it is possible to take into account their perceiving, their feeling and striving when</page><page sequence="4">240 SCIENCE PROGRESS we try to interpret, say, their flight from a menacing danger, this kind of interpretation will satisfy us more than the one in which these phenomena are neglected. For this again we may look to ourselves. If an observer were to explain our activity when trying to reach the shore after having fallen into the water, as a partly innate, partly acquired " behaviour-mechanism , ' ' evoked as a response to the stimulus of the water, we should recognise this as a very unsatisfactory way of interpreting our actions. We should feel that very important and fundamental elements had been neg- lected, as for example our fears as to the possibility of death, our looking out for a place of safety, and our actual striving to reach this, and we should know that these phenomena had influenced and governed our actions and movements much more than the stimulation by contact with the water alone would do. Therefore it will be clear that we shall also accept such an objective interpreta- tion of the behaviour of animals only when we are forced to believe that the other is impossible. Let us see if such is the case. As I have previously pointed out, the answer to this problem depends on the question whether such subjective phenomena, as we know within ourselves, do also occur in animals, and, if such is the case, if they are sufficiently knowable to us as to be used as elements for the interpretation of their behaviour. That no sub- jective phenomena occur in animals at all is a belief that has prob- ably not found many advocates since the days of Descartes ; yet some doubt is oft-times expressed if they also occur in the lower organisms. As these subjective phenomena are directly knowable only to the subject experiencing them, and as animals are not able (and probably do not feel any need) to communicate their inner experiences to us, the only way to settle this question is to look for objective signs, for objective criteria, that make it possible to decide whether their behaviour is to be regarded as an expression of subjective phenomena, or is not to be so regarded, in which case it would show an essential similarity with (though perhaps in a more complicated form) the movements we observe in inanimate nature, such as the rolling of a stone or the movements of iron filings towards a magnet. Dr. Zuckerman is rather pessimistic on this point, and believes that the question whether animals have subjective lives " is one that is impervious to scientific statement and scientific proof." I cannot share his pessimism. As has already been remarked by William James in his Principles of Psychology , we find a criterion for the presence of mentality in a phenomenon in the fact that it is directed to a goal, in its " pursuance of future ends." Zuokerman</page><page sequence="5">THE INTERPRETATION OF ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR 247 meets this mark of purposiveness or mentality by the remark, that " the most obviously purposive systems are man-made machines.'' I believe that he in doing so overlooks the fact that machines are not purposive by their own nature, but are only appropriate con- structions, made by man after the example of his own purposive activity, so that in their movements they show only a seeming purposiveness and lack the essential characteristics of real pur- posive action (vide infra). Dr. Zuckerman attaches much value to an apparatus, constructed by Hull and Baernstein,1 "whose behaviour provides an amazing parallel to the various phenomena of the conditioned reflex." I certainly admire in constructions like this the ingenuity of the builder, who succeeds so well in imita- ting the phenomena of life in inanimate material, but think it rather naïve to accept these crude analogies as a kind of explanation of biological phenomena. In the same way I cannot accept a doll that " oloses " its eyes when it is laid on its back as an " explan- ation " of the phenomenon of sleep. For that matter, the difference between the imitation and the real thing is too essential.2 But we may go further in tracing subjective phenomena in animals. To Professor McDougall 8 we owe the discovery of soven objective criteria that enable us to recognise real behaviour, i.e. physical activity in which mental processes of men and animals find expression ; in other words, to recognise subjective life in living beings. It seems worth while to mention them here. They are : - first, that of the spontaneity of movement, in opposition to the passiveness of the inanimate world ; then, the persistence of the activity, independently of the continuance of the impression that first evoked it, and the cessation of the activity, as soon as a particular goal has been reached ; next, the variability and unpre- dictability of the action, the preparation for a new action, the totality of the action, in which the whole organism is involved (in contrast especially to the reflex, which only involves parts of the body) ; and, finally, in many cases, the improvement of the action under the influence of experience, acquired on former occasions. By means of these seven criteria we may distinguish behaviour, as an expression of subjective phenomena, from mechanical move- 1 C. L. Hull and H. D. Baernstein. A mechanioal parallel to the con- ditioned reflex. Science, 70, 1929. 2 Hull and Baernstein are of another opinion. They hope to organise the phenomena, imitated by their apparatus, into a system which shows nothing less than " true trial-and-error learning with intelligent selection and the elimination of errors, as well as other behaviour ordinarily classed ąs psychic " (!) 3 Wm. McDougall, An Outhne of Psychology , London, 1923.</page><page sequence="6">248 SCIENCE PROGRESS ment, and where we find them in animal activity we may conclude that some mental life, some subjective phenomena, are at the bottom of this. On a former occasion,1 while following this line of thought, I tried to show that we find these seven criteria of McDougall every- where in animals, when we closely observe their behaviour. I cannot repeat the result of this examination here. I will only point to the fact that even in the Protozoa the marks of spontaneity, of variability, of persistence, etc., so clearly show themselves in their behaviour, especially in hunting and catching their prey, that there is, in my opinion, no reason to doubt that even in these lowest animals we find in their actions an expression of phenomena, essen- tially akin to, if perhaps qualitatively different from, those that in ourselves we know as perceiving, desiring or feeling. The belief that subjective phenomena are absent in animals or in some of them cannot, therefore, be regarded as an obstacle to our endeavours in admitting subjective elements into our interpretation of their behaviour. Another objection is that such subjective phenomena, even if they do occur, are not sufficiently knowable by us as to be useful for such an interpretation. This was already the argument of the objectivists in Germany, when at the end of the last century Beer, Bethe and von Uexküll tried to purge sense-physiology of all terms that were clothed with a subjective meaning, and later, in consequence of this endeavour, declared that animal psychology was impossible. The same argument comes up again with the modern Behaviourists, although with some of them, for instance Watson in his later works, such subjective phenomena not only seem to be ignored as unknowable, but even more or less denied. It is rather difficult to meet the argument that such phenomena are not knowable enough to be utilised. If we admit that they are knowable to a certain degree of certitude, what then would be the degree of knowableness required for their usefulness ? The minor degree of knowableness of the mental phenomena of our fellow- men, as compared with our own mental experience, will prevent no objectivist from taking them into account, when he wishes to understand the actions of a fellow-man he meets with in the street, and if in the laboratory he refuses to do so, we can only regard this as a theoretical inconsistency. In the same way no objectivist will hesitate to reckon with the subjective state of a dog or a bull, if he feels the want and necessity to interpret its behaviour - for 1 J. A. Bierens de Haan, Die tierpsychologische Forschung , ihre Ziele und Wege , Leipzig, 1935.</page><page sequence="7">THE INTERPRETATION OP ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR 249 instance when the animal suddenly assumes a menacing attitude towards him. If he is consistent, he will not suddenly ignore these subjective phenomena as soon as he has returned to his labora- tory and starts studying the behaviour of a similar animal under laboratory conditions. Now we often hear the objection that the difficulty of knowing the subjective phenomena in animals becomes greater, the more we descend to the lower animals, as the analogies between our own attitudes and expressions diminish because of the greater difference in morphological structure. I believe this argument to be only partially true. For when we, for example, read fear or anger in the attitudes of an animal, it is not by means of an analogy with our own attitudes that we conclude as to this. It is not by analogy of external signs that we draw conclusions as to special emotions or desires or perceptions in a dog or a bird, but by imagining our- selves to be the animal, by conceiving what would be our percep- tions and feelings and desires if we were in the animal's place, possessing its nature and psychical structure. The external atti- tudes and signs play only a secondary rôle in so far as we have learned by experience that a certain attitude is always associated with a special state of mind in the animal. The basis of our inter- pretation must be a knowledge of the mind of the animal itself. Therefore, the more the animal is known to us, the surer will be our understanding of the inner aspect of its behaviour. And then we must not overlook the fact that most of our knowledge about the subjective phenomena in animals nowadays is obtained, not by simple observation, but by experiment directed to a special question, like a discrimination between different perceptions, or a remember- ing, or an understanding of the solution of a special problem. With such experiments much surer results are obtained in this respect than by simple observation. So I believe there is no reason to be excessively prudent and too sceptical, and, as we see that we are justified in admitting subjective phenomena in all animals, we may also utilise them for our interpretation of their behaviour. The fact that in former days errors were made, especially with regard to the degree of explicitness with which a subjective phenomenon is experienced by an animal, cannot be denied, but ought not to dis- hearten us too much ! Dr. Zuckerman raises another objection to the use of subjective phenomena in the interpretation of animal behaviour. According to him their weakness is that they cannot be defined in a non- ambiguous way, while exact knowledge can only be acquired by making use of objectively definable data, which can be stated</page><page sequence="8">250 SCIENCE PROGRESS without fear of ambiguity. It is certainly true that so concrete a phenomenon as a " table " can be defined much more easily than, say, a feeling of disgust. But, if we limited our scientific interest to phenomena that were easily definable, the field of science would be unduly restricted. So, for example, the concept of " life " is not easy to define ; at least we have not yet a definition of " life " that satisfies everybody. Yet we are very well able to recognise life if we meet with it, and are able to perceive it in a living animal, and fail to do so in a lifeless stone. There is no reason, therefore, to give up the study of life, simply because we cannot easily define its object itself. And, in the same way, if perhaps the phenomenon of " fear " cannot be defined " without the fear of ambiguity," yet everybody knows very well in himself what fear really is, and has about fear a more direct and more primary knowledge than say about some quite objectively definable accessory of his wireless set. And certainly Dr. Zuckerman is wrong when he declares that " the re-introduction of the terminology of introspective psychology would be a disastrous step, calculated only to return the subject to its discredited anthropomorphic and aneodotal phase," Dr. Zuckerman in these words gives evidence of a serious lack of know- ledge of the prudent and critical work on animal psychology that has appeared in the last few decades, perhaps more on the Con- tinent than in England, and does injustice to the students of that science who have carefully weighed the terms they use in order to escape the error of overestimating the complexity and explicit- ness of the subjective phenomena they describe in their animals, and who certainly in their experiments, carried out under strictly laboratory conditions, do not give him any right to the incrimination of " aneodotal " methodology ! A final question : - why and to what end do we feel a need to interpret animal behaviour ? Why do we not simply let them behave as they like, and why do we want to explain this behaviour ? This question may be answered in different ways. First of all we may try to understand their behaviour for practical reasons, for a better understanding of the possibilities of their actions and a better government of the animals themselves. For a man who has to do with dangerous animals, or one who wishes to compel animals to do his bidding, it will be useful to understand the springs of their actions. Further we may do it for scientific reasons, e.g. for a better understanding of our own nature, which to a certain degree shows affinity to that of the animals, and especially for a better understanding of the child, who in several respects stands nearer to the animal than the adult. So our more profound know-</page><page sequence="9">THE INTERPRETATION OF ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR 251 ledge of the instincts of animals has certainly thrown a new light on human conduct. Yet I believe the chief value of our endeavours to interpret animal behaviour lies in another direction. It lies in the fact that it brings us the material for a science, that has as its object just those subjective phenomena that are discovered by an interpretation of the behaviour of the animals in the sense defined above, and has as its aim the knowledge of the psychical constitu- tion of the different animals or types of animals, i.e. the whole structure of cognitive, affective and conative elements of their inner life, that react upon each other and evoke each other. A scienoe like this has the right to bear the name of " Animal Psy- chology," and it is especially as a basis on which to build up this animal psychology, for which the interpretation of their behaviour i$ our only source of knowledge, that this interpretation finds its value and significance, But apart from this last significance I hope I have shown that the interpretation of animal behaviour is only complete when we take into account its subjective experience, and that there is no reason to be too sceptical of the possibility of obtaining knowledge of this inner aspect of animal life.</page></plain_text>
