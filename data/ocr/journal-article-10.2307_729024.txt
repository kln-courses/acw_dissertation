<plain_text><page sequence="1">REVIEWS OF BOOKS This lack of attention to harmony (strange in a book which is other- wise so thorough) shows itself in some musical quotations. On p. 40 Mr. Nelson quotes the opening bass bars from six ofByrd's ' Walsingham ' Variations and invites us to compare the harmonies. This cannot be done without the full chords or unless the bass is figured (I use the word in the English sense), for it is impossible to tell in many cases whether the new chord is the original in an inversion or another chord in root position. Again, in the comparison of melodic figuration with the original theme in works by Farnaby and Munday on p. 43, the analysis for the eye of the melodic connection is excellent, but the connection the ear immediately perceives is the harmonic one, which here receives scant mention. The same point may be made about the analysis of motives in the character variations. The melodic and rhythmic relationship between the motives and the theme is revealed with care and clarity, yet the harmonic relationship is dismissed with " each may have originated in the basic triad form which initiates the subject ". In his last chapter, 'An Aesthetic of the Variation', Mr. Nelson comes to the conclusion that " the truest variations would seem to be structurally conceived " and " that an unreserved allegiance to the free treatment does not produce the most characteristic variations ". He might have pursued his point and decided that the motival development of a theme with no reference to its structure and chord-progressions does not deserve the designation variation at all. With this premise Cesar Franck's ' Symphonic Variations ' becomes not a free set on two themes, as Mr. Nelson states in his analysis, but a set of structural variations on one theme, with an introduction and a coda in the nature of a free development. The statement that in this work "there are few easily recognized indications of where one variation ends and another begins " becomes untrue, as the five true variations, though not separated by breaks, are marked by obvious cadences and employ the structural techniques. In this case Elgar's " Enigma" Variations are more truly free variations than Franck's, for they are more eclectic in development, depart farther from the structure of the theme and yet preserve their affinity with it. Mr. Nelson might pursue this question of when a free variation is not a free variation but a free development. The book is handsomely produced, with creditably few printing- errors. The plentiful musical quotations are apt, and on the whole excellently set out to clinch each point. The notes are not at the foot of each page, but gathered at the back, which preserves the elegance of the page at the expense of the reader's energy and patience: it might have been wiser to incorporate into the text the various comments and leave at the back only the references, which are full and useful. Such points are, however, minor drawbacks in a book which has considerable merit. It is prodigal in its facts, from which are drawn occasional shrewd criticisms. In a sober way one is made to feel Mr. Nelson's own enthusiasm for this most fascinating of musical forms, the variation. D. McV. The Instruments of Music. By Robert Donington. pp. I75. (Methuen, London, I949.) I8s. "We could none of us look over the hedge ", says Mr. Donington at</page><page sequence="2">MUSIC AND LETTERS the beginning of his Reading List (App. V.), " if we did not stand on the shoulders of all previous authorities ". Let us be thankful, then, that instead of adding to that tottering pile the author discovers to us an unpretentious wicket through which to peer, with both feet on the ground. For he does all our reading for us, and in its place offers a quite formidable mass of data couched in deceptively simple terms. Deceptive, because he refuses to side-track important but complicated issues by over-simpli- fication. Generalizations there are bound to be when a book of this size covers so much ground; and Mr. Donington does occasionally sit on his hedge in his desire to be comprehensive without over-emphasis in any one direction. But he has most of his facts straight, and since there seem to be few contingencies which he leaves unprobed, that is no mean feat. All the important information about musical instruments, including some details which are new and not very well known, is to be found in this book. Because of this, its avowed purpose as a not-too-advanced textbook on the subject is admirably fulfilled. What matters about a musical instrument is not the way the pegs enter the peg-box or to what precise sub-group it may be assigned after lengthy and anthropomorphic cogita- tion, but how it works, why, and to what purpose. Mr. Donington makes no pretence that all the answers are easy, but he tackles all with a valiant lucidity. Mr. Donington rightly discloses his own bias,.which is towards the obiter dicta of the late Arnold Dolmetsch, but he grinds no axe and is in fact the first writer of the Dolmetsch school to put these matters where they belong, which is, in the main stream of musical experience and not in some esoteric backwater. In some cases, however, the old partisan spirit of the 1920S dies hard, and it is of some interest to examine these in their I949 context. One of them concerns the viola, which Mr. Donington says should be larger than the violin in the ratio of 3 : 2. We are certainly entitled to ask what units are here premised. Strings half as long again as the violin's would give the right pitch at the same tension, but there is no evidence whatever that this is either practicable or desirable. If it were, what kind of tone might be expected from an instrument which exceeded the violin, as it would have to do, in all linear measurements in this ratio ? In any case the viola is the type- instrument, not the violin. Why was not the violin made to conform to the viola? Unfortunately for the ratio theory there are some large violas which are very bad in tone, and some small ones which are very good; but the most consistently good-toned violas are those which are neither too large nor too small, as violas go: that is to say those with a body-length of I6i in. or thereabouts. In a matter of this kind the accumulated experience of generations of players and makers can hardly be at fault. Then Mr. Donington describes the octave difference in pitch between the viola and cello as " that awkward gap . . . which no ingenuity on the part of more recent composers can quite bridge ". Considering that for the greater part of the eighteenth century composers seem to have had the greatest difficulty even in knowing what to do with their violas, the necessity for the postulated fifth part of the " true tenor " cannot have weighed very heavily. For better or worse the rise of thorough-bass eliminated any need for writing real middle parts, except for special 70</page><page sequence="3">REVIEWS OF BOOKS effects, and it is probably to this that we owe a conception of orchestral sonority as being better when the parts are spaced "harmonically "- closer in the upper registers than in the lower-than in the more equable distribution of the older polyphony. Nor must we forget that modern string parts are often very widely spaced indeed and at any moment may cover a range of several octaves. Such conditions do not favour the use of a low-pitched tenor. Five-part writing for the violins never had any wide currency, and, outside France, with its ossified court traditions, had disappeared by the end of the seventeenth century, and thus in the earliest period of orchestral string writing. It is unreal and chimeric to disregard these considerations. By all means let us revive the tenor for its identifiable occasions. But I have yet to be told what these are. Somewhat akin to the above is Mr. Donington's plea for larger and more complete instrumental " families ". Such families, consisting of several sizes of the same instrument, have existed in the past, but the tendency has always been to breed out the less useful members as the technique and technology of the instrument developed. Instruments need to be built in several pitches only when their respective ranges are small, or their capacity for dealing with changes in tonality is limited. But has Mr. Donington considered the practical implications of such a step at the present day ? There is a place in ' Petrushka ' where a group of clarinets imitates an itinerant barrel organ. The illusion is complete, because by no stretch of imagination or art can a group of clarinets, bereft of any context, be made to sound like anything else. The score of' The Rite of Spring ', too, approaches to Mr. Donington's ideal; but the general effect of block-chords on a massive wind section suggests, in this work at any rate, something perilously akin to a cinema organ-the only instrument, by the way, to which the author's otherwise impartial wel- come is not extended. These and a few other points (such as the again-repeated fable that however hard you press on a Tourte-pattern violin bow, the tension of the hair remains the same, a thing which is dynamically impossible even in Nuclear Physics) invite comment, but certainly not condemnation. On the contrary, I know of at least one musician who will quietly put his house in order in the light of the really excellent chapters on Acoustics. The book is well illustrated with two groups of half-tones, one ancient, the other modern. The former includes some plates which have appeared before and others which are new to me; in the latter the homely and unphotogenic competence of orchestra X makes a realistic foil for the unbelievable confusion of mind with which, it appears, the angelic host were wont to approach the mixed consort. One slip needs correction: an obviously mid-eighteenth-century oboe is described (P1. 20) as a shawm. Good line drawings (mainly reproduced from other sources) complete the story. E. H.
