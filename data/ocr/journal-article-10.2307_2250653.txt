<plain_text><page sequence="1">VI.-NEW BOOKS The Reach of the Mind. By J. B. RHINE, Professor of Psychology, Duke University, U.S.A. Pp. 188. Faber and Faber, London, 1948. 10s. 6d. Dr. J. B. RNINE is the Director of the Parapsychology Laboratory at Duke University, North Carolina, the only laboratory in the world which is wholly devoted to the experimental investigation of supernormal phenomena. Broadly speaking, his experimental method consists in estab- lishing what Professor Ryle has called 'a divergence from the numerical odds-fraction '. For example, extra-sensory perception (ESP) is in- vestigated by means of the card-guessing technique. Zener cards are generally used. These resemble ordinary playing-cards, but there are only five different cards in each pack instead of fifty-two. By chance alone, therefore, the subject would be expected to make about one correct guess in five in a long series of trials. If it is found in a long series of trials that his correct guesses significantly exceed this proportion (in the statisti- cian's sense of the term 'significant') we have evidence that some non- chance factor is operative. And since very elaborate precautions have been taken to ensure that the subject cannot perceive the cards in any normal m&amp;nner, we have evidence that this non-chance factor is some form of supernormal cognition. Work on these lines began at Duke about 1930, and has been regularly reported in the Journal of Parapsychology, published by the Duke University Press. Dr. Rhine's earlier book Extra-sensory Perception (1940) gave an account of some of the results. The present book is more ambitious. It has two aims. One is factual: to give a general survey of all the work done at Duke in the last eighteen years, and to state the main conclusions which appear to have been experimentally established. The second aim is theoretical: to discuss the bearing of those conclusions upon a philoso- phical problem or group of problems concerning the nature of the human mind and its relation to the rest of the universe. Dr. Rhine begins by distinguishing two conceptions of human person- ality. First, there is the traditional ' psychocentric ' conception which most of us are still taught in youth, and which is still the basis of most of our social institutions: the dualistic conception, which regards the human being as a compound of two distinct but interacting entities, mind and body. Secondly, there is the ' cerebrocentric ' conception (either Epipheno- menalist or Behaviourist) which is accepted nowadays by the majority of scientifically educated persons, including the majority of professional psychologists. According to Dr. Rhine, the new experimental evidence shows decisively that the cerebrocentric conception is mistaken, and that some form of the psychocentric conception is right, though not necessarily the traditional theological version of it. First he considers extra-sensory perception (ESP). This term is equivalent to 'telepathy and/or clairvoyance'. It is not a very happy one, though most psychicval researchers now use it. For whatever telepathy and clairvoyance may be, they are not very like ordinary perception: they only resemble it in one way-in being means of acquiring information about matters of fact. Still, a new term was needed, because 390</page><page sequence="2">NEW BOOKS 391 in many experimental investigations it is impossible to distinguish between these two supernormal powers. We often cannot tell whether the subject is clairvoyantly cognising the card itself, or is telepathically cognising the visual sensations of the experimenter who looks at it; and the decision between these two explanations becomes still more difficult when the possibility of precognitive telepathy or precognitive clairvoyance is admitted. Now it does not seem possible to account for ESP by any hypothesis of physical radiations-at any rate if we use the words 'jphysical' and ' radiation ' in anything like their ordinary meaning. Distance in space appears to make no difference to it. The 'percipient ' and the ' perceived ' may be in the same room, or they may be many miles apart, even hundreds of miles. Stranger still, ESP appears to be indifferent to time too, at any rate in some degree. It may be precognitive, and it may be retrocognitive. There has long been evidence of this from well-attested spontaneous cases. There is now experimental evidence as well. In the second stage of Dr. Rhine's argument, we are introduced to a phenomenon which is even stranger, if possible, than precognition. This is what he calls Psychokinesis or PK. (It is sometimes called Telekinesis.) In PK the mind is supposed to cause changes in physical objects outside its own body, not by means of the nervous system and the muscular apparatus, but directly, by mere thought or 'will '. The reader must be warned that there has been some controversy about PK among British psychical researchers. Some experimental work has been done on the subject in this country, though not very much-nothing like as much as at Duke-and the results so far seem to be indecisive. The late Mr. Whately Carington did some experiments in the last few months of his life, and appears to have been satisfied of the reality of PK. But most British experimenters, if I am rightly informed, have had only chance results, though a few have had results which were above chance but not significantly so. Nevertheless, the PK work done at Duke is undeniably impressive as it stands. We must admit, I think, that a prima facie case has been established, even though not a conclusive one; and philosophers would do well to consider what Dr. Rhine has to say on the subject. What happens in a PK experiment is something like this. A die is repeatedly thrown, and the subject is asked to 'will' high faces (i.e., he is to will that the die shall fall with 4, 5 or 6 spots uppermost). With some subjects, it is found that in a long series of throws the proportion of high faces significantly exceed the chance expectation. The same thing happens when the subject is asked to 'will' low faces instead of high ones. It does not appear to matter how many dice are used. If anything, the effect is more marked when many dice are thrown at once. (In one experiment, ninety-six dice were thrown at once.) Again, it does not appear to matter whether the dice are thrown by hand or by a machine. The above-chance deviation is admittedly much smaller than it is in the best ESP cases, but it is still significant. If these results are accepted, what conclusions are to be drawn from them ? Clearly'they tend to support the traditional belief in mind-brain interaction, and the dualistic conception of human nature which goes with it. For if Smith's mind does act upon Smith's brain, the process must be ' psycho-kinetic '. Conversely, believers in the old Interaction Theory have no right to be surprised at Dr. Rhine's results. They have no doubt supposed hitherto that Smith's brain is the only piece of matter which Smith's mind ever acts upon in this direct and ' psycho-kinetic ' way.</page><page sequence="3">392 NEW BOOKS But there is no a priori reason why it should be. The question is a purely empirical one. If good empirical evidence is produced to show that Smith's mind does sometimes act upon other pieces of matter in a like manner, the Dualist ought to accept that evidence in a spirit of Natural Piety. Of- course if the Epiphenomenalist theory is true, it will follow -that PK cannot occur at all, and Dr. Rhine's results will have to be ex- plained away somehow. But whether Epiphenomenalism is true is again an empirical question. The arguments which support it are empirical ones, derived from physiology andi the other biological sciences"(for we need not waste much time on the a priori argument that the action of mind upon matter is 'inconceivable'). It must therefore be logically possible that there should be adverse empirical evidence, whether we think or do not think that Dr. Rhine has in fact provided it. A Behaviour- ist, on the other hand, might conceivably accept Dr. Rhine's evidence, but only at the cost of admitting that sub-vocal speech (the Behaviourist equivalent for Dr. Rhine's ' acts of will') can have a direct effect on environmental objects: an admission savouring somewhat of primitive magic. Dr. Rhine makes two other observations about PK. The first is that in the PK tests with dice, etc., 'mind-matter relations . . . can be studied in a simpler and more controllable situation than the thought-brain com- plex provides'. It is very much easier to study the movements of little cubes than the immensely complicated physical processes which go on in a living brain. Secondly, he maintains that there is a very close connexion between PK and ESP, so close that they can be regarded as two aspects of a single process. In clairvoyance, he says, the object cognised must be causing some change in the cognising mind. He then argues, if I follow him correctly, that here as elsewhere there can be no action without reaction; if A acts upon B, B must also be acting in some way upon A. He concludes that in clairvoyance 'the mind therefore does something to the object, even though that something be too slight to be detected '; when clairvoyance occurs, PK must be occurring too. Thus, given the existence of ESP, the existence of PK could have been inferred deductively, even before the empirical evidence for PK had been discovered (p. 73). I feel uneasy about this argument. Does it follow that because we have succeeded in devising a ' causal theory' of ordinary sense-perception, we must also hold a causal theory of ESP (with a very much shorter causal chain of cause) ? On the contrary, it might conceivably be an ultimate fact about the mind that it is in a direct relation all the time with an in- definitely large number of environmental objects; and that the function of the sense-organs and afferent nerves is to put biologically-useful blinkers on it, by forcing it, to attend only to those environmental objects which are biologically relevant. In that case, normal sense perception would need a causal explanation, but clairvoyance would not; it would rather be the absence of clairvoyance which would need one. In any case, our evidence for the ordinary physical and physiological explanation of normal perception is purely empirical, whatever difficulty epistemologists may have in making sense of it. Is there any empirical evidence to support a parallel theory of ESP? And even granting the parallelism,is it reallytrue that in ordinary sense-perception the perceiver acts upon the perceived, as well as the perceived on the perceiver ? In touch, no doubt, the percipient's body causes a change in the object touched, though I cannot see that his min'd does. But in sight or hearing, do I do anything to the external object</page><page sequence="4">NEW BOOKS 393 which I see or hear ? Or is the scene of operations to be transferred to the sensory centres in the brain, and are we to suppose that when a visual or auditory sensation occurs the sentient mood reacts somehow on those very same brain cells, and causes a physical change in them ? Perhaps, but is there any empirical evidence that it does ? No doubt when the sensation occurs, the mind does often act upon other brain cells, namely on the motor centres. But this is not relevant to Dr. Rhine's argument, which requires that it should act upon the sensory centres themselves. If I am right, Dr. Rhine has not shown that whenever there is ESP there must also be PK. But he also argues, conversely, that whenever there is PK there must also be ESP, and this argument is a much more plausible one. For how can the subject control the movements of a falling die (or of many dice falling at once) unless he somehow perceives the physical position of the die at the critical moment when the PK 'force' is to be applied ? He cannot perceive this in any normal manner; the dice fall much too quickly for normal sight to follow their movements with the -accuracy which would be needed. Therefore he must be perceiving them extra-sensorily, i.e., by clairvoyance. This argument again assumes that PK must be analogous to our normal action upon environmental objects in one respect at least, namely, in being guided or controlled by perception of some kind (like the action of poking at a die with a long thin rod, or influencing the direction of its motion by squirting a stream of water at it). Is this assumption necessarily right ? If it was, I do not see how Dr. Rhine could also be right in as- suming that the action of mind upon brain is also a case of PK. When I move my little finger, does my mind have to percezve the brain cells in the motor centres (unconsciously and clairvoyantly) in order to direct its ' mental energy' into the appropriate parts of the nervous system ? Perhaps, but there is no evidence that it does. And yet this operation would seem to be at least as delicate as changing the direction of move- ment of a die, and as much in need of perceptual guidance. Again, let us ask ourselves what a Vitalistic biologist would say about such organic processes as growth, or assimilation of food, or the healing of wounds. It is relevant to ask this question, for if PK does really occur, there is something to be said for old-fashioned Vitalism after all. Would the Vitalist say that the OvyX or vital principle perceives the parts of the organism which are in need of nutriment or repair at a particular moment, and can only ensure that the appropriate chemical substances reach the part of the body which needs them, if it is able to watch them as they go ? (We may notice that Dr. Rhine himself regards psycho-somatic healing as a form of PK.) I think that there would be something logically vicious about such an explanation. For if the vital principle acts in this kind of way it is nothing but a little man-a very sharp-sighted and preter- naturally skilful homunculus-who somehow manages the human body from inside. And then the same problem will arise over again about the internal arrangements of the homunculus himself. It does not follow that all forms of vitalistic theory are absurd. But this ' anthropomorphic ' form of it-the form of it which Dr. Rhine's argument would suggest- does seem to be untenable. These are the difficulties, we get into, if we try to think of PK as a perceptually guided ' process, in the way that threading a needle or poking something with a rod are perceptually guided. Is there any other conceptual model vwhich we might use instead ? The only one I can</page><page sequence="5">394 NEW BOOKS suggest is ideo-motor behaviour. We might perhaps suppose that ordinary ideo-motor behaviour is just a special case of something more general, and that all ideas have an inherent tendency to execute themselves or realise themselves by means of material movements. If they cannot manage it in the ordinary way by means of the nervous system and mus- cular apparatus of their owner, perhaps they sometimes manage it tele- pathically by affecting some other mind and making use of his nervous system and muscles. (Automatic writing may be an example"of this.) If they cannot manage it in that way, perhaps they sometimes manage it directly, without using any nervous system at all: provided they are not inhibited, as they usually will be, by other adverse ideas-for example, by the fixed idea in the mind of the subject himself, or of the bystanders, that 'such things simply do not happen'. This suggestion may well be utter nonsense, of course. But if there is anything in it, the connexion between PK and ESP is much less close than Dr. Rhine believes. It would still be true, all the same, that they have a very important negative feature in common. Neither of them would operate indirectly, by the mediation of the nervous system, as ordinary perception and ordinary voluntary action do. ESP would be independent of the afferent parts of the nervous system, and PK would be independent of the efferent parts of it. In both cases there would be a direct or immediated relationship between the mind and other entities. There are many other points in Dr. Rhine's book which should interest the philosophical reader, whether he is a methodologist, or an epistemologist or a moralist. The discussion of free will and precognition in Chapter 5 will provide healthy exercise for the analytically-minded. The problem is essentially the same as the old problem of reconciling free will with the non-inferential prescience of God; and the solution which Boethius offered for the old theological problem (De Consolatione Philosophiae, Book V) may perhaps apply to this modern ' parapsychological' version too. Students of methodology will be interested in Dr. Rhine's discussion of the 'decline effect' which appears to be a common feature of all para- psychological experiments (Chapter 10). And linguistic analysts might pro- fitably consider the questions posed in Chapter 9, 'How normal are Psi capacities ? ' (I think they might find that the emotive meaning of the word 'normal' has a good deal of relevance to the issue, and they might have something to say about 'persuasive definitions '.) Chapters 11 and 12, the last two chapters of the book, will interest the plain man, as well as the philosopher and the psychical researcher. I shall only make two remarks on Chapter 12 'Consequences for relations among men'. One is that Dr. Rhine's estimate of the present status of the problem of survival, and his suggestions about the way in which it should be tackled, see to me eminently sensible. On the other hand, his contention that the general acceptance of the ' psychocentric ' view of human nature would necessarily result in better relations among men seems much more disputable. Some of the most devastating wars we know of-for instance the Albigensian crusade and the Thirty Years War- occurred in the Ages of Faith, when a ' spiritual' concepticn of humafl nature was accepted by almost everyone. Chapter 11, 'Prospects of application', calls for more comment. Indeed it is one of the most exciting chapters in the book. Dr. Rhine begins by pointing out that both ESP and PK are at present unreliable and elusive capacities, and he asks what makes theni so. He answers,</page><page sequence="6">NEW BOOKS 395 rightly I think, that it is their unconscious or unintrospectible character; the subject has no means of knowing whether his ' shots ' are right or wrong. Could this obstacle be removed in some way ? Dr. Rhine suggests various methods, direct and indirect, by which it might possibly be removed or circumvented: hypnosis, or the use of drugs, or one of the systems of psychological and psycho-physical exercises such as has long been practised in the Far East. He thinks the time has come when such methods of lowering or altering the threshold of consciousness should be experimentally investigated by psychical researchers. Let us now assume that the obstacle will be removed some day, and that ESP will be brought under conscious control and thereby made reliable. What consequences may be expected to follow ? Dr. Rhine offers some interesting speculations on this (he says emphatically that they are only speculations). The chief consequence, he thinks, would be ' to turn a searchlight upon all the secrets of man and nature'. Dr. Rhine seems to welcome this prospect, on the ground that the plans of every malefactor would be detected as soon as they were formed; war, and large-scale crime too, would no longer be possible. No doubt. But would social life be possible either, if the secrets of all hearts were revealed ? The complete abolition of all privacy-a Behaviourist's paradise, though attained by most un-Behaviouristic means-is a state of affairs almost too horrible to be contemplated. But perhaps we need not despair. There may be a way of escape, though Dr. Rhine himself suggests none. If we do ever acquire conscious control of ESP, perhaps we shall also gain conscious control of the means of screening ourselves against it. The ' screen ', no doubt, would have to be mental, not physical, since ESP seems to be a non-physical process. But some such screen must exist already, though we have no idea how it works, since there are people who are 'bad' telepathic agents; in other words, their thoughts and emotions are not detectable even by 'good' telepathic percipients. Let us hasten, before it is too late, to investigate what this salutary 'badness' depends upon. H. H. PRIcE. Inevitable Peace. CARL JOACHim FRIEDRICH. Pp. xiv + 294. Harvard University Press (London: Geoffrey Cumberlege). 15s. TEE title of this book is not a helpful guide to its contents. Prof. Friedrich holds that Kant had something important to say about the establishment of world peace and that two of his smaller works contain the essence of his view on this point. These are his essay Zum Ewigen Frieden of 1795, of which a new translation is provided in an appendix (pp. 243-81), and his earlier Idee zu einer allgemeinen Geschichte in weltbrfirgerliche Absicht (1784). These, however, require interpretation in the light of Kant's other works on moral and political subjects from the Grundlegung (1785) to the Streit der Fakultiten (1798) and of the general metaphysical position formulated in the three Critiques. Prof. Friedrich writes as an expert on this subject and his documentation is extensive and well chosen. It is, therefore, a pity that he has elected to refer to the comparatively rare Cassirer edition of the works of Kant instead of the standard Akademie Ausgabe. The substance of Prof. Friedrich's contention is as follows. Kant was one of the most important of the long line of writers who have</page><page sequence="7">396 NEW BOOKS tried to make sense of the notion of a non-empirical jus naturale. He insisted rightly against Hobbes, Hume and other naturalist thinkers that the law of freedom, which is normative, can never be derived from or made to depend upon psychological generalisations which are purely factual. He was therefore convinced that " Wars ought not to occur" was significant and in some sense true, although " Wars have causes" was certainly true too. Admittedly this is just a special case of the general question "How is freedom possible ? " but it is a case to which Kant devoted a lot of thought and his conclusion is interesting. As outlined in the Idea for a Universal History it is that wars must be regarded as part of the teleology of nature. They compel us to overcome our natural slothfulness and develop our faculties to the full. A similar account of bugs and tape worms occurs in the Critique of Judgment (? 67). But these stimuli are necessary only at a low cultural level. We can get along without them when we under- stand the factual situation rather better. Hence war can be abolished if men are prepared to take the necessary steps (which consist in the acceptance of an effective international organisation), but it is none the less inevitable at the level of the realm of nature. There are obvious objections to this as an attempt to reconcile the notion of freedom with that of natural necessity, and Prof. Friedrich does not claim that Kant solved the problem he set himself. But he does think that Kant provides a useful basis for further enquiry and I am inclined to agree with him. The line of development which Prof. Friedrich favours is sketched in his interesting but avowedly tentative discussion of Marxism. Marx was convinced, just as Kant had been, that war (in his case, the class struggle) was inevitable, and that the peace which would ensue (the classless society) was inevitable too. The classless society and the Kingdom of Ends in which the state disappears are indistinguishable from one another. It is indeed a pity that Marx's knowledge of Kant was limited to a few Hegelian misrepresentations. Kant and Marx, then, do provide between them an interesting and import- ant view about war. The trouble is that neither they nor Prof. Freidrich give any clear indication of what we should do about it now. I do not gee how they could do this, since it is not a philosopher's job. But I have an uneasy feeling that Prof. Friedrich thinks differently on this point. I may be mistaken, but I fancy he believes that political philosophy may provide practical advice as to the drafting of constitutions by U.N.O. or its successors, and this is a complete and dangerous mistake. If that is wanted, Machiavelli rather than Kant is the man to consult. T. D. WELDON. The Metamorphosis of Philosophy. By JOHN OULTON WISDOM. Cairo: Al-Maaref Press, 1947. Pp. viii + 224. Sole Agent in Great Britain: Basil Blackwell, Oxford. Price in Great Britain: 12s. 6d. MB. J. 0. WISDOM'S thesis in The Metamorphosis of Philosophy is that the victory of logical analysis over traditional speculative philosophy is both decisive and Pyrrhic. Almost half the book is devoted to an account of the revolution that began in 1903 with Moore's Refutation of Idealism and Russell's Principles of Mathematics. It is to be regretted that so well-worn a tale is allowed to occupy so much space, since Mr. Wisdom's exposition</page><page sequence="8">NEW BOOKS 397 contributes little that is new or illuminating. A short preface, with refer. ences to sources for readers not already familiar with them, would surely have sufficed. Mr. Wisdom's original contribution begins at Chapter VII and is more worthy of critical attention. He points out that the elaborate logico-analytic apparatus used to refute metaphysics is unnecessary, since the conclusion that metaphysics is NonSense follows directly from the assumption that 'Sense' can be identified either with the propositions of Common Sense or with propositions that are-to speak loosely-4inpirically verifiable. For the metaphysicians have admitted all along, nay claimed that their propositions belonged to neither of these classes. They " would stress that speculation has always been claimed to transcend sense-experi- ence, and that it must ipso facto be incapable of being defined in terms of ordinary meanings of words or empirical verifications. He might even . . .say that speculative statements were TransSense. What, then,' would be the difference between the logico-analytic judgement that specu- lation is NonSense and the speculative one that it is TransSense ? " (p. 131). The point is a fair one; but Mr. Wisdom gives the impression that the sole, or at least the main purpose of logical analysis is the elimination of Bradley and Bosanquet. Yet it surely has uses both in clearing up technical problems in logic and in helping ordinary people to avoid making the kind of mistakes that they in fact do make about 'the average man ' and 'England is a monarchy'. In the course of the discussion three points emerge which tend to show that the logico-analytic attack somehow misfires. (i) As already shown, logical analysis merely convicts metaphysics of not being something that it looked like being but never claimed to be. (ii) Like the heroes in Valhalla, metaphysics survives the onslaught which kills it. This is shown partly by the fact that it still exists outside logico-analytic circles but mainly by the fact that the latest logico-analysts avowedly make use of utterances that are as NonSensical as those of the metaphysician. Such utterances, though they may lack meaning, clearly have a purpose. (Mr. John Wisdom's " Philosophical Perplexity ", Proc. Ar. Soc. 1936-37 is cited as an example of this technique.) (iii) Metaphysics can be understood-not, perhaps, in the straight- forward way in which propositions are understood-but in some strange sense of ' understood ' that might turn out to be analogous with ' He under- stands children' or ' Nobody understands me'. Briefly (and inadequately), Mr. Wisdom's solution of these difficulties is that logico-analysis is not enough. To understand metaphysics what is needed is an application of psycho-analysis or, as he calls it, Psychocentrics. " Such an application of psycho-analysis will, I hope, demonstrate in con- crete detail how metaphysical assertions are symptomatic of a philosopher's inmost psychicallife, of whose nature and existence he is unaware " (p. 182). This theory can easily be shown to account for the three puzzling facts mentioned above. Metaphysical utterances are unverifiable -because they 'symptomatically-express ' facts but do not directly express them. They defy annihilation, because repressed emotions, denied one outlet, will always find another. And the metaphysician 'gets across' because the reader finds that the writer's utterances can be used to symptomatically- express his own emotions. Furthermore we can now see why the meta- physician must refuse to accept the analyst's challenge to bring his con- cepts before the bar of Common Sense and Verification. To fulfil its pur- pose a symbol (in the psycho-analytic sense) must not reveal the nature of</page><page sequence="9">398 NEW BOOKS what it symbolises. Ambiguity and all the other crimes in the logico- analyst's calendar are therefore virtues in a metaphysical system. The analyst who tries to 'cure' the metaphysician by means of a logical tech- nique is like a father who tries rationally to disprove his son's belief in Father Christmas; and he fails for the same reason. Mr. Wisdom makes the additional and important point that speculative philosophers are not merely expressing their own neuroses but those of their time, and even of the future' hence much of their abiding interest. The greatest merit in this book lies in the fact that Mr. Wisdom has seen that metaphysics must be not merely elimiiated but explained. Any philosopher who sees the force of the logico-analytic attack~ but remains unwilling to discount all traditional philosophy as so much misguided claptrap must face this fact, whether or not he is convinced by Mr. Wisdom's explanation. The explanation itself is sure to arouse opposition. Mr. Wisdom defends himself admirably against the obvious criticism that if -philosophy in general is not true but 'symptomatically-expressive', then his thesis is not true either. A more friendly critic might, however, raise the following objections:- (i) Mr. Wisdom has accepted too easily from the logico-analysts the rigid distinction between metaphysics and Sense. Have not speculative ideas played a large part in the creation of science ? Is not 'the Unconscious' itself a speculative idea ? The cap fits better on Hegel or Bradley than on Democritus or Descartes, Leibniz or Freud. (ii) To establish his thesis, as Mr. Wisdom would be the first to admit, ordinary empirical methods would have to be used in support of the trans- cendental argument he in fact uses. We should have to know from inde- pendent sources that some philosophers had neuroses before we could accept the fact of indulging in philosophy as evidence for the existence of a neurosis. And the case would be greatly strengthened if we could prove a connexion between specific metaphysical outlets (e.g., Substance, Unity, Certainty) and specific neuroses. So far Mr. Wisdom has argued for a speculative hypothesis because it would, if true, explain certain puzzling facts. The next stage must be the independent verification of the hypo- thesis, and it is to be hoped that Mr. Wisdom will attempt this task. P. NOWELL-SMITH. Existentialism and Humanism. By JEAN-PAUL SARTRE. Translation and Introduction by Philip Mairet. London: Methuen and Co. Ltd., 1948. Pp. 70. Price 5s. IN this volume, first published in French in 1946, M. Sartre offers a popular- ized account of his philosophy of existence. His primary intention is to clear existentialism of imputations by Marxist and Christian critics, who have seen in it a denial of responsibility, optimism, and human solidarity, and an encouragement to inaction, isolation, and relativism. M. Sartre's reply to all these charges is that existentialism is a doctrine of humanism. This assertion leads him to propound one of the least thought-out doctrines in the field of existentialist literature. For to substantiate it he attempts to show that pure subjectivity, the fashioning of individual existence, implies a sense of responsibility for the whole of mankind. Man, for M. Sartre, is free, and no one doubts that responsibility also means being free, i.e. making decisions according to one's own judgement. Responsibility,</page><page sequence="10">NEW BOOKS 399 however, means more than freedom: it represents a conjunction of freedom and constraint. We are responsible for certain things, if these are expected of us, i.e. if we have duties. M. Sartre's argument now is that subjectivity also constrains, that though man may choose this or that or even choose not to choose at all, choose he must (for he cannot ex hypothesi choose not to be free), and thus he is ' condemned to be free'. The constraint of which M. Sartre here speaks is not of the same kind as that which- curtails man's freedom in a position of responsibility. The mere necessity of having to choose, though it may make a man 'responsible' for what he is in the sense that he is what he makes himself, does not constitute a man's respon- sibility for all men nor a reason why 'nothing can be better for us unless it is better for all '. Thus no case for responsibility in the accepted sense can be made out on M. Sartre's premisses, and with it his claim for humanism falls to the ground. Obviously, this claim is something not naturally belonging to the heart of existentialist speculation but arises from some extraneous source, possibly from a confused reminiscence of Husserl's notion of man's predisposition towards 'entire humanity', or from the exigencies of controversy or popu- larization. The only other explanation that can be advanced for M. Sartre's equation of existentialism with humanism is that man's subjectivity from which he starts is not the fact without presuppositions and the genuine finding of a ' primitive ' attitude which he thinks it is, but a superimposed dogma concerning human nature, a preconceived theory of existence. In this respect some of what M. Naville has to say in the discussion appended to the volume is pertinent. Also, it is important here to keep in mind the relationship between ex- istentialism and phenomenology. What the translator of M. Sartre's book says about it in the introduction is, for all its clarity, far from being search- ing enough. For his account of phenomenology illustrates the theory of the gestalt psychologists and perhaps the methods of the psychological pheno- menology of Husserl; but it leaves altogether unexplained how this kind of phenomenology, according to which the essence of experience is the ground of its existence, can give rise to a doctrine of existentialism, according to which existence precedes essence. This can be accomplished only if pheno- menology is explained in the terms of a thoroughly presupposition-less exam- ination of Being (ontology) such as Heidegger has attempted to carry out. The fundamental and sincere rejection of everything taken for granted by common-sense, by the theoretical consciousness, and even by the psycholo- gical phenomenologists (e.g. their distinction between consciousness and being), is the link between phenomenology and existentialism. And it is here that M. Sartre, with his defence of existentialism as a doctrine true to humanism, falls short of a standard set by his own philosophy. W. VON LEYDEN. An Historical Introduction to Modern Philosophy. By HUGIH MILLER. New York: The Macmillan Company, 1947. Pp. x + 615. 25s. IT would be a mistake to suppose from the title of this book that it is primarily historical. Professor Miller has a problem to solve, the problem, to use his own words, of " the relationship of theory to practice or more concretely, of science to government ". There is, he believes, observable in all past history " a living connection between science and government,</page><page sequence="11">400 NEW BOOKS i.e. between man's conception of nature at large or reality, and his social pattern ". Unfortunately, however, in modern times (from Descartes onwards) a schism has developed between the two. Science has seemed to demand more and more "the postulate of natural necessity ". Rationalism in philosophy and absolutism in politics are the natural accompaniment of this sort of view. On the other hand American political thought has moved in the direction of democracy. But demo- cratic doctrine demands " the postulate of individual freedom ", it affirms the absoluteness of the individual and his power to determine in some way all general or universal character. An empirical philosophy would support this sort of outlook, and indeed Hume, by successfully challenging the dogma of natural necessity, was " the true inaugurator of modern political theory ". Empiricism, however, has found it difficult to do justice to the rational element in science, and easily degenerates into scepticism. Thus still " in our scientific and economic activities we do obeisance to natural necessity, but in our political practice we still affirm freedom. This inner contradiction has long defeated thought, and to-day it endangers human sanity." Professor Miller believes that recent developments in logic and science have made it possible to arrive at " philosophical truth ", which at last solves this contradiction, but as a necessary preliminary he engages in a study of Western philosophy beginning with the Greeks and ending with contemporary pragmatism and positivism. Throughout he has in mind the " ancient controversy" between rationalism, emphasising the logical criterion of truth, and em- piricism, emphasising the criterion of fact. The historical survey, as indeed the whole book, is written iii a clear and unpretentious style, which makes pleasant reading, and useful short bibliographies are appended to each chapter. Professor Miller might himself feel that the chapters on Greek philosophy (particularly Plato) call for some reconsideration in the light of Dr. Popper's book, The Open Society and its Enemies, which presumably was published too late to be used and is not mentioned in the bibliography. (R. H. S. Crossman's Plato To-day (published 1937) is also omitted). The chapter on " the revolutionary intellectual shift " involved in the early Christian outlook provides an interesting treatment of a factor which the professional philosopher may tend to neglect, and the chapter on " the concept of evolution in Science and Philosophy " is important particularly in view of the subsequent discussion in the final chapter. It is, however, perhaps the last two of the four main sections of the book, " Contemporary Philosophy " and " The Future ", which are of most interest. In these Professor Miller develops his own solution of the problem he has set, using towards it recent developments in physics and the work of Russell and Whitehead in Principia Mathematica. The solution may best be given in his own words (p. 553): " The two criteria of truth, logic and particular fact, are really one and the same criterion. True rationalism is empiricism, empiricism is altogether rational. The logical criterion is nothing else than the empirical demand, explicitly extended to require deference to all particular fact." The rationalist was wrong in supposing that logic was somehow descriptive of nature, and that consequently individual things and particular events must be determined by natural nedessity. The postulate of natural necessity is as out of place in science as in politics. Both alike demand the postulate of individual freedom ; both alike are based on the " philosophic truth "</page><page sequence="12">NEW BOOKS 401 that " Reality is individual being ", and " to accept scientific evidence and subscribe to scientific truth is to stand upon the principle of demo- cratic justice ". Professor Miller at one point describes his solution as ' simple ', but he would perhaps himself agree that it raises a large number of extremely difficult topics. Indeed the notion of " philosophical truth " itself, to which he frequently refers, and to which he plainly attaches the highest importance, is not an easy one. " That real being is identical with individual being " is frequently described as a " philosophical truth " (e.g. p. 366), on p. 557 as a " metaphysical truth "; on p. 543 philosophical truth apparently says " something absolute and incontrovertible about this world ", and on p. 564 we are said to have " knowledge of an absolute sort, or wisdom . . . in the philosophical insight into the identity of real with individual being ". It looks from this as though the proposition " real being is identical with individual being " might be an a priori synthetic truth-a conclusion which Professor Miller might not perhaps welcome. On the other hand this " truth " is also described (p. 367) as " a presupposition . . which conditions all scientific hypothesis whatsoever " (this has a Kantian ring about it, but Professor Miller is severe on Kant's " positivism "), and immediately following as a " postulate ". But a postulate could hardly be said to yield knowledge of an absolute sort. Again, in regard to morals, the suggestion on p. 557 seems to be that we should be just (i.e. respect individual being) because " every injustice done to individual being of necessity recoils on the doer ", and the passage goes on to say that " this is the moral law of nature ". Bait it is not clear in what sense this is a " moral " law at all; and the general recommendation seems to be: be just because it pays. Perhaps, however, enough has been said to indicate the range and interest of Professor Miller's discussion. This is an ambitious book, in that it is not afraid of large syntheses, nor of tackling a large number of difficult problems in its stride. Consequently the reader may be liable to quarrel with some, perhaps with many, of the things Professor Miller says; but he certainly should not fail to be interested and stimulated. R. C. CROSS. Sociologie Generale. By EUGEINE DUPREIEL, Presses Universitaires de France, 1948. Pp. 398. Tmis book is a formal and in the opinion of the reviewer sterile attempt at a systematic typology of societies. It treats of such abstractions as le rapport social, le groupe social, la symbiose sociale, les instincts sociaux, force et structure, naissance et dissolution des societes, la vie en groupe et l'individu, and so forth, and tries to organise them into a conceptual system. The treatment is in the philosophical tradition, being a dialect- ical analysis of concepts rather than an inductive analysis of observed behaviour. In this respect the author follows the methodology of certain German sociologists in their attempts at systematic classification, and his book may perhaps be of greater interest to logicians than to sociologists in England, for English sodciology has for the most part an empirical tradi- tion behind it. It is rarely that the author gives evidence that his formulations are</page><page sequence="13">402 NEW BOOKS based on a study of the considerable literature on actual societies, including the many detailed sociological investigations which have been made during the last fifty years, and it is seldom that he even illustrates his theorems by other than hypothetical examples. Consequently the book lacks a sense of reality and sometimes gives the impression of being an elaboration of arid commonplaces, such as the following. " D'apres le nombre des individus impliques dans la relation, les rapports sociaux sont singuliers, collectifs ou mixtes " (p. 11). " Au point de vue de la dure'e, on classera les rapports sociaux en ephemeres, durables, et permanents" (p. 11). Un groupe social ou une societe est une collection d'individus unis entre eux et distingues des autres individus par des rapports sociaux positifs et complkmentaires " (p. 20). " En resumre et sous une forme plus portative, d'apres le mode caracteristique de cohesion, quatre especes de groupes sociaux: familles ou parentes, groupes de force, groupes de croyance ou d'opinion; groupes d'e'changes " (p. 41). Analytical abstractions of this kind are doubtless necessary but they are too deductive and too arbitary unless constantly tested for truth and utility by reference to the body of descriptive facts. There are close on four hundred pages of them relieved by only occasional references to historic or contemporaneous societies, and it may be doubted whether systematisations of so abstract a character have much heuristic value. The formulations may be true but they neither arise out of, nor can be used as tools of, sociological research. E. E. EVANS-PRITCHARD An Introduction to Ethics. By WILLIAM LILLIE. London: Methuen, 1948. Pp. 354. 12s. 6d. ESSENTIALLY for the first year student, this book is in effect a twentieth century substitute for McKenzie's Manual of Ethics which the author used while teaching in the University of the Panjab. In the selection and arrangement of topics discussed and in adopting the systematic rather than the historical approach, Dr. Lillie follows his prototype closely. His treatment is, however, simpler, less diffuse, and has the advantage of avoid- ing " the now unfamiliar language of late nineteenth century idealism ". An admirable introductory chapter is followed by three chapters on moral psychology (based on McDougall) and moral epistemology. Here more space might perhaps have been devoted to the problems raised in these fields by psycho-analysis and logical positivism. Eight chapters analyse 'theories of the moral standard' (relativist, intuitionist, hedonist, etc.) and five discuss problems of theory and practice, individual and state, rights and duties, virtue, and the relation of ethics to religion and meta- physics. In these chapters, extensive and able use is made at an ele- mentary level of the ethical writings of Moore, Broad, Ewing, Paton, Taylor, Laird, Ross, Reid, Bergson and Berdiaev. The systematic dis- cussion is supplemented, under the appropriate rubrics, by special sections criticising works by prominent 'classical' moralists (Butler, Kant, Sidgwick, etc.). To counteract the unavoidable brevity and consequently misleading neatness of the discussions in an introductory work where so much ground is covered, more stress should :have been laid on the necessity of supplementing the argument throughout by the reading suggested in</page><page sequence="14">NEW BOOKS 403 the excellent bibliography (which includes articles in MIND). Intelligent, use of this book and its bibliography should undoubtedly enable the first year student, even if he has no previous philosophical training, to become familiar with the main topics and trends of contemporary ethical dis- cussion in this country.

Yale University Press (London: Geoffrey Cumberlege). 22s. TEIs sumptuously produced volume contains two pieces of interest to readers of MIND. The first, " Musonius Rufus, the Roman Socrates " by Cora E. Lutz contains text and translation of the works attributed to Musonius, a Stoic philosopher of the time of Nero, preceded by a life and a careful examination of all the data concerning him. Musonius appears as an attractive figure, a man of good sense, a humanitarian and a moderate feminist, but there appears to be little in his works which would justify the parallel suggested by the title. The second paper, " Plato's Theory of Natural Law " by Joseph P. Maguire, is of more philosophical interest. Mr. Maguire is concerned to maintain that there is a single theory of natural law, i.e., of the objective standard by which positive law is to be judged implicit throughout Plato's dialogues from the Gorgias to the Laws. This standard or criterion is the purpose of a divine demiurge. Mr. Maguire argues with a wealth of detail that theories which are prima facie quite different can be brought together under this concept. Attractive as this may be as a unifying hypothesis, the detail is difficult to work out. Is there room for the Form of the Good in the Laws, for example, or for the Demiurge in the central books of the Republic ? Mr. Maguire himself seems sometimes a little unclear on the necessary distinction between the Demiurge and any kind of Form, even the Form of the Good (p. 173). Some non-misleading misprints, especially in the Greek words quoted in the text, mar the production, and Mr. Maguire's fondness for the phrase ' criteriological value ' is rather worrying. There must be a simpler way of saying this. Why not, " value as a criterion " ? MARTHA KNEALE. Government and the Arts of Obedience. By WILLIAM W. HOLLISTER. Columbia University Press (London: Geoffrey Cumberlege), 1948. Pp. 139. Ils. 6d. THE author sets out to classify, describe and appraise (from a utilitarian point of view) the different relationships which exist to-day between governors and governed. He distinguishes five such relationships, which he labels respectively " domination ", "command ", "leadership ", " administration " and " representation ". Domination is rule by threat of force or by playing off one group against another. Command relies on</page><page sequence="15">404 NEW BOOKS a general readiness for group action: it assumes authority by impersonat- ing the general will and surrounding itself with the external trappings of office. Leadership emphasises the qualities of the individual in control rather than his position or function, and it exists where the followers feel that they will find their desires carried out whenever possible. Administra- tion is responsibility for carrying out social tasks of a specialised character which are publicly agreed to be desirable; and it secures obedience in return for services rendered. Representation depends on encouraging the expression of conflicting interests and on resolving the conflict in joint action; the individual representative accepts the decisions of the repre- sented and modifies his actions to conform with their wishes. Mr. Hollister compares these five forms of government to a spectrum, because each shades imperceptibly into the next and all five can be present in the same situation. He thinks of this spectrum as bounded on the one hand by coercion, in which obedience is unwilling but resistance is over- come, and on the other by custom, in which obedience is so natural that control is perfunctory. The author draws his general distinctions clearly and elaborates them in an interesting way, discussing also what he considers to be the corresponding corruptions of government. The book would be a useful tonic for anyone who thought that the only way to learn how people are governed is to study their constitutional laws. Its point of view is that of the social technician rather than that of the lawyer. But Mr. Hollister's appraisals of the advantages and disadvantages of these various methods of government do not go much boyond what any intelli- gent schoolboy could think out for-himself. That is to say, he makes no attempt to survey the evidence which modern history could supply in this connexion. Indeed, the book would profit by a much more liberal reference to factual detail: Chapter 1, on "Custom and Convention ", hardly cites more than one actual custom or convention. One would like to know, for instance, whether any sample surveys have been made of the reasons why people obey governmental instructions, and if the results of such a survey have been compared with regard to country, class of person, type of instruction and actual situation. This vagueness as to evidential detail is not unique in Mr. Hollister's sociology (compare, for instance, Karl Mannheim's -Man and Society). But sociologists can scarcely claim the dignified title of " science " for their work unless they are prepared to make full use of modern techniques of social survey. Generalisations and ab- stractions need to be supplemented by reference to statistical evidence. (I take it that the author's description of his work as a " philosophical analysis " (p. 94) is not to be taken in any technical sense.) The style in which the book is written is sometimes turgid and imprecise, and there are several rather wild remarks. For instance, we are told that " Election by lot was considered the only guarantee of equal participation in Greek times " (p. 65), and the administrator whose skill comes from practice and experience is said to be like " the wise man of Greek ethics " (p. 92). Kant's theory of the categorical imperative is treated in a curious way: e.g., " For Kant's analysis of moral obligation, the imperatives of reason become the protection of the practical reason against paralysis, rather than an agent of intelligence. The categorical imperative in its last analysis is only an exhortation to steadfastness and decision " (p. 68). But the main argument of the book is not affected by these eccentricities. There is a bibliography and an index. L. JONATHAN COHEN.</page><page sequence="16">NEW BOOKS 405 Moral Intuition and the Principle of Self-realisation. By C. A. CAMPBELL. Annual philosophical lecture (Henriette Hertz Trust), British Academy, 1948. Proc. of the British Academy, vol. xxxiv. London, Geoffrey Cumberlege. Pp. 36. Price 5s. 6d. PRoOFESSOR Campbell is primarily concerned in this lecture to establish the claim that the principle of self-realisation is the ultimate moral principle and a, " genuine object of intuition ". He starts from the valid assertion that all ethical theories, but not " every theory about ethics ", appeal ulti- mately to intuition, and satisfies himself that the alleged intuitions of other " Monistic " and " Pluralistic " theories " fail to pass the test of harmony with the moral judgements of mankind ". In a brief review it will perhaps be best to leave his criticisms unexamined' and consider, on its own merits, his own suggestion that the basie moral intuition is of an obligation of self-realisation. His first concern is to clear the theory of the charge of egoism. He distinguishes between " instinctive impulses " and " desires ". " Impulse becomes desire when, and only when, I become aware of the object as my object "; in other words, desire, as opposed to impulse, is for what I think to be my " personal good ". So far only need the deliberate, non-impulsive actions of a man be self- referent. Although in acting from desire I do that which satisfies or realises me, the ends of desire are not necessarily egoistic. A psycho- logical hedonist may still argue that, in fact, men do act from selfish motives, but Professor Campbell has shown that the acceptance of his view does not necessitate such a conclusion. He now endeavours to establish his main contention. Now it is one thing to assert that duty, good and desire are closely linked, that, when I recognise action x to be good, I implicitly recognise it to be good for me and that, in performing it, I am satisfying or realising myself. But it is quite another thing to assert or imply, as Professor Campbell does, that to do x is good because, in doing it, I am realising myself. Since on his view my basic moral intuition is of an obligation to realise myself, an obligation, say, to help others must be conditional on its promoting my self-realisation. This is really disguised egoism. If, however, Professor Campbell would say that I ought to do x for any other reason than to achieve self-realisation, self-realisation is not the ultimate moral principle. In order to make his theory more acceptable, Professor Campbell attempts to show not only that self-realisation is compatible with social unselfishness (and we need not disagree), but also that in general the most permanent and comprehensive human desires work to the good of others. This may be so, but unless he can show that a man ought to satisfy these desires for their own sake, he must admit that if a burglar has an active and constant interest in crime he ought to gratify that interest rather than transient feelings of compunction or anxiety for the welfare of his victims. D. MITCHELL. Thomas von Aquin: In Librum Boethii de Trinitate Quaestiones Quinta et Sexta, herausgegeben von PAUL WYSER, 0. P. Freiburg (Switz.) and Louvain, 1948. Pp.,80 (offprint from 'Divus Thomas', xxv. 437-85 and xxvi. 74-98). THE text edited here with greater care than ever before from Aquinas' autograph copy is the last section of his work on the first two chapters 27</page><page sequence="17">406 NEW BOOKS of Boethius' De Trinitate. In quaestio v Aquinas interprets, justifies, and defends the Aristotelian division of theoretical sciences into physics (naturalis philosophia), mathematics, and theology (divina scientia), a division based on the presence or absence of matter and movement in the things under consideration (physics and theology), and on our ab- stracting from matter and movement (mathematics). In the first article of qucaestio vi he struggles with the more hopeless task of making clear the sense of Boethius' terms-awkwardly translated from the fiftJ? entury Greek-characterising the different methods proper to the three sciences: ' rationabilis ' for physics, ' disciplinabilis ' for mathematics, and ' intell- ectualis ' for theology. The other articles of quaestio vi discuss the limits of our 'natural' knowledge of God. The main tenets of Aquinas' theory of knowledge are, of course, present all through the discussions, and Fr. Wyser is probably right in calling these two quaestiones " Thomas' amplest treatise on epistemology "; but, detached as they are from the first four quaestiones in which illumination and the equation between Aristotle's ?OEoAo7La and the 'scientia fidei' are treated among other things, these two quaestiones give an incomplete picture of Aquinas' doctrines. The character of the In Librum de Trinitate-something between a commentary and an independent treatise , its date (c. 1260), its general contents, and the method followed in editing it, are learnedly and clearly discussed in the introduction. The notes give all the references to, and many quota- tions of, the authorities mentioned, and not mentioned, by Aquinas; Fr. Wyser's accuracy can hardly be surpassed, but it would be better to quote the Latin translations used by Thomas, rather than the Greek originals, or later versions. A historico-philosophical commentary, which is almost completely missing here, is partly provided by M.

Eerdmans Publishing, Co., Grand Rapids, Michigan, U.S.A., 1948. Pp. 80. Price $1.50. Tius is a remarkable example of a book which " would have been much shorter had it not been so short ", for in it Dr. Dooyeweerd attempts an exposition of the fundamentals of his new Dutch school of Calvinistic philosophy, the " Philosophy of the Idea of Law ", by " demonstrating in a really scientific way the intrinsic relation between science and religion ". His theme is that the " autonomy of reason " is a dogmatic prejudice, i.e. that in stating or implying a " theoretical total-view of reality ", which " all possible philosophy " must do, philosophers cannot be unpre- judiced and have no absolute standard of truth in human reason alone (without Divine Revelation); that this can be seen from the variety of irreconcileable philosophical "isms ", and is here demonstrated in a radical-critical examination of the structure of theoretical thought-a critique which reveals the transcendent Self (the religious centre of our existence) as the "hidden player playing on the keyboard of theoretical thought " (p. 54); and that the Self (and hence theoretical thought) is</page><page sequence="18">NEW BOOKS 407 dominated (often unconsciously) by religious motives, e.g. " Matter and Form ", " Nature " and " Grace ", the effects of which throughout history are traced in the last section of the book. Unfortunately, despite some interesting obiter dicta, his exposition of his theme not only involves dubious hypostatisations and unsupported generalisations, but is maorred by a large number of vague and obscure statements in a formidable and inadequately defined terminology (espec- ially in the key section of the cri4ique, pp. 36-55,'and above all pp. 42-8). Hence, although these may be the faults of an excessive condensation of what is set forth in the five volumes of his two major philosophical works (in Dutch), Dr. Dooyeweerd is hardly likely to make many converts by this book, especially among those who feel that the errors in the meta- physical systems of the past and in many of the " isms " of to-day, are. sufficiently explained as due to bad logic, misconceptions about language or mathematics, etc., without recourse to the hidden workings of religious motives.
