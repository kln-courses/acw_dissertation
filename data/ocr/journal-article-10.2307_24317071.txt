<plain_text><page sequence="1">About 22 kilometers southwest of the City of Toluca is the extinct volcano called El Nevado de Toluca, also known as Xinantécatl. It is the fourth highest mountain in Mexico and "is formed by built-up lava flows and volcanic detritus. It was a product of frequent eruptions and clouds of gas and vapors accompanied by great quantities of ash and pumice". Its height is 4,558 meters above sea level. Geologists tell us that millions of years ago there was a violent explosion in the Xinantécatl. From its wide crater flowed quantities of burning lava which covered the sur rounding countryside. The volcanic chimney shot out fiery rocks until its fury subsided enough to permit closing it off by a plug of solidified lava which on cooling totally sealed off the central part of the crater. In this manner the crater was divided into two smaller ones which later were partially filled by melting snows to form two beautiful small lakes. The larger is known as the Lake of the Sun and the smaller as the Lake of the Moon. The Lake of the Sun measures 400 meters by 200 and is 4209 meters above sea level while the Lake of the Moon measures 200 meters by 75 and is 4216 meters above the sea. In respect to the altitudes of these lakes, inspired by a desire to obtain additional information as well as a confirma tion or a denial that these two lakes are the highest in the world, I wrote to the editors of Collier's Encyclopedia who informed me that Lake Tulainyo in California is the highest lake in the United States with a height of 3921 meters and Lake Titicaca, between Peru and Bolivia, is 3910 meters high. Subsequently I received a letter from James Edmonds, a member of The American Institute, who informed me that the highest lake in the United States is Lake Waian in Hawaii which is 3962 meters high. He also stated that Frozen Lake, in California, is 3921 meters high. From distant Pakistan I received word that there in the high mountains above the five thousand meter level there are small lakes. But since these are fed by the melting snows of high peaks they are not always of the same depth nor is their altitude level constant. So we may conclude that there are no real lakes higher than those of the Nevado de Toluca, whose altitude and depth do not vary as is the case of the others. Antonio García Cubas, the Mexican geographer, tells in his book the tale of the scientists Dolfuss and Montserrat who made the ascent of the Nevado in the nineteenth cen tury. In their description they state that the crater is ellip tical with major and minor axes of 1431 and 595 meters respectively. These results were obtained with a theodolite. Dolfuss and Montserrat calculated for the "Pico del Fraile", the highest point on the mountain, an altitude of 4758 meters and later referred to the measurements carried out by the Mexican geographer Velasquez de León who around the middle of the past century transported a canoe to the Lake of the Sun where he took soundings. He found a depth of 82</page><page sequence="2">NEVADO DE TQLBCÁ 12 to 14 meters in the center and these figures are accepted Zinacantepec is derived from the same roots tzinacan (bat) as maximum depths for both lakes.

Of about fifteen offerings so examined nothing was found. Other offerings were cut open to find out what else they might contain besides the copal gum. Many of these con tained small wooden splinters and others had maguey thorns, undoubtedly signifying the relation of the offerings to the earth fertility rites.

The difficulty rities. in my opinion is that in locating objects submerged under water in 40 to 60 centimeters of ooze it is necessary to swim as close to the bottom as possible and grope with the hands in the mud. The diver then has two choices: to use clumsy neoprene gloves or reject such protection against the cold and use his bare hands to locate and speedily recognize the offerings of copal and other objects hidden by the mud. This ooze completely covers the bottoms of both lakes whose transparent waters permit visibility up to eight or ten meters. But the slightest touch stirs up the mud and visibility is lost. This it is necessary to work quickly with the hands while continually swimming forward into water which has not lost its clarity. As regards stratigraphy which is considered so fundamen tal for establishing chronology of deposits we ask how it would be possible to follow this procedure in the lakes of the Xinantécatl where any sinking object settles down through the sixty centimeters of thin mud to rest on the hard bottom. Thus it is practically impossible to make stratigraphic studies. We have attempted to supply this deficiency with the most exhaustive bibliographical research in order to learn all we can regarding the ancestral cult of the water gods in these high mountain lakes. 84</page></plain_text>
