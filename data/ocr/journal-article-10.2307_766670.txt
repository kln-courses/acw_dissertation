<plain_text><page sequence="1">The Four Evangelist Symbols Page in the Book of Durrow1 MARTIN WERNER Rutgers University FIGURE I. Book of Durrow, Dublin, Trinity College, Ms. 57 (A. IV. 5),fol. 2r. The Book of Durrow, the earliest Insular Gospels with illustrations,2 contains five folios with representations of the symbols of the Evangelists. Each of the symbols is given a full page and all four appear together on folio 2r at the manuscript's opening (Fig. i). The series of sep- arately pictured symbols has attracted considerable schol- arly attention. The four symbols page, on the other hand, has scarcely been mentioned, yet it is iconographically the most complex of the book's figural compositions; its analy- sis may yield important insights into the question of the models available to the seventh-century Hiberno-Saxon scriptoria. Each of the singly illustrated creatures prefaces one of the Gospels. The man symbol appears on folio 2iv facing the opening of Matthew (Fig. 2), the eagle is seen on folio 84v at the opening of Mark (Fig. 3), the ox is placed on folio I24v initiating Luke (Fig. 4) and the lion is on folio 19iv at the beginning of the Gospel of St. John (Fig. 5). This arrangement would necessarily make the eagle the symbol of St. Mark, the lion the symbol of St. John. Several explanations have been advanced which indicate that this disposition was originally intended, each based on the fact that on the back of folio 84 (eagle) and folio I9I (lion) an explicit of the previous Gospel appears.3 W. O'Sullivan of Dublin's Trinity College Library has stated that these "explicits were in the hand of the original scribe" so that there can be "no question of a later trans- position."4 Accordingly, the text follows the usual order - Matthew - Mark - Luke - John - but the symbols for Mark and John are not those advocated by St. Jerome. Ap- parently they depend upon an exegesis advanced by St. Ireneus,5 the second-century Bishop of Lyon, and which appears in the prologue of a biblical poem attached to the Historia Evangelica by the fourth-century Spaniard Juvencus;6 it is seen again on folio I69v in the late eighth-century Irish Mac Regol Gospels.7 T. D. Brown and R. L. S. Bruce-Mitford have con- jectured that while the Durrow scribe probably followed the order of Ireneus for his full-page symbols, he may have been working from a Gospels exemplar without separate illustrations of the symbols but which did contain a folio picturing the four creatures. He therefore would have turned to the latter-the composition inspiring folio 2r- and separating and enlarging its symbols, use them to in- troduce each of the Gospels.8 C. Nordenfalk has recently proposed a somewhat different thesis but one which again interprets folio 2r in terms of the order of these prefatory miniatures. He too understands the separate symbol pages as following the order of Ireneus but also to reflect a knowledge of a symbol type he calls the "terrestrial" and which is characterized by being full-length and "naked," that is, lacking wings, haloes, books or other attributes. This type, Nordenfalk says, was introduced by way of an illustration of the four living creatures in a second-century 3</page><page sequence="2">Gospel harmony written by Tatianus, the Diatessaron.9 Nordenfalk does not enunciate a connection between the isolated symbol pages and folio 2r except to suggest that the latter depends upon a Juvencus manuscript illustration displaying the symbols according to the system of Iren- eus.10 The implication, presumably, is that the creatures on folio 2r follow the same order as those separately pre- sented. Brown and Bruce-Mitford, then, view folio 2r as inspiring the creation of the individually represented Evangelist symbols while Nordenfalk interprets the page as reflecting (or influencing?) the St. Ireneus order em- ployed for the remaining symbol folios. In either case the two symbol sets are made to appear intimately related by order or typology and little or no distinction is drawn between the models which may have influenced each. Nordenfalk is undoubtedly correct in concluding the Durrow full-length creatures depend upon a rare and early Evangelist symbol type. Whether this type was introduced from a second-century Diatessaron miniature remains problematic but its availability to the Durrow master seems assured; he did not have to turn to the model con- sulted for folio 2r for inspiration for his full-page symbols. It remains to be seen, however, whether the two symbol sets are related in terms of the order which each follows. The creatures on folio 2r are inserted into compartments created by the joining of the arms of a large interlaced cross to a rectangular frame. Each of the symbols is up- right. The man symbol, represented as a squared bust, appears above to the left of the crossing. The eagle is full- length and is placed at the same level to the right; its head is in profile and nimbed. Below, the lion, occupying the compartment at the left, is apparently standing on its hind legs and the ox, like the man symbol depicted as a clothed bust, is at the right. Each creature, except the eagle, is shown enface. The order in which they are to be viewed is ambiguous, as there are no identifying inscrip- tions. For them to follow the system of St. Ireneus-with the eagle symbolizing St. Mark, the lion, St. John-the creatures must be read clockwise beginning with the man at the upper left. However, if this order was not that intended in the model there is nothing to connect the miniature with a Juvencus prototype. As we shall see, it is likely that the system of Ireneus did not inspire the symbols' placement. Moreover, it will also become ap- parent the order which the Durrow creatures follow must be sought elsewhere than in compositions which arrange FIGURE 2.

In the Essen miniature the winged figures are a hybrid type-the John symbol is full-length, the Matthew, Mark and Luke symbols seem to depend on half-length types-but again an effort is made to make them all appear upright. Only on the Durrow page, despite the composi- tion's extreme simplicity, are the beasts convincingly and unequivocally upright in relation to the ground line of the compartments they occupy. Considering the folio's unique position as the first of its type, it seems reasonable to con- clude that its emphasis on the upright posture may have helped inspire the attempts to turn normally quadrupedal creatures into upright figures in later Insular compositions. Its prototypical position may also help explain the differ- ences between the arrangement of its symbols and that of the later illustrations, for if, as with the manuscript's separately depicted creatures, this arrangement depends upon an early, non-Vulgate exegesis, this system was probably found to be inappropriate for Latin Gospels and was abandoned for the eighth and ninth-century Insular four symbols pages. Although we hope to demonstrate a significant distinc- tion between the order followed by the two symbol sets in Durrow, this is not to say they were conceived as com- FIGURE 7. Book of Kells, Dublin, Trinity College, Ms. 58 (A. I. 6), fol. 27V. pletely separate entities. Indeed, a relationship is to be observed which suggests that rather than borrowing types from the four symbols page for his full-page creatures the Durrow artist reversed this process for two of the beasts on folio 2r. Typologically the man and eagle on this page are quite similar to their larger counterparts, although the eagle becomes more pointedly symbolic by being equipped with a halo, an attribute missing from folio 84v. The man symbols also diverge slightly. That on folio 2r raises its right arm over its chest, while the figure on folio 2iv lacks any indication of extremities. These seemingly insignificant distinctions may, in fact, indicate the availability of a symbols group separate from that inspiring the full-page naked series. Be that as it may, the lion and ox beneath the crossbar on the four symbols page are sharply dis- tinguished from their counterparts. Whereas on folio I9iv and folio I24v they are shown in profile, striding across the field as actual, if stylized beasts, on the cross page they are presented as rigidly upright; the lion stands on its hind quarters, hieratic and frontal, the ox is represented without extremities but is seemingly dressed in a garment which covers its body.'9 Picturing the symbols as upright neces- sitates no basic change in appearance for the man and eagle but must do so for the normally quadrupedal lion and ox. This fact may explain both the similarities and differences between the symbol sets in our codex. The two have strong typological associations only when each em- ploys figures which are customarily upright: the man and 6</page><page sequence="5">eagle. Otherwise they are essentially dissimilar. It is ob- vious the Durrow artist felt a need to make all his symbols uniformily upright. He was content to rely, with only slight modifications, on the naked type employed elsewhere in the manuscript when he could, but was forced to radi- cally depart from the full-page series to create two of his symbols. The question immediately presenting itself is what compelled him in this direction; why an upright lion and ox when a number of symbol types including the naked variety-which he effectively employs to preface each of the Gospels-was available to him? This problem, as will become apparent, is intimately linked to that concerning the order of the symbols. The unnatural disposition of the four symbols page's up- right lion and ox-the frontal positioning of the first com- bined with the bust-like depiction and especially the dress of the second-is trenchant indication that our Hiberno- Saxon artist was attempting to imbue his animal symbols with anthropomorphic qualities. The result is the creation of two creatures no longer completely zoomorphic yet not possessing human hands and/or feet, distinctive elements of that strange Evangelist symbol type which should be called the zooanthropomorphic. Could it be, confronted with a model employing such zooanthropomorphic beings in a cross composition, the Durrow master chose to follow its example only in part, using more orthodox creatures where he could (man and eagle) but when this proved im- possible, following his model more closely (but again not completely) to create the bizarre and otherwise typo- logically inexplicable ox and lion? The zooanthropomorphic Evangelist symbol type ap- pears in the West in a variety of iconographic contexts by the sixth century.20 Symbols are employed in sculptural settings independent of central cross or other symbolic foci and they are found in true Majesty scenes; the earliest example of such a Majestas composition is a Visigothic re- lief from St. Martin de Dume, now in the Braga Museum, Portugal.21 At its center Christ stands in an aureole sup- ported by two angels and symmetrically flanked by full- length, nimbed, winged and clothed figures shown pre- senting their Gospels to the Savior. Three have animal heads. In the sphere of manuscript illumination such full-length creatures are employed as initials in the mid- eighth century Gellone Sacramentary, a work associated with Flavigny.22 Another North French manuscript per- haps written at Corbie (or Amiens) a few years later, the Gospels of Sainte-Croix of Poitiers, contains an introduc- tory Majestas miniature with an enthroned Christ sur- rounded by medallions containing labeled busts of the animal-headed Evangelist symbols.23 Once again they present their Gospels to Christ. Similar bust symbols also appear in contemporaneous Insular manuscripts; the Rome and Maeseyck Gospels employ such figures in their so- called Beast Canon Tables.24 Finally, at the end of the eighth century, full-length zooanthropomorphic symbols appear in the Book of Kells.25 Thus it is not difficult to imagine the Durrow master being acquainted with a zoo- anthropomorphic symbols group. Of course, none of the compositions cited above combine Evangelist symbols and central cross, the arrangement suggested as possibly prompting the Durrow artist to create a set of upright figures on folio 2r. There are, however, Latin compositions of disparate date and provenance which eloquently argue for the possibility that such a representation was available to our Insular master. One is the obverse of the eleventh-century Irish Shrine of St. Molaise, now in the National Museum, Dublin (Fig. Io).26 It features full-length, upright and winged Evangelist symbols identified by labels and dis- posed in the Latin order in the interspaces of an interlaced cross. Although these creatures are extremely stylized and lack discernible hands, their postures and the fact that the Mark symbol is clothed (lemonstrate the relief's depend- ence upon a composition very like that proposed as known to the Durrow artist. Certainly, despite its late date, because of its more explicit use of the zooanthropomorphic symbol type in relation to an interlaced cross, the St. Molaise Shrine strengthens our thesis concerning the four symbols page model. A second composition further under- lining the possibility of a cross design with animal-headed symbols being available to our Insular artist is folio lv in an Orosius manuscript (ca. 750) from the scriptorium of Iaon and still in that city (Fig. I ).27 The frontispiece shows the Agnus Dei, equipped with a cross halo and identified by an inscription, standing within the central square of a cross which ends in circular terminals occupied by busts of the animal-headed Evangelist symbols; Matthew and Mark are respectively at the left and right ends of the latitudinal cross bar, Luke is above and John below on the longitudinal axis. A heavy rectangular frame outlined in pearl banding and filled with decorative quad- rupeds joins the cross to form compartments containing 7</page><page sequence="6">the Alpha and Omega. Foliate decoration fills the cross itself. We recall that in another eighth-century North French codex, the Essen Gospels, a miniature is devoted to a similar arrangement but with more orthodox symbols framing a frontal bust of Christ centered on an interlaced cross, and that a related composition appears in the Trier Gospels. The Agnus Dei was, in the Early Christian period, employed in symbolic Crucifixion and Majesty compositions. A comparison between the Laon and Essen folios suggests the Lamb was used interchangeably with the portrait of the Savior during the early Middle Ages; that is to say, the meaning of the Laon page as a symbolic Majestas Domini is not appreciably altered by the substi- tution of Lamb for bust of Christ.28 Rather its animal- headed symbols cause the miniature to become a rare variant of such a Majesty type. The Orosius page, although later than the Durrow com- position and differing from it in its ornamentation, is iconographically more complex. Therefore it becomes possible to envision folio 2r as a simplified version of a symbolic Majesty which arranged zooanthropomorphic symbols in relation to a monumental cross with a portrait of the Agnus Dei or Christ at its center. A third Latin monument relevant to our analysis of the Durrow page encourages this hypothesis. Significantly, it is a work created in the British Isles and assigned a date no later than A.D. 8oo-the sculptured slab from Wirksworth, Derby.29 In its upper register is a large Greek cross with the Agnus Dei at its center. Upright busts of the animal- headed symbols shown holding their Gospels appear in the interspaces and in a number of respects are more closely akin to the creatures on folio 2r in Durrow than those of t:he Laon miniature (Fig. 12). Both Insular compositions insert bizarre, upright bust symbols (man and ox in Dur- row) into compartments created by central cross and enclosing frame. Such similarities of type and setting seem too striking not to betray a reliance on related iconographic models. Surely, whether the four symbols composition suggested as available to the Durrow master included a central Agnus Dei (or bust of Christ) or had abandoned it, it almost certainly descended from a symbolic cross-type Majestas representation featuring four zooanthropo- morphic symbols of the Evangelists. W\here could such a representation have originated? It has been convincingly demonstrated that a number of scenes on the Wirksworth slab are most closely associated with early East Christian figurations;30 the Visigothic re- liefs and Merovingian miniatures which employ zooanthro- pomorphic symbols are, perhaps, even more clearly in- debted to Oriental models.31 For our purposes, this affilia- tion is most important as it concerns the Orosius miniature and it is therefore of special significance that the page's ornamental details--pearl banding, foliate forms, decora- tive animals-find striking analogies in Early Christian Syriac and Coptic art and that a similar association exists between closely related North French illustrations and Oriental works.32 Micheli has suggested that the similarities between Insular and Merovingian manuscripts associated with Corbie reflect a dependence on common pictorial prototypes "interprete(s) differement," an observation which acquires special meaning when applied to the Dur- row and Laon compositions.32 The Orosius page was created about a hundred years after the Book of Durrow. Since it could not have influenced the latter, yet is both similar to the Insular composition and, it would seem, indebted to Oriental sources, it becomes apparent that we should seek the model proposed as having a profound affect on the creation of the Durrow page in the southeast Mediterranean. Apart from the Orosius composition, those in the Essen, Trier and Durrow Gospels place their symbols around an interlaced cross. A full-page cross is often employed as an introductory composition in medieval manuscripts, espe- cially Gospel Books.34 In Oriental codices, most especially those created in Coptic Egypt, such frontispiece crosses are filled with interlace decoration. Recent scholarship has shown these frontispiece miniatures with monumental, interlaced crosses to have appeared in Egypt as early as the fourth century,35 and since connections have been demonstrated between early Coptic interlace patterns and those in the Book of Durrow and other Insular manu- scripts, it seems likely that the interlaced cross on folio 2r may depend upon Coptic inspiration.36 Of course, in the present context, the ultimate origin of this cross form and its ornament is of importance only in relation to the prob- lem of iconographic exemplars. In this sense, it becomes necessary to inquire into the existence of Oriental composi- tions which combine the interlaced cross with figural elements related to the symbols on the Durrow page. Such a synthesis is to be found in a number of medieval Oriental books. A folio in an eleventh-century Armenian Gospels in the Etschmiadzin Library (Ms. 3626) has, at 8</page><page sequence="7">FIGURE 8. Gospels, Trier, Domschatz, Ms. 6i (I34),fol. Iv. FIGURE 9. Gospels, Essen, Domsc.hatz, foio 2. FIGURE 9. Gospels, Essen, Domschatz, folio 29V. its center, a simple interlaced cross whose interspaces are occupied by medallions containing portraits of the Evan- gelists.37 More interesting is a symbolic composition in a thirteenth-century Coptic Gospels now in the Vatican Library (Ms. 9), for here a bust of Christ is employed at the center of a richly interlaced cross; labeled busts of the four Evangelists appear in medallions in the interspaces (Fig. I3).38 Matthew and Mark are seen respectively at left and right above, Luke and John at left and right below. The composition has obvious parallels with the four sym- bols page in Durrow and those in related Latin books- especially in the Trier and Essen Gospels. While late in date, the Vatican miniature is similar to a damaged frontis- piece in a Coptic manuscript of A.D. 906 now in the Mor- gan Library (Ms. 600) (Fig. I4).39 The latter arranges Evangelist portrait busts in medallions around a monu- mental cross in the same order-that followed by the canonical Gospels-as seen in the Vatican illustration, and again a bust of Christ appears at the center now supported by two flying angels and accompanied by the Madonna and Child in the base of the cross. Though iconographic- ally more intricate than the Vatican leaf, the page remains a symbolic Majesty: a cross with its bust of the Savior is framed by representations of the four authors. The Mor- gan manuscript's cross is not of the interlaced variety but, considering the earlier and eventually nearly ubiquitous use of interlaced crosses for Coptic frontispieces and the employment of the type as framework for a symbolic Majestas Domini in Vat. Copt. 9, this should not prevent us from presuming the existence of the interlaced-cross symbolic Majesty type by A.D. 9oo. Further, given the extreme conservatism of Coptic art40 and its development of variants on the Majestas theme at an early date, it seems likely that the interlaced-cross symbolic Majesty type was in use during the Early Christian period.41 Accepting this possibility and recalling the early medieval Latin works which both display Oriental affiliations and employ zoo- anthropomorphic Evangelist symbols (including those featuring the group in symbolic Majesty compositions), it is not difficult to imagine the Copts substituting animal- headed symbols for the authors they personify in symbloic Majesty designs. For many years, though scholars could not discover ex- amples of our bizarre symbol type in Coptic Egypt itself, the evidence provided by orientalized Latin monuments and the nature of pharaonic imagery and its persistence 9</page><page sequence="8">into the Coptic age, led to the suspicion that the animal- headed symbols were the product of Coptic imagination- perhaps descending from a pharaonic group of animal- headed dieties such as the four children of Horus.42 A little known Coptic fresco of eleventh-thirteenth century date has recently come to my attention which almost certainly assures the validity of this thesis. Moreover, it demon- strates not only that the Copts employed zooanthropo- morphic Evangelist symbols but that they used them in Majesty settings: the church of St. Anthony in the Desert has, attached to the south side of the narthex, a small chapel containing a well preserved fresco of the Panto- crator.43 He is seated on an elaborately decorated throne supported by four angels. Full-length, winged and clothed zooanthropomorphic symbols stand, in groups of two, on either side. Portraits of the Virgin and St. John complete the composition (Fig. I5). Such full-length symbols, as appear in this Coptic painting, are to be seen in contempor- aneous reliefs from the Ethiopic church of Bieta Golgota, Lalibela;44 there are independent indications that Egyptian Copts may have assisted in the construction of the famous rock-cut churches at this site.45 Later, during the fifteenth century, our symbol type is frequently found in Ethiopic Majesty and "Ascension" scenes.46 Ethiopic art was until the sixteenth century dependent upon Eastern models,47 yet its animal-headed symbol arrangements resemble the Visigothic, Merovingian and Insular compositions cited earlier. The St. Anthony fresco provides the strongest possible indication that these Latin and Ethiopic figura- tions, separated by great distance and by time, find their common sources in the art of Early Christian Egypt. Con- sequently, the possibility we have suggested, of an early Coptic composition which deployed zooanthropomorphic symbols around a bust of Christ on an interlaced cross, becomes immediately relevant. In this regard the excavations conducted by K. Michal- owski at Faras, just below Wadi Halfa on the Nile, are important. He has uncovered a series of Nubian frescoes variously dating between the eighth and the thirteenth century.48 As might be expected, considering the site's proximity to Coptic monasteries, a number of these paint- ings demonstrate dependence on Coptic iconographic models. Several of eleventh century date represent the Cross of Golgotha. In each a bust of Christ holding a codex is at the crossing, the head of Adam in the prominent stepped base, with the four living creatures above and FIGURE IO. Soiscll Molaise, Dublin, National Museum. below the cross bar.49 One of these compositions is espe- cially significant, for its symbols, upright and winged, (Fig. 16) are not far removed from the zooanthropomorphic type which, as we have seen, is found in the contemporaneous and intimately related art of Egypt and Ethiopia.50 The Faras crosses with their references to Golgotha combine Crucifixion symbolism with elements of the Majestas Domini. Although somewhat less emphatic, Crucifixion symbolism is also an aspect of the Laon Orosius frontispiece and Wirksworth relief. These Latin depictions substitute Lamb for Christ bust and do not specifically identify the cross as that at Calvary, but the prominence of the cross and the central Lamb are testimony to a retention of Crucifixion symbolism now subordinated to or merged with the Majestas theme. The content of these composi- tions is thus not essentially different from that of the Nubian frescoes.5s There can now be little doubt that they depend upon Coptic invention. We have noted that the placement of the Evangelist portrait busts in Morgan 600 and Vat. Copt. 9 seems in accordance with the usual sequence of the four Gospels- Matthew-Mark-Luke-John-when each now is read from left to right. It is therefore of interest that the four crea- tures of the Faras crosses, undoubtedly associated with the four Evangelist symbols, follow another order: angel eagle lion ox This arrangement is that most frequently employed in Oriental representations of Christ in Glory; the four IO</page><page sequence="9">FIGURE II.

Detail of upper regi heavenly creatures are placed behind or around the en- throned Christ's aureole. They are seen surrounding Christ in the sixth-seventh century apse frescoes of the Coptic monasteries of Bawit and Saqqara. In the seventh century Pantocrator Grotto fresco from Latmos, Asia Minor, created by Egyptian monks from Sinai and South Arabia, this arrangement is found again and with the creatures carrying books and thus identified with the four Evangelist symbols. These heavenly attendants are, of course, inspired by the descriptions of the four "living creatures" in Ezekiel (1:5-14) and the Apocalypse of John (4: 4-8).52 The Oriental understanding of the four heavenly crea- tures as the Evangelist symbols generally does not extend to an identification of individual symbols with the Evan- gelists they personify.53 This may help explain the fact that the apocalyptic order continues to be employed for the symbols when they are arranged around a cross. No doubt a distinction was drawn between the order to be followed when picturing the Evangelists in a symbolic Majestas where they suggest the Gospel sequence and that used for their symbols in a comparable setting. Since the symbols are not emphatically identified with individual Evangelists ster. II</page><page sequence="10">they continue to follow the traditional apocalyptic order assigned to the four living creatures in Majesty composi- tions. This observation has particular relevance for our study. It is clear that the Faras composition we have illustrated, with its upright, bust-like symbols inserted above and below the bar of a monumental cross, is iconographically related to the four symbols design in the Book of Durrow and the symbolic Majesty representations in the Laon Orosius and on the Wirksworth slab. A comparison be- tween the Durrow and Faras figurations makes it equally apparent that the Insular folio's symbols are deployed in the same order as those of the Nubian fresco. Hence, it is not only probable that our Hiberno-Saxon page depends upon a knowledge of a model which employed animal- headed symbols but that these prototypical zooanthropo- morphic symbols were arranged in the Oriental manner. Several conclusions may now be drawn concerning the origin of folio 2r in the Book of Durrow: The first in the long sequence of such Insular introductory miniatures, it is related to symbolic Majestas compositions appearing in Latin art during the second half of the eighth century. Most probably a simplified version of such representations, it no longer includes the central symbolic detail of Agnus Dei or bust of Christ but preserves references to the zoo- anthropomorphic symbol type. It also employs, in its placement of the symbols, an order separate from that commonly found in Latin representations and not seen in the subsequent Insular four symbols pages.64 This last factor and the miniature's use of a central interlaced cross -two elements setting the page apart from the Laon Orosius illustration-suggest a direct dependence on a Coptic model. As we have seen, there are Coptic miniatures which picture the Evangelist busts in medallions framing an interlaced cross, and zooanthropomorphic Evangelist symbols are to be found in medieval Coptic painting; the intimately related art of Christian Nubia employs a sym- bolic cross design around which symbols not unlike the zooanthropomorphic are arranged in the same Oriental order as in the Durrow miniature. Of course, this is not to say that the Durrow scribe did not interpret this order according to another system. Surely, if he arranged the Gospels following the Vulgate sequence and the full-page symbols according to the exegesis of Ireneus, he may have interpreted the creatures on his four symbols page as following one of these traditions; read clockwise they FIGURE 13.

FIGURE 16. Faras, Nubia, Cross of Golgotha fresco. follow the order of St. Ireneus, read counterclockwise they follow the order adopted by St. Jerome. Such speculation is, however, ultimately unrewarding. It is obvious that, however understood or justified, the disposition of symbols must directly depend upon the symbols grouping tradi- tionally employed in the Orient. The two symbols groups in the Book of Durrow, the full-page series and the upright set, despite certain similarities, must, therefore, descend from (at least) two different models. Whatever the source for the first, the second upright quartet is, in large measure, indebted to a venerable symbolic Majestas Domini com- position with zooanthropomorphic Evangelist symbols. Similarities between aspects of the decoration of the Book of Durrow-its color scheme, cross and carpet pages, interlace ornament, etc.-and early Coptic ornamental compositions have, in recent years, attracted the attention of a number of scholars.56 Because of the profusion and diffusion of ornament such comparisons have necessarily led to tentative conclusions as to origins and trans- mission. Given the almost certain iconographic derivation of the book's four symbols page from a rare and unusual composition created in Egypt and perhaps employed as an introductory miniature in an early Coptic manuscript, the debt owed by the Durrow scribe-artist to Coptic invention takes on demonstrable specificity.

Its text, a version of the Vulgate which includes some Old Latin parts, is usually assigned to a Columban scriptorium in Northumbria: E. A. Lowe, Codices latini antiquiores, II, Oxford, 1935, p. 43 and No. 273; Evangeliorum Quat- tuor Codex Durmachensis, Olten-Lausanne-Fribourg, I960, vol. I: facsimile, vol. II: text by A. A. Luce, G. O.

Folio I69vis a framed page with six compartments in which are written: "Matheus instituit virtutum tramite moras/ bene vivendi iucto dedit ordine legas./ Marcus amat terras inter caelumq. volare/ et vehymens aquila stricto secat omnia labsu./ Lucas uberius descripsit proelia xpi. iure/ sacrato vitulus quia vatum moenia fatur./ Iohannes fremit ore leo similisque rudendi/ intonat intonet eterne pandens mysteria vite./ Mac Regol dipincxit hoc evangelium. Quicumque legerit et intellegerit istam narrationem orat pro macreguil scriptori." Henry, op. cit., p. 172 and A. A. Luce, op. cit., pp. 8f., argue that the separate symbol pages in Durrow follow the Old Latin order of the Gospels. However, as Nordenfalk, op. cit., p. 134, n. 84, E. Kitzinger, "The Coffin Reliquary" in The Relics of St. Cuthbert, ed. C. F. Battiscombe, Oxford, 1956, p. 233, n. I and Bruce-Mitford, op. cit., p. 6, n. I. have correctly observed it is the order of Ireneus which more convincingly accounts for the symbol sequence; as the Mac Regol Gospels shows, this order was known in Ireland at an early date. 8. Ibid. Luce, op. cit., pp. 7 ff., also has suggested that the four Evangelist symbol pages were planned in connection with those of folio 2r. Therefore, he says, the latter set must follow the Old Latin order. 9. Nordenfalk's analysis (op. cit., pp. 119-40) of the illustrations in a sixteenth-century Persian copy of the Diatessaron written in Armenia (Florence, Bib. Laur. Cod. Orient 8I) leads him to propose their dependence on a miniature cycle in a second-century prototype. The Florence cycle begins with a carpet page composition which is similar to folio iv in the Book of Durrow. It also contains a diagram with the Evangelist symbols. Like the full-page, full-length examples in Durrow (and those seen in the slightly later Echternach Gospels), the Diatessaron creatures lack attributes. These similarities, Norden- falk concludes, result from the importation-perhaps as early as the second century-of an illustrated Diatessaron to Iona, there to pro- foundly influence the creation (among others) of the Book of Durrow five hundred years later. I cannot follow Nordenfalk in his conclusions. Undoubtedly a relation exists between the terrestrial symbols in the Diatessaron and those in our Insular codex but that this results from direct in- spiration is extremely doubtful. Symbols of the naked type appear at St. Vitale, Ravenna during the sixth century. The seventh century Latin Valerianus Gospels in Munich (Staatsbib. Clm. 6224) employs the type. They are also to be found (against a background of wings and with their Gospels placed behind or next to them) on the Throne of St. Mark, a stone reliquary A. Grabar, "La 'Sedia di San Marco' 1 Venise," Cahiers arch6ologiques, 1954, pp. 19-34, pls. VI-XI, suggests may have been carved in late sixth or seventh- century Coptic Egypt. The Throne of St. Mark symbols may follow the order of Ireneus (Nordenfalk, op. cit., p. I34) as do the full-page Durrow creatures. The symbols of the Diatessaron diagram are arranged in an order unrelated to any known in theological literature. Thus, the only similarities the Durrow creatures share with those of the Diatessaron illustration are their common completeness and their common lack of attributes. Since naked Evangelist symbols appear in Early Christian Italy (and much more closely resemble the Durrow animals than do the Diatessaron creatures) and (accepting Grabar's thesis concerning the Throne of St. Mark) in sixth-seventh century Oriental art as well, it seems less than likely the Durrow full-page symbols were directly inspired by a Diatessaron illustration.

I8, points out the two most important interpretations of the Evangelist symbols were those of Ireneus and Victorinus, Bishop of Poetovio in the third century (Comm. in Apoc.: P. L. 5, 317-18). Jerome adopted the second and it became the standard type in medieval art. In Insular art it appears in the Echternach Gospels, St. Gall Mss. 51 and 60, the Lindisfarne Gos- pels, the Book of Kells, the Book of Armagh, the Book of Dimma, the Harleian Gospels and the Mac Regol Gospels. See further F. van der Meer, Maiestas Domini, Rome, 1938, pp. 223-229; P. Bour- guet, "Les symboles des quatre evangelistes," Revue rtformte, Io, 1959, pp. 2-25. 18. The Eastern church on the principle of the proposed true order of writing favored the sequence Matthew-Mark-Luke-John. This system was adopted for almost all Greek Gospel Books and through the influence of Jerome became standard for the West. I9. P. Meyer's drawing of folio 2r (Evangeliorum Quattuor Codex Durmachensis, fig. 6) shows the man and ox symbols with feet. A careful examination has failed to reveal the existence of feet for the man. It is more difficult to state whether or not the ox possessed feet. There are some slight linear details below the bust which could be interpreted as such but they are probably only marks of age or damage. 20. See R.

The Gospels of St. Catherine at Maeseyck contains a com- plete set of Canon Tables with the symbols of the Evangelists on the last four pages. This set has stylistic associations with the Lindis- farne Gospels; it may be a product of the mid-eighth century. The manuscript also contains an incomplete Canon Table set (and an Evangelist portrait) perhaps created during the late seventh century. This fragment is sometimes associated with the Echternach scrip- torium; Nordenfalk believes it to be from York.

In- scriptions identify the Evangelist symbols as following the order of St. Jerome (see note I7). In a number of respects the Soiscel Molaise symbols are similar to those of the four symbols page in the late ninth-century Irish Book of Mac Durnan. The Mac Durnan symbols are upright creatures formed by joining the heads of the Evangelist symbols to large crossed wings. See F. Henry, L'art irlandais, (Zodiaque), 1963-64, II, pp. 155, 185, pl.

Within the Crucifixion setting the Agnus Dei is usually assigned an Eastern origin, for the great majority of such depictions come from the East Mediterranean. A ciborium column now in St. Marks features the theme (W. F. Volbach, Early Christian Art, London, 1961, p. 327 assigns it to fifth-century Constantinople), and it appears on the Byzantine silver gilt cross of Justin II of c. 575 A. D. (Rome, Museo Sacro Vaticano. See D. Talbot Rice, The Art of Byzantium, London, 1959, p. 305; E. Kitzinger, "Byzantine Art of the Period Between Justinian and Iconoclasm," Berichte zum XI. Internationalen Byzantinisten-Kongress, Munich, 1958, pp. 19 ff., 31 ff.). Other monuments of early date featuring the Agnus Dei in the manner described, found in Ravenna, Syria and Tunisia, have also been given Eastern attribution. Because of the Quinisexta Synod of 692 banning in its Canon 82 the use of the Lamb as repre- senting Christ, few such representations appear after A. D. 692 in the East but they continue to be found in the West and apparently are used interchangeably with the figure of the Savior (See L. Brehier, L'art chrttien, Paris, 1928, pp. 81-2). When the Lamb or bust of Christ is placed at the center of a cross and surrounded by the four Evangelist symbols several meanings are intended. Such representations become symbolic Crucifixion and symbolic Majesty designs. The two themes are, of course, com- plementary; Crucifixion is referred to within the framework of Majesty or perhaps more accurately, a synthesis is effected empha- sizing the metaphysical concept of triumph over death. For a dis- cussion of Latin works employing this iconography see M. Werner The 'Majestas Domini' and the Eastern Penetration of Hiberno-Saxon Art.

In the upper part of the cross are, according to Kurth, the Evangelists Mark and Matthew, below John and Luke. 30. Kurth, op. cit., 117 ff., has shown its models to be icono- graphically closest to Eastern sixth century representations and proposes-because several of the scenes are extremely rare during the Early Christian period or appear much later in Eastern works-that the scenes on the slab may have belonged to an ancient and lost pictorial cycle. 31.

The frontispiece to a Merovingian version of St. Augustine's Quaestiones in Heptateuchon (Paris, Bib. Nat. Lat. Ms. 12168), written at Corbie or Laon toward the middle of the eighth century, is closely related to the Laon 137 illustration. The famous Sacra- mentarium Gelasianum (Vatican, Reg. Lat. Ms. 313), most often assigned to Corbie, also makes use of this infrequently employed frontispiece type. It features the Agnus Dei within a large cross-as on the Orosius page. In the .uaestiones manuscript, a large cross also dominates the composition. An eagle is perched on this cross and framing cross and eagle is an arch supported by square "capitals" and "columns" which rest on the backs of two lions below. Orna- mental animals, foliage, interlace and geometric decoration fill both frame and the cross itself. S. Sulzberger, ibid, has proposed a Coptic origin for this composition (and its ornamental details). The decorative quadrupeds of the Laon 137 frontispiece are essentially the same as some of those in the Q_uaestiones illustration. An interesting relation also exists between the composition and the decoration of the Cross of Justin II of A. D. 565-578. Both works share the central, nimbed Agnus Dei and figures occupying the terminals of a cross. Also important is foliate decoration. Formal scrolls occupy the shaft and arms within a frame created by a double outline in the miniature and similar floral forms are more elaborately stated on the silver gilt cross-and include a leaf form of interest, for IS</page><page sequence="14">it appears at an early date and often in Sassanian and Coptic art (see M. Schapiro, "The Decoration of the Leningrad Manuscript of Bede," Scriptorium, 1958, pp. 194 ff.). Kitzinger, "Byzantine Art," pp. I8 ff. and n. 116, notes a relation between the decoration of the Cross of Justin II (and the Stuma plates) and that of the Canon Tables in the seventh-century Greek Gospels fragment in the British Museum (Add. Ms. 5II ). In both cases ornamental affiliations are strikingly Syriac rather than Hellenistic. See also Nordenfalk, Die Spatantiken Kanontafeln, pp. 127 ff.). On the Byzantine cross such foliate forms most probably indicate the absorbtion of Oriental ele- ments into sixth-century Constantinopolitan art. The relationship between Cross and Orosius Illustration therefore seems indicative of the illuminator's dependence on Coptic or Syriac compositions. Not only is the Cross's decoration more characteristically Syriac than Byzantine but it lacks the other Oriental motifs seen on the Merovingian page, the pearl banding and decorative animals in the frame: The certain dating of the Byzantine cross, however, does indicate the antiquity of the Oriental model(s) consulted for the Orosius page. For the Paris Quaestiones see also A. Boeckler Abend- landische Miniaturen, Berlin-Leipzig, 1930, p. I3: Lowe, op. cit., V, No. 630; Porcher, op. cit., No. 12. For the Gelasianum see Zimmer- mann, op. cit., II, pls. 135, 136. 33. Paris, Bib. Nat. Lat. Ms. 12190, a treatise by Augustine on the Gospels, of c. 760 and probably from Corbie, contains a very unusual folio for a Merovingian book, one completely given over to interlace decoration. Apparently this is the first appearance in a Continental book of the "carpet page", a composition characteristic for Hiberno-Saxon codices. The Corbie design places a series of interlace bands of several types in vertical and horizontal con- junction without a strong sense of order or balance. When compared to folio i25v in the Book of Durrow, a work apparently a hundred years earlier and characterized by handsome and crisply articulated decorative forms, it is the Merovingian page which appears more primitive and tentative. The softness and heaviness of its individual interlace bands have in the earlier work already yielded to the rhythmic complexity we associate with Hiberno-Saxon interlace. In other words, the Paris Ms. 12190 carpet page, although chrono- logically later than the Book of Durrow, seems closer than the In- sular design to its decorative sources. The closest parallels for the interlace patterns of Durrow appear in Coptic and Syriac works (see note 36). This is equally true for the Merovingian carpet page. Its retardataire decoration could not have been inspired by the ad- vanced patterns created in Insular centers by the late seventh century but rather seems to depend upon the same basic prototypes. Similar interlace patterns applied to initial decoration appear in related Merovingian books; for example, in Paris Lat. 12168 (fol. Ir). The cross in the Essen (ospels' symbolic Majestas page (Fig. 9) makes use of such patterns as well. (See Micheli, op. cit., pp. 81 ff.; F. Masai, Essai sur les origines de la miniature dite irlandaise, Brussels, 1947, pp. 55 ff.) Complicating this question is the apparent artistic interchange between the Corbie-Amiens scriptoria and Hiberno-Saxon centers during the eighth century. On this problem see Henry, L'art irland- ais, II, pp. 81 ff., 160, n. 3. 34. Cf. Nordenfalk, "An Illustrated Diatessaron," n. 18. 35. The recently discovered Coptic Acts of the Apostles (in the Glazier collection on deposit in the Morgan Library) of c. 400, con- tains a full-page colophon illustration of an interlaced crux ansata with peacocks and other birds. The manuscript is proof of the existence of interlaced cross pages in Egypt at an early date. It is also "the earliest complete illuminated manuscript of the Middle Ages extant": H. Bober, "On the Illumination of the Glazier Codex," Homage to a Bookman, Essays on MSS, Books and Printing Written for Hans P. Kraus, Berlin, 1967, pp. 31-49. 36. Nordenfalk, op. cit., pp. I25-6, is certainly correct in con- cluding that the cross-carpet page in Durrow (fol. Iv) and that in the sixteenth-century Florence Diatessaron (fol. 127) are related. His assertion, however, that the Durrow page was directly inspired by a second-century Diatessaron exemplar is questionable. Given the late date of the Florence recension and the similar-though not identical-illustrations in medieval Oriental books (especially Syriac codices) the possibility cannot be ruled out that the cross-carpet page in the Florence codex may depend on a medieval model. How- ever, even if we should grant the validity of Nordenfalk's thesis, the fact remains that the cross on folio 2v in Durrow is interlaced, while on folio Iv interlace is employed to decorate the areas surrounding the cross-in other words, it is used in a slightly different context. Then too, the interlace decoration of the Diatessaron miniature is of a simple two-band variety. While a somewhat more complex pattern is seen in the four Evangelist symbols composition in the Florence codex (which Nordenfalk compares to interlace in Durham Ms. A. II. 10, fol. 3v, a Hiberno-Saxon fragment somewhat earlier than the Book of Durrow) it nevertheless remains demonstrable that the interlace patterns in our insular codex-both simple and complex- are more closely similar to designs created in Early Christian Coptic Egypt than to those in Florence Cod. Orient 8I. (See Aberg, op. cit.; M. Werner, Coptic Elements in the Book of Durrow, unpublished thesis, Institute of Fine Arts, N. Y. Univ., I957; Nordenfalk's earlier conclusions in "Before the Book of Durrow," Acta Archeologica, 1947, pp. 141 ff.; and especially Bober, op. cit., pp. 41 ff.) I hope to discuss this problem more fully at another time but this is as good a place as any to state simply that not enough evidence has been presented from which to categorically assert the dependence of Hiberno-Saxon interlace upon that possibly employed in an early Diatessaron manuscript. Not only does an examination of the interlace patterns suggest this but also the iconographic relation between the inter- laced cross and the Evangelist symbols on folio 2r, for if, as we hope to demonstrate, a model combining cross and symbols was imported to the seventh century Insular scriptorium responsible for the crea- tion of the Book of Durrow it could not have come by way of a Diatessaron manuscript since no such illustration appears in the Florence recension. 37.

It pictures an animal-headed St. George mounted and killing a monster in the form of a crocodile. More important is the dog-headed image of St. Christopher, one of the fourteen auxiliary saints. As Z. Ameisenowa, "Animal Headed Gods, Evangelists, Saints and Righteous Men," Journal of the Warburg and Courtauld Institutes, 1949, pp. 42-5, indicates, St. Christopher was a purely literary creation. In the Gnostic "Acts of</page><page sequence="15">Saint Bartholomew," a text from fourth-century Egypt, he is cited as Christianus and described with a dog's head. A sixth century icon of the Saint shown in this manner created during the reign of Jus- tinian is,said to have existed at the Monastery of St. Catherine at Mt. Sinai. See P. Saintyves, St. Christophe successeur d'Anubis et de H6racles, Paris, 1936. Significantly, St. Christopher seems to have inspired a cult in early Christian Ireland. In the Calender Martyr- ology of Oengus (A. D. 797-808) he is mentioned and in later medieval glosses he is cited as having the head of a dog. See H. Gaidoz, "Saint Christophe a tete de chien en Irelande et en Russie," Memoires de la Soci6tl des Antiquaires de France, 1922, pp. I92-218. These indications that in Egypt zoomorphic elements-the animal heads common in pharaonic mythology and art-continue to be used for such Christian figures as Sts. George and Christopher suggest the possibility that the zooanthropomorphic Evangelist symbols them- selves may have been inspired by ancient Egyptian mythological groups. Some years ago L. B. Ellis, "The Animal Symbols of the Evangelists," Ancient Egypt, London-New York, I930, pp. o09-118, concluded that the animal-headed symbols were directly inspired by representations of the four children of Horus, the four gods always present at the Judgement before Osiris. Recently J. Doresse, op. cit., pp. 44 ff., has presented a similar hypothesis. He singles out the so-called Canopic vases which contained the intestines of the de- ceased; these were topped with the heads of the gods in question- man for Imsety, hawk for Qebhsnuf, jackal for Duamutef and a dog- headed ape for Hapi. The last two, he feels, easily suggest the ox and lion symbolizing Sts. Luke and Mark. 43. J.

Never- theless, two of the animal-headed symbols are clearly visible in Fig. 15. I intend to publish a complete view of the painting in the near future.) For dating of the fresco see J.

If Grabar is correct in his attribution of the Throne of St. Mark in Venice to a sixth-seventh century Coptic workshop, it would seem an inconographic arrangement related to that of the Faras crosses was employed in Egypt at an early date; in- side the Throne's back is the Lamb, the four rivers of Paradise and the Tree of Life. On each side of the circular disk at the top are two Evangelists; their symbols appear on the sides and back of the Throne. An aspect of the reliquary's complex Paradise-Evangelist iconography is the juxtaposition of Agnus Dei and Evangelist sym- bols, a combination similar to the Christ and symbols of the Faras crosses and the Lamb and symbols of the Laon Orosius and Wirks- worth cross compositions. 52.

In the frescoes of Bawit and Saqqara (see note 41) the Ezekielian tetramorph has become four separate creatures-the six winged creatures of the Apocalpyse of St. John. The four Beasts are appar- ently also to be understood as symbols of the Evangelists. As men- tioned above, creatures in the seventh-century Latmos fresco carry books (Ihm, Apsismalerei, pp. o02 ff.; 190 if.; T. Wiegand, O. Wulff, Der Latmos, Berlin, I913, pp. 191 ff., pl. I); in the eleventh-twelfth century apse fresco of the church of Deir-el-Abiad (White Monastery) near Sohag, Christ appears in Glory surrounded by the four creatures, while at the sides are medallions containing portraits of the seated Evangelists themselves (U. Monneret de Villard, Les Couvents pres de Sohag, II, Milan, 1926, pp. I32 ff., fig. 20I). Recently Leroy, Les manuscrits syriaques a peintures conserves dans les bibliotheques d'Europe et d'Orient, Paris, 1964, p. 219, pl. 50, has cited an early eleventh century Syriac Bible (from the Church of Mar Tuma) with an illustration of the Vision of Ezekiel (fol. 8). Again the symbols carry books. 53. Nordenfalk, op. cit., p. I33f., n. 8I, mentions the fact that the order of Jerome was not employed for the Evangelist symbols until the end of the eleventh century in Greek art and then only under Western influence. A few Greek manuscripts employ the order of Ireneus for the symbols and, as Nordenfalk suggests, this system may have been used for the symbols on the Throne of St. Mark. 54. Significantly, this Oriental order is employed for the Evan- gelist symbols in the Majestas Domini (fol. 796v) in the Codex Amia- tinus, a product of the Wearmouth-Jarrow scriptorium. For a discussion of the manuscript's East Mediterranean affiliations see Werner, 'Majestas Domini', pp. 22 if. and passim. The Oriental order is also used for the symbols in several Carolingian Apocalypse Majesty illustrations (ibid). 55. W. R.
