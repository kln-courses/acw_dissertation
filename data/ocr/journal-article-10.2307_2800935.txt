Rs 15 The first of these volumes is a detailed tour de horizon of India for the period announced in the title with frequent background excur- sions to western Asia and on occasion, even to western Europe. Passing through a review of the several physico-chemical aids now available to archaeology, Agrawal sets himself the task of applying several of these to a broad range of Indian problems. In this, he draws upon not only the work of other scholars, but his own important researches (principally in radiocarbon dating) as well. Many of the conclusions thus reached challenge currently held opinions and some bold new hypotheses are bound to stimulate discussion. The Harappan civilisation, for example, is seen to ' explode onto the scene', while the idea of an extended empire is rejected, mainly on chrono- logical grounds which deny the contempor- aneity of the urban centres. Unexpectedly, the theory that the Indo-Aryans did after all participate in some part in the decline of this grand civilisation is revived, but in novel form. The relevant date is put at 2000 B.C.E. and the Indo-Aryans are identified with the modest Banas Culture of central India, and thought perhaps to have come originally by sea. Some noteworthy ideas are also developed concerning the Copper Hoards. In a pioneer- ing departure into the area of experimental archaeology, the author suggests that the familiar anthropomorphic copper figures might have been useful in cutting down birds in flight, while the antennae swords, wedged point upwards in wooden logs, may have been placed in pits excavated to entrap large game. For the hunting component thus recog- nised, a Munda association is proposed. Beyond such substantive concerns, it is clear that the author has another message. It is an appeal for the extended use of the new techniques, coupled with a mild reproach to those colleagues who have hesitated to enter the unfamiliar waters of the natural sciences. Agrawal sees archaeology one day helping to span the gap between the Two Cultures.Well, why not? Throughout, the word ' ecology' is used as if it were merely another, more modern way of saying 'environment'. This will lead to further misunderstandings, but here too is a concept and a new tool which will assume a major role in archaeological inter- pretation in India. Never one to be caught standing at the water's edge, H. D. Sankalia's little booklet is an appropriately titled random review. The first two words of the title are the operative ones. A possible way of dealing with diffi- culties is to ignore them. So, the detailed criticisms of the Lothal 'port' theory (Am. Anthrop. 70, 5, 1968) are here passed over in silence in favour of maintaining the original speculative view. Fischer and Shah's descriptive account of the manufacturing process of wooden images erected in parts of Gujerat State deliberately eschews analysis and interpretation.
