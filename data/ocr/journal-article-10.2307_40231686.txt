GORDON, The Structure of Emotions: Investigations in Cognitive Philosophy. New York: Cambridge University Press 1987. Pp. 161. Robert Gordon's investigation into emotions is impressive, creative, and rigorously argued; the breadth and detail of his thought is astonish- ing. In terms of a causal framework that is to remain true to our folk psychology, Gordon defends a place for the emotions in the explana- tion of human and animal behavior, offers analytic-causal structures which group the emotions into distinct families, explores the conse- quences of these structures for an understanding of the emotions gener- ally, and illustrates this with illuminating studies of particular emotions. As well, Gordon examines the passivity of emotion, argues that cer- tain often accepted consequences of its passivity do not follow, then articulates the contrast between emotion's passivity and action. Final- ly, he considers the implications of the work of James, and Schachter and Singer, explores the normality of knowledge in folk psychology, and offers a simulation model for understanding our knowledge of what we are about to do, would do, and the beliefs of others. What will dampen the enthusiasm that many might otherwise have had for this work is that parts of the f oundational chapters are so dense- ly written that they fail to locate adequately the discussion in terms of contemporary debates about the emotions, or to illustrate and expand upon points or their consequence. This can leave the reader struggling to see the exact point, its significance and how to fit the argument into its larger context. Struggle on: the quality of thought well rewards the effort. This work shall surely be an important departure point for fu- ture explorations into emotions by philosophers and psychologists alike. I Method and Scope Gordon so ably and subtly works out the implications of his proce- dures that whether one should accept his conclusions in large measure</page><page sequence="2">116 Stephen R. Leighton rests on whether his method of investigation is adequate. Matters of method, therefore, deserve a great deal of our attention. Gordon's way of setting out his framework employs linguistic struc- tures to get at the ontology of emotion. He is particularly concerned with propositional attitude formulations in which an "emotion" term is followed by a propositional attitude, e.g. 'fear that,' l\ope that.' While there is nothing misguided in this as a part of one's investigation, Gor- don's commitment to propositional attitude formulations as founda- tional to an understanding of the emotions, and his largely uncritical acceptance that the uses of such formulations help to divulge the struc- ture of emotion, yields a skewed view of the emotions, one whose con- clusions concern more and less than the intended scope. The language of "emotion" gets used in many ways. With it we can speak of our occurrent emotion, our disposition to emotion, and even matters that do not bear on our emotions. When we utter 'pride,' for example, we can speak of our emotional life, as well a particular charac- ter or personality trait. Quite often, the language of "emotion" gets used as a form of politeness. One receives a form letter in which the sender 'regrets' to inform you; the shoe sales person "fears" that they are out of that shoe. Here, though the language of "emotion" has been used, it is not used in connection with the emotional life of the utterer. Little about the emotions is to be gleaned from this. Some uses are grammatically marked: the difference between emo- tional uses of 'pride' versus uses connected with pride the character trait seem to be ('proud of X' versus 'proud X'). Many are not -as the above forms of politeness illustrate. That many are not, when taken in conjunc- tion with Gordon's rather catholic acceptance of propositional attitudes preceded by "emotion" language and his failure to exploit familiar dis- tinctions (such as that between occurrent and dispositional emotion) means that we can't be hopeful that the implications Gordon assembles have much to do with central features of emotion. The problem is not that his charting of the implications of the language is not subtle, but that many of the uses of these structures has not to do with his topic, the emotions. In using the linguistic structures to set the boundaries of his investigation, they are too widely set. Prominent features of a terri- tory much broader than emotions come to be offered as the prominent features of the emotions. Hence a skewed view of the emotions. What is needed is more critical reflection on which and when uses help to reveal something about the emotions. So doing would bring to the forefront questions about the importance and role of feelings, behavior... to emotions. But by adopting the strategies he does, Gor- don removes these concerns from the lime-light and features the im- plications of certain linguistic structures, implications which are not primarily about emotions.</page><page sequence="3">Critical Notice of Robert M. Gordon The Structure of Emotions 117 Paradoxically, Gordon's focus on propositional structures also over- ly narrows his focus. Typically, the language of emotion is followed by a grammatical complement of some sort. Although one can say Toby is upset/ so saying is incomplete in comparison to Toby is upset about the exam/ Again, 'Frank is afraid of the dog' is complete in a way that 'Frank is afraid' is not. The complements to the emotion terms form a grammatically heterogeneous lot, and it is controversial whether there is some underlying relation(s) to be uncovered. Gordon attempts a propositional (re)casting of all formulations. Most significantly, where "emotion" expressions are followed by language that refers to an ob- ject, event, state, etc., Gordon recasts this propositionally. Hence 'afraid of the dog' becomes 'afraid that the dog will bite one/ or some such thing. Gordon even generates a computer program (EMOTIONS) that when "asking" people about their fears manoeuvers them to recast responses of the form 'fear X' to 'fear that p.' So proceeding has several advantages: it creates more homogeneity in the account; it facilitates his rejection of an object/cause distinction; most importantly, it articulates emotions in a form that makes them particularly amenable to cognitive analysis and reduction. Yet it is far from clear that so recasting is philosophically neutral. As Gordon himself notes, this recasting isn't possible with liate' and love.' Gordon, therefore, excludes love and hate from his study of emo- tions. But surely an account of the emotion, whose methodological commitments at the outset debar love and hate as data to be consid- ered suggests not a restriction in scope but that the methodological commitments are themselves too restrictive. Love and hate are such important emotions that they cannot be set aside, ignored, nor assumed eccentric because they do not fit an adopted methodology. While the exclusion of love and hate by the propositional methodol- ogy may be taken to suggest an overly restrictive method of investiga- tion, arguably all that follows is the discovery of a fundamental contrast between love and hate and other emotions. To test this we must see whether the propositional recasting is innocuous for the emotions Gor- don wishes to consider, or whether they too remain in a certain sense recast resistant. What seems to lie behind the question is that on Gor- don's view emotions relate to the world under a particular description; they relate to particular features of things, states, etc.; and when not so described, they may be recast in such a fashion without harm to the phenomena. One alternative is that our emotions, at times, relate not specifically to features of the objects they concern, but simply to the object in question. The latter view denies the adequacy of the propositional recasting in certain cases. Let us return to love and hate to investigate the way these emotions relate to their object. This should help to suggest what might be being</page><page sequence="4">118 Stephen R. Leivhton missed in adopting the procedures of recasting. Consider love. When we love someone it is that person that is the object of our love. We may be quite prepared to talk about the various features of the beloved, their wonderful manner, their humanity, etc. While it can be the case that what we love about them are those features, it need not be so; while it can be the case that we love the person insofar as they pos- sess, promise to possess, or once did possess those features, it need not be so. We can find ourselves in love with them without any of these endearing features. ('I can think of nothing good to say about the per- son, but they have such a hold on me/) In such cases the love that we bear for the person need not be encompassed by or located (sim- ply) in terms of these features. Rather than keying on a certain feature of a person, love often seems to be a brute relation (perhaps an irre- ducible one) obtaining between the lover and beloved, capable of ex- isting independently of various features which may serve to enhance the emotion. Any further articulation of the features of the beloved may be quite true but need not serve to adequately comprehend or delimit the emotion. Love is misunderstood if it is seen simply in terms of these features. Gordon may have no difficulty with this. He can hold that these ob- servations (if correct) help to articulate the contrast between love and hate and the rest of the emotions. Yet I wish to suggest that these fea- tures are often present in other emotions. If so, Gordon's methodolo- gy will wrongly have excluded love and hate, understood in a propositional fashion what is not (sometimes) properly understood in that way, and left unexplored, indeed excluded, important features from the account of the emotions. Consider fear. If I fear subways, it may be that I fear that I shall be injured or robbed in a subway. Indeed either or both of these may be the whole scope of my fear. In such cases recasting T fear subways' as 'I fear that I shall be robbed' accurately portrays the emotion. But it need not be this straightforward. While my fear may be fueled by particular concerns, the abhorrence I feel may be directed at subways, regardless of these particular concerns. One's fears may but need not diminish with the resolution of these concerns. Again, one often doesn't know what it is about something one fears, just that one fears the thing. Of course, this may be simple ignorance and open to dis- covery, but it may also be the case that there is nothing further to be discovered: one fears subways. Like love, the fear may obtain indepen- dently of these or other features of the subway. The emotional reac- tions of children often seem directed at the object rather than certain features of it. Discussion of their fears is particularly interesting. For one moves them (as does Gordon's EMOTIONS) to discuss particular features of the thing feared. It is often presumed that this is a matter</page><page sequence="5">Critical Notice of Robert M. Gordon The Structure of Emotions 119 of clarifying or uncovering the real concern of the fear, the real fear. It can be that. But much of this talk seems not uncovering at all, but a refinement on the part of the child in light of conditions of appropri- ateness such that what they come to is not simply an articulation of the fear, but its realignment. When this is so, dealing with fears by questioning is not a discovery of the fear, but a leading of the child to refine and define the fear such that it becomes both appropriate and manageable. Similarly, our emotional reactions often begin con- fused and diffuse, then are sharpened. I suggest that while this shar- pening can be the discovery of the concern of the emotion, it can be the creation and refinement of the concern in terms of conditions of appropriateness. If this is right, the move to rewrite the fears propositionally while facilitating cognitive reduction does so at the cost of certain of the phenomena. Hence Gordon's methodology necessarily bypasses in- triguing aspects of our emotional life. One way to explain cases that are resistent to propositional diagno- sis is to urge that such reactions are irrational. Even if they are, they remain very characteristic of our emotional life. Any method of examin- ing the emotions that fails to take this into its account remains an im- poverished understanding of our emotional life. Alternatively, a distinction Gordon draws between fear and the state of fear (a flight-fight syndrome involving physiological stimulation etc.) might be employed against these objections. The fear a mouse might have is an example of the latter. States of fear are thought to charac- terize the emotional life of mammals. They are much less sophisticat- ed than the fear spoken of when we say that we fear that we shall be robbed. For while we are willing to think of the mouse as fearing the cat, it looks overly anthropomorphic to say that it fears that. ... By speak- ing of the state of fear, then, Gordon makes room for certain cases of fearing X that do not require a rewriting in terms of fearing that p. Hence Gordon might urge that the objections to the propositional re- writing disappear if we distinguish fear from the state of fear, allow- ing that we humans can be subject to both. It is the state of fear, not fear, that resists propositional rewriting. Yet problems remain. At the least, Gordon's account of emotion fam- ilies and particular emotions is going to have to bring the state versus emotion contrast to the forefront and observe their interplay, rather than offering the explanation primarily in terms of the propositional structure. More problematically, Gordon will require a general con- trast between emotion and the state of emotion. Yet extending this con- trast to, say, a state of shame versus shame, a state of grief versus grief, seems improbable, and becomes more so since the state and the emo- tion seem to have little relation to one another. Further, separating the</page><page sequence="6">120 Stephen R. Leighton emotion X from the state of X makes the account unnecessarily baroque. Far better to give an account that does not require this duality for each emotion. What is surely striking about Gordon's propositional methodology is that it is so bound up with certain human manifestations of emo- tion that non-human, mammalian emotions are excluded from the out- set as part of the data to be accounted for, relegated to a relatively uninteresting special case of the state of fear, which is then tacked on to the general account. This has two disadvantages. First, in the case of fear, what reason do we have to suppose a radical break between normal attribution of fear and the state of fear, with setting aside the latter as not part of the phenomena of emotion? There seems little war- rant to think that the state of fear is simply concurrent with fear, rath- er than a proper part of fear. Gordon's procedures have required him to separate them as distinct phenomena, whereas to most appearances they are part of the same phenomena. By divorcing the two the ac- count is no longer recognisably an account of emotion. Second, the duality involves a discontinuity that seems evolutionarily implausible. In contrast, an account of fear in which the propositional structuring of emotion evolves as a potential part (for certain creatures with cer- tain evolved abilities) of a more basic emotional reaction is much more satisfying. We have one phenomena to deal with, though recognising variation in its structure which parallels evolution in cognitive capa- bility. Accounts would be in terms of the more basic reaction, and the propositional structure as an elaboration upon (but not replacement for) that. We would then understand how fear can be a basic relation- ship to things, why it can become more than that, and why this more evolved form is more prevalent in the emotional lives of adults than children. Again, we have a much better idea of how love and hate are to be incorporated into a general account of the emotions. Thus Gordon's distinction doesn't help him. Rather, it helps to show that his concentration on propositional attitudes is misplaced. By ex- amining emotion in terms of the 'emotion that' structure, Gordon has overly narrowed his vision; by uncritically accepting 'emotion language' as getting at the emotions he has overly broadened his vision. His con- clusions must leave important matters untouched, and give undue sig- nificance to other matters. II The Nature of Emotion Gordon is interested in the logical preconditions and entailments of emotion, but particularly in this as the causal structure of emotion, a structure that links together particular beliefs, knowledge, pro-</page><page sequence="7">Critical Notice of Robert M. Gordon The Structure of Emotions 121 attitudes, wishes, an underlying state, an impulse to behave, an auto- nomic state, feelings, behavior, etc. Families of emotions, emotion types are differentiated by the type and particular causal sequences implicated. That a causal story of some sort needs to be told seems plausible enough. Moreover, Gordon's thoughts about which are relevant causes and effects for certain sorts of emotions and particular emotions are often persuasive. Seeing the causal stories as a replacement for an ob- ject/cause distinction is more controversial. I shall not comment on that move here beyond noting that if my earlier claims about the error of the propositional recasting are correct, then the rejection of the object- cause distinction becomes much less plausible. Rather, I take up the account given of one family of emotions, taking anger as a representa- tive of that family and offering a somewhat simplified picture of its causal complexity. The account Gordon comes to is that anger is an underlying state caused by particular cognitive-desire components (beliefs and know- ledge that p, and wishes that not p) and itself issuing in autonomic arousal, an impulse for retribution, further cognition, feelings, and be- havior. Anger requires its particular causal ancestry, must issue in the action tendency (which, in turn, may issue in action), and typically issues in autonomic arousal, feelings, etc. An underlying state will not be one of anger even if identical in all respects to one of anger but produced by a different causal ancestry or not resulting in the action tendency. Nonetheless, the cognitive-desire causal ancestry, is strict- ly not a component of anger, but necessary to anger. Similarly -though not unambiguously (cf. 57-8, 105-6) -the resultant action tendency is necessary to but not a component of anger. I suggest that this focus on an underlying state to the exclusion of the necessary causal com- ponents is misguided. A preferable approach, especially for one in- terested in offering a theory within the general framework of our folk-psychology, is one in which the necessary causes and effects are viewed as are components of emotion. The claim that the emotion anger is the underlying state has at least two sorts of problems. First, what evidence is there that there is an underlying state? The state is left undescribed by Gordon; and no em- pirical evidence is offered for its existence. Yet it seems not to be a necessary hypothesis. For the causal story (above) seems as plausibly told without the supposition of an intervening underlying state. Sec- ond, its lack of positive characterization means that there is as little reason to suppose that the state has the features emotion has as there is to suppose its existence. When one recalls that Gordon is commit- ted to offering a theory that sits well with normal intuitions about the nature of emotion, the claim that emotion is this undescribed and</page><page sequence="8">122 Stephen R. Leighton underlying state becomes worrying. For example, we think of our emo- tions as being reasonable or unreasonable, justified, etc., but if the cognitive-desire components are excluded from being components of emotion, then the claim that emotion is reasonable, unreasonable, justi- fied, etc. is quite wrong: it is the cognitive cause of the emotion, not the emotion itself, that deserves these attributions. Again, according to many, anger involves a desire to retaliate. But if one follows Gor- don's suggestions, it is anger's necessary effect, not anger that involves this desire. Further, we think that emotional reactions can be strong or mild. Sometimes this is to be explained in terms of the feelings of the emotion; sometimes it is to be explained by the desire or behavior involved in the emotion. Since Gordon excludes these as components of the emotion, he excludes this intensity from emotion, and must ana- lyze it as being relevant to emotion in terms of the causal antecedents or consequences. Quite generally, since the underlying state is color- less, so becomes emotion. Many of the attributions we make to emo- tion are lost, to be reformulated in terms of emotion's cause or effect. This presents a very unintuitive view of the nature of emotions, and (without very good reason) a most implausible picture of emotions. But the reasons are absent. If one is inclined towards the causal story that Gordon offers, the plau- sible account of emotion will have to incorporate more features of the causal network as components of emotion. How much of that network is to be incorporated will involve a good deal of sifting. At the very least, the cognitive cause needs to be incorporated; I suspect that the under- lying state can be readily jettisoned from any part of the account. Ill Factive versus Epistemic, Positive versus Negative Gordon's thought is at its keenest when setting forth a logical structure of emotions in general and of particular emotions. Two outstanding dis- tinctions he offers are factive versus epistemic, positive versus negative. Emotions, Gordon observes, tend to be classed into two sorts, differ- ing from each other in terms of temporal direction. Forward looking emotions (e.g. fear, hope) concern something future; backward look- ing emotions (e.g. regret, amazement) concern something present or past. But Gordon argues that this will not do. For while it may be that certain emotions typically look forward or backward, they do not do so necessarily. For example, not only can one hope that the train will arrive, but also that it already did. Again, not only can one regret what has occurred, but also what will follow. Rather than a difference in temporal gaze, Gordon proposes that the emotions differ epistemologically. "Backward looking" (factive)</page><page sequence="9">Critical Notice of Robert M. Gordon The Structure of Emotions 123 emotions are emotions whose epistemic position is that of knowledge, whereas "forward looking" emotions are (epistemic) emotions whose epistemic position involves a lack of knowledge, uncertainty. Hoping that p (be it something past or future) requires a lack of knowledge as to whether p; regretting that p (be it something past or future) re- quires knowledge that p. Because the epistemic situation of the two sorts of emotions are importantly different, the sorts of reasons in- volved likewise differ. Whereas epistemic emotions (e.g. hope) have as causes (attitudinal) reasons which have to do with our wishes that p or not p (say, the value of the job applied for), they may also have as causes (epistemic) reasons which have to do with the certainty of the that p. In contrast, while factive emotions (e.g. regret) may have as causes attitudinal reasons (the value of the job lost), since there is no question of the matter obtaining (here the job loss), epistemic rea- sons may not be offered. Gordon's shift from a temporal to an epistemic framework has far- reaching consequences to the analysis of emotion. His ability to pur- sue the consequences of the distinction and to locate a large number of emotions with which we are familiar in those terms, attests to the value of what he is up to. And one suspects this is but the tip of the iceberg. What is troubling here is Gordon's claim that the facticity of emotions concerns not what emoters take themselves to know, but what they do know. I am factive that p only if p. I am not factive that p if I merely take it that I know that p. If not p or if I do not know that p, then I am not factive that p. Rather I am mistaken about my emotional state. For example, I am angry that she has gone only if she has gone, and that is a matter of knowledge on my part. If she has not gone or I don't know it, then I am not angry that she has gone. But what, then, am I? Gordon suggests that what we say here is that I was angry because I (mistakenly) believed that she was gone. This seems fair enough. It seems to allow that I was angry, and notes an error in my cognitive structure. But if factive emotions are as Gordon suggests, there should be some state of affairs causally linked in such a way that one is angry about them, and this is a matter of knowl- edge. But that is what we have just denied in the case of being angry because I mistakenly believed that p. One could handle this problem by denying that I was angry in any sense, but this is not a move Gordon makes, and would seem to be a most desperate and unintuitive solution, one that simply ignores an im- portant feature of anger. Alternatively, one could handle the case by introducing an object-cause distinction, citing the mistaken belief as the cause, suggesting the object is not the supposed fact that she has left but "her leaving," where that is given some special intentional status. Of course, the status of the intentional object remains an ontoloeical</page><page sequence="10">124 Stephen R. Leighton mystery, and an object-cause distinction is something Gordon wishes to reject. Yet the cost of doing so, given the knowledge condition built into factive emotions, seems to be that one has no further analysis of the emotional state of one who is angry because they (wrongly) be- lieve that p, except (unhelpfully) to reiterate that one is angry because one took it that p. Moreover, if this is some form of anger, as it seems to be, and if it is left as it is, then it seems to break out of Gordon's own knowledge condition and propositional rewriting of said emotions. These may not be bad things, but they are not something that Gordon can be very happy with. The matter is further complicated because Gordon allows that first person perspectives, novels and psychiatric cases attribute the emo- tion in terms of a "notional world" where the attribution is in terms of how the world is perceived. Here we legitimately claim that one is factive that p even if not p. This admission is necessary if one is to remain loyal to common sense views. Yet the implicit claim that such cases are parasitic on the standard knowledge requirement is open to question, especially since that claim has trouble with cases in which we are mistaken. Rather, what these cases and the above puzzles seem to suggest is that the implications of factive versus epistemic emotions are not knowledge versus uncertainty but something weaker than knowledge versus uncertainty. Knowledge has do with the appropri- ateness, not the presence, of factive emotions. In seeking a positive-negative emotion contrast, Gordon offers nega- tive and positive emotions lists which (are said to) satisfy our intui- tions about which emotions are positive and negative, and then seeks the foundation for that distinction. Gordon's positive emotions include delight, pride, gratitude; his negative emotions include sorrow, indig- nation, annoyance. He rejects accounts of the distinction in terms of pleasantness or attractiveness versus unpleasantness or aversiveness, and concludes that the distinction has to do with negative and posi- tive attitudes toward something that is or is believed to be the case (for factive emotions) or might be the case (for epistemic emotions). Pride is a positive emotion because we have a postive attitude towards the relevant that p; indignation is a negative emotion because we have a negative attitude towards the relevant that p. While Gordon's own proposals provide a plausible explanation of his lists, the thought that by so doing he has replaced other attempts, revealed the positive-negative contrast or its foundation is unwarrant- ed. There seems little general, deep-seated agreement about which emotions are positive and which are negative, even within our own cultural heritage. For example, Gordon's listing is very different from one I would draw in which very few emotions would be deemed nega- tive, perhaps Nietzsche's resentment or Aristotle's envy. I take most</page><page sequence="11">Critical Notice of Robert M. Gordon The Structure of Emotions 125 other emotions to be positive, and do so because they facilitate the per- son in grappling with their world. The situations of sorrow or anger may be negative but the emotions themselves seem quite positive responses to those situations. Again, while Gordon and Hume take pride to be a valuable emotion, it is taken to be a sin by many within the Christian tradition. Further, some of a deeply puritanical bent would have it that taking pleasure or being joyous are negative emo- tions; still others hold that all emotions are negative because they en- cumber reasoning. Our views of our emotions are so bound up with and driven by our values that there seems no common or grounding intuition about which emotions are positive and negative. As a result, there is no brute phenomena of positive and negative emotions to give an account of. Thus while Gordon's own listing and account of it is sensible enough, it is misguided to think of the other accounts, lists and sensible accounts of them as less appropriate. Any positive- negative contrast in emotions depends on our value schema; thus the positive-negative contrast (if there is some one such thing) depends on knowledge of the correct value system, a knowledge that we do not have and may not be possible. The competing accounts and lists are only less appropriate to Gordon's own purposes. IV Fear Gordon's portrayal of particular f active and epistemic emotions rein- force some version of his epistemic-f active contrast, as well as being of interest in their own right. I shall conclude by exploring further Gor- don's thoughts on fear, particularly the claim that fear requires non- deliberative uncertainty, and the structure of aversion is to be found in fear. Standardly, accounts of fear see it as a forward looking emotion, the thing feared as some future eventuality. Since Gordon has rejected the forward-backward contrast, he must reject the claim that fear must con- cern future events. His example of fearing that the robber has entered the home, in which there is no future event to be feared, serves to il- lustrate his point. Often, fear is thought of as motivating one to (try to) prevent one's fear coming true. For example, fearing that a robber will come motivates one to (try to) prevent the coming. Gordon right- ly notes that this type of analysis often and unnecessarily renders fear a fruitless, impotent state. For example, in fearing that it will rain, what point is there to wanting or wishing that it not? Again, in fearing that the robber has entered the house, what point is there to wanting or wishing that he or she not? A more productive analysis of fear, claims Gordon, is one in which instead of understanding fearing that p as</page><page sequence="12">126 Stephen R. Leivhton motivating one to bring it about that not p, understands it to motivate one to make it false that if p then q- where q is the related attitudinal reason. For example, fearing that it will rain is seen to involve the wish that it not be the case that if it rains then I get wet; fearing that the burglar has entered involves the wish that it not be the case that if the burglar has entered, I get my things stolen, etc. Success in action would mean that even if one's fears are realized, one has salvaged the impor- tant thing at stake. Gordon's analysis of these examples renders fear a more productive emotion, nicely links fear's desires to our attitudes, and seems a plau- sible reconstruction of certain of our fears. Thus his proposal is attrac- tive. But rather than giving both explanations their due, Gordon claims that fear always motivates us to (try to) bring it about that it is false that if p then q. Consider my (your) fear of death. What one would normally sup- pose is that those who share this fear want not to die and are motivat- ed stave off if not prevent death. Gordon recasts this propositionally (presumably, the fear that I shall die), then claims that the fear moti- vates one to make it false that if I die then.... But what is to fill in the . . .? It is supposed to be the attitudinal reason that explains why I don't want to die. But it seems very hard to see what attitudinal reason can be offered that plausibly explains my fear of death, in the way one can be offered for a fear that it shall rain. Death would seem to be one thing that is at the end of the line in terms of justification. We can give glosses that articulate what death is, but I don't know that we plausibly give an attitudinal reason for why we fear death. There isn't a real option to dying; it is far from clear that if the fear is realized there is some- thing to be salvaged which is the important thing at stake. Gordon seems to over generalize with respect to the place of an attitudinal rea- son in fear, and fear's motivational upshot. We should admit the sort of explanation he wishes to reject. But perhaps this is wrong. We might be able to come up with some attitudinal reasons. We might say that if I die, my work will stop, or I will no longer be able to be with my loved ones. While these seem to be fairly pale explanations of our fear of death, let that pass. On Gordon's analysis, I am motivated to make it false that if I die, I shall no longer be with my loved ones. But whereas there was a certain amount of sense to wish to make it false that if it rains I get wet and bringing umbrellas to solve the matter, we seem to have no such pos- sibilities here. My motivation to make it false that if I die I will no longer be with my loved ones becomes a most implausible gloss on my wish- es regarding death and my loved ones. In contrast, the more simple wish that I not die is both comprehensible and fits rather well with what manv of us think we want-though it is equallv futile. Perhaps,</page><page sequence="13">Critical Notice of Robert M. Gordon The Structure of Emotions 127 for some of us, our concern for death is the want to ensure that it is false that if we die certain things follow, but many of us simply want not to die. And this means that the role for motivation in fear is more multifarious than Gordon allows. According to Gordon, fear also requires a non-deliberative uncer- tainty; that is, there must be an uncertainty involved in my fear, an uncertainty that cannot be resolved by further or fuller deliberations. For example, the captain who fears that he will drown if he doesn't abandon ship must have some doubt, some uncertainty as to whether the ship will sink. Such a move is natural: as an epistemic emotion fear involves uncertainty about the relevant state of affairs. But need all fears be like this? Again, consider our fear of death, which has as its reformulation my (your) fear that I (you) shall die. In certain cases the place for uncer- tainty is well founded. Careening down the mountainside with a ques- tionable set of brakes, I fear that I shall die. Here there is a good deal of uncertainty about whether I can negotiate the car successfully and said uncertainty certainly fuels my emotion. But as persons who from time to time reflect upon what it all means, we find that the prospect of our death looms before us. Here there need be no uncertainty. There may be; we may fool ourselves for a while, but the prospect of death comes back to haunt us in its certainty and inevitability. It is this ines- capability that makes it loom so awfully. Of course, there may always be uncertainty about when I shall die. But the fear that I am presently writing about is not like the mountainside example: it is not a concern for when or whether, but that, and of that, sadly, there is no doubt or uncertainty. Fear, then, proves to be a particularly interesting emotion. For while it may be epistemic and involve uncertainty, it may also be f active and involve certainty. Interestingly enough, that fear can be factive becomes more obvious when fears are formulated non-propositionally, e.g. fear of death, of the explosion. Received: October, 1988 STEPHEN R.
