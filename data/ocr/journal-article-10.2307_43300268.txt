<plain_text><page sequence="1">Ģākinī : Some Comments on its Nature and Meaning By Janice D. Willis In the literature and tantrio practice contexts of Tibetan Buddhism, the term dâkinî (Skt. ; Tib., mkhď 'grò ma) is fairly ubiquitous. Indeed, it occurs so often these days in western translations of tantric texts, that one expects it will soon be appearing in The American Heritage Dictionary along with such other recently incorporated common places as satori, zen, and mandala . Still, ap'art from the quite literal definition of the term - i.e., as a feminine noun meaning "one who goes in the sky" - there remains little consensus about its meaning and, in my opinion, little precision in the various attempts to further delineate and characterize its nature and function. Without doubt, dākinī represents one of the most important, potent, and dynamic images/ideas/symbols within all of Tantra. Yet, precisely owing to such dynamism and power, and to the all-encompassing nature of this symbol, it is almost impossible to pin it down or to limit it to a single definition. To do so is not the intention of the present essay. Instead, what I want to do briefly here is : firstly, to survey and review some of the diverse assessments of its meaning offered by scholars previously; and secondly, to suggest perhaps some new ways of thinking about it in a more holistic way. Dakirii-s are said to be beings that are "tricky and playful.1" The term is thus sometimes glossed by translations like "sky-dancer"2 or "sky-enjoyer."3 They are often described as "wrathful or semi-wrathful deities,"4 though it is also recognized that they may have human (or other, animate or inanimate) form as well. In some contexts they are termed "demoniacal beings" and "witches."5 One scholar seemed to like to call them "furies;"6 others have referred to them as "sprites" and "fairies."7 They have been called the "genii of meditation."8 For tantric adepts, they are viewed as "messengers" or "prophetesses," "protectresses," and "inspirers." Additionally, they are at times regarded as rig ma-s , or "mystic consorts." And most inclusive of all, within Buddhist tantric contexts, dākinī is viewed as the supreme embodiment of the highest wisdom itself. Embracing such wisdom, one becomes Buddha. I believe it is this latter sense of dākinī, that is, as the embodiment of the highest wisdom and as the symbolic concretization of the direct, unmediated, and non-conceptual experience of voidness (Skt., šū Hyatã; Tib., ston pa ñid), that makes the term so difficult to discuss. For in the ultimate, absolute, and final sense, "she" stands for ineffable reality itself. In a tantric universe replete with symbols, dākinī, one may say, is the symbol par excellence; and being preeminently, constitutively, and inherently symbolic, the dākinī always</page><page sequence="2">SOME COMMENTS ON ITS NATURE AND MEANING 57 remains a symbol within the "Tibetan symbolic world."9 As such, "she" serves always only to represent and suggest - even for the tantric adept - other and deeper, non-discursive experiential meanings. Inevitably, then, "she" remains elusive to academic or intellectual analyses. All this notwithstanding, a number of scholars (western, Indian, and Tibetan) have offered various definitions, as well as symbolic and psycho- logical interpretations, of the term. (One extremely thoughtful analysis, by Nathan Katz, appeared in this very Journal some ten years ago.10). By way of review, I now turn to some of these. I. Definitions and Etymologies: In 1895, L. Austine Waddell's classic study of Tibetan Buddhism called dākinī-s "furies," further defined them as being synonymous with yoginî-s , and stated that both terms referred to "goddesses with magical powers."11 In his estimation, it was because such "goddesses and she-devils were the bestowers of natural and supernatural powers and were especially malignant [that] they were especially worshipped."12 S.C. Das's great Dictionary , which was finished shortly after that time, defined mkha ' 'grò ma as "a class, mainly of female sprites, akin to our witches, but not necessarily ugly or deformed."13 He went on to further delineate two types of such beings: "those still in the world and those that have passed out of the world" ; and to include a group called the "goddesses of wisdom" (ye ses kyi mkha ' 'grò ma) in the latter class/4 Some six decades later David Snellgrove would write, giving a much fuller description of dākinī, the following : "Especially associated with Uddiyâna is a class of feminine beings known as çlâkinî. There is frequent reference to them in the tantric texts, where they appear as the partners of the yogins, flocking around them when they visit the great places of pilgrimage. Their presence was essential to the performance of the psycho-sexual rites and their activities generally are so gruesome and obscene as to earn them quite properly the name witch. They enter Tibetan mythology in a rather more gentle aspect, and ceasing altogether to be beings of flesh and blood, they become the bestowers of mystic doctrines and bringers of divine offerings. They become the individual symbols of divine wisdom with which the meditator must mystically unite, and although icono- graphically they retain their fierce and gruesome forms, in such a context witch seems rather a harsh name for them. The Tibetans trans- lated the name as sky-goer (mkha'-'gro-ma), which Mr. Evans-Wentz regularly translates as fairy, but this scarcely does justice to their composite character."15</page><page sequence="3">58 THE TIBET JOURNAL Snellgrove's description is certainly fuller, incorporating many of the ideas mentioned here earlier, while indicating still others. A more recent study by Martin Kalff,16 informs us further about the dākinī' s pre-Buddhist origins, as well as "her" early iconographie representa- tions. Kalff writes: "The Dākinīs alluded to here [i.e., in the Cakrasamvara Tantra ], female aspects of the enlightened Buddha, have to be differentiated from a lower type of Dākinī, a class of harmful female demons who feed on human meat. The relationship between the two types of Dākinī is suggested by the fact that the lower unenlightened type represents a remnant of a pre-Buddhist form which, with the ascendancy of Tantra, became integrated into Buddhism."17 Continuing his description of these "pre-Buddhist" demonic 4ākinī-s , Kalff notes: "An example of the demonic type of Dākin! can be found in the Lctnkãvatãra Sütra. In that text the one who eats meat is threatened with the following words: From the womb of Dākinī he will be born in the meat-eaters' family and then into the womb of a Râkçasï and a cat ; he belongs to the lowest class of men. Here the Dākinī is mentioned in the same breath with a RâkçasI, another type of meat-eating female demon who haunts the cemeteries. The Pākinīs, too, are at home in the cemeteries. They are very well described in a biography of Padmasambhava which includes his visit to eight cemeteries in eight different regions."18 Again, detailing his description of the "gruesome" inconographic depiction these dākinī, Kalff quotes from Eva Dargyay's dissertation on the Mātaraķ and Ma mo. Kalff's English translation of Dargyay's German reads as follows: "And there is the uncountable host of Dākinīs. Some of them with loose hair ride on lions, in their hands they raise up the skull and the nine-pointed emblem of victory. Some of them are mounted on birds and they scream. In their hands they hold the lion's emblem of victory. Some of them have one body and ten faces. They eat intestines and hearts."19 In such wise are the "pre-Buddhist" dākinī-s described. Within Buddhism, however, a change occurs; and the dãkinVs nature is softened and trans-</page><page sequence="4">SOME COMMENTS ON ITS NATURE AND MEANING 59 formed. One may recall here, for example, that Padmasambhava ' s "journey to Tibet" is narrated almost solely in terms of his "tamings" and "subjuga- tions" of various "demons" in route, the bulk of them female.20 Following each such "taming," that demonic spirit being pledges to aid and support the new religion, i.e., Buddhism. Thence, the dākinī is viewed as a helper and an ally to the Buddhist cause. Now, as descriptions of "Buddhist" dākinī-s, we hear definitions like the following: "Dākinīs, [or] female sky travelers, [are] the Tantric Goddesses who protect and serve the Tantric Doctrine. They are not invariably enlightened beings ; there are many so-called Worldly Dākinīs. . .who are still bound in Samsāra." What then, one may ask, of the term's precise etymology? The Sanskrit term may have derived from a root meaning "to fly"22; but as the term is normally defined in the Sanskrit (at least, as evidenced by most of the Purāņic literature), it refers to the "female attendants of Kālī" who are said moreover to "feed on human flesh."23 The Tibetan etymology certainly softens this portrayal of dākinī! In Tibetan, the equivalent for dākinī is composed of three syllables: mkha', meaning "sky" or "space" (Skt., ākāšd); 'grò, a verbal contraction meaning "to go;" and ma, a feminine particle marker. Hence, the compound term in Tibetan could justifiably be translated as "sky-goer" or "she who goes in the sky." Still, this does not fully explain the term. I now cite three interpretations by western scholars who attempt to offer further clarification of the Tibetan etymology. Herbert Guenther offers the following gloss: "The Tibetan explanation of the word for 'sky,' 'celestial space' is a term for 'no-thing-ness' ( stong-pa-nyid) (Skt., sünyatá) and 'to go' means 'to understand. ' The Dākinī is therefore an understanding of no-thing- ness."24 According to Anagarika Govinda, "mkha' means 'space' as well as 'ether', the fifth element 'in other words, that which makes movement possible . . . and makes form appear without being itself movement or appear- ance. . . Hgro ' means 'to go,' 'to move about'. According to popular con- ception a Khadoma is therefore a heavenly being of female appearance (as indicated by the suffix ma), who partakes of the luminous nature of space or ether, in which she moves."25 Again, James Robinson, in a description which is perhaps too anthropomorphic (?), comments: "The Tibetans render çlâkinî as mkha ' 'grò ma, 'the sky-walking woman'. But the idea of 'sky' was interpreted as standing for 'emptiness', and 'walking' is equivalent to 'under- standing', so that the dākinī is 'the woman who understands emptiness', that is to say, the feminine embodiment of wisdom."26 Symbolic and Psychological Interpretations Individual terms function in contexts; and it is within such contexts that they take on life and meaning. (One is reminded of Wittgenstein's famed maxim that "the meaning of a word is its use in the language.")27 Definitions and etymologies are useful only to a point. To begin to see what dākinī means,</page><page sequence="5">60 THE TIBET JOURNAL we need to see it in action, in context; that is to say, to see how it functions - as narrated in siddha biographies, as enacted in tantric ritual, and as depicted in tantric art. Firstly, it is necessary - even if only briefly - to investigate its function in actual texts , i.e., what one scholar has called the role the dākinī plays in the "spiritual imagery" of Tibetan tantric texts.28 As Katz rightly noted, among the chief sources for such an investigation are the biographies (Tib., mam thar) of the siddha-s (tantric adepts who are famed for having attained Enlightenment in their lifetimes by using tantric means). Such texts are replete with mentions of the çlâkinî ; and the stories they narrate are told and re-told throughout the Tibetan world of practice. Undoubtedly, one of the most famous stories is that which narrates the episode of Nāropa's encounter with the grand dame of all dākinī-s, the great Vajrayogini. As wonderfully trans- lated by Guenther,29 this story goes as follows: Once when 'Jigs-med grags-pa (Abhayakïrti [=Nāropa]), with his back to the sun, was studying the books on grammar, epistemology, spiritual precepts, and logic, a terrifying shadow fell on them. Looking around he saw behind him an old woman with thirty-seven ugly features: her eyes were red and deep-hollowed; her hair was fox- coloured and dishevelled; her forehead large and protruding; her face had many wrinkles and was shrivelled up; her ears were long and lumpy; her nose was twisted and inflamed; she had a yellow beard streaked with white; her mouth was distorted and gaping; her teeth were turned in and decayed; her tongue made chewing noises and licked her lips; she whistled when she yawned; she was weeping and tears ran down her cheeks; she was shivering and panting for breath; her complexion was darkish blue; her skin rough and thick; her body bent and askew; her neck curved; she was hump-backed; and, being lame, she supported herself on a stick. She said to Nāropa: "What are you looking into?" "I study the books on grammar, epistemology, spiritual precepts, and logic," he replied. "Do you understand them?" "Yes." "Do you understand the words or the sense?" "The words." The old woman was delighted, rocked with laughter, and began to dance waving her stick in the air. Thinking that she might feel still happier, Nāropa added: "I also understand the sense." But then the woman began to weep and tremble and she threw her stick down. "How is it that you were happy when I said that I understood the words, but became miserable when I added that I also understood the sense?" "I felt happy because you, a great scholar, did not lie and frankly</page><page sequence="6">SOME COMMENTS ON ITS NATURE AND MEANING 61 admitted that you only understood the words. But I felt sad when you told a lie by stating that you understood the sense, which you do not." "Who, then, understands the sense?" "My brother." "Introduce me to him wherever he may be." "Go yourself, pay your respects to him, and beg him that you may come to grasp the sense." With these words the old woman disappeared like a rainbow in the sky. [It has been my experience that whenever I have asked a Lama to explain to me the nature and meaning of dākinī , he has answered, firstly, by narrating this particular story!] Guenther, applying Karl Jasper's term, has called dākinī-s "ciphers of transcendence."30 In the "Introduction" to his translation of Náropa's mam thar he posits his own interpretation of the above passage : "The vision which induced Nāropa to resign from his post and to abandon worldly honours, was that of an old and ugly woman who mercilessly revealed to him his psychological state All that he had neglected and failed to develop was symbolically revealed to him as the vision of an old and ugly woman. She is old because all that the female symbol stands for, emotionally and passionately moving, is older than the cold rationality of the intellect which itself could not be if it were not supported by feelings and moods which it usually misconceives and misjudges. And she is ugly, because that which she stands for has not been allowed to become alive or only in an undeveloped and distorted manner. Lastly, she is a deity because all that is not incorpo- rated in the conscious mental makeup of the individual and appears other-than and more-than himself is, traditionally, spoken of as the divine. Thus he himself is the old, ugly, and divine woman, who in the religious symbolism of the Tantras is the deity rDo-rje phag-mo (Vajravārāhī) and who in a psychological setting acts as 'messenger' (pho-ña)."31 The siddha biographies give us numerous other examples of the "play" of the dākinī . Another example of the dākinī as shock-therapist is provided by the mam thar of Abhayâkaragupta. As translated by B.N. Datta, the pertinent passage reads as follows : "Once, as he was sitting in the court of [a] temple cloister, there appeared a young maiden who dragged on a piece of beef near to him which was dripping in blood, shoved it to the acarya and said : 'I am a Candāla (out-caste) maiden, but eat what is slaughtered for you.' But he answered: "I am a Bhiksu of purer order. How shall I eat meat</page><page sequence="7">62 THE TIBET JOURNAL which is extraordinarily offered to me?' But she sank back and dis- appeared in the court below. That was again VajrayoginI who gave him the Siddhi, but he did not take it."32 Like Nāropa (in later sections of his mam thar), Abhayâkaragupta here missed his chance to attain special power and insight even though the dākinī offered him the opportunity (read: "chance", "moment", or "space") in which to do so. The dākinī-s burst upon the scene (here, consciousness) at any moment, to test, to shock, to "stop the [habitual] world"33 of the future siddha . Thus they may be said to function as "tricksters." As "messengers" they are often also "triggers," "instigators," or "inspirers." Again, as Katz has noted, "the influence of the mkhď 'grò ma is virtually [a] universal [motif] in mam thar to mark the 'turning-point' stage."34 "Her" appearance catches the future siddha9 s attention, and creates a space in which old, habitual, patterns are either mildly called into question, or shattered completely. Indeed, it is because "she" ushers in insight which is totally new, and because the experience of insight seems to burst in upon the intellectually barren and stagnant mind, that the dākinī is described as "playful" and "capricious." Of course, "her" very abruptness also explains why "she" is also so often described as "horrific" and "terrifying." As "trickster," the dākinī tests the tantric adept in numerous ways, usually revealing his or her own mental rigidness and neurosis. Commenting upon this "trickster" quality of the tfākinī, Trungpa Rinpoche has said : "The playful maiden is all-present. She loves you. She hates you. Without her your life would be continual boredom. But she continually plays tricks on you. When you want to get rid of her she clings. To get rid of her is to get rid of your own body - she is that close. In Tantric literature she is referred to as the dākinī principle. The dākinī is playful. She gambles with your life."35 The dākinī is not always, however, a terrifying messenger. Sometimes in various mam thar we see "her" as trusted companion and prophetess. In the mam thar of rGyal-ba dbEn-sa-pa,36 for example, the following passage is found: "During that time [rGyal-ba dbEn-sa-pa] occupied himself performing penances and behaving in such a way as to have (the experience of) Bliss-Voidness arise (continuously) in his consciousness. Then by the Wisdom-Dâkinï he was advised thusly: 'Tomorrow you will meet a paņdita who is the reincarnation of the great siddha dPal-'bras-rdo-rje. To that one you should impart all the detailed practice instructions without holding back.' "</page><page sequence="8">SOME COMMENTS ON ITS NATURE AND MEANING 63 While the above example contains implicit reference to the dākinī principle in "her" iconographie form as the great Vajrayoginï, other mam thar refer to this principle in other forms, whether deific, human, or formless. For example, from the mam thar of Sañs-rgyas-ye-ses we learn that he determined not to remain in Lha-sa (but to return to his Mahāmudrā guru - i.e., dbEn-sa-pa - in gTsañ) on account of 1) a mysterious illness, and 2) a dream in which a "young girl" admonished him to do so. The pertinent passage reads : ". . .when Sans-rgyas-ye-šes had developed the illness in his legs while in Lha-sa, he had strongly determined at that time to return to gTsañ as soon as his illness left him. Moreover, it had also happened that one night in a dream, a young girl had said to him, 'Now you have accomplished your aims (here). Let's go back go gTsan !' " Just prior to this passage and interestingly, offered as an "explanation" of it, one finds another passage in the mam thar which alludes to the dākinī by way of showing its influential presence and workings in the spiritual life of dbEn-sa-pa, himself. This passage states: "Now, in the meantime, it had occurred that an inner voice spoke to. . .dbEn-sa-pa, saying, 'It is good that my Rab-'byams-pa (i.e., Sañs-rgyas-ye-ses) has not wandered too far away. Ï must ask (the great goddess) dPal-ldan Lha-mo to bring my brilliant one back to me, since his remaining (in Lha-sa) could be harmful (to him).' " The coda which connects and encapsulates these two passages is intriguing, both for its picturing of the inner dynamics of spiritual clairvoyance and telekinesis, and for the tender and loving concern it illustrates in connection with the guru-disciple relationship. The text says, "This explains why. . . (Sañs-rgyas-ye-ses decided to return to gTsañ)" and, finally, "Those events occurred owing to dbEn-sa-pa's feelings of concern (for his heart-disciple)." Moreover, it may be noted that in these two passages, Sañs-rgyas-ye-ses' illness, dbEn-sa-pa's "inner voice," the grand protective deity dPal-ldan Lha-mo, and the "young girl" in the dream are all manifestations of the dākinī. In the above examples, a certain pattern can be clearly discerned. Namely, the appearance of the dākinī in each case marks a particular and unique communicative moment for the tantric adept. In terms of specific functions, during such moments, or "spaces," "she" prophesies to, advises, or carries out the wishes of, the advanced adept. For the siddha-to-be, she provides protection. Manifesting in multifarious forms, "she" serves as the spur, inspiration, and helpful companion or successfully accomplishing the arduous path of tantric practice. In order to perform such functions, the dākinī does not always manifest as a phantom of dreams, nor as the divine apparition of a deity. Nor does</page><page sequence="9">64 THE TIBET JOURNAL "she" necessarily take human form. In one account "she" appears as a stone statue.37 In the rnam that of the siddha, Kukkuripa, the dākinī is his dog!38 Still, if we judge from the evidence of the siddha biographies, we note that quite oten the dākinī does appear in human, female form; and that in this form, "she" is often the sexual partner or "mystic consort" (Tib., rig mdf9 of the siddha. Such human dākinī-s are integrally and intimately connected with the sexual symbolism of tantric ritual and practice and, by extension, to the notion that for certain advanced tantric practices, the aid of an actual flesh and blood partner is useful and/or required.40 According to Katz's count, "fully fifty-six of the eighty-four [Indian mahāsiddha-s] are depicted in the company of a woman."41 Citing examples, Katz notes: "The attainment of mahāmudrāsiddhi by Vaidyãpâda is dependent upon his taking up residence with a Candâla (outcast e woman). Anaňgavajra is instructed by his guru, Padmavajra: 'Put yourself in touch with the swine-keeping woman by keeping swine and then step by step you will be a Vajrasattva.' . .We hear of Dha-ri-ka-pa, a king, becoming the servant of a harlot. Pu-ta-lo-ki in the same verse 4 . .won the harlot and perfection.' "42 And, of course, owing to recent English translations, we are all quite familiar now with such illustrious human dâkinî-s as Ni-gu-ma43 ("wife" of the siddha, Nāropa, who developed and taught her own system of the famed "six yoga-s"), Ye-ses mTsho-rgyal44 (chief Tibetan consort of Padmasambhava), bDag-med-ma45 (Marpa's accomplished wife), and Ma-gcig-lab-sgron-ma46 (Pha Dam-pa Sans-rgyas's chief consort, and fashioner of the advanced meditative system of gCod). These examples remind us that the Tantras were, and remain, effective for producing enlightened beings regardless of sex. They should also remind us that these were no ordinary women practitioners ! They were all tantric masters in their own right, who left society's constraints to follow the treacherous path of tantric practice. (It should be stressed, moreover, that within the contexts of certain advanced tantric practices, the processes of sexual intercourse may be performed either between human partners or conducted solely as an internal and imagined series of yogic actions. In the case of human practitioners, the sexual act is not performed by "ordinary beings," but rather by "deities"; by beings who have each put aside his or her ordinary mind-body complex and assumed the arcane body and the subtle awareness of a particular deity.) Summarizing the major functions of the dākinī in the tantric siddha biographical tradition - what one might call a summary of the dākinī as a central leit motif - Katz has enumerated the following: "1) inspiring and directing the siddha; 2) directly or indirectly initiating the siddha; 3) [serving as] the patron of the siddha. . .4) the source of</page><page sequence="10">SOME COMMENTS ON ITS NATURE AND MEANING 65 power of the siddha; 5) guardians of the gter-ma; and 6) biographers of the siddha."47 He goes on to reiterate that, "The mkha' 'grò ma may appear in visions, dreams, meditations and as actual women. They are also revered as precep- tors of particular yogic practices (i.e., gCod; gTum-mo) and may be demonia- cal as well as beneficent Their role in the lives of the siddha is tremendous "48 It remains now only necessary to mention how the dākinī functions within the contexts and symbolism of tantric ritual and practice, itself. According to the symbolism of tantric, or Vajrayâna, Buddhism, Enlightenment (bodhi) is represented as the perfect "sexual union" (Skt., yuganaddha ; Tib., zun 'jug ) of ultimate wisdom and compassionate activity. In Mahäyäna Buddhism generally, these two are referred to as prajnä (Skt. ; Tib., ses rab) and upãya (Skt.; Tib., thabs ), respectively. Prajnã is represented as being female ; and upâya , as being male. [Of course, the perfection of sexual union, simultaneous orgasm, is a familiar and direct symbol for the loss of "self"- what might be called a readily understandable description of šůnyata. During such orgasm, both partners experience the "transcendental émotion" called in the Tantras, samarasa or "one tasted" Here, neither partner is distinct. It is impossible to distinguish where one ends and the other begins. This experience of "wholeness" and "sameness' is accompanied by intensely blissful feeling.] In terms of tantric symbolism, these two are iconographically represented as two deities, usually semi -wrathful in form, who are embracing in sexual union. The pair of deities are said to be in the aspect of yab~yum (Tib., literally, "Father-Mother"). Comprising this most reverred pair are the great Wisdom -dākinī (Tib., Ye-ses-mkha'-'gro-ma) who is usually in her form as the Goddess VajrayoginI or Vajravārāhl,49 and "her" consort (whether Cakra- samvara, Guhyasamâja, Hevajra or whatever chief "male" deity of the given ritual cycle). Their blissful union symbolizes complete Enlightenment, the direct, blissful experience of ultimate Voidness. Since our discussion focuses on the dākinī , it is fitting here to describe "her" deific form. To do so, I refer to one of "her" chief iconographie forms, that is, as the great yi dam, the Goddess Vajrayoginï:50 Her body is a vibrant blood-red color. Apart from the bone ornaments that are draped around her waist and a necklace of skulls around her neck, she is completely naked. She holds aloft in her raised left hand a kapãla (Skt. ; a skull cup, here, filled with blood) ; and her right hand wields a hooked knife (Skt., kartari). Resting upon her left shoulder is the trident staff, or khãtvãnga (that represents her consort, the Heruka, Cakrasamvara). The top of the staff is decorated with three skulls. Standing with bent left leg and out-stretched right leg upon two corpses, her entire figure is encircled in flames.</page><page sequence="11">66 THE TIBET JOURNAL In such wise is "she" envisioned and contemplated upon by the practicing adept. n. Overview and Concluding Remarks In the above materials, in addition to briefly reviewing how some scholars have defined and interpreted the phenomenon of dûkini, I have tried to indicate a sampling of the multiplicity of forms and guises in which the symbol, or principle, of tfākinī manifests. To be sure, such a multiplicity of forms, together with the fact of "her" special ambiguity - i.e., that "she" is at once the witch, the trickster, and wisdom incarnate - combine to make "her" a most elusive phenomenon. Yet, in spite of such divergent images "her" nature, it seems to me, is allusive as well. Viewing the dākinī in a number of different textual and ritual practice contexts allows us perhaps to develop some appreciation of its multivalent character. Here, then, I wish to offer some general comments regarding "her" nature and meaning. To begin, it allows us to note that "she" is not "female." Though the 4ākinī assuredly most often appears in female form (whether as a female deity, or a female human being), this is but one of the myriad of ways Absolute Insight chooses to make manifest its factivity. Modern-day women practitioners who pride themselves on being "already half-way there" owing solely to their sex, need only be reminded of two pristine teachings on Voidness : In the Diamond-cutter (of doubts) sutra,51 the Buddha said: Those who by my form did see me, And those who followed me by my voice, Wrong the efforts they engaged in, Me those people will not see. From the Dharma (alone) should one see the Buddhas, From the Dharmakaya comes their guidance. Yet Dharma's true nature cannot be discerned, And no one can be conscious of it as an object.52 And, in the Vimalakīrti-nirdeša-sūtra, the goddess who lives in Vimalakfrt's house (herself a dākinī f) has this dialogue with Šāriputra (who represents the conservatism of early Buddhism wherein distinctions based on sex still held sway) : Šāriputra: Goddess, what prevents you from transforming yourself out of your female state?</page><page sequence="12">SOMB COMMENTS ON ITS NATURE AND MEANING 67 Goddess: Although I have sought my 'female state' for these twelve years, I have not yet found it. Reverend Šāriputra, if a magician were to incarnate a woman by magic, would you ask her, 'What prevents you from transforming yourself out of your female state?' Šāriputra: No ! Such a woman would not really exist, so what would there be to transform? Goddess: Just so, Reverend Šāriputra, all things do not really exist.53 (Of course, modern-day men practitioners who think this lets them off the hook from respecting their female counterparts might reflect upon the last of the "Fourteen Root Vows of Vajrayäna," which makes it clear that it is a serious downfall "to disparage women, who are of the nature of wisdom" !)54 The dākinī is, however, a feminine principle. The term used to refer to the phenomenon is a feminine noun ; and within the tantric symbolism employed to represent supreme Enlightenment, the dākinī most assuredly takes feminine form. Of course, one of the most interesting questions in this regard is, 'why is that the case?'55 An attempted answer would require at least a book; but I would like to suggest that apart from such ancient characterizations, constructs, and divisions based on sex and/or gender differences - as for example, "male - intellect, female - intuition;" "male - activity, female - passivity and receptivity;" and the like- the main idea being articulated here is that the dākinī is the necessary complement 56 to render us (whether male or female) whole beings. To put it another way, "she" is what is lacking, the lacking of which prevents our complete Enlightenment. Given that we un-Enlightened beings normally exist in rather narrowly limited "spaces," it is not surprising that the appearance in our lives of the 4ākinī's vastness ("she" is all that we lack!) might be, at least initially, over- whelming, horrific and terrifying, some of the portrayals of the dākinī as "gruesome, demonic, flesh-eating ghouls" no doubt spring from this pers- pective. And with the most stubborn and most self-righteous, "she" is least gentle! Making contact with the dākinī, then, is sometimes terrifying and always dangerous; but doing so offers the chance for dramatic and highly-prized fruit. The biographies of the siddhas show that these brave ones actually seek "her" out. To do so, they are usually shown making perilous journeys and visiting cemeteries and charnel grounds. The "logic" of such imagery operates on several levels at once. The "outer" journey, of course, is more accurately, an "inner" or "spiritual" one; and because in order to fully make contact with "her," the adept's own ordinary psycho-physical being must "die," the cemetery is a most appropriate symbolic place for such an encounter. Even in non-tantric Buddhism, the utter destruction of the "false idea of a 'self' " must be accomplished prior to (or concomitant with) the attainment of the insight which cognizes Voidness (sünyata) directly. Having finally won access to the dākinī, the tantric adept is thereafter graced by "her" to receive new powers and insight and, ultimately, full Enlightenment itself.</page><page sequence="13">68 THE TIBET JOURNAL From the absolute point of view, then, the tfâkinï is highest wisdom, itself. That is, "she" is the direct, unmediated, nonconceptual understanding of Voidness ( sûnyatâ)* "She" is, as her chief iconographie representation suggests, the "naked" experience of Voidness, in itself - limitless, uncontained, effusive, and entirely blissful. How could such an experience be adequately described in words? In the tantric world of ritual and meditative practice, the older Buddhist trilogy of Buddha , Dharma , and Sañgha is replaced by the triad of bLa ma, Yi dam , and mkha ' 'grò ma (i.e., dâkinï). But in practice, each of the three includes both of the other members ofthe triad ; so that oneregards ones'guru as the yi dam and as the dâkinï (since both are embodiments of the highest wisdom). Likewise, the dâkinï is both bLa ma and Yi dam. In highest tantra practice contexts, one is continually reminded that about this, one should not be confused. The dâkinï is all the "Three Roots" in one. Within tantric contexts (and Mahâyâna contexts, generally), we speak of the trikâya, or so-called "Three Bodies of the Buddha." Since "she" embodies the highest wisdom, the dâkinï is all three of these bodies. "She" is the formless "Body of Truth," The Dharmakâya. In "her" communicative role, bringing inspiration and insight to advanced practitioners, "she" is the magnificent and eloquent "Enjoyment Body," the Yi dam , or Sambhogakâya. And in "her" infinite manifestations which serve to communicate with us ordinary beings and to trigger havoc in our habitual samsâric patterns of thought, "she" sports in countless configurations of the "Emanation Body," the Nirmãnakâya. The dâkinï is thus, in her vastness, the embodiment of the entirety of trikâya . Also within the world of tantric practice , another triad is commonly posited, namely that which delineates the "outer; inner, and secret" (Tib., phyi, naň , and gsaň ba) levels of experience. (These three may be seen as reflecting the trikâya , in reverse order.) According to this manner of speaking, we may say that the outer dâkinï is those varied forms in which the çlâkinï appears, whether human or deific, benign or wrathful, beneficient or male- volent; the inner dâkinï manifests when the advanced meditator successfully transforms him or herself into the great dâkinï (usually VajrayoginI, herself); and the secret dâkinï is the formless power, energy, and pure bliss of Voidness.57 In this last aspect, the dâkinï is synonymous with another extremely important concept in the Tantras, namely, Mahâmudrâ , the "Great Gesture" or "Great Symbol"; for "she" appears when the highest intellectual grasp of Voidness is transcended. There since beginningless time, "She" is the ultimate, unchanging, basis and reality of being. At the end ot the arduous path of practice of highest yoga tantra, "She" reveals "herself," naked before us. And regardless of whether we aré "male" or "female" beings, if we wish to become Enlightened beings, we must embrace, and be embraced by, "Her."</page><page sequence="14">SOME COMMENTS ON ITS NATURE AND MEANING 69 ENDNOTES 1 . This characterization of tfākinī is found in the "Glossaries" appended to both The Life of Marpa the Translator (Boulder: Prajna Press 1982) p. 219 and The Rain of Wisdom (Boulder : Shambhala, 1980) p. 345. Both works were translated by the Nālandfi Trans- lation Committee under the direction of Chögyam Trungpa Rinpoche. 2. For example this gloss is used by Keith Dowman in the title of his translation of the life of the dãkiní, Ye-šes-mtsho-rgyal. See his Sky Dancer; The Secret Life and Songs of the Lady Yeshe Tsogyel (London: Routledge &amp; Kegan Paul, 1984). 3. See Geshe Kelsang Gyatso's Clear Light of Bliss ; Mahamudra in Vajrayana Buddhism (London: Wisdom Publications, 1982). 4. Both "Glossaries" mentioned above in note 1 define 4àkinl as "a wrathful or semiwrathful female yidam." 5 . A. Waddell often referred to çlâkinî-s as being "demoniacal." Waddell, Evans-Wentz, and Das all used the term "witch" in their characterizations. 6. See Waddell, Tibetan Buddhism (London: Allen &amp; Co. Ltd. 1895. Rpt. New York: Dover Publications, Inc. 1972) p. 366. 7. Sarat Chandra Das used both "sprites" and "fairies" in his definition of the term mkha ' 'grò ma. See his A Tibetan-English Dictionary Rpt., Delhi: Motilal Banarsidass, 1970), p. 180. [Interestingly "fairies" is also the term used by Robert Paul in his The Tibetan Symbolic World; Psychoanalytic Explorations (Chicago: The University of Chicago Press. 1982). On p. 132, for example he calls dlakinī-s "sky-going fairies."] 8. This is one of the descriptions used by Anagarika Govinda. See his Foundations of Tibetan Mysticism (Rider 1960.

Wittgenstein, Philosophical Investigations. (G.E.M. Anscombe trans. Oxford, 1958). The fuller statement by Wittgenstein, found at P.I. , 43 is : "For a large class of cases - though not for all - in which we employ the word 'meaning' it can be explained thus the meaning of a word is its use in the language." Wittgenstein was aware of two other points of importance to this study ; namely he realized that language has multiple functions and that words and expressions îunctionre lationally, getting their meanings in social [and/or cultural] conexts. 28. This language is that used by Lobsang Lhalungpa in the "Introduction" to his trans- lation of The Life of Milarepa (New York : E.P. Dutton, 1977.), p. xxiii. 29.

Also cited in Katz, op. cit., p. 13. 31. Guenther clearly recognizes the paralleles between the dākinī and Jung's anima. In a note to this passage he writes: "This aspect has a great similarity to what the Swiss psychologist C.G. Jung calls the 'anima.' " Katz's article, op. cit., investigates and elaborates upon these similarities; and upon some dissimilarities. 32. Bhupendranath Datta (trans.) Mystic Tales of Lāmā Tõrânãtha (Calcutta : Ramakrishna Vedanta Math, 1944; Rpt., 1957) p. 65. This story, with some minor changes in translation, is also cited in Katz op. cit., p. 23. It is paraphrased in Tsultrim Allione's Women of Wisdom (London: Routledge &amp; Kegan Paul, 1984) p. 37. 33. This type of language was used, one may recall, in several of Carlos Castaneda's novels for describing part of the method, and experience, of training in the Yaqui Indian tradition. See especially Castaneda's Journey to Ixtlan; The Lessons of Don Juan (New York: Simon and Schuster, 1972). 34. Katz, op. cit., p. 22. [I have slightly rearranged the structure of Katz's original sentence here.] 35. These remarks by Chogyam Trungpa Rinpoche are to be found in the journal, Maitreya IV, p. 25. They are also quoted in Allione, op. cit., p. 38. 36. This rnam thar and that of Saňs-rgyas-ye-šes (which follows) were translated by me. The complete translations of these rnam thar, together with four others, will shortly appear in a book forthcoming from Wisdom Publications entitled "Enlightened Beings; Early dGe-lugs Siddha Biographies." 37.

Often the term karmamudrã is used in such contexts as an alternative for rig-ma. However, in my opinion, there is already so much confusion regarding the many, and varied, meanings of karmamudra that I prefer not to use it. 40. An interesting analysis of the benefits of having an actual flesh and blood partner, and of "living with an insightful consort" is presented in Allione, op. cit., pp. 39-40. 41. Katz, op. cit, p. 24. 42. Ibid., p. 24. 43. There is as yet no full-scale biography of Ni-gu-ma published in English. One can, however, learn something of her life from Guenther's translation of The Life and Teaching of Nãropa. Additional information can be gleaned from The Blue Annals (Roerich, trans., 1949; Rpt., Delhi: Motilal Banarsidass, 1979); and from Glenn</page><page sequence="16">SOME COMMENTS ON ITS NATURE AND MEANING 71 Mullin's Selected Works of the Dalai Lama II (Ithaca, N.Y. : Snow Lion Publications, 1985). 44. There are two English translations of the life of Ye-šes mTsho-rgyal: 1) Tarthang Tulku's translation, called Mother of Knowledge; the Enlightenment of Ye-shes mTsho- rgyal (Berkeley: Dharma Publishing, 1983); and 2) Keith Dowman's Sky Dancer; The Secret Life and Songs of the Lady Yeshe Tsogyel (London : Routledge &amp; Kegan Paul, 1984). 45. Again, there is no single work which narrates the life of bDag-med-ma, but information regarding her may be gleaned from The Blue Annals and from The Life of Marpa the Translator , op. cit. 46. Apart from the accounts of it in The Blue Annals , the life of Ma-gcig-lab-sgron-ma appears in Allione's Women of Wisdom , pp. 141-187. Additionally, four of the "Eighty- four siddhas" of Indian fame were women. Their life stories "can be found in Robinson's Buddha's Lions and in Keith Dowman's Masters of Mahãmudrã . 47. Katz, op. cit.» p. 28. In the quote, I have substituted "siddha" for Katz's phonetic rendering of its Tibetan equivalent. 48. Ibid., p. 28. 49. In essence these "two" goddesses are actually one. Vajrayogini is the female deity who is the chief consort of Lord Cakrasamvara. It is explained that the name "Vajrāvārahi" (that is, "Diamond Sow") is used of her to emphasize her function (which is to destroy the ignorance of holding the view of an inherently existent "I"- sympolized by the pig's head), while the name "Vajrayogini" is used to indicate her essence (namely, the adamantine insight which cognizes the inseparability of bliss and voidness.) 50. Here, I describe Vajrayoginl's iconographie form based upon the descriptions of it found in a number of her meditative sûdhanas. For a description and discussion of the iconographie form of Vajravārāhī and her "ornaments, "see Allione, op. cit., pp. 31-36. 51.

For a full enumeration and discussion of these, see my The Diamond Light of the Eastern Dawn (New York: Simon and Schuster, 1972) pp. 100-106. 55. It is, I believe too simplistic to assert that the Tantra-s are written from a male point of view because most tantric practitioners were/are men. I would agree that the texts do seem to take this point of view. However, there seem in addition actually to be qualities that are "feminine" in nature, and that hence require feminine characterization. A thorough discussion of such a premise would, of course require at least a book. 56. I find this way of speaking more appropriate and much more helpful - than language like: the dākinf represents one's "other" or one's "opposite." It seems to me to be also less combative; and certainly, if we're seeking Enlightenment, we had better try to be less combative. 57.
