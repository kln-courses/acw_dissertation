<plain_text><page sequence="1">PEREKPEREKPEREK SHIRAH, AN EARLY RESPONSE TO PSALM 151 One of the significant contributions to the continuing discussion concerning the meaning of Psalm 151 from Qumran Cave XI was made by John Strugnell, (1) who pointed out the existence of an Arabie "anti-psalm:" Ο David, if the mountains did not praise Me then would I truly tear them up: If the trees did not praise Me then would I truly make their fruit little. But there is nothing which does not praise Me greatly and sanctify Me mightily. Do so then, ye peoples, for I see ail. (2) The Arab writer was apparently protesting against David's senti ments as expressed in lines 5-7 of the Hebrew text, which he understood to imply that the mountains and the trees do not praise the Lord. In view of the conflicting translations which are still being ofïered for this key passage, (3) this protest would seem to add weight to those which take the suffixes in line 6 as 3rd person pronouns referring to God: The mountains cannot witness to Him (lw) neither the hills tell about Him (,lw) (nor) the trees His words (dbrw) (1) John Strugnell, Notes on the Text and Transmission of the Apocryphal PsalmsPsalms 151, 154, and 155, in Harvard Theological Review, vol., 59 (1966), pp. 279-280.

For who can tell, and who can bespeak, and who can relate the deeds of the Lord of Ail Things? God has seen everything, He has heard and He has heeded. (4) The date of the Arabie "anti-psalm" is not specified by Strugnell. I should, however, like to call attention to a Hebrew text, most probably substantially earlier, which may likewise be characterized as a reaction against the unorthodox sentiments attributed to David in the apocryphal Psalm 151. PerekPerek Shirah is an anonymous collection of hymnic scriptural verses put into the mouths of animais and personifications of the inanimate world. The purpose of this liturgical tract, still included in some prayer books, is to demonstrate in an anthropomorphic fashion the truth t.hat ail of nature proclaims the glory of its creator. The text has been preserved in several manuscripts, the earliest dating from about the lOth century, at which time it is also mentioned in a polemical work of the Karaite, Salmon ben Jeroham. According to Malachi Beit-Arié, who prepared a critical édition (5) of the text under the supervision of (îershom Scholem, Perek Shirali has close affinities with the Ileikhalot literature from before the 3rd century and was composed during a very early period of Jewish mysticism. The following Midrash found in the proem to Perek Shirah (6) is of spécial interest in the light of 11 QPs 151: It is said of David, king of Israël, peace be upon him, Lhat when 11e had completed the Book of Psalms, he was flushed with conceit and said before Him: Master of the Worlds, is there a creature (7) in existence which excels me in (4) See Sturugnell, opus citatum in note 1, p. 280. However, while 11 kwl 11 kwl in line 8 is probably accusative, I prefer taking 'dwn hkvvl in line 7 as a genitive construct as suggested by a number of scholars. (5) M. Beit-Arié, Perek Shirah, Introduction and critical édition, 2 volumes (PH.D. thesis, Jerusalem, 1966); see also his article in Encyclopaedia Judaica, XIII,XIII, 273-275. (6) My translation is based on Beit-Arié's text, Perek Shirah II, pp. 22-24 : אמרו עליו על דוד מלך ישראל ע״ה כי בשעה שסיים ספר תלים זחה דעתו עליו אמי לפניו רבון העולמים כלום יש בריה בעולם שיאמר[!] שירה יותר ממני באותה שעה נזדמנה לו צפרדע אחת ואמרה לו דוד אל תזיח דעתך עליך שאנכי אומרת שירה יותר ממך ולא עוד אלא שכל שירה שאנכי אומרת אנכי מושלת עליו נ!] שלשת אלפים משל שני וידבר שלשת אלפים (וגו׳) משל ויהי שירו חמשה ואלף The text is quoted from Perek Shirah in Yalqut Shim'oni on Psalm 150.

At that moment a frog came along and said to him: David, be not puffed up with conceit, for I utter more songs than you. Moreover, for every song I utter, I recite 3000 proverbs, as is written: "And he spoke 3000 pro verbs and his songs were 1005" (1 Kings 5,12). The suggestion has been made (8) that Perek Shirah was written as a Midrash on the last verse of the canonical Book of Psalms: "Let every thing which has breath praise the Lord." This is indeed where the above cited passage is placed in Yalqut Shim'oni. However, this hardly accounts for the critical allusion to David's boasting. It is only in Ps. 151, and more particularly in the Hebrew version found at Qumran, that we flnd David's estimate of his unique rôle and the déniai that animate or inanimate création can rival it. It is, moreover, only in llQPsalms that we find the emphasis on David as a prolific author of songs, whose total number exceeded that of Solomon's proverbs and songs combined. (9) According to Perek Shirah the frog excelled them both, since each of his innu merable songs was accompanied by 3000 proverbs. We note, further, that like the Arab 'anti-psalmist', the author of Perek Shirah was disturbed by the déniai that nature is capable of praising God. This would indicate that (1) he was familiar with a version of Ps. 151 in which the negative lw' on lines 5-6 of the key passage was applied to the mountains, the hills, the trees, as well as the sheep; (2) he took the déniai as referring to the capability of proclai ming the words and deeds of God, rather than those of David. By way of illustration, none of the following proposed transla tions would provide a basis for the reaction in Perek Shirah: Les montagnes témoignent pour moi et les collines rapportent à mon sujet; Les arbres &lt; racontent &gt; mes chants et les brebis mes œuvres (Magne) (10). (8) See Beit-Arié, ibidem, pp. 22 and 39 citing the view of J. L. Abida. Beit-Arié, himself, notes the striking link between the proem of Perek Shirah and 11 Q Psalm 151 (ibidem, p. 46, note 201).

It is this Hebrew Vorlage containing the negative, but abbreviated by the omission of vv. 4-5, which lies behind the Greek and Syriac. However, none of the 7</page><page sequence="4">JOSEPH M. BAUMGARTEN 578 Les montagnes ne Lui rendent-elles pas témoignage? Et les collines ne (Le) proclament-elles pas? Les arbres prisèrent mes paroles et le troupeau mes poèmes (Dupont-Sommer) (11). Les montagnes n'iront pas témoigner à mon sujet, et les collines n'iront pas rapporter sur mon compte, &lt;ni&gt; les arbres mes dits ou les brebis mes œuvres (Auffret) (12). The interprétation of the original editor (13) does supply the déniai of the rôle of the mountains and hills as proclaimers of God, but is considerably weakened by the "Orphie" sequel: "The trees have cherished my words and the flock my works." It is more likely that the author of Perek Shirah, who took pains to specify the songs of various species of trees as well as small and large cattle, had before him a version which excluded both végétation and animais from any hymnal function. The apparently naive anthropomorphism of Perek Shirah in turn gave rise to opposition by some religious writers. The tract survived, however, mainly due to the kabbalistic-mystical inter pretation which it received in the esoteric tradition associated with the Heikhalot literature. (14) The links between this literature and the apocalyptic writings of the Second Temple period are now gradually emerging. (15) The likelihood that the author of Perek Shirah knew Psalm 151 in a form more complété than the truncated Greek and Syriac versions need therefore cause little surprise. As Stiiugnell lias noted, this probably was the case with the Arab writer. The reported discovery of Hebrew manuscripts with additional psalms in the eight century is only one possible link.
