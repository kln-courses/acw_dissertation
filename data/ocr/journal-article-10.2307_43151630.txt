<plain_text><page sequence="1">Baudelaire au féminin le sens, ce sens en question, est toujurs de l'autre, dans tous les sens de cette expression.1 (Jean-Luc Nancy, Le Partage des voix) Not long ago, I assembled five texts for the study of fictions of feminine desire. At the time, I did not pay special attention to the fact that all of them - the letters of Heloise and Abelard, Les Lettres portugaises, La Princesse de Clèves, La Nouvelle Hélotse and Les Liaisons dangereuses - disturbed in one way or another the function of a simple attribution of authorship. That is, none of these writings were unequivocally signed, although attribution often could and has been assigned. I was interested by this circumstance in each case, in particular in the case of Les Lettres portugaises, yet I did not then interrogate the coincidence of the five absent signatures that I myself had brought about. Recently, however, I found myself faced with this coincidence at an unexpected moment. While puzzling over what seemed to be a particularly cryptic assertion in Paul de Man's essay 'Autobiography as De-Facemenť, I found it became more accessible only after it had turned the tables on me, so to speak, and gave me some access to my own encrypted fascination with missing signatures. De Man writes: '(. . .) any book with a readable title page is, to some extent, autobiographical'.2 1 cannot say what finally prompted me to read this sentence 'autobiog- raphically', but once I had I also noticed something that should have stood out from the first: the work is autobiographical, asserts de Man, to the extent that its title page, the place of the signature, is readable. This minimum criterion for autobiography concerns the readability of proper names, more precisely of signatures. It therefore points to the necessary deviation of the name from what it properly signifies, necessary, that is, if the name is to be readable or iterable. But what, then, is a readable autobiography? Or rather, whose autobiography does one read when reading signatures and the texts they sign? It now seems to me that what is problematic in the sentence 'any book with a readable title page is autobiographical' is not so much the difficulty of consenting to such an all-inclusive assertion but the difficulty which comes from the way it upsets a basic certainty about the autobiographical process. By making it a function of readability, de Man does not so much dissociate autobiography from writing and the writer as place it between writer and reader, writing and reading. Thus, the same gesture both allows one to Paragraph Volume 8 © Oxford University Press 1986</page><page sequence="2">76 Paragraph assert that any text is more or less autobiographical and prevents any certain attribution of autobiography to reader or writer. Autobiography is an all-inclusive genre precisely to the extent that it remains impossible to conclude whose life is being written - or read. The implications of generalized autobiography would have to be taken into account whenever a relation between signature and work is at issue, whenever, that is, readable title pages are considered part of the work to be read (and, to a certain extent, as de Man would say, they always are). This, of course, is easier said than done since what has to be taken into account by definition cannot be fully calculated or predicted by any one reading or writing subject. Even in a text such as Jacques Derrida's Glas, whose author obviously calculates to an entirely new power the back and forth of the autobiographical 'between' of readable signatures, there comes a moment when Derrida's readers are taken aside and prodded to admit that they believe the author of what they are reading at some level does not know what he is doing. Yet, not ever fully knowing what is going on when one reads and writes will never mean that the complications, the co-implications of signature simply disappear when one's purpose is to construct some theory of its workings. This double bind leaves its mark whether one knows it or not. Such a setting aside or ignoring of co-implications would be necessary to transfer any formal aspect of the signature to the text of the work it signs. If, for example, this move were to take one from the fact of a male or rather a male's signature on certain theoretical texts - those, precisely, which have so complicated thinking about signatures - to the notion of something called 'male theory', then one would have effected the sort of transfer from form to meaning that de Man, for instance, describes according to patterns of metaphor and metonymy. These are patterns whose epistemological reliability is not necessarily enhanced by being pressed into the service of political or other programmes. On the contrary. Specifically, the move from the signature of a male to a male signature, and from there to something called male theory transfers a formal, known attribute from one 'thing' to the non-appearing, non-phenomenological 'thing' that is the meaning of a text. As in the psychoanalytic situation of transference, the interpreter is at high risk in this situation of plugging her or his own 'content' into that space presumed to be full of meaning which is a text. Yet, if we recall our point of departure in the aphorism about title pages, it would seem that this kind of 'autobiographical' or transferential operation is also what allows a text to become readable. Is this not, therefore, a circle of some sort - hermeneutic, vicious or solipsistic? The</page><page sequence="3">Baudelaire au féminin 77 answer to that question, it seems to me, can never be a simple 'yes' and, oddly enough, precisely because there is autobiography circulating through all the transfers of meaning. The circulation of readability, of iterability, is the circulation of a deviation and of autobiography as always already the autobiography of the other.3 Or, in terms that are perhaps still more challenging to the doxa , there is autobiography of a 'we' given by the division, the deviation and the sharing of voices. Here, I am trying to translate the title page of Jean-Luc Nancy's book Le Partage des voix and, especially, the sense of the circle it traces which, paradoxically, makes no sense unless it is open: Yhermeneuein nomme cela à quoi tout cercle herméneutique, qu'il le veuille ou non, se trouve, en tant que cercle, paradoxalement ouvert . C'est-à-dire à cette altérité ou à cette altération du sens, sans laquelle l'identification d'un sens - le retour au meme du cercle - ne pourrait même pas avoir lieu. L'ouverture de Yhermeneuein est en ce sens ouverture du sens et au sens en tant qu'autre. Non pas à un 'autre' sens supérieur, transcendant ou plus originel, mais au sens lui-même en tant qu'autre, à une altérité définissant le sens.4 (hermeneuein names that to which every hermeneutic circle, whether it wants to or not, is paradoxically opened insofar as it is a circle. Opened, that is, to that alterity or that alteration of meaning without which the identification of a meaning - the circle's return to the same - could not even take place. The opening of hermeneuein is in this sense the opening of sense and to sense as other . Not to some superior, transcendant or more original 'other' sense, but to sense itself as other, to an alterity defining sense.) c This somewhat roundabout introduction brings me to the circulation or sharing of voices in a work whose signature - 'Charles Baudelaire' - one should perhaps not rush to read as in any simple sense 'male'. I say 'one should not' when of course you understand already that I mean it is I who am in no rush to do so. This in part for the principal reasons that I have just outlined, but also no doubt for more obscure, even auto- biographical reasons that I would share if I could. To hear the deviation in Baudelaire's voice, not so as to tax him (or anyone else) with it, nor to pretend to heal it over, but rather to share in its address and perhaps to readdress it: this will require activating the silent pole of a dialogue, taking up a position which, at first glance, will not seem very promising. But I promise at least to return to what is promising, even if the route may not be exactly circular. In 1856, an observer of the Parisian literary scene who wanted to illustrate Baudelaire's eccentricity, reported that the poet regularly</page><page sequence="4">78 Paragraph insisted on reading his verses to 'his young Creole mistress'. 'La dame', remarked the observer, 'ne trouve pas le régime de son goût et se révolte quelquefois contre la tyrannie de son amant. "Taisez-vous, donc", lui répond-il en lui jetant cinq francs. "Je sais bien que vous êtes une oie; mais j'ai besoin de lire mes vers à haute voix et je tiens à ce qu'on les entende.'"5 (The lady does not find this diet to her taste and from time to time revolts against her lover's tyranny. 'Just hold your tongue', he answers, throwing five francs at her. 'I know you're a silly goose, but I need to read my verses out loud and I insist on their being heard.') Claude Pichois, Baudelaire's most recent editor, refers to this piece of gossip in a note to one of the poems of Les Fleurs du mal ('Sonnet d'automne' (Autumn Sonnet)), at a point where, precisely, the poet directs an abrupt 'Tais-toi!' (Shut up!) to an inquiring feminine figure. The point the editor seems to be making with this reference is that, regardless of the anecdote's authenticity, Baudelaire at least fuelled his own legend when he staged this moment in the poem, the moment at which the poet tells a woman to shut up and listen.4 What is more, Pichois also implies that the anecdote accurately reflects Baudelaire's contempt not only for Jeanne Duval, his illiterate companion of many years, but for women in general. He does this when, without transition or comment, he simply juxtaposes to the anecdote the following quote from Mon Cœur mis à nu (My Heart Laid Bare), which is just one of many he might have chosen from that text to illustrate its author's categorical disdain: 'J'ai toujours été étonné qu'on laissât les femmes entrer dans les églises. Quelle conversation peuvent-elles tenir avec Dieu?' (I have always been amazed that women are allowed to enter churches. What conversation could they possibly have with God?) With that gesture, Pichois, inadvertently perhaps, invites every women to put herself in the place of Jeanne Duval when confronted with Baudelaire's poetry. That is, every woman should hear herself addressed by 'Shut up, silly goose, and listen'. Now, it might seem that the place of such an addressee is the least promising position from which to hear or read this poetry. Yet if that is so, then it would be not so much because it is the place of non-readers like Jeanne Duval (or any of the Fleurs du mal' s other mistresses) but rather because these addressees are curiously positioned by a kind of double gesture that the anecdote neatly brings out. What Jeanne Duval was ordered to listen to over her objections were poems which, more often than not, included a form of address to some feminine figure. That is, she had to sit still for the address of this address, for a doubled address which, on both levels talks, so to speak, over her head.7 However, one assumes perhaps too quickly that her impatience with this manœuvre can only be</page><page sequence="5">Baudelaire au féminin 79 a sign of her dull imperviousness to Baudelaire's verse. One assumes, that is, that there is no link possible between her exasperation in this situation and an understanding of the poems that would be more than just a passive hearing of them. What if, however, Jeanne Duval's naïve petulance were also the sign that just such a link has and should be made between the address in the poems and their address to an unwilling listener? Who, in fact, can say that Jeanne Duval has not understood what she heard?8 Jeanne, of course, supplies raw material for a Baudelairean thematics of woman - woman in the raw. Yet, as the poet Michel Deguy has pointed out, woman figures as a theme in Baudelaire only because she is first what he calls the poem's milieu , its medium, that by which the poem names and measures the appearance of whatever appears. In his text titled 'Le Corps de Jeanne' (Jeanne's Body), Deguy writes: Pour Baudelaire, la femme est le corps pascalien; ou, en termes de poétique, la femme est l'oxymore (. . .) Elle - ou il=son corps - est le milieu en tant que partage du haut et du bas, et convertisseur du haut et du bas entre eux. Elle peut opérer cette distension et cet échange en étant elle-même agrandie ou rapetissée. Mais d'abord il faut passer par elle pour voir: son déploiement de microcosme donne la mesure, l'échelle de référence.9 (For Baudelaire, woman is the Pascalian body; or in terms of poetics, she is the oxymoron (. . .) She - or he=her body - is the milieu in the sense of the division between high and low, converter of high and low into one another. She can operate this distension and this exchange by being herself aggrandized or made smaller. But first one must pass by way of her in order to see: her microcosmic unfurling gives the measure.) To call Jeanne a milieu is to place her at the heart of the poetic operation. And indeed it is to the operation of the word sein - breast or bosom, but by metaphor or metonymy also heart - that Deguy turns his attention. This move is perfectly consistent with the poem's own working through of these rhetorical possibilities, which Deguy draws out subtly and surely. I wonder, however, whether it is not almost too consistent, that is, too closely joined with the movement it is tracing or describing, to be able to remark, rather than just repeat, all that may be at work here, including certain resistances. Deguy's own term milieu , when taken in the sense of poetic medium, may also name a point of resistance that has been assumed uncritically or unknowingly by the commentary. To call Jeanne or woman the poetic medium is to implicate her with the poem's language or speech. Yet the body with which Deguy finds Baudelaire concerned is often rendered speechless.</page><page sequence="6">80 Paragraph What I want to begin to explore is this silencing that gives voice to the poem. Silencing and not simply silence. Indeed, only the difference between an unequivocal absence of speech and a silencing of speech can make it potentially interesting to sit up and listen when feminine figures are made to speak in Baudelaire's poems. Because they are made to speak all through Les Fleurs du mal, as we shall see. The point, then, is not that this medium is a speechless body but that its speaking in the poem and by the poem is stamped by a kind of equivocation or double gesture: both a giving and a taking away of voice. The Fleurs du mal opens, in fact, with two women screeching to the heavens their intentions to make the Poet suffer. First, even before he speaks for himself, 'Bénédiction' (Blessing), the initial poem, cites the speech of the Poet's mother. In a caricatural parody of the Virgin Mother, her invective invokes God to call down a curse and a blight on the son who is her punishment for unnamed crimes.10 Next, the opening poem invokes the Poet's woman - 'Sa femme va criant sur les places publiques' (His woman goes screeching through the public squares) - who vows to usurp the place of divine honour in his heart, then to rip it from his chest and throw it to her dog. 'Bénédiction' concludes with the Poet in his own voice humbly thanking God for the suffering he has endured at the hands of all humanity represented principally by the speech of mother and mistress. Such an opening scene sets up a kind of sounding board against which many voices of Les Fleurs du mal resonate. The figures of feminine voice or voice attributed to feminine figures are numerous and diverse enough to require a much longer study if one were to propose an exhaustive census of them all. Such a study, moreover, would have to set out some sure and decisive criterion for distinguishing among the poems' different voices, for establishing where one ends and another begins in order to enumerate all those that the Poet attributes or lends to feminine figures. My hunch is that such a criterion will always finally elude the most patient research. What is more, it may be precisely because the criterion allowing one to distinguish one voice from another is in default that conventional solutions risk being too easily welcomed to take its place.11 Following the same hunch, I would suggest that any procedure for separating out a feminine voice or voices in Les Fleurs du mal should consider the possibility that there is a defensive component to its reaction in the face, so to speak, of a mixed voice, a middle voice or even a doubled and undecidable voice, a voice which both is and is not the Poet's own, which both is and is not the voice of an addressee, destinataire or interlocutor. Finally, it may be that unless one suspends as far as possible</page><page sequence="7">Baudelaire au féminin 81 this defensive reaction, one has no chance to determine how it may be working within the poetry itself, no chance to hear what may be a wound in a voice which is trying to heal itself by expelling or expressing the instrument of its injury. The question, however, is whether this impossible expression is not precisely what gives the Poet his voice. One thinks, for example, of these lines from 'L'Héautontimorouménos' or the self-tormentor: Elle est dans ma voix, la criarde! C'est tout mon sang, ce poison noir! Je suis le sinistre miroir Où la mégère se regarde. Je suis la plaie et le couteau! Je suis le soufflet et la joue! Je suis les membres et la roue, Et la victime et le bourreau! (She is in my voice, this screeching one! All my blood is this black poison! I am the sinister glass In which the shrew looks at herself. I am the wound and the knife! I am the slap and the cheek! I am the limbs and the wheel, The victim and the executioner!) The shrill 'elle' who is 'dans ma voix' does not, it seems, refer to the woman who is supposed to be addressed by the poem's first line ('Je te frapperai sans colère' (I will strike you without anger)), but rather to 'la vorace Ironie' (voracious Irony) of the preceding stanza. 'Elle' is but an allegorization which takes advantage of grammatical gender to turn Irony into a shrew.12 Yet, all the images of ironic doubling in the lines that follow confront masculine with feminine gendered nouns. The voice of gender has thus here been extended well beyond the apparent limits of woman's or man's speech. At the very least, these lines thematize the obstacle which would confront the attempt to separate different voice strands from each other along some dividing line between genders. Still, there are poems, indeed many of them, that represent some feminine or feminized interlocutor or addressee speaking. If, however, one insists on the strictest criteria for determining what constitutes represented speech, then these would have to be counted as rare.13 And</page><page sequence="8">82 Paragraph even where one encounters what seems to be a dialogue that puts in play a woman's speech or voice, one can never dismiss the possibility of a defensive dissimulation or projection of the ironic doubling that is always at work. The opening of the sonnet 'Semper Eadem', for example, which appears to be a question put to the Poet by his mistress, should perhaps be read as already a displacement out of the echo-chamber of self-questioning. Y et the fact that the poem adopts at the outset the device of another, feminine, speaker remains interesting if for no other reason than that this voice is invoked only in order to be silenced. The first six lines articulate the pair question/answer with the other pair joy/pain. The poem opens with the citation of a question put to the Poet by a mistress in what we must imagine to be a light, perhaps even a mocking tone: 'D'où vous vient, disiez-vous, cette tristesse ētraņge, Qui monte comme la mer sur le roc noir et nu?' - Quand notre cœur a fait une fois sa vendange, Vivre est un mal. C'est un secret de tous connu, Une douleur très simple et non mystérieuse, Et, comme votre joie, éclatante pour tous. ('From where, you were saying, does this strange sadness come over you, Rising like the sea onto the black and naked rock?' - Once the heart has had its harvest, Living is an evil. It's a secret that everyone knows, A very simple and unmysterious pain, And, like your joy, obvious for everyone.) That a pain is said to be like a joy because both are 'éclatante pour tous' might seem to be an abuse of metaphor until one begins to suspect that the forced resemblance is a kind of cover thrown over what is actually a métonymie relation of cause and effect between the terms. That is, the questioner's joy does not resemble the Poet's pain; rather it inflicts that pain. The point of their exchange, the place where both of them burst out, is clearly named in the next stanza with another metonymy: the woman's mouth. It is this 'Bouche au rire enfantin' (childishly laughing mouth) that the poem twice commands to be silent with a repetition of 'taisez-vous' on either side of the poem's principal division: Cessez donc de chercher, ô belle curieuse! Et, bien que votre voix soit douce, taisez- vous!</page><page sequence="9">Baudelaire au féminin 83 Taisez- vous, ignorante! âme toujours ravie! Bouche au rire enfantin! Plus encor que la Vie, La Mort nous tient souvent par des liens subtils. Laissez, laissez mon cœur s'enivrer du mensonge, Plonger dans vos beaux yeux comme dans un songe, Et sommeiller longtemps à l'ombre de vos cils! (So stop looking, o beautiful, curious one! And, even though your voice is sweet, be quiet! Be quiet, ignorant one! always ecstatic soul! Childishly laughing mouth! Even more than Life, Death often has a subtle hold on us. Let my heart get drunk on a lie, Dive into your beautiful eyes as in a beautiful dream, And sleep for a long time in the shadow of your lashes.) The imperative command 'taisez-vous' makes way for the gentler imperative of the final stanza: 'Laissez, laissez mon cœur' etc. that brings the poem to a close with what is the most characteristic - not to say obsessional - of all Baudelaire's attitudes in the face of the feminine figures mustered in the pages of Les Fleurs du mal : the Poet dreamily drinking in to the point of drunkenness the light (or the shadow) of her eyes. 'Semper Eadem' is interesting in this regard because it installs the dreamy attitude only after imposing silence on the woman's childlike speech. Her question, in effect, betrays a forgetting and as such it marks a return to the child's ignorance of the simplest truth: Death has a better hold on us than Life. This poem, therefore, not only situates the poet's dreaming in the woman's eyes but locates them as a displacement of her mouth 'au rire enfantin', a displacement which is a forgetting or a repressing of her forgetting. If, however, the movement traced from mouth to eyes, and from speaking to dreaming, is one that goes toward forgetting, then what exactly is so painful about the woman's question which, as I said, betrays forgetfulness? One answer might be that, precisely, it betrays forgetful- ness, that is, it is a reminder of what one wants to forget, whereas forgetting only works when one forgets that one is forgetting. But there is, perhaps, another hint in the poem of what is so painful in this woman's happy or mocking question. Since it is said that the two states - pain and joy, but also remembering and forgetting - are linked by the fact of their being 'éclatante pour tous' (obvious for everyone), there may be as well a</page><page sequence="10">84 Paragraph veiled reproach in this image of indiscriminate jouissance made available or promised to anyone.14 These two motifs of reproach that fuel the repetition of 'taisez- vous, taisez- vous' can moreover be joined if one understands the woman's question as betraying her lack of memory and therefore the likelihood of her future infidelity. The mensonge italicized in the last stanza would be a lie, then, about the woman's memory. Specifically, it covers over her forgetfulness that always threatens to give the Poet a preview of his own death or an advance taste of his own disappearance for the other, in the eyes of the other. In this poem, woman is silenced in order to sustain the lie which her speech too quickly undermines. No sooner does she open her mouth than the poet is reminded of the world of others to which she belongs by her speech, almost as if she had spoken only in order to welcome a wild throng of partygoers into the privacy of their lovers' chamber. The intrusion, however, comes not from others so much as from the otherness of the woman that speaks a separation of their voices, their memories, their bodies and their deaths.15 It is this separation, this difference and this otherness that the lie is called upon to dissimulate, although obviously it cannot do so very satisfactorily. The italics situate both an emphatic will to override or faire taire difference and, by a gesture that has to call attention to itself, a reminder of precisely the difference and the death the Poet wants to forget. If one were to plot further this conjunction of lying, memory, the Poet's death and woman, a point adjacent to 'Semper Eadem' would have to be the poem entitled 'L'Amour du mensonge' (The Love of Lying), where all of these terms are laid out in a similar way.16 Since, however, it contains no explicit instance of a feminine figure made to speak and/or be quiet, the latter poem risks diverting us from our primary concern in these pages.17 Still, two of this poem's metaphors can provide a brief but useful transition from the unsatisfying suppression of feminine speech in 'Semper Eadem' to the unsilencing of feminine voice in Baudelaire at which we are trying to arrive. The first of these concerns the woman's eyes which may or may not be reliable indicators of that most prized attribute: her memory. In the next to last stanza, the Poet concedes that even the most melancholic eyes may deceive in that they in fact conceal no precious secrets and can thus be compared to 'médaillons sans reliques' (1. 19) (lockets without relics). This image makes explicit the two senses of memory that were already crossing and getting confused in 'Semper Eadem'. The souvenir locket meant to keep safe relics of the dead - a miniature portrait, a lock of hair - figures at once the faculty of memory and that which memory</page><page sequence="11">Baudelaire au féminin 85 remembers or, as we tend to say, contains. It is her memory of him, his memory in her, a pocket of internalization but worn on the outside as a reminder of her memory of him, his memory in her - an external reminder to interiorize the other, to keep him alive in memory, to keep his memory alive. That the locket may be purely decorative, containing nothing of significance, that 'médaillons' and 'reliques' remain dissoci- able within the very metonymy that associates them, leads the poet once again to embrace rather unconvincingly the lie with which metaphor promises a more reassuring assimilation of one term by the other. As in 'Semper Eadem', eyes as pure appearance, silent melancholic eyes are thus preferred to any knowledge of what those eyes may or may not conceal. This knowledge, which could only come from opening the locket and gaining access to the woman's memory, would require that she first open her mouth; that is, it requires that she be desired to speak and desired as speaking rather than just appearing. But this poem, which concludes with the line 'Masque ou décor, greetings! J'adore ta beauté' (Mask or decoration, greetings! I adore your beauty), has silenced even the silencing which installs the theatre of feminine decoration. Yet an earlier line in the poem will have already warned the reader not to take this final cavalier dismissal of uncertainty too seriously.18 It occurs in the fourth stanza which poses a series of metaphors for the figure of woman's memory, the faculty of containing and holding the Poet's memory. One of these metaphors, more than the rest, brings out the container/contained topos of dissociable difference and, in effect, bars the flight into self-delusion which the Poet seems so eager to take. The line asks: 'Es-tu vase funèbre attendant quelques pleurs' (1. 14) (Are you a funeral urn waiting for some tears), a question which, because it asks about a future, promptly leaves the realm of truth or lying conceived as a system of correspondences or signs. It asks in effect: 'Will you hold my memory', and it is thus the sort of question that cannot be answered by a corresponding yes or no but only by a promise. Both 'Semper Eadem' and 'L'Amour du mensonge' suppress, in different ways, the other voicê which at the same time they call up or call for. Each concludes with an attempt to cover over or dismiss the difference which has been evoked, yet neither can do so satisfactorily. But 'L'Amour du mensonge', at least, leaves room in its margin for the feminine addressee to speak in a way - the promise - that may not fall back immediately onto the stage of appearances. What of this other voice which is not to be heard even if the Poet's own voice can be heard calling for it? If one looks elsewhere in Les Fleurs du mal for promising women's</page><page sequence="12">86 Paragraph voices, the most insistent examples are negative either because they are threats rather than promises, such as the vows made by mother and mistress in 'Bénédiction' to humiliate and destroy the Poet, or else because they are empty or even false promises. This latter category would be headed by the Siren-like promises in 'Les Métamorphoses du vampire' (The Metamorphoses of the Vampire) spoken by the vampire-woman who, once she has had her fill of lovemaking, appears first as 'une outre (. . .) pleine de pus' (a bag full of pus), and next as 'des debris de squelette' (a pile of bones). It may be, however, that it is not so much to a promise made in the poem that one has to be attentive, but precisely to that which no poem can represent of itself: the promise to keep the poem's voice in memory and to keep giving it voice. Voices represented, attributed or assumed in the poem can, in the best of cases, give one to hear or understand - in French, elles laisseraient entendre- the absent voice, the absence in the voice marking the place of the promise, and the place of the other. One late poem from 'Les Epaves' puts a promise in its title: 'Les Promesses d'un visage' (The Promises of a Face). It is, I believe, one of the least noticed of any poem now figuring in the complete works. (I have one or two ideas as to why this may be so, which I'll get to in conclusion.) Most of its twenty lines are speech attributed to a woman's eyes, according to a familiar prosopopoeia. Although this device seems to situate the poem steadfastly in the realm of promising appearances which may always be deceiving, there is - how to say it? - a ring of truth to these promises that moves the composition closer to the edge of the visible stage and to what might be called off-voice, to the other who has yet to enter or has already left the theatrical realm of the visible. J'aime, ô pâle beauté, tes sourcils surbaissés, D'où semblent couler des ténèbres; Tes yeux, quoique très noirs, m'inspirent des pensers Qui ne sont pas du tout funèbres. Tes yeux, qui sont d'accord avec tes noirs cheveux, Avec ta crinière élastique, Tes yeux, languissamment, me disent: 'Si tu veux, Amant de la muse plastique, 'Suivre l'espoir qu'en toi nous avons excité, Et tous les goûts que tu professes, Tu pourras constater notre véracité Depuis le nombril jusqu'aux fesses;</page><page sequence="13">Baudelaire au féminin 87 'Tu trouveras au bout de deux beaux seins bien lourds, Deux larges médailles de bronze, Et sous un ventre uni, doux comme du velours, Bistré comme la peau d'un bonze, 'Une riche toison qui, vraiment, est la sœur De cette énorme chevelure, Souple et frisée, et qui t'égale en épaisseur, Nuit sans étoiles, Nuit obscure!' (I love, pale beauty, your lowered eyebrows, From which shadows seem to flow; Your eyes, although very black, inspire me with thoughts That are not in the least funereal. Your eyes, which agree with your black hair, With your elastic mane, Your eyes, languidly, say to me: 'If you want, O lover of the plastic muse, To pursue the hope that we have aroused in you, And all the tastes that you profess, You can certify our veracity Between the navel and the thighs; 'You will find at the end of two fine heavy breasts, Two large medals of bronze, And beneath a smooth belly, soft as velvet, Brown as the skin of a buddha, 'A rich fleece which, in truth, is the sister Of that enormous head of hair, Supple and curly, and which is your equal for denseness, Starless night, obscure Night!') The composition, all in black, sets out from the shadows of lowered eyebrows19 and moves to the eyes which, 'quoique très noirs, m'inspirent des pensers/Qui ne sont pas du tout funèbres'. This initial conjunction of shadowy eyebrows and dark eyes states the non-funereal principle that will be repeated several times: an accord or agreement which owes nothing either to metaphorical resemblance or to a metonymy of container/contained. These eyes are not windows into some interiority and thus they do not evoke a lost time or a hidden place. They are rather nothing more (nor less) than points of articulation on a differentiated</page><page sequence="14">88 Paragraph surface which is not a surface covering or hiding something else. The principle of simple accord is stated directly in the second stanza which also transfers voice to the eyes: Tes yeux, qui sont d'accord avec tes noirs cheveux, Avec ta crinière élastique, Tes yeux, languissamment, me disent: What these eyes will call their 'véracité' is nothing other than the posing side by side of different features without any claims made about their sense in some larger signifying whole. No relations of signification are claimed to exist between any of the parts: both the metaphoric and métonymie principles, resemblance and contiguity, have been emptied of their sense-making potential. If these eyes promise, then, they do not promise a future meaning. They promise, rather, only to go on promising. The prosopopoeia, that is, the eyes' speech, begins: (. . .) 'Si tu veux, Amant de la muse plastique, 'Suivre l'espoir qu'en toi nous avons excité, Et tous les goûts que tu professes, Tu pourras constater notre véracité Depuis le nombril jusqu'aux fesses' The relation between the eyes and the lower torso is articulated here like a sign: the one pointing to the other and arousing an expectation. The expectation is answered, however, in a markedly circular form: 'Tu pourras constater notre véracité/Depuis le nombril jusqu'aux fesses'. If the eyes can be said to point to- or promise - the lower torso, then it is because the lower torso points to the eyes' veracity in appearing to point to the torso and so forth. Each feature promises the other with a kind of redundancy that is perfectly stable because it keeps turning in a circle.20 Other features can be brought into the picture in the next stanza without substantially altering this pattern. Only the final two lines seem to make a gesture off in another direction: 'Tu trouveras (. . .) Une riche toison qui, vraiment, est la sœur De cette énorme chevelure, Souple et frisée, et qui t'égale en épaisseur, Nuit sans étoiles, Nuit obscure.' Do these last lines promise an equivalent or a substitute for the depth of</page><page sequence="15">Baudelaire au féminin 89 night? If so, then the eyes' speech breaks with its own principles of veracity, its pattern of non-substitution and non-totalization. It would thereby come very close to repeating the sort of promise made by the vampire before she undergoes her metamorphoses. She says: 'Je remplace, pour qui me voit nue et sans voiles, /La lune, le soleil, le ciel et les étoiles.' (For whoever sees me naked and without my veils, I take the place of/The moon, the sun, the sky and the stars.) 'Les Promesses d'un visage' may, that is, be hiding another face of the vampire. One detail of these concluding lines we have yet to mention. At the same moment at which the eyes' discourse falls into promising the moon and the stars, so to speak, it also turns to address the dark night: 'et qui i'égale en épaisseur, /Nuit sans étoiles, Nuit obscure!' What difference, if any, does this detail of address make in the promising structure of the poem? The answer to that question, it seems to me, lies in a deep fold along which the poem opens and closes like a mouth or an eye, its two lips or lids joining and parting. The final apostrophe to dark night is spoken by the dark eyes which are themselves made to speak by apostrophe to and prosopopoeia of darkness. The final apostrophe restates the initial one, the poem's lower edge meets and joins its upper one in a circulation for which there is no end in sight and no promise of final meaning. Specifically, it cannot be said that the poem's initial voice, attributed to the poet, contains or encloses the other voice, attributed to a woman's eyes. Rather, the meeting or joining of the two voices makes of each the other's container and contained. Each holds the memory of the other and promises its return. This is its ring of truth. But I promised some accounting for why this poem has been passed over by critical notice.21 1 am tempted at least to wonder whether readers have not always sensed something distinctly un-Baudelairean, so to speak, in the voice that, once invoked, takes over the poem. I am thinking of what could be called its flatness, the fact that it remains on the surface and exposes the superficial relation not only of the signs it speaks but of the very sign which it is supposed to be by the Poet's address. This flatness is something quite different from the depth of those eyes in 'L'Amour du mensonge' which may be 'plus vides, plus profonds que vous-mêmes, ô Cieux' (emptier, deeper than yourselves, O Heavens). In 'Les Promesses d'un visage', the transcendent, celestial backdrop drops away and with it the promise of metaphor's final revelation, its corps mis à nu. And this despite the central topos of the strip-tease which has been not so much turned inside out as turned back on the spectator, mocking the 'Amant de</page><page sequence="16">90 Paragraph la muse plastique'. There is, moreover, a mocking tone to be heard in the distinctly prosaic line 'Tu pourras constater notre véracité', as well as in the interjected 'vraiment', a mocking that aims at the Poet's predilection for the lie of metaphor, for women who are like decorative souvenir lockets, or for eyes whose dark depth seems to promise that of night. When this very Baudelairean figure is invoked, therefore, in the last lines, has it not been taken over and exposed in its turn as a lie imposed by a willing blindness? And thus, is it even possible still to hear it in Baudelaire's 'own' voice? Some may, of course, want to make these questions go away, and along with them the non-interiorized other who, I am suggesting, has somehow managed to get out in this poem. One may, that is, want to conclude that the mockery is simply self-inflicted or calculated and thus recuperable to what is being mocked. To do so, however, would be to seal off Baudelaire's signature, to make it finally, for us, today, unreadable. If, on the other hand, it is precisely the recuperative or totalizing power of any one voice that has been given the lie in this poem, then an opening still remains and a chance for readdress, even - who knows? - for redress. In the end, this belying effect cannot be made in any simple sense internal to the lie's calculation. Some other voice will have had its say in 'Les Promesses d'un visage'. How, then, can one say of this other voice, as I have, that it promises a return, that it lends to the poem its ring of truth? Is there not a contradiction of the one configuration by the other, of the circular return by the deviation imposed or inflicted on the same by the other? Or perhaps this is a circle whose only sense can come from the opening onto the sense of the other, the sharing of voice? This, finally, will have been the question that divides us but that is also our lot and our share.

This and all further translations are the author's own. The translations of Baudelaire that follow are meant only to give the non-French reading reader a sense of the rhetorical patterns which provide the focus of the readings proposed here. The specificity of these patterns tends to disappear in more 'poetic' renderings, such as Richard Howard's recent translation of Les Fleurs du mal.</page><page sequence="17">Baudelaire au féminin 91 2 The Rhetoric of Romanticism (New York, Columbia University Press, 1984), p. 70. 3 Le Partage des voix (Pans, Galilee, 1982), pp. 39-40. 4 For the expression autobiography or the other , see The Ear of the Other: Otobiography, Transference, Translation : Texts and Discussion with Jacques Derrida (New York, Schocken Books, 1985). 5 Quoted by the editor in Œuvres Complètes I (Paris, Pléiade, 1975), p. 948. 6 If indeed this is Pichois's point, it is not particularly well-taken about 'Sonnet d'automne' where a question put to the poet is put off because it is too probing rather than too stupid. The note would have been better placed in appendix to the 'Taisez-vous!' of 'Semper Eadem' which is discussed below. 7 'Apostrophes are embarrassing', writes Jonathan Culler in his 'Reading Lyric' ( Yale French Studies 69 (1985), p. 99), an article that is very helpful in elucidating Paul de Man's reflections on Baudelaire's lyric in 'Anthropo- morphism and Trope in the Lyric' (in The Rhetoric of Romanticism). De Man also notes the embarrassment of apostrophe when he remarks about the opening stanza of 'Obsession': 'We are all frightened by windy woods but do not generally make a spectacle of ourselves talking to trees' (p. 25 5). Culler, particularly, suggests that absurdity or embarrassment may help explain why apostrophe is so often neglected by readers, leaving relatively untouched its trope of anthropomorphism whose workings de Man is concerned to lay out. The point, however, would be that anthropomorphism is better hidden but no less at work when apostrophe seems 'reasonable', when, that is, it is another talking creature, rather than woods, that is being addressed. Indeed, the violence that may be implied or entailed is all the more effective by appearing 'reasonable'. 8 The initial reporter in the 1856 journal article, Raymond de Breilh, betrays what may be itself a kind of naïve understanding of Jeanne's naïve - or at least unformulated - understanding. When he writes that 'la dame ne trouve pas le régime à son goût', his language suggests that this situation of address is to be compared to a forced feeding. The metaphor may even have prompted the use of the epithet 'goose' which, besides having connotations of silliness and femininity (is it because geese are monogamous?), is also regularly forced in the French countryside to undergo gavage or forced feeding. In any case, the image of the violent or at least unwelcome address implies a kind of interiorization when it likens listening (or reading) to eating. Although it's too early to judge, it may be that such a comparison to a kind of interiorization is telling more than it means to say about a certain violence of address. 9 Poétique 3 (1970), p. 338. 10 This is the first and will be the last time in Les Fleurs du mal that the word 'mère' (mother) is employed in its primary, biological sense. Silences, of course, can also be resounding. ii Might this explain why, for example, one could propose to speak of 'dialogue' in Baudelaire and then be forced to recognize that one of the</page><page sequence="18">92 Paragraph dialogue's 'interlocutors' is almost always silent? In 'Dialogue in Baude- laire's Poetic Universe', Russell S. King does just that when he writes: 'Dialogue (. . .) is here defined as that portion of a poem contained between inverted commas, representing the conversational element. Usually only the addresser's speech is present, with the addressee remaining silent' (Esprit Créateur 13, 2 (1973), p. 115). 1 2 'Elle est dans ma voix' might also be called a parasitical prosopopoeia since, instead of lending voice to the figure of Irony, voice is here infiltrated and taken over by Irony. 13 Consider, for example, the poem 'Confession' about which Jean Prévost remarks: 'C'est à peu près la seule fois, dans toute l'œuvre de Baudelaire, que la femme aimée est traitée en être pensant' ( Baudelaire , Paris, Mercure de France, p. 205) (This is about the only time, in Baudelaire's entire opus, that the beloved woman is treated as a thinking creature). The poem stages the scene of a courtesan (Mme de Sabatier is usually taken as the model for the poem), confessing to the poet a despair that, as a woman of the world, she must keep hidden. The eleven lines of this confession are between inverted commas and this speech is specifically attributed to her voice (rather than to her eyes, for example), more precisely to a dissonant note in her voice. Yet the syntax of the quoted lines indicates indirect rather than direct discourse and thus effects a curious mixing of reporting and reported voices, of addresser and addressee: 'Pauvre ange, elle chantait, votre note criarde:/ " Que rien ici-bas n'est certain, /Et que toujours (. . .) etc.'" (Poor dear, your grating note sang: ' That nothing here below is certain, /And that always (...) etc.'). 14 Besides some thematic parallels with 'Semper Eadem', the poem 'A Celle qui est trop gaie' (To She Who is Too Gay) suggests yet another displacement of the laughing, mocking mouth to 'ces lèvres nouvelles/Plus éclatantes et plus belles' (these novel lips/More striking and more beautiful), that the Poet dreams of opening in the woman's flank. 15 See Deguy, op. cit., for a superb reading of 'La Mort des amants' (Death of the Lovers), a poem which fantasizes the simultaneous death of the lovers. 1 6 The fact that the two poems were first published together in the same issue of a journal (Revue Contemporaine , 15 mai i860), before they were both included in the second, 1861 edition of Les Fleurs du Mal&gt; could suggest a renvoi between the mensonge in the one and the other. 17 A more detailed reading or this poem would have to begin by correcting a frequent misreading of the lie which is to be sustained. This is not the lie of the woman's beauty in spite of her age. If anything, it is precisely the contrary that is asserted by the poem since the suggestions of her maturity alone can offer an apparent support for the desired illusion of her memory - 'Le souvenir massif' (1. 10) (Massive memory) which is said to crown her. Baudelaire, in fact, may have been the first misreader of his poem since the initial published version carried an epigraph from Athalie , which later disappeared and which pointed to age as what had to be dissimulated:</page><page sequence="19">Baudelaire au féminin 93 'Même, elle avait encor cet éclat emprunté/Dont elle eut soin de peindre et d'orner son visage/Pour réparer des ans l'irréparable outrage' (She even had still that borrowed bloom/With which she was careful to paint and decorate her face/So as to repair the irreparable outrage of time). 1 8 Prévost, op. cit., p. 219. 19 These 'sourcils surbaissés' led George Heard Hamilton to wonder whether Baudelaire's 'pâle beauté' was not also Manet's 'Chanteuse des rues', since when it was first exhibited in Paris in 1863, the painting drew hoots from one critic because of what he took to be eyebrows on either side of the bridge of the figure's nose. See Manet and His Critics (New York, Norton, 1969) p. 40, n. 4. 20 In his reading of 'Correspondances', Paul de Man isolates a breakdown of metaphor around another kind of redundant repetition or circularity (op. cit., pp. 247-52). 21 Only Jean Prévost, as far as I have been able to determine, has given any sustained attention to this poem and then only in order to dismiss it as sournois . His commentary is but one paragraph and it makes no secret of his eagerness to forget what he has read: 'Ce poème sournois, aigu, expertise gourmande, attente impatiente du déshabillage, cherche en vain, au dernier vers, à relever notre contemplation vers la 'nuit sans étoile, nuit obscure'; la sensualité reste maîtresse; la gaieté ne masque pas le trouble du libertinage. Cette suite d'insinuations vives n'est qu'un chef-d'oeuvre d'érotisme. Nous ne sommes pas assez purs pour aimer ce poème; en le quittant, notre émotion trouble bourdonne encore. Prions ensuite qu'on nous dise les Bijoux : notre émotion gardera le mouvement calme des oiseaux planeurs' (op. cit., p. 285). (This crafty, shrill poem with its refined gluttony and its impatient anticipation of undressing vainly seeks in the last line to raise our thoughts up towards the 'starless night, obscure night'; sensuality remains in control, the gaity cannot mask the uneasiness of the libertine. This series of vivid insinuations is nothing but a masterpiece of eroticism. We are not pure enough to appreciate this poem. As we leave it, our uneasy emotions are still buzzing. We want nothing so much then as to hear 'Les Bijoux' so that our feelings might return to the calm movement of soaring birds.)</page></plain_text>
