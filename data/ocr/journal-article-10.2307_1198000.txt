<plain_text><page sequence="1">CRITICAL REVIEWS is here, or will come-all are true, each in its own sense. The New Testament knows that God's victory is sure and sometimes dates that victory in the cross, sometimes in a coming age. From the point of view of these writers, there is no contradiction. There are numerous tensions between the various ideas of the different au- thors, and these tensions exist even in the phrases of the same author, but there remains a striking unity in the main underlying ideas, and this unity is, after all, what has given the New Testament its unique worth. JOHN W. BEARDSLEE, JR. New Brunswick Thelogical Seminary Prayer in the Apocrypha and Pseudepigrapha: A Study of the Jewish Concept of God. By NORMAN B. JOHNSON. Philadelphia: Society of Biblical Literature and Exegesis, I948. 77 pages. $i.oo. A man's prayers uncover his beliefs! Some such assumption forms the basis of this careful review of the prayers in the Old Testament Apocrypha and Pseudepigrapha. By this "in- direct approach to theology ... we catch a man off guard," and, without the distortion of con- scious consistency, his prayers reveal what char- acter he assigns to God. The author pursues three lines of inquiry: (i) What do the Jews pray for? (2) What inducements do they offer God to grant the petitions? (3) What response do they expect from God? The discussion of each section includes a citation of Old Testa- ment usage and a reference to New Testament or rabbinic prayers as abutments for the inter- testamental bridge. I. The aims and objects of Jewish prayer in this period are found to cover a wide range, from help in time of war through the supply of daily needs to righteousness and pure praise. Each goal reflects some aspects of the character of God. 2. Many readers will be startled to see listed among the "Means of Inducing God To Heed the Prayers" "The Appeal to God's Bargaining Instinct" and "An Appeal to God's Love of the Beautiful." And a greater question may be raised as to whether Jesus in Matt. 6:15 recom- mended forgiveness of men as a "reasonable way of gaining [?] forgiveness" from God. 3. Prayers in this period found response in voices, angelic visitation, dreams, or direct ful- filment. The audible voice response suggests an anthropomorphic idea of God, the angelic re- sponse a transcendent God, the dream response a God near at hand. A direct response exerts less control on the concept of God in relation to the world. In drawing his conclusions, the author recog- nizes the range and inconsistency in the Jewish thought about God, and he is content to outline the broader bases of belief. He is aware also of the fact that beyond the record the actual prac- tice of prayer was a living experience of the Jewish people. The deductive method of this monograph yields important results for the Jewish concept of God. The method has been put to very lim- ited use in discovering Jesus' vivid experience of God or the New Testament sense of God's act in the coming of the Kingdom. PAUL E. DAVIES McCormick Theological Seminary Sublimation. By J. TREVOR DAVIES. New York. Macmillan Co., I947. I48 pages. $1.75. Can thwarted persons be both ethical and healthy through sublimation? Dr. Davies surveys various views and con- cludes that neither free expression nor depres- sion is necessary. Inhibition-in other words, suppression or conscious control-is possible and harmless up to a certain point, depending upon the soundness of the individual. Deflec- tion of energy is possible too; deflection into activities that satisfy not only particular in- stincts but the whole self. People must inhibit some instincts at times, and they should deflect the energy into morally desirable, beneficial ac- tivities. In Davies' view, sublimation is such diver- sion of instinctive energy (not more libido) into higher and socially useful processes. It is effect- ed by objective values, through man's devotion to them. Moreover, sublimation may be con- sciously directed; and it may be applied not merely to man's surplus emotional energy but to all his instinctive energy. Thus sublimation is more than a safety valve for superfluous energy. It is also more than a "second-best way." Sub- limation is "as natural as the direct gratification of the instinct"; art, music, learning, and reli- 317</page></plain_text>
