Writing in 1 884 to  Violet Paget ( "Vernon Lee" ), he praises the success of her essay "The  Portrait Art of the Renaissance, " but his attention remains on his own  endeavors. '  "It is not easy, " he protests (and the plaintive emphasis  is his )  to do what you have done . . .- to make, viz. intellectual theorems seem  like the life's essence of the concrete, sensuous objects, from which they  have been abstracted. I always welcome this evidence of intellectual  structure in a poetic or imaginative piece of criticism, as I think it is a  very rare thing, and it is also an effect I have myself endeavored after,  and so come to know its difficulties.  Though Pater is speaking of his "imaginative criticism" here, he en­ deavored after the same effect in his historical fiction. He grants  priority to concrete, sensuous objects from which "intellectual theo­ rems" are abstracted; the "difficulties" of this sort of composition lie  in the effort to reverse the process of abstraction, to reconstruct the  object from the idea of the object, or historical novelty from an "intel­ lectual structure.

Still praising her  essay, he explains that he finds in it  not merely historic learning dominated by ideas, which is certainly a  good thing; but ideas gathering themselves a visible presence out of  historic fact, which to me, at least, is a far more interesting thing.  Through the "medium" of the transparent hero, whose consciousness  filters and transmits the "historic learning" of his day, Pater manages  to represent "ideas gathering themselves a visible presence out of  historic fact. " Here again, for aesthetic historicism, the crucial con­ cept is the representation of historicity, not "fact. /1 Concretion, not  factual accuracy, creates the sense of "visible presence. "   Just as some of Marius's "sensations and ideas /1 deal more fully with  the thoughts suggested by the "Conclusion, " so does the form of  Marius the Epicurean deal more fully with problems of historical  representation raised in The Renaissance. In particular, Marius the  Epicurean works out an interesting compromise between "historical  novelty" and mythic repetition. On the one hand, Marius's cultural  surroundings are presented in vivid detail and endowed with all the  historical specificity of unique, unrepeatable phenomena. The novel  carefully offers a "realistic" representation of historicity-one partic­ ular consciousness and life history specified to the cultural surround­ ings of the second century. But on the other hand, the cultural institu­ tions, the other characters, and the literature Marius encounters are  portrayed as types, invested with ideal value, and seen to represent  second-century instances of forms that are repeated over time. This  tendency to find the typical value of past historical phenomena is  represented by the retrospective narrator of the novel, who looks back  at Marius's age from a vantage point in the late nineteenth century.  Thus, the narrative structure of this novel expresses the tension  between "historical novelty" and typicality. The narrator's emphasis  on analogy produces the paradoxical effect of simultaneously asserting  and denying historical difference. From Marius's point of view, one  thing leads to another, and development is made to seem a matter of  2. Monsman calls attention to the resemblance and continuity between Pater's aes­ thetic and philosophical criticism and his imaginary portraits. See Gerald Monsman,  "Pater's Aesthetic Hero, " University of Toronto Quarterly 40 (Winter 1 97 1 1, 1 44; and  idem, Pater's Portraits (Baltimore, Md. : Johns Hopkins University Press, 1 967 1, pp. 3 1- 40.  </page> <page sequence="3"> Historical Novelty and Marius the Epicurean · 1 7 1  ·  change as much as continuity. But the narrator's point of view works  to familiarize the difference of the second century, to mediate Marius's  "sensations and ideas, " to conflate past and present through analogical  comprehension. Pater's figure for change in time (the developmental  series) may here be seen to span the representational potentials of  historicism: to read the figure "forward" through its linearity throws  the emphasis on the difference between elements in the series,  whereas retrospectively to read the figure in its totality throws the  emphasis on the unity of development. In the latter sense, each ele­ ment in the series becomes an instance or manifestation of the  "same, " overarching thing. The form of Marius the Epicurean balances  these claims of difference and recognition. Through Marius's life story  we read forward along the developmental line, but at the same time  the perspective of the narrator gathers all past time into the place  of present retrospection, the repository (or place of repose) for the  multitudinousness of past forms.  The narrative structure of Marius the Epicurean presents another  example of Pater's complex figure of relief for our examination. In a  sense characteristic of the historical novel, Marius is poised as a  central figure against the background of his second-century historical  milieu. But because of Pater's emphasis on the dynamics of internal­ ization, the reverse is also true : second-century figures have been  placed against the background of Marius's receptive consciousness.  Then again, both Marius and his second-century context are staged  against the second-order background of the narrator in the late nine­ teenth century. The position of the narrator, then, becomes that retro­ spective, metafigural place of recontainment, the position from which  the historical figure against its background is transfigured, recontextu­ alized, thrown into relief against another ground, to become the com­ posite figure of aesthetic historicism.  As we have seen, Pater's interpretation of the historicity of myth  includes the notion that narrative form represents the past by imitat­ ing its spirit in a model or structure. In Marius we can see this principle  working on several levels at once. The form of the novel presents the  historical shift from paganism to the Christian era as a matter of  evanescent, extremely gradual change-change so gradual that it is  almost invisible at the time. It becomes graphically visible only from  the vastly different perspective of the nineteenth-century narrator.  Portraying the "secularization" of paganism as it gradually becomes  Christianity tends to relativize the late nineteenth-century crisis of  secularization by making it too merely one part of an ongoing develop­ ment. The historicist form of the novel figuratively places the different  </page> <page sequence="4"> • 1 72 • Historical Novelty and Marius the Epicurean  "spirits" of two different ages side by side, but in the end these turn  out to be merely different phases of the same, overarching spirit. The  novel begins with the strict premise of historical difference, but in the  end pre-Christian, Christian, and even post-Christian seem not so  different. In order to focus the ironies of a dialectical reversal whereby  Christian principles of historiography are used to explain the process  of secularization, I have interpreted the narrative structure of Marius  the Epicurean on the model of typological exegesis, highlighting Pa­ ter's debt to traditional Christian historicism while at the same time  showing how that system of interpretation has been transvalued and  secularized in its late nineteenth-century form.  In another sense Pater has written the romance of aesthetic histori­ cism. Marius's life story is the story of openness, sensitivity, affinity  for " all that is really lifegiving in the established order of things" (MS,  2 5  r ) . Thus Marius's "aesthetic" process of absorption and detachment  makes history in several ways. As an exemplary or typical figure,  Marius shows how the "time-spirit" comes to life in its concrete  representatives-in Marius's transition from paganism to Christian­ ity, for example. But Marius is particularly concerned not only with  religious ritual but also with the literature of his day. His reception  of that literature forms a major part of the plot, and the form of the  novel consequently becomes anthological, composite, and modern.  As the fragments of second-century literature are gathered up into a  new, comprehensive form-the narrative form of Marius the Epicu­ rean-they "appreciate, /1 or gain in aesthetic value, through the stag­ ing of their renewed reception later in historical time. Marius the  Epicurean represents the composite voice of Pater's essays, writ large,  as narrative form. Its depiction of historical change and re-collection  is his greatest essay in the poetics of revival.  I · The Transparent Hero  In July r 864, Pater read to the Old Mortality the earliest of his essays  that now remains to us, the beautiful "Diaphaneite. /1 He had recently  become a Fellow of Brasenose College, and in the next year he would  write of the differences between ancient and modern thought in his  essay on Coleridge. Three years remained before he published his  discussion of the differences between ancient and modern art in  </page> <page sequence="5"> The Transparent Hero • 1 7 3  ·  "Winckelmann, " and four years before the "Conclusion" first ap­ peared as the last paragraphs of "Poems by William Morris. '" Yet we  can see in "Diaphaneite" the preoccupations of these more familiar  essays taking shape. For the present study, "Diaphaneite" serves as  the "key-signature" of Pater's work, especially because the ideas  worked out in that essay are figuratively embodied as a person, as a  character, and as a character type. 2  Pater refers in the essay to this character's "clear crystal nature, "  and following Pater's lead Harold Bloom translates "Diaphaneite" as  "the Crystal Man" (MS, 2 5 3 ) . 3  This translation places the emphasis on  the several qualities of crystal that metaphorically allude to aesthetic  form: its clarity and complex symmetries, the process of pressure and  ascesis through which such form is realized (R, xi ), and the resulting  ethereal suggestion of spirit in material form. Pater twice wrote of  Dante (once comparing him to Plato) that in his work "the spiritual  attains the definite visibility of a crystal" (A, 2 1 2 ; PP, 1 3 5 ), 4  and it is  especially in this latter sense that the "crystal man" functions as a  historical representation, embodying Pater's belief that the spirit of  time attains visibility in the historical person. This translation high­ lights the way a life can be lived in the spirit of art. But to translate  "Diaphaneite" as "crystal man" emphasizes the character's solidity of  form, his relative visibility rather than his diaphanous or translucent  nature, with all its Coleridgean associations. 5  The paradoxical and  intermediate state of diaphaneity sets up a complex play of visibility  with invisibility, partial permeability with full transparency; and I  have chosen loosely to translate "diaphaneite" as "the transparent  hero" in order to throw the emphasis on the character's relative invisi­ bility and permeability and his attainment of a wistful, graceful efface­ ment in the service of historical change.  1 .  Dating of essays from Samuel Wright, A Bibliography of the Writings of Walter  H. Pater (New York: Garland, 1 97 5 ), pp. 1-5 .  2. Bloom, on the other hand, chooses "The Child in the House" as his "key­ signature, the largest clue to his work" (introduction to Selected Writings of Walter  Pater, ed. Harold Bloom [New York: Columbia University Press, 1982], p. 1 5 ,  n. 1 ) .  His  choice emphasizes the "aesthetic" aspect of Pater's dialectic, while mine emphasizes  his historicism.  3.

Monsman ( "Pater's Aesthetic Hero, " p. 143 )  points out that Pater uses the same  sentence in these two locations.  5 .  Ibid. I am indebted to this essay in several ways. Monsman mentions Coleridge's  metaphorical use of the crystal. He points out that Pater's "aesthetic hero" is a personi­ fication of the forces of history, a dramatic embodiment of "the Coleridgean (or German  Idealistic) theory of art, in which the perfect aesthetic object is defined as a balance  </page> <page sequence="6"> I ?4  · Historical Novelty and Marius the Epicurean  In this essay Pater describes a type of figure, a projection of certain  personal traits on the general level of historical culture. The aura of  generalization projected about this figure is in fact, responsible in part  for its formal "transparency, " for this type of figure embodies Pater's  ideal relations between an individual and his culture at any given time  and over time. Pater imagines that it could serve as the "basement" or  fundamental type in effecting historical "regeneration" (MS, 2 5 4 ) .  Thus  it is no surprise that it would serve (and this has been noted by other  critics of Pater) as the fundamental type in Pater's representations of  history. Recognizing in it the kernel of all Pater's " imaginary portraits, "  Gerald Monsman has called it "a sort of Ur-portrait, " and in another  context he associates the diaphanewith Pater's " aesthetic hero, " a char­ acter type that Pater will employ again and again in his fiction. 6 In dis­ cussing this figure, I want to treat not only its content ( that is, the traits  that are characteristic of the type) but also its form (its projection as a  type, the dynamics of its transparency) .  For "Diaphaneite" not only  portrays Pater's ideal " aesthetic" character type but also promulgates a  theory of characterization for his historical fiction.  As he will later do more fully in the Renaissance volume, Pater  works here to articulate a new, "modern" form of generality or typical­ ity. The essay opens with a meditation on the reception or recognition  of types. Some "types of character, " though they are "unworldly, " are  nevertheless traditionally recognized by "the world. "  Pater names the  saint, the artist, and the speculative thinker in this regard. The world  is predisposed to recognize them; it has /1 a place made ready for them  in its affections. "  Thus, this sort of type is "given"-individual in­ stances "fill up" the "place" given by preexistent "outlines"-but it  is "given" not absolutely but historically, "given" because it has  existed many times before. Furthermore, "to constitute one of these  categories, or types, a breadth and generality of character is required"  (MS, 247 ) .  In other words, Pater describes this type of character in  terms exactly like those he will use to describe "ancient thought" in  the essay on Coleridge and those he will use to describe classical  sculpture in the essay on Winckelmann. But " diaphaneite" is " another  type of character" (MS, 247 ) .   between noumenal and phenomenal" (pp. 143-44) .  And throughout the essay he  stresses  the typicality of Pater's hero.  6. Monsman, Pater's Portraits, p. xiv. In that argument, Monsman's search for  "mythic pattern" leads him to identify Diaphaneite with the Apollonian hero (see ibid.,  pp. xiv, 22, 203, 205 ,  207 ) .  However, in "Pater's Aesthetic Hero, " pp. 1 3 6-·5 1 ,  Monsman  associates Diaphaneite with the "religious hopefulness, " which indicated Pater's "con­ cession to Christianity" in Marius the Epicurean. In both cases, Diaphaneite is taken  to be the prefiguration of later figures.  </page> <page sequence="7"> The Transparent Hero · l 7 s ·  In "Winckelmann, " Pater distinguishes between ancient and mod­ ern art using the examples of Greek sculpture and the poetry of Robert  Browning. Greek sculpture represents "broad" and /1 general" types in  their "broad, central, incisive lines" (R, 2 1 3 , 2 1 6 ) .  For this art form,  "not the special situation, but the type, the general character of the  subject to be delineated, is all-important" (R, 2 l s ) . Furthermore, these  types are /1 given" ;  Greek sculpture "has to choose between a select  number of types intrinsically interesting-interesting, that is, inde­ pendently of any special situation into which they may be thrown"  (R, 2 l s ) . "It renounces the power of expression by lower or heightened  tones . . . . I t has no backgrounds . . . t o suggest and interpret a train of  feeling . . . . I t unveils man in the repose of his unchanging characteris- tics" (R, 2 1 2-1 3 ), and it does so through a process of abstraction or  purgation, ridding the aesthetic object of all particularity or detail  (R, 2 1 6 ) .  Modern art, on the other hand, is the art of accumulating  particularity and specific detail, the art of shading, of "lower or height­ ened tones, " the art of "foregrounds and backgrounds, " which repre­ sent the relativity of the object within special situations (R, 2 1 4-16 ) .   Yet like the object of Greek sculpture, the object of Browning's "poetry  of situations" also gains general value, but by another route.  The characters of Browning's poetry are not "given" types, for they  are themselves unremarkable, of little intrinsic interest. According to  Pater, Browning "accepts such a character, throws it into some situa­ tion . . . i n which for a moment it becomes ideal. In the poem entitled  Le Byron de nos fours, in his Dramatis Personae, we have a single  moment of passion thrown into relief after this exquisite fashion" (R,  2 1 4 ) .  In other words, Pater uses the figure of relief to describe the  means by which the modern object is represented in its unique con­ text, or "relatively, and under conditions . "  The aura of general value  is projected around such a character through the modern technique of  "throwing" it "into relief. " The process can work in reverse as well,  beginning with the general field and concentrating within it; in either  case, the result is the complex, modern figure composed of a figure  within its contextual ground. The modern poet, according to Pater,  attempts "to realise this situation, to define, in a chill and empty  atmosphere, the focus where rays, in themselves pale and impotent,  unite and begin to burn" (R, 2 1 4) .  This, of course, is the familiar  language of the "hard, gemlike flame" from the "Conclusion. "   It is the language Pater uses to describe Diaphaneite as well . The  type under discussion in that essay is "fine, " not broad. It relates  obliquely to the "established order of things, " and thus it is unrecog­ nizable by "the world. " Its transparency, in other words, is partly  </page> <page sequence="8"> · 1 7 6  · Historical Novelty and Marius the Epicurean  expressive of the fact that it is invisible within the world's lexicon of  types. In the spatial terms of Pater's figure, it fills up the "blanks"  between categories, rather than taking "places" the world has already  "made ready" in its affections, and thus it invisibly works to "trans­ mit" its influence to "every part" of the moral order:  It does not take the eye by breadth of colour; rather it is that fine edge of  light, where the elements of our moral nature refine themselves to the  burningpoint. It crosses rather thanfollows themaincurrent of theworld's  life. Theworldhasnosensefineenoughfor those evanescent shades, which  fill up the blanks between contrasted types of character-delicate provi­ sion in the organisation of the moral world for the transmission to every  part of it of the life quickened at single points ! For this nature there is no  place ready in its affections. This colourless, unclassified purity of life it  can neither use for its service, nor contemplate as an ideal. (MS, 248 )  The fact that it remains "unclassified" testifies to its aesthetic value,  for the world cannot "use" it, even for contemplation. 7  The metaphors  of focus and refinement make it clear that the diaphane is a "modem"  type, formed within but against the background of the world's recog­ nized "organisation. "  Its spiritual force is registered in its difference  from /1 the world, " for it "crosses" the main current, rather than follow­ ing it, /1 cutting obliquely" the established "order of things" (MS, 249 ) . 8  This type is refined and oblique, represented by an "edge" or a  " single point, " but by virtue of the paradoxes of Pater's characteriza­ tion it partakes of generality as well. Its "colourless, unclassified  7 .  Monsman ( "Pater's Aesthetic Hero, " p. 142 )  points out that this characteristic  serves to associate Pater's typical hero with the artists of the Renaissance, who "live  in a land where controversy has no breathing-place" and "refuse to be classified" (R,  27 ) .  I am pursuing the point that all Pater's types of "modernity" are set off against the  "given" types.  8 .  Possibly Pater remembers here Browning's portrait of Lazarus in "An Epistle . . .   of Karshish, " who is "at cross purposes" with the world after his return from the realm  of pure spirit (1. 1 5 8 ) :   He  holds on firmly to  some thread o f  life­ (It is the life to lead perforcedly)  Which runs across some vast distracting orb  Of glory on either side that meagre thread,  Which, conscious of, he must not enter yet­ The spiritual life around the earthly life :  The law of that is known to him as this,  His heart and brain move there, his feet stay here.  So is the man perplext with impulses  Sudden to start off crosswise, not straight on,  Proclaiming what is right and wrong across,  And not along, this black thread through the blaze-(11. 1 7 8-89)   </page> <page sequence="9"> The Transparent Hero • 1 77  •  purity of life" is the colorlessness of white light, "blank" to "the  world" but in reality composed of all colors . As Pater explains, there  are two very different ways of being "colourless, " which "the world"  easily confounds. Most of us are reduced to a "c olourless uninteresting  existence" by "the play of circumstances, " by the "pressing" of "our  collective life" upon us. But Diaphaneite is "neutralised, not by sup­ pression of gifts, but by just equipoise among them" (MS, 2 5 2 ) .  His  "colourlessness" is a sign of inclusiveness and balance : "here there is  a moral sexlessness, a kind of impotence, an ineffectual wholeness of  nature, yet with a divine beauty and significance of its own" (MS,  2 5 3 ). These very phrases are reproduced in "Winckelmann" to describe  the beauty of Greek sculpture, "the colourless unclassified purity of  life" to describe its Allgemeinheit or generality (R, 22 1 1 2 1 8 ) . 9  The transparent hero partakes of the "characterlessness" of Greek sculp­ ture as well as the very particularized character of Browning's modem  "poetry of situations. "   Pater's modem type, in other words, i s  synthetic, dialectically con­ stituted, displaying transvalued versions of the very qualities associ­ ated with its opposite, the ancient or classical types. This is especially  clear from the hindsight of "Coleridge" or "Winckelmann, " but it is  thematically quite explicit in "Diaphaneite" as well : "Such a charac­ ter is like a relic from the classical age, laid open by accident to our  alien modem atmosphere. It has something of the clear ring, the  eternal outline of the antique" (MS, 2 5 1 ) . This "outline, " usually  Pater's shorthand signal of the ancient, "given" type, is here used to  praise the transparent expressiveness of the diaphanous one, whose  "simplicity in purpose and act is a kind of determinate expression in  dextrous outline of one's personality. Such a simplicity is characteris­ tic of the repose of perfect intellectual culture" (MS, 249 ) .  In this way,  Pater signals that Diaphaneite is the successor to the value of Hellenic  Heiterkeit as well as Allgemeinheit, both in their synthetic, modern­ ized, transvalued forms.  The "transparency" or near-transparency of this character works in  several ways. In the first place, Diaphaneite is transparent to his own  interiority. In this sense, transparency functions as the metaphorical  foundation of Pater's romantic theory of individual expression. The  "life" of this character is like art in this particular sense: it is a clear  translation of what is inward.  9. On Pater's repetition of passages from "Diaphaneite" in the later essay, see  Francis X. Roellinger, "Intimations of Winckelmann in Pater's Diaphaneite, " English  Language Notes 2 (June 1 96 5 ), 277-82 .   </page> <page sequence="10"> 1 7 8  · Historical Novelty and Marius the Epicurean  The artist and he who has treated life in the spirit of art desires only to  be shown to the world as he really is; as he comes nearer and nearer to  perfection the veil of an outer life not simply expressive of the inward  becomes thinner and thinner. (MS, 249 )   Arnold's exhortation to  objectivity here again has been reassimilated  to the very romantic project he was attempting to combat. Pater  envisions the conventional, inexpressive "outer life" as occluding  matter which prevents pure expression; in his ideal type, this material  "veil" is becoming "thinner and thinner. " "There is an intellectual  triumph implied" in this defeat of the "adulterated atmosphere of the  world" (MS 249, 2 5 3 ) . For "the world" does not manage to impose its  conventional categories on this character, and as the "veil" becomes  thinner and thinner, this rare type comes closer to being recognized,  "shown to the world as he really is. "  But what is inward has quite clearly been internalized from what is  without. In this sense, transparency functions as the metaphorical  foundation of Pater's theory of historical expression. Pater is working  here on the dynamics of the reciprocal and analogous relation between  the individual and his historical "environment. " The diaphane draws  together Pater's aestheticism and his historicism in one unified theory  of expression. 10 On the one hand, the "order of things" in any given age  determines the content of this transparent character; but on the other  hand, certain "elements" in his nature magnetically attract certain ele­ ments in the age-and not others . His " diaphanous"  exterior metaphor­ ically signals a state of almost total permeability to the order of things .  But an active force of attraction allows for the character to have an ex­ tremely subtle shaping role in what it receives. For this reason, diapha­ neity (and not full transparency) is the apt metaphor. In this context  Pater spells out what might be called an ethics of internalization:  Its ethical result is an intellectual guilelessness, or integrity, that instinct­ ively prefers what is direct and clear, lest one's own confusion and int rans­ parency should hinder the transmission from without of light that is not  yet inward. . . . I t is just this sort of entire transparency of nature that lets  through unconsciously all that is really lifegiving in the established order  of things; it detects with out difficulty all sorts of affinities between its own  elements, and the nobler elements in that order. (MS, 2 s 1 )   Thus the diaphanous character is formed through an unconsciously  regulated receptivity, regulated by his "affinities" with the best that  IO. On Pater's theory of expression, see F .  C. McGrath, The Sensible Spirit (Tampa:  University of South Florida Press, 1986 ), pp. 1 84-2 14 .   </page> <page sequence="11"> The Transparent Hero · 1 79  •  has been thought and said in a certain "established order of things. "   His character i s  at once an accurate microcosm of the spirit of the age,  and yet it has been formed selectively. He has been totally passive to  the forces of his environment, and yet he has been "unconsciously"  active.  This paradoxical union of sheer passivity with "unconscious" activ­ ity is at the heart of this character's role in Pater's scheme of historical  representation. For he exerts an aesthetic, shaping force on the "estab­ lished order of things, " transmitting synchronically and diachroni­ cally-to his own age, and to future ages-only what is "really lifegiv­ ing. " And yet he performs this aesthetic function unconsciously, "in  the order of grace" (MS, 249 ) .  Thus Pater manages simultaneously to  imagine an individual power to shape the course of history, while at  the same time granting to the movements of the Zeitgeist an indepen­ dent and primary force. Pater's notion of diaphaneity defines the role  a cultured but otherwise unremarkable individual might play in the  vast movements of historical change. His activity is invisible, for it  consists in the internalization (and thus the transmission) of cultural  forces surrounding him. Like the "receptacles" of Pater's "Preface" to  The Renaissance, the transparent hero is the site of forces passing  through him, and thus this character type participates in Pater's revi­ sion of the notion of "content. "   He does not "make history" as the types recognized by "the  world"-kings, saints, artists-are conventionally understood to do,  but he does "make" history, for he selectively internalizes and trans­ mits what is "really lifegiving" in the "established order of things . "   Pater is involved in a paradoxical project : bringing into visibility the  important shaping function of a character who is by definition-by  the world's definition-invisible. His fundamental assumption is that  historical change has not taken place exactly in the way "the world"  would say. Thus we can see that the play of visibility and invisibility  set in motion by the figure of diaphaneity suggests a critique of con­ ventional historical retrospection. Through the character of Diapha­ neite, Pater considers not only the aesthetic shaping of history-in-the­ making, but also the retrospectively aesthetic procedures of history­ writing. In other words, through the character under discussion, Pater  works out a theory of historical fiction.  When he comes to embody Diaphaneite as Marius the Epicurean,  Pater manages to lend that character the full paradoxical blend of  visibility and invisibility to the retrospective eye . Pater's Marius is  not remembered in received historical records, yet he is personally  involved with the figures who are memorialized from his age. To this  </page> <page sequence="12"> • 1 80 • Historical Novelty and Marius the Epicurean  extent he is the typical protagonist of historical fiction, one of whose  generic premises is that it makes visible a portion of the past which  has become invisible within the scope of present memory. 1 1  This sort  of fiction purports to go "behind the scenes" of received history to  show the lives of unremembered characters who nevertheless had an  effect on the events of monumental history. But Pater's characteriza­ tion is particularly interesting in that the very sort of historical effi­ cacy imagined for Marius depends upon his near-invisibility from the  point of view of traditional history. Transmission of "what is really  lifegiving" in the "established order of things" is an activity that by  definition (here again, by the world's conventional definition) takes  place behind the scenes.  Marius becomes amanuensis to Marcus Aurelius, so he is fictively  responsible for the literal transmission of the emperor's words (as  he is in a less direct sense responsible for the transmission of the  anonymous Pervigilium Veneris, fictively attributed to Flavian in the  novel ) .  But his more important act of transmission is a more figurative  one. In a tour-de-force of passive activity, Marius becomes a Christian  at the end of the novel. That closing action is famously more done to  him than done by him. Marius's only real " activity" is to make himself  perfectly receptive to the forces of his age. He feels "all sorts of affini­ ties" for the new religion: he is attracted to Cornelius, the Christian  knight; and he has chosen to go to the church in Cecilia's house. But  at his death, "in the moments of his extreme helplessness, " he receives  the Host and is made a Christian, not exactly against his will, but  crucially without his will having been consulted (ME II, 224) .  After  his death the early Christians count him as a Christian martyr. Let us  say, then, that he is swept up in the most important historical change  taking place at the time. Thus, at his death Marius represents the  vast number of unremembered converts who made up a historical  "movement, " but more important, he represents the force of the time­ spirit moving through him into the Christian era. In both senses  his invisibility to traditional historical retrospection indicates the  "spiritual" nature of fundamental historical change.  In this regard, it is important to Pater's theory that the figure of  Marius represents a type, for this is one way of suggesting the represen­ tative spirit of an age, embodied in concrete but generalized form.  1 1 .  Lukacs makes the important point that the historical novel is characterized by  the typicality of its protagonist, as opposed to the "world-historical" figure ( in Hegel's  sense) .

Hannah and Stanley Mitchell (London:  Merlin Press, 1962 ), pp. 89- 1 3 8 .   </page> <page sequence="13"> The Transparent Hero · r 8 r  ·  Marius is imagined to be like many others of his age who are no longer  remembered, and thus he represents the vast number of cultured  individuals who invisibly accomplish the work of historical transmis­ sion. Pater's unspoken Hegelian assertion is that the real forces of  historical change are not the kings and warriors, or even the artists  and writers, but an invisible, spiritual force of which those persons  are merely the concrete representatives. 1 2 In the transparency of this  character, and his resultant invisibility to "the world, " lies his histori­ cal efficacy. His effectuality, in other words, depends precisely upon  his ineffectuality in the conventional sense.  The premise that a novel is recording the history of an unremarkable  character (or a remarkable character who is nevertheless not recog­ nized by the world for being remarkable) is a familiar technique of  literary realism. What is invisible to traditional history is made visible  in the novel's ordinary characters and actions. Pater takes this premise  of realism to its extreme (as George Eliot does in certain cases) by  delineating characters whose rarefied sensitivity indicates that great  forces are passing through them but whose very sensitivity at the  same time renders them passive. 1 3 Instead of pretending to actual  historicity, realism is based on the principle of analogy or typicality.  The realistic novel presents characters who are like many others, and  so it presumes to give detailed, individualized portraits of general  phenomena. 1 4 Pater alludes in "Diaphaneite" to the author of Romola  (MS, 249 ), and we might usefully compare Pater's representational  strategy here with George Eliot's paradoxical claim to write the history  of the very sort of character whose history, according to the usual  definition of "historical, " would always remain unwritten.  The "Finale" to Middlemarch tells us that the influence of Dorothea  Brooke was "incalculably diffusive" and that "the growing good of the  world is partly dependent on unhistoric acts, and . . . h alf owing to the  number who lived faithfully a hidden life, and rest in unvisited  1 2 .

"  Dorothea, too, is elaborately constructed as a type in the  "Prelude" to that novel. Diachronically she is compared to Saint  Theresa, and synchronically to all the other "later-born Theresas" of  her own age who were "helped by no coherent social faith and order  which could perform the function of knowledge for the ardently will­ ing soul . "  Like Pater, Eliot is concerned with the modern absence of  a "given" order, of received knowledge, of recognized types, and with  their replacement by relative ones. As it does in Pater, Eliot's move  out of a religious context and into a secular, historical context high­ lights the aesthetic value of her character's typicality, and in both  cases the secularization-effect is in part dependent on the fiction  that an invisible, spiritual phenomenon has been made visible. The  character of Pater's transparent hero, "like the religious life, . . . i s a  paradox in the world, " for it is precisely in the world, but not of it  (MS, 249 ) .   The paradoxical and fictive presumption to  represent what "in fact"  is invisible has particular implications for these writers ' views of  historical change. It signals their commitment to a gradualism so  extreme that at any present moment change cannot even be perceived.  Thus both Eliot and Pater are able to embrace change as a positive  value while at the same time maintaining a fundamental conserva­ tism. In "Diaphaneite, " for example, Pater conveys a complex attitude  toward historical change. On the one hand, he is wistfully conserva­ tive, remarking that "after all progress is a kind of violence" (MS, 2 5  2 ) .   The type in question may contribute to  the regeneration of the world  in part because it is "not disquieted by the desire for change" (248 ) .   But on the other hand, "its wistfulness and a confidence in perfection  . . . m akes it love the lords of change" (MS, 2 5 r ). "Also the type must  be one discontented with society as it is" (MS, 2 5 4 ) .   The contradiction in these attitudes is  resolved in a strategic and  paradoxical conception of historical change, made possible by the  passive activity of the transparent hero, for "in this nature revolution­ ism" is transvalued, "softened, harmonised, subdued as by distance"  (MS, 2 5 2 ) .  In Pater's view, change can be regenerative only if it is  "softened, " if it takes place "without any struggle at all" (MS, 249 ) .  When viewed through the present actions of this character, it is eva­ nescent, "inexpressible, " at any moment practically invisible. Taken  as a matter of faith, historical change does not impose its confusing  sense of difference in the present; it is always taking place so gradually  that it cannot be seen clearly and graphically except in retrospect. And  of course in retrospect it is effectively "subdued as by distance. "  The conclusion of Pater's essay looks forward to the future efficacy  </page> <page sequence="15"> The Transparent Hero · I 8 3 ·  of this character type, who represents a "natural prophecy of what  the next generation will appear" : "A majority of such would be the  regeneration of the world" (MS, 2 54 ) .  This idea of the future, envi­ sioned precisely as regeneration, is another sign of the value of conser­ vation in Pater's view of historical change. 1 5 It is a prophetic conserva­ tism like Carlyle's, which opens toward the future by passionately  transmitting the past. Here again, the notion that the Diaphaneite  is a character type becomes important, for its paradoxical blend of  unconscious self-consciousness reminds Pater at once of historical  revival and Platonic reminiscence:  It is like the reminiscence of a forgotten culture that once adorned the  mind; as if the mind of one &lt;l&gt;i.\.oao&lt;l&gt;fiaa&lt;; TToTTe μ,er'eTTwros- fallen into a  new cycle, were beginning its spiritual progress over again, but with a  certain power of anticipating its stages. (MS, 2 50)  In other words, it is the type, of Pater's poetics of revival. His  clear statement of metaphorical distinction keeps this character from  evanescing into the realm of mythic recurrence : it is merely "like"  reminiscence, "as if" fallen into an new cycle. But at the same time,  this passage reminds us that typicality can become a mode of mythic  characterization, within certain conditions . Later in Part Three I argue  that Pater manages in his historical fiction to balance historical speci­ ficity with spiritual or mythic recurrence. That balance is registered  in the dominance of a Christian, historical sense of the type over a  Platonic, allegorical sense. For now, however, it is important to see  this mythic tendency in the characterization of the hero. 1 6  In Pater's  historical fiction, the central character is more prone to lose the dis­ tinction of historical "novelty" than is the background within which  he is represented.  "Diaphaneite" articulates the theory of characterization which Pa­ ter practices in Marius the Epicurean . The hero of that novel is trans­ parent to his culture, the "medium" through which pass the voices of  his age. Invisible though Marius is to conventional history, Pater  envisions his central figure as most truly "nodus et vinculum mundi,  1 5 .

Monsman's first study of Pater's fiction, Pater's Portraits, emphasizes this impor­ tant element of "mythic pattern ."  Because he ties his notion of "pattern" to the specific  myths of Apollo and Dionysus, Monsman misses the full abstraction of Pater's tendency  in this direction. But my main difference from Monsman in this case is in seeing Pater's  attraction to mythic pattern as merely one pole of a dialectic, the other pole of which  is historical specificity-what I am calling in this chapter "historical novelty.

In Marius, Pater works out  a fictional form in which the central character becomes the pivot­ point of an elaborately recursive play with backgrounds and fore­ grounds .  1 7 Thus the fictional form of Marius the Epicurean is another  example of Pater's figure of relief. For in one sense the transparent  hero is represented in the foreground, and the reader sees through him  into the colorful multiplicity of the second century, but in another  sense the consciousness of Marius is the background against which  the panorama of the past is displayed. On the one hand, historical  specificity is defined in this novel as a matter of background, against  which Marius's consciousness is thrown into relief. But on the other  hand, Marius's consciousness is the background within which alone  the past can be transmitted and thus in retrospect revived or thrown  into relief. The elaborate working of this figure of relief on the level  of the novel's total form is only one of the important ways in which  Marius the Epicurean is a magisterial example of Pater's modern art  of aesthetic historicism.  2 · Autobiography of the Zeitgeist  The point has been made many times that the character of Marius  the Epicurean is a recognizable mask for Pater's own "epicurean"  sensibility. This particular connection of the character of Marius to  Pater himself is usually made in order to suggest a palinodic motive for  the composition of the novel. In 1 877 Pater dropped the "Conclusion"  from his second edition of The Renaissance, and when he restored it  to the third edition in 1 888, three years after the publication of Marius  the Epicurean, he added the following note of explanation:  This brief "Conclusion" was omitted in the second edition of this book,  as I conceived it might possibly mislead some of those young men into  whose hands it might fall. On the whole, I have thought it best to reprint  it here, with some slight changes which bring it closer to my original  1 7 .  Monsman makes a similar point and extends it generally to several of Pater's  "visionary texts" in his Walter Pater's Art of Autobiography (New Haven, Conn. :  Yale  University Press, 1 980) .  He calls attention to Pater's "multireflexive interplay between  inner and outer textual levels" and associates Pater's textual strategy with techniques  of postmodemism (pp. 48, s ) .  </page> <page sequence="17"> Autobiography of the Zeitgeist · 1 8 5  •  meaning. I have dealt more fully in Marius the Epicurean with the thoughts  suggested by it. (R, 2 3 3 )   The pretext of Marius was defensive, this argument runs-a defense  of Marius's pre-text, Pater's own Renaissance. When Lawrence Evans  calls Marius Pater's apologia pro vita sua, it is this specific sense of  its "autobiographical" valence to which he alludes. '   However, as I began this book by arguing, many of the "thoughts"  represented in the "Conclusion" are never owned by Pater in the first  place, but are carefully staged as an impersonation of "modern  thought. "  To bring these thoughts "closer to [his] original meaning" is  to distance themmoredefinitively. lnMarius theEpicurean, Patermore  decisively detaches himself from those "modern" thoughts by casting  them as the thoughts of a fictive, hypothetical persona. When ideas are  thus thrown into relief within the mind of a particular character in a  particular situation, they are relativized by their context. Like the epi­ graph from the Cratylus prefacing the "Conclusion, " Marius's extreme  distance in time from Pater's own age works to demonstrate that the  disturbingly "modern" thought of the nineteenth century had its ana­ logue in an ancient, venerable, and revered philosophical tradition.  The fictional plot of self-culture works to show what Marius thinks  of the thoughts he entertains, how provisionally ( though seriously) he  regards them, how he "holds his theories lightly, " as Pater says of  Plato (A, 69 ) .  Pater translates the Latin contextus as "clothed, " and  the temperamental coloring of Marius's character does indeed clothe  each system of thought he essays (ME II, 5 9 ) . Marius entertains sys­ tems of thought at the distance of speculation, not with the closeness  of identification we call belief. In other words, he uses them as "instru­ ments of criticism, " as guides along a journey of self-culture more  comprehensive than any of its separate, partial phases (R, 2 37 ) .  Like  Goethe's, his "proper instinct of self-culture"  struggles with [every divided form of culture] till its secret is won from  each, and then lets each fall back into its place, in the supreme, artistic  view of life. With a kind of passionate coldness such natures rejoice to  be away from and past their former selves. (R, 229 )   Even after his visionary moment of coming to a willed "conclusion, "  Marius wonders : "Would he be faithful to himself, to his own habits  of mind . . . i f he did but remain just there ?

(The other is that he  must "hold by what his eyes really saw. " )   But Marius the Epicurean is certainly not autobiographical in any  conventional sense of the word. The novel focuses so closely on the  "sensations and ideas" of its title character that it is almost possible  to forget that it is narrated by another "person."  A narrator occupies  the position of the first person, whereas Marius is described at the  figurative distance of the third. We read of "his" sensations and ideas  in long passages of free indirect discourse. The narrator is for the  most part recessive, an effaced background for Marius's feelings and  thoughts in the foreground. Marius's development seems to be seen  from the inside out, so to speak, even though the story is told in an  objective mode, as if from the outside in. 2  Through its representation  of the central character the novel seems introspective, and through  its representation of the narrator it seems retrospective, though these  two functions of traditional autobiography have been divided between  "persons. "  But how can we accurately speak of autobiography at all  when the novel is written in the third person? 3   The important sense in which Marius the Epicurean may be  usefully  called autobiographical is an effect of its narrative structure. A clue  lies in the fact that the narrator is not only distanced from but also  explicitly identified with Marius the Epicurean. He narrates this story  of second-century Rome from the great distance of a perspective in  late-nineteenth-century England, and yet when the narrator assumes  the foreground by taking on the personal pronoun "I, "  that narrator  frequently uses the occasion to draw analogies between Marius's age  and his own. "Let the reader pardon me if here and there I seem to be  passing from Marius to his modern representatives-from Rome to  Paris or London, " this narrator demurs, after offering the general re­ mark that Marius's "age and our own have much in common-many  difficulties and hopes" (ME II, 14 ) . 4  Analogies like these establish  similarity across the space of historical difference. They bind the  figures of Marius and his narrator together in a relation of mutual  reflection, for the narrator interprets Marius's age as not only analo­ gous to but also prefigurative of his own age.  2. See Inman's description of "the objective-subjective technique" whereby "he  always seemed to be writing about himself, even though he very rarely made a personal  reference or even expressed a personal opinion" (Billie Andrew Inman, Walter Pater's  Reading, [New York: Garland, 1 9 8 1 ], p. 5 8 ) .   3 .

But  because the narrator makes analogies between Marius's experiences  and his own contemporary conditions, second-century culture in gen­ eral is made to seem "formative" of later ages. Marius's individual  experiences, then, are made to represent structures of cultural experi­ ence that are recapitulated again and again over the course of the  centuries. The narrator has retrospective access to all ages of Western  history. He draws analogies not only between Marius's age and his  own, but between any of the "intervening" ages as well . Thus, from  the perspective of the narrator all the cultural practices from the pre­ Christian survivals of the religion of Numa to the late nineteenth  century are knit together in one continuous development. This narra­ tor "binds the ages each to each, " using a version of the modern,  historic method.  One of Pater's most interesting narrative choices is the construction  of this analogous, prefigurative, or evolutionary relation between the  central character and the narrator, and this relation is crucial to an  understanding of the novel . 5  The narrator mediates the otherness of  Marius by showing it to be essentially another, earlier stage of the  same overarching development in which he still participates. He looks  back, in other words, to an earlier period of his own cultural past. It  is as if Marius and the narrator were in relation to one another as  past and present phases of the same person, though the "person" in  question is not an individual person but an overarching personal figure  for Western culture in general.  This narrative presents a wonderful example of what Paul de Man  calls "specular structure. 11 6 In the figure of specularity, two subjects  "determine each other by mutual reflexive substitution. "  De Man  argues that this figure occurs to some degree in all texts, but that the  "specular structure is interiorized in a text in which the author de­ clares himself the subject of his own understanding, " in other words,  in a traditional, first-person autobiographical narrative.7 What we find  instead in Marius the Epicurean is the interesting example of a text  5 .

"  The author has not de­ clared himself the subject of his own understanding in the traditional  way, and yet the specular structure of Marius the Epicurean operates  to generate the effect of self-understanding across the supposed differ­ ence between narrator and protagonist.  Theory of autobiography has traditionally drawn this distinction  between "narrator" and "protagonist" in order to hypostatize two  temporalities of the same "self" : the "I" remembering and writing  in the present, and the "I" in the past, experiencing the events  that led up to and conditioned the present state of retrospection.  Subtending this distinction is the fundamental and unspoken as­ sumption of personal development, through which all differences  are ultimately united under the figure of the same retrospective "I. "  James Olney, for example, exploring various types of autobiography,  describes the autobiography of memory, in which the "I" controls  a double reference : "here and now, there and then, both the perpetual  present and the historic past-and it is the tenuous yet tensile  thread of memory that joins the two 'l's . " 8  Jean Starobinski argues  that the "style" of autobiography is characterized by a double  "deviation"-of time and of identity-which establishes autobio­ graphical reflection; this double deviation marks the difference  between present and past, as well as a change within the "I. " That  change is obscured by a "personal mark, " the "pronomial constancy"  of the "I, " which covers the difference within and asserts continuity  over change. But this "constancy" is an "ambiguous constancy, "  because the retrospective stance depends precisely on a difference  in temporality. 9   De Man's exposition of specular structure develops further the  emphasis found in Starobinski's formulation: an emphasis on defin­ ing autobiography not with reference to a "real life" outside the  text but through attention to the structure of figuration which  produces the illusion of such a reference. This line of argument  makes it clear that the distinction drawn between "narrator" and  "protagonist" is a working distinction only. The sense of memory  is itself an effect of figuration. Whereas the traditional understanding  8.

Instead of empha­ sizing stability and continuity in the "I, " which covers fundamental  difference, the novel emphasizes the apparent differences that obscure  a fundamental continuity. The figure of self-understanding has been  separated into two personae, figuratively reunified in their specular  relation. Thus the novel enacts the autobiographical play of similarity  and difference within a self-reflexive identity. At first glance, the  development represented in the novel does not appear to be personal  development. And yet through this particular relation of narrator and  character, historical development is cast precisely in personal terms.  Rather than the figure of an older, wiser person looking back over  the course of a lifetime, to chart his development as the "protagonist"  who eventually became the present "narrator"-instead of a narrator  who projects a figure of his past self as "other" than his present self,  and then in the end recuperates that "other" as "same"-we have a  narrator in the present looking back over the course of centuries to  chart the growth of a more distantly displaced "other. " But the struc­ ture of the figure works the same way. Through the framework of  analogy, the narrator insists on his developmental relationship with  the character Marius; the narrator and Marius are related as later and  earlier stages of the same continuing identity. The implication of this  relation is of course evolutionary. Young epicureans like Marius are  the precursors of their modern representatives, as the second century  is the precursor of the nineteenth century. In Marius the Epicurean  the specular relation between narrator and central character projects  transhistorical continuity as a personal figure, "born" in Marius's  time, aging and retrospective in Pater's .   In this sense, Marius the Epicurean should be read not as an  autobiography of Pater himself but as an autobiography of the  Zeitgeist. The "time-spirit" looks back, in the old age of the  nineteenth century, to remember and to "place" an earlier phase of  his own life history. Seasoned readers of Pater might think that  IO.  I am using the figures of Olney, Starobinski, and de Man to sketch the lines of  a more complicated debate.

The point I am making, however,  is a formal one. Even if one had no knowledge of the author of  Marius the Epicurean or of his other works, one could still recognize  the figures of narrator and protagonist as two temporalities of the  same figurative identity. But that identity should not be taken to  refer to the historical identity of Walter Pater as its autobiographical  subject. Let us tum briefly to another example. Pate11s first imagi­ nary portrait, "The Child in the House, " has also been called  autobiographical. It might clarify the point I am making about  Marius to look at the similar narrative effects generated in that  essay-reverie. For again, whether Florian Deleal, the central character  of "The Child in the House, " can be equated in any way with the  historical Pater is less important than the fact that a version of  specular structure is set up in the narrative.  In the first paragraph, which tells of Florian Deleal making the  decision to note "some things in the story of his spirit, " a personal­ ized narrator is not evident. In other words, the narration begins in  the position of the third person, at a decisive distance from "Flor­ ian" : "he" decided to note some things about "his" spirit. The  figurative difference between present and past is transfigured as  space, as distance, and as reverie : "In the house and garden of his  dream he saw a child moving. " From his vantage later in time,  Florian could "watch" (as if from a distance) the gradual expansion  of his soul within "the old house, " as if the child were not himself,  as if the soul in question were not his own (MS, 1 7 3-74 ) .  But soon  a first-person narrator emerges; by the third paragraph the position  of the narrator has been taken by an "I. " This transference suggests  that the boundaries between "Florian" and the narrator are obscure.  The titular "child in the house" seems to refer simultaneously to  the young Florian and to an earlier state of the narrator, who  describes "the child of whom I am writing" (MS, 1 7 5 ;  emphasis  added) .  Again, though in a different way from Marius and his  narrator, this central character and his narrator are figured both as  the same "person" and as different "persons. "  The slippage from  third to first person in this narrative creates the effect of specularity,  of gathering both Florian and narrator within the figure of a self­ reflexive "I . "  The "identity" hypostatized through the specular relation of narra­ tor and character in Marius the Epicurean is a personal figure for the  historical identity of Western culture. Pater argues in The Renaissance  against the " superficial view" that divides history into periods, and  </page> <page sequence="23"> Autobiography of the Zeitgeist • 1 9 1  •  he reserves his special criticism for the "trenchant and absolute"  division conventionally made between Pagan and Christian. That  trenchant division between Pagan and Christian is precisely the one  that Marius the Epicurean works to repair, with its notion of develop­ ment so gradual as to be evanescent, nearly invisible, diaphanous.  Against these "superficial" div isions Pater posits "the deeper view . . .   which preserves the identity of European culture" (R, 22 5 ) . Pater's  language here should alert us to the aesthetic status of this "deeper"  ground against which separate figures are only apparently or conven­ tionally divided. The specular relation between Marius and his narra­ tor constructs this "deeper view. "  Because Marius plays the part of the transparent hero, a sort of  specular exchange also takes place between him and the other  characters in his second-century cultural milieu. Like Diaphaneite,  Marius's consciousness is the site of the internalization of "all that  is really lifegiving in the established order of things" (MS, 2 5 1 ) .  Thus Marius, like his narrator, sums up and "contains" the impor­ tant cultural forces of his day. His receptivity is played out in the  plot through his relation with supposedly external realities-other  characters, cities, books, and cultural institutions-that reflect his  state of internal development at any given point in the narrative.  Even "world-historical" figures, such as Marcus Aurelius, or docu­ mented lesser historical figures, such as Apuleius or Cecilia, are  seen chiefly as they relate to Marius's development and are thus  rendered as "minor" characters.  These minor characters are ranged in developmental series. Each  character reflects a particular stage of Marius's development, and each  series reflects the larger arc of historical development he internalizes  over the course of his lifetime. The familiar device of the guide­ figure, for example, has been multiplied across the text, each guide or  companion indicating the issues involved in that particular stage of  Marius's life : the young priest of Aesculapius who urges Marius to  develop his visual capacity, the pagan poet Flavian, the Stoic Emperor  Marcus Aurelius, through whose example of self-consciousness Mar­ ius learns to become his own guide, the Christian knight Cornelius,  and finally that "divine companion" Marius envisions on the Sabine  Hills .

In fane Eyre, for  example, other characters not only are seen retrospectively by and  through the autobiographical "I" in the present time of narration but  also are somewhat "flattened" (partly because their consciousnesses  cannot be fully represented) and reduced to the value they have with  respect to Jane's development at each point in the story. The Reed  children, Helen Bums, Blanche Ingram, Bertha Mason-even to some  extent Edward Fairfax Rochester and St. John Rivers-are in large part  represented as foils for Jane Eyre, externalized markers of her current  stage of internal development. The pattern they fall into with respect  to one another is usually read as a configuration imposed by the  adult Jane-that is, the mature retrospective "narrator. " The narrative  structure thus becomes the sign of her achieved psychological coher­ ence as "protagonist. " It is easier, simply because it is habitual, to see  this effect when the narration is in the first person, but the same  structuring principle is even more pronounced in Marius the Epicu­ rean, where all the ostensibly "other" characters seem in a sense to  be epiphenomena of the central consciousness of Marius. 12   The fiction of development is marked in this novel by Marius's  internalization of these supposedly external, cultural phenomena.  That fiction is maintained by a series of specular relations, as one  "external" reflection of Marius's personal development yields to an­ other. With this reflexive relationship established between the indi­ vidual and his surrounding culture, the borders between exterior and  interior are simultaneously asserted and broken down, defended and  violated. This continuous exchange between internal and external  provides another demonstration of historical expression, and the rela­ tion between narrator and character personalizes historical retrospec­ tion as self-knowledge.  In Marius the Epicurean, historical development is imagined as  successive stages of internalization and transmission. Thus Marius's  consciousness comprehends the cultural developments of his day, and  1 2 .  My argument here is close to, but pointedly different from, Spengemann's explo­ ration of "poetic autobiography. "  He too recognizes in modernist texts the peculiar  sense that every character is an expression of a central consciousness, but he associates  that central consciousness with the author. For example, in his analysis the characters  of The Scarlet Letter are finally seen to represent aspects of Hawthorne himself. I would  argue instead that the "central" consciousness around which all the other characters  radiate must be represented as the central figure in the text. See William C.

Both figures occupy the position at the end of  the line, for Marius is the last of his pagan "race, " and the narrator  speaks from the latest moment of development represented in the  novel. In other words, both Marius and his narrator, at different points  along a continuous line of development, show that "the composite  experience of all the ages is part of each one of us" (B, 1 96 ) .   Thus Marius the Epicurean presents a complex example of the  interaction of genealogical and metafigural impulses in aesthetic his­ toricism, for the plot of self-culture shows lines of development being  absorbed by a mind in the present, and in Marius that plot has been  doubled. Both Marius and the narrator represent that figurative posi­ tion at the end of the line, where the retrospective mind in the present  preserves all parts of the past in one place. But the narrator, due to his  later, more present position, also comprehends Marius as part of his  late-nineteenth-century culture. Caught up in "the intoxication of  belatedness, " ' 3  this narrator regards Marius at the distance of specula­ tion and sees an earlier figure of his own developmental type.  3 · The Transcendental Induction  The specular structure of Marius the Epicurean displays personal  identity and historical culture as correlative and interlocking develop­ ments. Taken together in their specular relation, narrator and protago­ nist represent the individual self and its generalized projection, its  transcendent "other, " the overarching Zeitgeist. ' In examining the  specular structure of Marius, I have so far concentrated chiefly on the  retrospective stance of the narrator, within whose perspective all past  ages may be gathered together and preserved. However, the novel also  provides an understanding of how that concept of the overarching  Zeitgeist is constructed, from the perspective of the individual. This  section focuses on "The Child in the House" and chapter l 9 of Marius  the Epicurean, "The Will as Vision, " both of which are concerned  1 3 .

Like "Diaphaneite, " "The Child in the House" advances a theory  of internalization, but "Diaphaneite" concentrates on cultural trans­ mission, whereas "The Child in the House" concentrates on individ­ ual psychology. It proposes an associationist, inscriptive model for the  formation of personality, through which the 11 accidents" of outward  influences "indelibly . . . fi gure themselves on the white paper, the  smooth wax, of our ingenuous souls" (MS, 1 7 3, 1 77, 1 79 ) .  Primitively  at first, the soul of the young Florian receives the general influences  of beauty and pain; it is in these terms that Pater sets up this particular  dialectic of development, and pain is its first term. 2 The Virgilian  lacrimae rerum have been transfigured in Paterian terms to become a  phantasmagoric mechanism of infliction: Florian both recognizes and  eventually works himself "that great machine in things, constructed  so ingeniously to play pain-fugues on the delicate nerve-work of living  creatures"  (MS, 1 84 ) .  In this reverie, the "musiclike intervals in our  existence" are not only those of clarity, fluidity, play (R, l 5 l ) . "The  Child in the House" is Pater's tone-poem on the shifting vicissitudes  of human mood.  Gradually in Florian's experience these two "elementary apprehen­ sions" distinguish themselves further, through narrated incidents in  which both beauty and pain make their marks and are "recognized"  through particular experiences (MS, 1 82 ) .  The entire theory depends  upon the absolute particularity of experience in time. The picture of  Marie Antoinette on her way to execution, the white angora with a  face like a flower, the treasure of fallen acorns and black crow's feath­ ers, the great red hawthorn in full flower-these things are "im­ pressed" upon Florian's soul in moments of intense reception, and  they form ever afterward the stuff of memory.  I have remarked how, in the process of our brainbuilding, as the house  of thought in which we live gets itself together, like some airy bird's­ nest of floating thistle-down and chance straws, compact at last, little  accidents have their consequence. (MS, 1 84 )   The "house" in which "the child" lives, then, is the most ingenuous  and at the same time ingenious figure for the child's soul. Interiority  2.

The human body that houses  the soul, and the house that encloses the body, both represent the  spirit that can be expressed in no other way. What is expressed will  be what has been impressed there from the outside, and here we have  again the familiar, circular epistemology of impressionism, through  which figures of interiority and exteriority reflect and replace one  another. "The Child in the House" explicitly addresses this paradoxi­ cal relation in which "inward and outward [are] woven through and  through each other into one inextricable texture" (MS, 1 7 3 ) .  In the short passage quoted above, the soul is figured as a bird,  making its nest from whatever fragments of the world happen to come  its way. In other words, personal identity itself is an example of  Pater's favorite composite form. All the "little accidents have their  consequences, " and eventually a soul "grows" and "expands" within  the house. This imaginary portrait highlights the unique formation of  each individual identity in historical time. But though it begins with  the stress on concrete historicity, "The Child in the House" attends,  with equal force and care (though in the second place) to the other  side of the dialectic as well. The latter part of the essay moves toward  a consideration of ideal typicality.  The development of concepts from sense-impressions is also a fea­ ture of life in time, according to this essay. It is, after all, a "house of  thought  in which we live, " after the process of "brainbuilding" goes  on for a time (emphasis added) .  "In later years" Florian occupied  himself with various philosophies that considered the relation be­ tween "the sensuous and the ideal elements in human knowledge"  (MS, 1 86 ) .  He chooses to prefer, from among these philosophies, the  ones that emphasize the "sensible vehicle or occasion. " In other  words, searching for a theory that might lend coherence to his experi­ ence, Florian chooses the theory that best reflects and generalizes  upon that experience. As the narrator puts it: "such metaphysical  speculation did but reinforce what was instinctive. "  And I want to  call attention to the specularity of this sort of speculation, for the  development described in this retrospective portrait consists of more  and more generalized exfoliations of the same, instinctive affinities.  More than the intense receptiveness to sensuous experience, "The  Child in the House"  explores the successive stages of generalization  from that experience. Through time, the "accidents" of early, familiar  life "in the house" are transfigured, becoming in "later life" and  in retrospect "ideal, or typical conception[s)" (MS, n9) .  A sense of  typicality, then, is the result of reflection in time, and the figure of  the narrator provides the vantage point from which to see what Florian  </page> <page sequence="28"> • 1 96 • Historical Novelty and Marius the Epicurean  later made of his early experiences. For example, late in the portrait  we find that his "innate sense for the soberer tones in things" was  reinforced and at the same time "softened" by a later development of  the "religious sentiment. "  Florian began to love the objects of church  ritual "for their own sakes, " and from those "actual" experiences he  formed ideal conceptions. The linen, the vessels, the holy water­ these things became to him "the type of something he desired always  to have about him in actual life. " An experience from "actual" life,  in other words, has been raised to the level of the type: the generalized  standard that prefigures later "actual" manifestations. This reflexive  exchange between the typical and the actual forms his "way of con­ ceiving religion" :   a sacred history indeed, but still more a sacred ideal, a transcendent  version or representation . . . o f human life and its familiar or exceptional  incidents, birth, death, marriage, youth, age, tears, joy, rest, sleep, wak­ ing-a mirror, towards which men might tum away their eyes from  vanity and dullness, and see themselves therein as angels, with their  daily meat and drink, even, become a kind of sacred transaction-a  complementary strain or burden, applied to our every-day existence,  whereby the stray snatches of music in it re-set themselves, and fall  into the scheme of some higher and more consistent harmony. A place  adumbrated itself in his thoughts, wherein those sacred personalities,  which are at once the reflex and the pattern of our nobler phases of life,  housed themselves . . . .  Some ideal, hieratic persons he would always  need to occupy it and keep a warmth there. And he could hardly under­ stand those who felt no such need at all, finding themselves quite happy  without such heavenly companionship, and sacred double of their life,  beside them. (MS, 1 9 3-94)  Here we have most prominently displayed a sacramental vision of  everyday life. But this passage also expresses an explicitly demytholo­ gizing view of religion, through which religion is seen as an elaborate  anthropomorphic creation. The "mirror" of religion, in which men  might see themselves as angels, has been explicitly envisioned as a  projection. This exchange between "actual" life and its idealized,  specular double is quite clearly stated. The sacred figures are "at once  the reflex and the pattern of our nobler phases of life . "  The irony  should be appreciated: these secularization-effects play so subver­ sively just here, when the thematic content of the passage deals with  the supposed sacralization-effects of Florian's habits of thought.  This conception of religion envisions it as "a place" where "sacred  personalities . . . h oused themselves. " We can recognize here another  </page> <page sequence="29"> The Transcendental Induction · 197  •  version of Pater's House Beautiful, the place beyond time which gath­ ers up and comprehends idealized recreations of all the effects gener­ ated in time. Like a "complementary strain or burden" added to the  music of everyday existence, this transcendent projection organizes  "the stray snatches of music in it" ;  accidental, random experiences  "re-set themselves, and fall into the scheme of some higher and more  consistent harmony. " 3 Through several levels of generalization and  idealized projection, the "actual" childhood house becomes, first, the  "house of thought, " and finally this house not made with hands .  After this passage on the transcendent "place, " a summary state­ ment comes abruptly: "Thus a constant substitution of the typical  for the actual took place in his thoughts" (MS, 1 94 ) .  This specular  substitution is the basis for Florian's sacramental vision, whereby " all  the acts and accidents of daily life borrowed a sacred colour and  significance" (MS, 1 9 5  ). The story ends quite quickly after this. Fl&lt;;?rian  moves out of the childhood house. At first the change is eagerly  anticipated, but a pet bird is left behind and Florian must return to  retrieve it. An agony of homesickness descends upon him as he sees  the abandoned, "dead, " and empty house. Florian's is the anxiety of  the revenant, wondering how much of his soul has been left behind.  And we can see in the parable of this tale's ending both the "modern"  eagerness to move away from the past, and the nostalgic return to  memorialize it. Florian was "driven quickly away, far into the rural  distance, so fondly speculated on, of that favourite country-road. "   This departure, of course, i s  mirrored in the return of the story's  beginning, where the figure of specularity is also opened.  Though it points us beyond history, "The Child in the House"  presents a historical vision of how ideal types and their transcendent  dwelling are generated in time. Pater will work this vision out in  Marius the Epicurean on the level of cultural development at large,  as we shall see in later sections of Part Three. For now, let us turn to  the chapter in which Marius the Epicurean projects the same sort of  "heavenly companionship, and sacred double of [his] life, beside  [him], " for in "The Will as Vision" that transcendent double is under­ stood to be precisely the sense of historical retrospection.  Marius the Epicurean meditates upon the process of visionary expe­ rience, but the novel never attempts to present it directly in a fictive  present, never allows it to open an abyss in Marius's consciousness or  to convert Marius's identity, never allows it to break the sequence or  3.

The Paterian  narrative, in other words, does not represent the Paterian "moment. "   T .  S .  Eliot complained that the visionary moment was dangerously  discontinuous, "with no before and after ."  But Marius the Epicurean  is radically continuous. Mediated by memory-and the nineteenth­ century narrative voice ensures that all Marius's "sensations and  ideas" are mediated by memory-moments of his "intense conscious­ ness of the present" become strangely rationalized events. Marius's  most telling moment of vision is generated in self-consciousness,  through a series of logical and psychological projections. It is not an  "epiphany" but a "difficult ecstasy" that must be achieved through  will. 4   "The Will as Vision" is  carefully placed to mark the end of Part the  Third. 5  As the climax of the novel, its placement makes the point that  the willed vision achieved here is the necessary precondition for seeing  a further vision in "actual" things. But the willed vision has its own  precondition in a dream that induces a state of reverie. Like Florian  at the beginning of "The Child in the House, " Marius has awakened  that morning from a particularly refreshing night of sleep . He dreamed  that " those he loved best were pronouncing his name most pleasantly"  as they passed in a procession before him on the pavement of a city  "fairer far than Rome. " His serene state of mind, the result of his  dream and the precondition of his vision, is only equivocally granted  from without. Given "as if by favour of an invisible power, " it has  actually come while Marius's watchful consciousness slept . Pater has  retained the idea of an external agent, but his "as if" pushes the  notion of external inspiration to the distance of metaphor. Though this  chapter extolls the control of self-consciousness, such clarity seems  to be the gift of an unconscious. Marius generates his inspiration from  deep within, then figures it as coming from without. The successive  stages of the transcendental induction to come will elaborately fulfill  this initial gesture of self-reflexive "speculation. "   The landscape within which this vision takes place i s  pointedly  both picturesque and sublime. The "yellow old temples" and the  "shrine of the patronal Sibyl" mark the scene with cultural associa­ tions that are in the process of being superseded. But at the same time  4. See Robert M.

William Buckler correctly points out that "the climactic spiritual experience of  Marius' life occurs before he undergoes the close experience of Christianity" ( "Marius  the Epicurean, " in Walter Pater: The Critic as Artist of Ideas [New York: New York  University Press], p. 263 ) .   </page> <page sequence="31"> The Transcendental Induction · 1 99 •  the scene is wild and harsh, with floods and precipices, high, rocky  crags, evergreen trees, twisted olives, and the roar of an "immemorial  waterfall" (ME II, 6 5-66 ) .  That waterfall rewrites the image from  paragraph two of the "Conclusion, " in which "the water flows down  indeed, though in apparent rest" (R, 2 34 ) .  In its context here, the water  plunges down, but "with a motion so unchanged from age to age as  to count . . .  as an image of unalterable rest . "  The Wordsworthian,  emblematic reading of woods decaying never to be decayed has been  restored, though it has been marked as an explicitly aesthetic or willed  construction. Nature and culture conspire to set an ancient scene.  The air in this "time-worn place" is "pure and thin, " but it is also "an  air of immense age ."  The natural scene becomes a figure for the  extreme gradualism of Marius's vision (and, indeed, of the novel's  historical vision in general ) :   On this day truly no mysterious light, no irresistibly leading hand from  afar, reached him; only, the peculiarly tranquil influence of its first hour  increased steadily upon him in a manner with which . . . t he place . . .   had something to do . . . . I t was as if the spirit of life in nature were but  withholding any too precipitate revelation of itself, in its slow, wise,  maturing work. (ME II, 6 5-66 )   As Marius sits in an olive garden on the Sabine Hills overlooking the  city, he begins a conversatfon with himself. He takes as his model for  this "dialogue of the mind with itself" the Conversations of Marcus  Aurelius. 6 Since Marius has become amanuensis to the emperor, he  has transcribed and internalized these Conversations. The lesson Mar­ ius found "most serviceable" begins his meditation: " 'Tis in thy  power to think as thou wilt . "  Marius begins to meditate on the efficacy  of a controlled self-consciousness by first becoming conscious of what  it is that he wills, namely, "an eternal friend to man, just hidden  behind the veil of a mechanical and material order" (ME II, 6 3 ) . He  asks himself : Is the perception of that "friend" simply "a matter of  choice" ?  "Dependent upon some deliberate act of volition on his part?  . . . M ight the will itself be an organ of knowledge, of vision ? "  (ME II,  6 5 ) . The "conclusion" Marius reaches in this chapter represents Pa- 6.

There, extreme  materialist and idealist systems of thought were represented as cancel­ ing one another out; here, Marius wills the priority of mind over  matter.  Marius slips from thought, through reverie, toward vision, in a  movement similar to the slippage in person at the beginning of "The  Child in the House. " Perhaps reverie may be defined as that state of  mind in which a blurring of interior and exterior takes place or, in  terms of narrative figures, a blurring of the first person into the second  or third. The figure of specularity signals this state, as Marius projects  the past course of his own life into the figurative distance as a visual  image. He sees himself journeying toward himself on the road below,  literalizing the figure of life's "journey" at the same time that he casts  it in specular terms :  All around him and within . . . t urning to reverie, the course of his own  life hitherto seemed to withdraw itself into some other world, disparted  from the spectacular point where he was now placed to survey it, like  that distant road below, along which he had travelled that morning . . . .   Through a dreamy land he could see himself moving, as if in another life,  and like another person. (ME II, 66)  This prospect of self-reflection produces a feeling that Marius registers  as gratitude :  It was as if he must look round for someone else to share his joy with:  for someone to whom he might tell the thing, for his own relief. (ME II,  66-67)  We cannot fail to note, in passing, that "relief" is at issue in the  projection of companionship. Thus, to the senses already established  for Pater's figure of relief, we should add the sense of relief from  solitude. This desire for ideal companionship but thinly disguises the  familiar, romantic fear that there is no one "to whom he might tell  the thing. " "Must not the whole world around have faded away for  him altogether, had he been left for one moment really alone in it? "  (ME II, 67 ) .  But Marius need not fear, for he is never "really" alone :  "In his deepest apparent solitude there had been rich company. "  The feeling of lively gratitude, which was the result of one self­ division, produces another and yet another. Memories of "actual"  companions on his life's journey prompt Marius to imagine the possi- </page> <page sequence="33"> The Transcendental Induction • 201 •  bility of "an unfailing companion, ever at his side. " And from this  projection of an ideal "other, " Marius constructs his vision of tran­ scendence :   I t  was as  i f  there were not one only, but two wayfarers, side by side,  visible there across the plain, as he indulged his fancy. . . . H e passed  from that mere fantasy of a self not himself, beside him in his coming  and going, to those divinations of a living and companionable spirit at  work in all things, of which he had become aware from time to time in  his old philosophic readings-in Plato and others, last but not least, in  Aurelius. Through one reflection upon another, he passed from such  instinctive divinations, to the thoughts which give them logical consis­ tency, formulating at last, as the necessary exponent of our own and the  world's life, that reasonable Ideal, to which the Old Testament gives the  name of Creator, which for the philosophers of Greece is the Eternal  Reason, and in the New Testament the Father of Men-even as one  builds up from act and word and expression of the friend actually visible  at one's side, an ideal of the spirit within him. (ME II, 67-68 )   This process of reasoning from experience i s  very much like what we  saw in "The Child in the House, " where Florian passed too from  "instincts" to the "thoughts which give them logical consistency. "  But in Marius the Epicurean there is an even more explicit acknowl­ edgment of the constructive "will" involved in this sort of reasoning;  the "instinctive divination" comes first, and then Marius looks for  support in the history of philosophy. He adduces historical evidence  to give his "fantasy" the sense of "actuality. " The argument here is  that the historical frequency of this will to believe tends to validate  Marius's personal speculations. This "necessary exponent" of "the  world's life" is explicitly modeled on a personal figure, as the example  of the "friend" serves to show, whose "spirit" has been "built up" as  an ideal through a mental act of summation and projection.  Finally, Marius's vision is not merely supported by historical evi­ dence; it is a vision of divinity as history. For in the last movement  of Marius's visionary speculations, the "divine companion" is imag­ ined as a transcendent mind, an idealized projection of individual  memory, a resting-place or repository for all the disparate moments  of experience:  Might not this entire material world . . . b e . . . b ut reflections in, or a  creation of, that one indefectible mind, wherein he too became conscious,  for an hour, a day, for so many years? . . . H ow had he longed, sometimes,  that there were indeed one to whose boundless power of memory he  </page> <page sequence="34"> 202 • Historical Novelty and Marius the Epicurean  could commit his own most fortunate moments, . . . o ne strong enough  to retain them even though he forgot, in whose more vigorous conscious­ ness they might subsist for ever, beyond that mere quickening of capacity  which was all that remained of them in himself! . . . T o-day at least, in  the peculiar clearness of one privileged hour, he seemed to have appre­ hended that in which the experiences he valued most might find, one by  one, an abiding-place. (ME II, 69-7 1 1   The projection of a transcendent power of memory stabilizes the self,  but it in turn has been generated "exponentially" on the model of that  very self. Of course, we have again the 11 abiding-place" that Pater often  calls the House Beautiful. In this ideal vision the material world does  fade and "dissolv[e] away all around him, " but Marius experiences  that dissolution as hope and joy, not as solipsistic panic. His joy is  expressed in a (muted) figure of the Apocalypse; as the "prison-wall"  of the material world falls away, "he felt a quiet hope, a quiet joy  dawning faintly . . . l ike the break of day over some vast prospect with  the 'new city' . . . i n the midst of it" (ME II, 70 ) .   The specular structure of Marius the Epicurean cannot be fully  appreciated unless we also see that Pater has thematized its construc­ tion as part of Marius's story. Not only does the narrator look back  toward Marius as if toward an earlier phase of his own identity, but  Marius also projects from himself as his /1 divine companion" the  vision of an ideal and transcendent retrospective capacity, which is  figured in this novel by its narrator. In this case, the narrator concludes  by calmly stating that this moment of vision passed, that Marius  never again felt this degree of concentrated focus, and that he was not  essentially changed by this experience. Marius passes on, to experi­ ence a realization of his vision in "actual things, 11 and from the point  of view of the next chapter, this moment seems chiefly preparatory.  But the moment is preserved, even as it is annulled, by a narrator  within whose capacious memory all of Marius's moments find rest  and continuity, a figure of the "more vigorous consciousness" within  which they "subsist for ever. "  4 · Typology as Narrative Form  At the moment of his death, the central character of Pater's novel  remains only passively committed to Christianity, but the novel as a  whole is more actively, though ambivalently, engaged. That complex  </page> <page sequence="35"> Typology as Narrative Form · 203 •  relation, as we have seen in Pater's earlier work, is in no sense a direct  embrace of Christianity; but neither is it a full disengagement, for  Pater preserves on the level of aesthetic form what he rejects on the  level of positive belief. He turns the figures of Christianity toward his  own end, using them to structure his representation of historical and  aesthetic development as narrative form.  Pater had a clearly developed sense of the "aesthetic" residue left  behind when a creed becomes outworn as positive belief and can be  regarded in its historical value alone. He explained this in the earliest  published version of his essay on Coleridge, an essay that deeply  laments Coleridge's inability to change with the times :  Religious belief, the craving for objects of belief, may be refined out of  our hearts, but they must leave their sacred perfume, their spiritual  sweetness behind. 1  In Pater's novel, as in his Renaissance essays, the nostalgia for "ob­ jects" is renounced in favor of representations. Pater finds in typologi­ cal strategies of narration a systematic technique for preserving not  the "objects" themselves but the memory of those objects . His narra­ tive could be described in this sense as the ritual repetition of inherited  forms whose value is thereby shifted from the "objective" or positive  realm of belief to the secondary, "transfigured" realm of the aesthetic.  These forms or patterns are one sort of "sacred perfume" that remains  as a refined testament to the continuing presence of an attenuated,  nostalgic, secularized, and aesthetic form of belief; Pater has an abid­ ing "faith" in the shape of historical time itself and in the aesthetic  types that embody its spirit. Typological methods of interpreting his­ tory, of interpreting individual experience, and of interpreting texts  were prevalent in the mid-nineteenth century, and those methods  inform Pater's novel in each of its several dimensions : in its reading  of historical development, in Marius's reading of his own experience,  and in our reading of Marius the Epicurean .

Crane first advanced this argument when he  chose Marius to  represent one of  his three categories of plot formation, the "plot of thought, " whose structure is governed  by the synthesizing principle of thought, idea, or theme, rather than by action or  character.

The narrator estab­ lishes, and keeps alive in readers' minds through continual reiteration,  a pervasive historical analogy between the culture of Victorian En­ gland in the 1 8 80s and second-century Rome in the Age of the Anto­ nines. But that is only its most obvious point, for the narrative com­ mentary is obsessed with the principle of historical analogy in general,  with relations of similarity and difference among all ages of cultural  history. Together, Marius and the nineteenth-century commentary  engage in exercises of memory and analogy from their vastly different  points of time; together they contribute to a dense layering of tempo­ ralities in the narrative.  An important narrative strategy emphasizes these analogies and the  resulting shifts between various layers of time: between prospection  beyond the tenuous present tense of the represented action, and retro­ spection, backward in time, sometimes from Marius's point of view  and sometimes from the narrator's. Many readers have complained  that very little dramatization occurs in present narrative time: very  few words are directly spoken; nothing "happens. "  Each event is  first mediated by the consciousness of Marius and then again by the  narrating voice; no event appears sui generis, isolated in its own  present. But perhaps as much is gained by this strategy as is lost.  "Foreshadowing" is a suggestive term for what goes on in the opening  chapters, where the triumph of Christianity is premised outright in  the opening phrase:  As, in the triumph of Christianity, the old religion lingered latest in the  country, and died out at last as but paganism-the religion of the villag­ ers, before the advance of the Christian Church; so, in an earlier century,  it was in places remote from town-life that the older and purer forms of  paganism itself had survived the longest. (ME I, 3 )   Paganism too, i t  seems, had its own "pastoral" past-before the advent  of Christianity-to which we readers of the novel now nostalgically  look back. The cultural development of paganism can be seen, in  "historic retrospect, " to foreshadow the later cultural development of  Christianity. Paganism was "secularized, " incorporated, and tran­ scended historically to become Christianity. In other words, the very  term "foreshadowing" should remind us that even our simplest criti­ cal vocabulary acknowledges the debt of secular narrative to typologi­ cal conventions, but the simpler modem term merely represents a  residue of the complex system to which it alludes.   </page> <page sequence="37"> Typology as Narrative Form · 205 •  As the first sentence of chapter 1 predicts the outcome of the novel's  major cultural development, chapter 2 anticipates the outcome of  Marius's personal development and the end of the novel's plot. Mari­ us's temperament  kept him serious and dignified amid the Epicurean speculations which  in after years much engrossed him . . . a nd made him anticipate all his  life long as a thing toward which he must carefully train himself, some  great occasion of self-devotion, such as really came, that should conse­ crate his life, and, it might be, its memory with others, as the early  Christian looked forward to martyrdom at the end of his course, as a seal  of worth upon it. (ME I, 1 8 )   "Suspense" has no place in a novel whose most general and fundamen­ tal, as well as local and intimate, narrative strategies are so deeply  prefigurative. Overt narrative clues make it clear that these early  experiences prepare both Marius and the reader for later experiences .  Their very value lies largely in their anticipatory function; we begin  to look for later, analogous experiences to unfold. What happens is  always less important than how it happens and what it will come to  mean later in the narrative, when it is echoed in a later stage of a  developmental " series . "  Events come to the reader already interpreted,  in other words, presented as they will later be seen-both by Marius  and by the nineteenth-century narrator-to be significant.  The density of this interpretive mediation and of the temporal layer­ ing related to it must be called to account, and as the term "foreshad­ owing" suggests, my account will be typological. Pater's literary use  of typology is neither orthodox nor consistent throughout the text,  but its logic is pervasive, and indications in the text argue that its  logic is applicable to a reading of the novel. Most important, some  thorny problems and apparent contradictions, which have plagued  readers of this great novel, resolve themselves under its light : the  division of narrative attention between Marius's development and  that of his culture, for example, or the troublesome coexistence of  cyclical and conservative with linear and progressive schemes of his­ torical development, both seemingly endorsed by the novel . 3 Finally,  understanding Pater's use of typology will help us propose a new  solution to the perennial problems raised by the novel's ambiguous,  deeply ambivalent, and yet profoundly coherent closure.  3 .

Typology above all asserts a certain interpretation of the shape of  time and its ways of unfolding in history, a vision in which earlier  events are seen in retrospect to have prefigured later, structurally  analogous ones. Similarly, present events, persons, institutions, and  texts may be seen prophetically, as prefigurations of greater fulfill­ ments in the future, higher developments of the "type . "  Most impor­ tant, the type is realistic, absolutely concrete in the historical sense;  and this fundamental feature serves to distinguish typological rela­ tions from symbolic or allegorical ones. But before considering the  profound appeal of the typological vision of history for the late nine­ teenth century, perhaps the case for Pater's familiarity with typologi­ cal methods should be made, and it can be made very briefly.  From the earliest centuries of the Christian era, typology has devel­ oped as a "rhetoric of high spiritual authority" 5  a venerable array  of techniques designed simultaneously to represent the phenomenal  world and to gesture toward the transcendent, designed to mediate  the claims of positive, historical knowledge and the belief in a force  that is beyond history and capable of ordering or directing it. Auer­ bach's seminal 1 944 essay "Figura" noted that figural interpretations  of Scripture were prevalent in most European countries until the  eighteenth century, when they markedly faded from view. 6 But a major  retrieval of the method took place in the nineteenth century as one  expression of the age's widespread interest in various historical meth­ ods of exegesis, a retrieval whose full dimensions have been coming  4.

Whether Pater knew it as a systematic method or not, as the modem  comprehensive term "typology" suggests, he was surely acquainted  with its procedures, as well as its spiritual (and aesthetic, or literary)  rationale. Christian typological thinking was practiced at least as early  as the Pauline epistles and certainly by the earliest church fathers  (Tertullian, Origen, Augustine), all of whom Pater knew well and all  of whom he mentions in Marius the Epicurean . His deep interest in  high church ritual, his readings of ecclesiastical history, and his role  in religious and intellectual controversy at Oxford are well-known and  well-documented. 8  But he could easily have assimilated the method  through his native literary tradition, whose typologically inspired  writers include Milton, Herbert, and Bunyan, among many others .  Pater's immediate literary environment, too, provided authoritative  models, for figural methods of representation in literature and painting  were fashionable as early as the l 84os and l 8 5 os. Several recent studies  have demonstrated the role of typology in the works of major figures  of the period : the "artistical-scientific-historical" vision of Carlyle,  especially in Past and Present; the Tractarian doctrines of Analogy and  Reserve represented in the poetry of Keble, Williams, and Newman, as  well as their concern with the historical development of Christian  practice; the moral aesthetic of Ruskin, especially in volume 2 of  Modern Painters; the figural realism of Pre-Raphaelite painting during  the years of the first Brotherhood ( 1 846-5 3 ) ; the temporal shifts of  Rossetti's sonnets; the evolutionary vision of transcendence in Tenny­ son's In Memoriam; and the secularized hagiographies of George El­ iot's fiction. Such pervasive use of figural techniques by writers and  artists who anticipated a large audience argues the currency of the  7. The initial study was George P. Landow's Aesthetic and Critical Theories of  fohn Ruskin ( Princeton, N.J. : Princeton University Press, 1 97 1 )1 followed by Herbert  L.

Pater might  well have expected his figures to be recognized.  In the earlier part of the nineteenth century, before this documented  revival in the mid-Victorian period, the literary history of typology is  somewhat obscure.9 But typological thought seems to reemerge first  as symbolic, static, and ahistorical-that is, not strictly typological in  the Christian sense at all, but in the Neoplatonic sense, as, for exam­ ple, in Wordsworth's "Types and Symbols of Eternity" from the Sim­ plon Pass episode of The Prelude, or Carlyle's Zeitbild, or "time­ figure, " from Sartor Resartus. In two senses, the Victorians histori­ cized these universal types : they reclaimed the historically based  Christian reference of the types and figures and used them to interpret  secular history.  Illuminating as it is, much of the recent study of Victorian typology  is needlessly limited. Its focus has remained primarily on the strengths  of the method as a poetic or pictorial mode of symbolic figuration  and not as a narrative or explicitly temporal representation. Possibly  because attention to Victorian typology began with a study of Ruskin  (who himself set a strong precedent for using his method as a key to  symbolic significance), typological criticism of the period still largely  concentrates on the interpretation of visual art or on the type as  figurative image, not on the type figurally unfolding in time.  When a Victorian artist uses certain charged images, such as strayed  sheep or a young boy in a carpenter's shop, that artist expects the  biblical allusion to place his work in a context of scriptural analogues.  He may allude to a story or cycle of stories, but his representation  translates narrative into image. On the one hand, typological interpre­ tations of images often reduce the complexities of the method to a  dictionary of types that can be read by substituting one term for  another; this sort of simplification can lead to an allegorization of  history in which its linear dimension disappears in easy conflations  of one age with another and its concreteness evaporates too, as a result.  On the other hand, types seen simply as images can suggest, through  their allusion to a biblical story, the basis for interpreting a scene  morally or tropologically, but this sort of typological reading also  easily succumbs to the pressure of allegory (as in Ruskin's famous  interpretations of Tintoretto, for example) .  Either sort of interpreta­ tion tends to be by virtue of the substitution of one term for another  9. Paul Korshin has contributed to an understanding of early-nineteenth-century  typology.

A fully typological interpreta­ tion must be grounded in historical actuality, must preserve the integ­ rity of separate historical events, and must not allow the linear, "hori­ zontal" dimension of history to disappear in allegorical, "vertical, 11  spiritualizing or symbolic substitutions.  Any use of typology, however "symbolic" or cursory, implies analo­ gies backward and forward in time. But in one sense at least, the  typological organization of narrative time can transcend its uses as a  mode of visual symbolism. Typology has the further power to repre­ sent movement or change in time, to embody the dialectic of anticipa­ tion and retrospection, prefiguration and fulfillment. In narrative, the  typological progression can be enacted in narrative sequence; analogi­ cal relations across time can unfold in time, as a series of progressive  fulfillments . As narrative form, typology can become not only a lexi­ con of types and symbols but also a grammar; not only symbolic but  also fully historical; not only a rhetoric but also a logic of temporality.  Can it be argued that the text of Marius presents us with a legitimate  occasion to read typologically? Then, where can we see typological  modes of organization in its narrative form? The two questions must  be taken up together, beginning with basic guidelines limiting the  cases for which a typological reading would be necessary, illuminat­ ing, or at least justified. The literary use of typology, writes A. C.  Charity, simply expresses a particular view of history and its workings  in literature. It need not signal an exclusively Christian orientation,  but may form "a basis for conversation between the Christian and the  'humanist' writer or scholar. " A legitimate discussion of typology in  a work of literature depends simply on "the actual presentation of the  idea of prefigurations in biblical and non-biblical literature, rather  than the discursive theoretical study of this idea . . . w herever . . . a   writer has attributed significance to an apprehended analogy between  different events, 11 but "only in so far as the texts themselves can be  reasonably viewed as expressing, or involving, or presenting . . .  a  concept of prefiguration and fulfillment . 11 10 In other words, we must  find relatively explicit signs in the text that such a reading is called  for-what Charity calls the "actual presentation" of prefiguration  and fulfillment-if we are not to be like overzealous exegetes who  10 .

And that "actual presentation" must take place within an explicitly  Christian context of discourse-not necessarily a context of avowed  belief or uncomplicated doctrinal orthodoxy, but a Christian context  nonetheless-in order for an author's use of typological structures to  be distinguished both from the analogical structures of many ( if not  most) secular histories and also from similar proleptic structures in  more strictly secular literature. I I   The cultural context of Marius i s  certainly Christian: for all Mari­ us's ambivalence about embracing Christianity as belief, the thematic  content of the novel is largely devoted to the rise of Christianity as a  historical force. Pater's use of a specifically typological form is another  of his characteristically ambivalent and ironic secularizations. Marius  was planned as the first of a trilogy of novels; each novel of the trilogy  would be set in a different historical period, but each would deal with  "the same problems, under altered historical conditions. " 1 2  We have  already seen that Marius posited the "same problems" in nineteenth­ century England and second-century Rome. The second novel, the  unfinished Gaston de Latour, began to examine the "same problems"  during the religious wars of the late sixteenth century in France, and  the third was to have dealt with England in the late eighteenth century.  In a letter to Violet Paget ( "Vernon Lee" ), Pater explained that his  trilogy would deal with the development of a "sort of religious phase  possible for the modern mind . . . t he condition of which phase it is the  main object of my design to convey. " 1 3  Thus Marius was ultimately to  have been merely the first part of a much larger project, which in its  entirety would more clearly have illustrated stages in the development  of this modern "religious phase. "  That trilogy, had it been completed, would have demonstrated ( in  the familiar three stages) that the church as a historical institution  had already changed a great deal over the course of centuries; it would  have implied that both the church and the individual consciousness  had always faced the "same problems, under altered historical condi- 1 1 .  Robert Hollander's morphology of secular medieval literary adaptations of typology  is helpful here, though Pater's use spans several of his categories. See his "Typology and  Secular Literature: Some Medieval Problems and Examples, " in Miner, literary Uses of  Typology, pp. 3-19.  I have derived the criteria invoked here both from Charity and to some  extent from the implications of Hollander's categorization. His discussion of "Christian  typology" proper takes a modem novel (Dostoevsky's The Idiot) as its chief example.  1 2 .  Letters of Walter Pater, letter 96, p. 6 5 .   1 3 .

But Marius, even though it is but one term of that  projected three-part analogy, offers the same comforts to the reader  who, following its internal order, learns to read analogically. Reassur­ ance of this sort was in high demand in the novel's contemporary  climate of reception. Pater's contemporary W. H. Mallock, for exam­ ple, explained the tremendous popularity of Mrs. Ward's Robert Els­ mere ( 1 888 ), the story of a doubting Anglican clergyman plagued by  conclusions drawn from his reading of Darwin and Renan, as an "ex­ pression of the devout idea that the essence of Christianity will some­ how survive its doctrines. 11 1 4 That remark could apply with equal  justice to Marius, which proposes a secularized faith in historical  process itself.  Pater's projection of this novel as the first of a series not only  identifies its thematic interest in Christianity as historical, not doc­ trinal, but also suggests why a typological form would be particularly  significant. The typological analogies established by the trilogy would  imply not only that "the modern phase" retained essential features of  Christianity, but also that it retained those features as parts of a more  highly developed form. Pater's formal motives, in other words, seem  ambivalent : both conservative (to represent modern, relativizing  thought as incorporate within the larger Christian pattern) and pro­ gressive (to show outmoded forms as accommodating to the modern  system by which they were superseded) .  The spiritualizing, conserva­ tive element of typological thought attends to analogies between his­ torically disparate events, thereby preserving their "sameness, " the  steadfastness in their deep structure over time; and on the other hand,  the historicizing, progressive element attends to their difference, to  their change or growth over time.  The chief use of this exegetical system has always been to preserve  whole dispensations and whole literatures from receding into the past  as outworn and useless when a new order supersedes them, and at the  same time to preserve (unlike allegory) the specific historicity of each  one. Thus, early Christian typology, developed over centuries of prac- 14. From "Amateur Christianity, " Fortnightly Review 5 7  ( 1 892 ), quoted in U. C.

See also Pater's review of Robert Elsmere, collected in Essays from the "Guardian "  (EG, 5 5-70) . Pater found Elsmere's doubt more dogmatic than orthodox faith; his own  more refined relativism could entertain Christianity as a "great possibility" simply by  virtue of its historical actuality (EG, 67-68 ) .   </page> <page sequence="44"> • 2 1 2  • Historical Novelty and Marius the Epicurean  tice, preserved the "Old" Testament by redefining its pivotal events  and figures as prefigurative of the "New."  The bondage in Egypt and  the events of the Exodus, for example, were reinterpreted as prefigura­ tions of the Passion and the Resurrection. Late medieval and Renais­ sance typologists, then, admitted pagan and classical figures to the  Christian literary community "retroactively, " seeing them as predic­ tive of Christian virtues and as striving unconsciously toward the  Christian dispensation. Thus Dante admits Statius to Purgatory, imag­ ining that he had been converted to Christianity by Virgil's Fourth  Eclogue (Purgatorio 2 1-22 ) . And seventeenth-century Puritan typolo­ gists, saving not only the past but also their own present, read contem­ porary political heroes as fulfilling both biblical and classical types,  as in Marvell's treatment of Cromwell, for example.  These generalizations are meant only to suggest the gradual secular­ ization of typology itself; once secular history becomes the province  of typologists, any historical analogy between an earlier event and a  later event has the potential to be interpreted typologically. These  stages of literary secularization were fulfilled, so to speak, in the  nineteenth century, when typology was used simultaneously to pre­ serve Christian modes of thought and signification and at the same  time to figure forth modes more "developed" or "evolved" than the  Christian modes. In this ambience of comforting ambivalence, Chris­ tian forms of figuration were used nostalgically to express the faith  that even though Christianity was being superseded through historical  process, the essence of Christianity might survive the passage of its  doctrines, might be preserved in the shape and structure of historical  time. Of course, the system depends on time being seen as shape or  structure, and that is a function of retrospection.  In determining the legitimacy of a typological reading, then, context  is all-important, a construal of "context" that goes beyond the explic­ itly Christian content of the plot of Pater's novel. But the Christian  content of the novel alone would legitimate a typological reading, if  one should be suggested by "the actual presentation of the idea of  prefiguration and fulfillment" in the text itself. And here we may tum  to Pater's explicit uses of both typological concepts and typological  techniques, at the level of form where concept and technique inextri­ cably blend and reinforce each other.  </page> <page sequence="45"> 5 • Typological Ladders  The developmental plot of Marius the Epicurean stresses the analog­ ical relationship between Christianity and Marius's childhood "Reli­ gion of Numa" in order to show that the essence of paganism survives  even after its practices are absorbed and superseded by the early Chris­ tian church. In the culture at large, pagan reverence for the earth is  transformed into Christian burial of the dead; the pagan sentiment  for maternity is fulfilled in devotion to the Holy Mother; the pagan  ritual use of the substances of everyday life (bread, wine, oil, and  water) becomes the foundation of the Christian sacraments.  Christian  ritual, so regarded, is simply old wine in new bottles, a more highly  developed devotional practice that "gathers" previous forms within  its structurally analogous though more spacious, "generous, /1 or "ex­ panded" order (ME II, 1 2 5-27 ) .   Marius's recovery of  ritual in his later years returns him to his  physical and spiritual "home."  For Marius, the very essence of religion  was this return to origins, self-consciously enacted in ritual . As "The  Child in the House" explores the personal and psychological signifi­ cance of "home, /1 Pater's Greek Studies essay the importance of indig­ enous influence on the growth of mythic story, as we shall see. For  Marius, the "spell of his religion" had been, for the first, "a part of the  very essence of home" ;  he yearned, "ever afterward, " we are told in  chapter 2, for home "which, throughout the rest of his life he seemed,  amid many distractions of spirit, to be ever seeking to regain" (ME I,  1 2, 22 ) .  Marius recovers this sense of home and family in the church  in Cecilia's house, where the pastoral "usages and sentiments" of  pagan family life have been transformed into a self-conscious cultural  institution. In other words, Marius's return also marks progress on  his life's journey. '  His recovery also marks the discovery of something  new-an ideal as well as historically institutionalized version of the  family that is nevertheless fully concrete, visible, actual.  There can be no doubt that we are to regard the scene in Cecilia's  house typologically, for Pater describes it explicitly in the language of  types. Marius himself interprets it typologically, thinking "of chaste  women and their children-of all the various affections of family life  under its most natural conditions, yet developed, as if in devout imita- 1 .

The most fundamental typological conclusions areveryeasy  to draw: this cultural form preserves the "natural conditions"  of its  type, achieves a certain new development, and also anticipates yet an­ other, more "sublime new type, " possible in the future. Christian fam­ ily life, already a fulfillment of Marius's own family (and of pagan family  life in general ), prefigures more perfect forms to come, further fulfill­ ments of "that instinct of family life, which the sanction of the Holy  Family was, hereafter, more and more to reinforce" (ME II, 98 ) .   The Christian attitude toward the family, then, represents the  growth in communal self-consciousness registered in the transition  from the "natural" to the institutional, as well as an institutionalized  aspiration toward further cultural self-consciousness . Projecting that  aspiration as a cultural ideal ( " the sanction of the Holy Family" ) will  ensure higher and higher developments of the "actual" or historical  family "hereafter. " (This is a secularized "hereafter, " which refers to  the historical future, but the apocalyptic and spiritual reference of the  "hereafter" hovers nearby. ) In Marius's case, Christian ritual not only  idealizes home and family as part of its worship, it enables him liter­ ally to recover his actual home, as he returns to bury the ashes of his  pagan ancestors, thus incorporating his lineage into the community  of the new dispensation, personally comprehending his whole family's  history in the new cultural order.  Thus Christianity typologically fulfulls Marius's pagan past, but  only after he goes through a "worldly" middle phase, representing  the entangling complications of historical life that make resolution  necessary and possible on a "higher, " more developed plane. Before  he sees the family of Christians in Cecilia's house, for example, he  moves within the cosmopolitan family of the Emperor Marcus Aure­ lius, whose ideas of communal life mark a certain progress beyond  paganism yet remain inadequate in many ways . Marius's feelings of  dissatisfaction propel him onward in his search, through several stages  that are represented sequentially in the novel as smaller analogical  developments within the overarching personal and cultural renewal  represented by the rise of Christianity. The progressive arrangement  of families links Marius's personal growth inextricably to the growth  of his wider culture.  The same sort of serial development proliferates throughout the  novel. Pater organizes the stages of Marius's growth and the growth  of his culture in narrative sequences that one might call "typological  ladders, " for they embody a view of historical development in which  each stage builds on the previous stages and at the same time prefig- </page> <page sequence="47"> Typological Ladders · 2 1 5 •  ures even "higher" developments in the future. These typological  ladders illustrate, on the level of narrative form, Pater's characteristic  serial figure for historical development. Marius's individual growth is  prompted by his yearning toward greater fulfillment in certain con­ stant areas of human life, and Pater's narrative structure conveys this  developmental principle almost obsessively. The serial presentation  of families in the novel, of mother-figures, of cities he passes through  on his life's journey, of companions who accompany him, emphasizes  Marius's quest for spiritual fulfillment among the things of this world.  Each one prepares him to encounter the next; not only does he  learn the limitations of each stage, he learns greater skills of  apprehension and comprehension with which to grasp the next one.  As Bildungsroman, the novel employs these ladderlike structures  to focus on Marius's "education. "  As a philosophical "romance, "  the novel replicates, in the changes represented by each series or  ladder, the characteristically romantic three-stage development from  a "natural" state, through a sophisticated, "worldly" state of knowl­ edge and experience, to a higher state of nature and innocence  regained. When the familiar romantic pattern is crossed with the  typological ladder, the middle term need no longer indicate an  antithetical or "fallen" state; it may merely indicate an intermediate  stage in an ongoing process of development.  For example, the "sentiment of maternity" as the "central type of  all love" (ME I, 22 )  is embodied first in Marius's own mother, then in  the sophisticated, complex, enigmatic Empress Faustina, the "mis­ tress and mother of palaces, " and finally in Cecilia, who refines mater­ nal love into simplicity once more, while devoutly imitating the  Virgin Mother. Even as a boy, Marius "came to think of women's  tears, of women's hands to lay one to rest, in death as in the sleep of  childhood, as a sort of natural want" (ME I, 2 1 ) . Flavian's pagan "nup­ tial hymn" begins with a meditation on "nature as the universal  mother" (ME I, 1 1 3  ). But a higher culture unexpectedly rejuvenates  even nature in the Antonine Christian church, a figure of maternity  who is "in truth no alien from that old mother earth" (ME II, 1 1 9 ) .   Marius's own death and presumed Christian burial, then, fulfill previ­ ous types of maternity. Ministered to by chaste Christian women, he  is assumed into the family of the church and into the earth, another  type of mother. 2   2.

They had hoped to serve their mother-tongue, to  raise her from her fallen, "divided" state, by reuniting the "learned  dialect" with the "colloquial idiom" (ME I, 9 5 ) . But Flavian's euphu­ ism, though it does manage to unite past and present by blending  archaisms with racy neologisms, does not manage to renovate the  language, for Flavian dies before the lovely Pervigilium Vereris is  finished. His "Pagan end, /1 represented by the corruption of the plague,  will stand in ironic relation to Marius's own death.

Pater explicitly places the pagan poem in relation to the Christian  service of worship as prefiguration to fulfillment; language too experi­ ences a rebirth in this general cultural renaissance.  Marius searches through the cities of the world for higher forms of  communal life, and those cities in the novel form another typological  series, each one real in its own right, each one pointing toward further  fulfillment in the next city and finally in the next world.3 His lifelong  quest is conveyed from the first in a secularized metaphor of the  apocalyptic marriage : he hoped for a vision, "as of a new city coming  down 'like a bride out of heaven' /1 (ME I, 32 ). From Pisa, Rome beckons  him onward. But no actual community fulfills "the great Stoic idea,  that we are all fellow-citizens of one city" (ME I, 2 1 9 ) .  Fronto's Stoic  discourse The Nature of Morals proposes all of humanity as a com­ monwealth of the mind, but Marius wants to find an actual commu­ nity, not an intellectual abstraction (ME 11, 1 1-12 ) .  Similarly, Marcus  Aurelius, extrapolating the idea of an unseen Celestial City, urbs  beata, from his own internal spiritual order, is powerless to establish  it in the actual world : the emperor "had but divined . . . t he void place  which other experience than his own must fill" (ME 11, 40) .

Neither of these approaches contradicts a typological reading; in fact, the  tropological level of the fourfold method accords well with a psychoanalytic reading.  3 .  Sudrann first noted the development of cities in the novel, identifying the "heavenly  city" as one of three central "images" of the hero's quest for the vision incarnate, whose  cumulative, unifying force lends coherence to the novel.

In  the next chapter he  sees the church in  Cecilia's house. The  Christians are certain that a heavenly city will descend at the end of  time, "like a bride out of heaven, " but they have faith as well that the  celestial city will to some extent be achieved in human time. Marius  finds their own community the highest development of earthly citi­ zenship to date. Throughout his works, Pater imagines true culture  as a sophisticated union of manners and morals, a "music, or kind of  artistic order in life, " a "mode of comeliness in things" (ME II, 4 ) .  Like  the conception of the Holy Family, the vision of a City of God provides  a "sanction"-both a spiritual model and the commmand to institute  that model ever more surely on earth-what Pater called in The Re­ naissance a "law" of development. And here, with exquisite wit, Pater  implies that the earthly, Christian community has come close to  establishing a real beata urbs, when he calls the culture of the early  church its "divine urbanity" (ME II, 1 2 1 ) .  The same sort of typological progression can be seen in the arrange­ ment of minor characters, especially guide-figures and companions :  the young priest of Aesculapius, Flavian, Marcus Aurelius, Cornelius,  and of course that "divine companion" whom Marius envisions on  the Sabine Hills, Each one defines both Marius's progress in actual  friendship and, more important, a stage in the development of his  capacity to internalize companionship, to conduct, in other words,  instead of an interior monologue, the modem "dialogue of the mind  with itself, " deplored by Arnold but represented by Pater in this novel  as the essential dialogue. Each companion represents the current state  of his interior order.  The young priest of Aesculapius, for example, as the "type" of  youth, first makes Marius conscious that he should develop his capac­ ity for vision (ME I, 3 8-39 ) .  Flavian personifies the charm of pagan  life, "the depth of its corruption, and its perfection of form" (ME I,  5 3 ) . His horrible death from the plague, though, is the emblem of a  "pagan end" in which corruption utterly obliterates perfection of form,  preserving nothing beyond an inconsolable alienation. Flavian's death  forces Marius onward in his quest. Each death, as Gerald Monsman  has observed, signals the end of one stage in Marius's pilgrimage and  the beginning of the next. 4  4. Monsman, Pater's Portraits, p. 49.  </page> <page sequence="50"> • 2 1 8  • Historical Novelty and Marius the Epicurean  Marcus Aurelius then teaches him to conduct a continuing "conver­ sation" with himself, a discipline through which one learns to com­ municate with the divine Logos internally (ME II, 46-47 ) .  Pater inter­ prets such a deepening subjectivity as "progress, " while explicitly  anticipating the role of Christianity in deepening that subjectivity  further:  Marius, a sympathetic witness of all this, might almost seem to have  had a foresight of monasticism itself in the prophetic future. With this  mystic companion he had gone a step onward out of the merely objective  pagan existence. Here was already a master in that craft of self-direction,  which was about to play so large a part in the forming of the human  mind, under the sanction of the Christian church. (ME II, 5 0-5 1 ) .  As in The Renaissance, Pater approves the development beyond the  "mere objectivity" of pagan existence and registers that development  as an aesthetic acquisition, the "craft of self-direction. "   But the emperor's commitment to the actual world falls short : he  tolerates evil, despises the body, and his philosophies seem mere  intellectual abstractions (ME II, 5 1-5 3 ) . Cornelius, the Christian  knight, is explicitly compared with Aurelius on these points and  deemed superior. Cornelius seems to Marius "a sort of outwardly  embodied conscience" (ME I, 2 3 3 ) . When searching for the secret  of his spiritual power, Marius wonders of what intellectual system  Cornelius in the "sensible exponent" (ME I, 2 34) ,  and when Marius  achieves his own willed belief in an external friend, he uses the same  word: his "divine companion" seems the "necessary exponent of our  own and the world's life" (ME II, 68 ) .   In  this scene on the Sabine Hills, Marius does in  fact achieve his  vision by multiplying his own consciousness exponentially; through  a series of projections, as we have seen, he manages to envision, first,  companionship on his journey and, finally, a permanent and divine  friend. As Marius experiences his visionary projection, the narrative  commentary traces the history of belief in this "reasonable ideal"  typologically, from the Old Testament idea of the Creator and the  Greek Eternal Reason, to the New Testament Father of Men (ME II,  68 ) .  Marius's ideal of companionship as brotherhood perhaps repre­ sents an even more humanized ideal. All these companions-the  young priest, Flavian, the emperor, Cornelius, and finally the "divine  companion"-seem, in a sense, epiphenomena!, representative re­ flections of Marius's consciousness. Pater's narrative strategy here  </page> <page sequence="51"> Typological Ladders · 2 r 9 ·  projects Marius's internal "dialogue" outward, externalizes and fic­ tionally imagines it as interchange between characters ( though actual  dialogue is notoriously absent) .  In this novel the central character may  be known-and learns to know himself-through the "company" he  keeps.  6 · Christian Historicism  All Marius's "sensations and ideas" are arranged in these narrative  sequences, which I have called typological ladders. Marius climbs,  step by step, through earthly embodiments ever closer to spiritual  fulfillment. Pater emphasizes this serial structure by multiplying it on  every level of the plot. Critics have sometimes missed its organization  entirely because of the deeply textured surface of the narrative, the  associative procedures of Marius's consciousness, and the nineteenth­ century narrative commentary. 1 But these mediating layers of texture,  though much less schematic than the typological ladders, nevertheless  keep the typological dialectic active in other ways .  The nineteenth-century commentary reinforces the novel's serial  organization by repeatedly calling attention to the structure of histori­ cal analogy. But at the same time the narrator emphasizes the secular­ ized transformations that characterize typology in a specifically nine­ teenth-century vision. And finally, this narrative commentary  complicates the forward motion of the typological ladders through its  retrospective stance, shifting rapidly back and forth between memory  and prefiguration, nostalgia and anticipation, making the dialectical  movement of typological historiography and narration an activity of  the text on a more intimate level.  I .  T. S. Eliot brutally dismissed the possibility that Pater was in control of his  structure, and he set the tone for much modem criticism of the novel when he called  it an "incoherent . . . h odge-podge. "  Monsman notes Eliot's remarks (Pater's Portraits,  pp. 6 5-66) and the relatively recent willingness of critics to champion the structural  coherence of the novel. My argument-that the novel is emphatically structured,  though the structure is obscured by a complicated texture of mediating layers-draws  not only on Monsman's analysis ( ibid., pp. 6 5-97) but also on Billie Andrew Inman,  "The Organic Structure of Marius the Epicurean, "  Philological Quarterly 41 (April  1 962) ;  Knoepflmacher, Religious Humanism; James Hafley, "Walter Pater's 'Marius'  and the Technique of Modem Fiction, " Modern Fiction Studies 3 ( 1 9 5 7 ), 99-109; David  Delaura, "Marius and the Necessity of Religion, " in Hebrew and Hellene, pp. 263-8 5 ;   and esp. Shuter ( "History a s  Palingenesis, " pp. 41  l-2 1 ), who calls Marius Pater's "most  ambitious treatment of historical palingenesis . "   </page> <page sequence="52"> 220 • Historical Novelty and Marius the Epicurean  Thus, in Part the Fourth, interpreting the mature ritual of the early  church, Pater directly articulates the "law of development" under  which earlier, historically specific forms are seen in retrospect as  prefiguring later and more highly developed but structurally analogous  forms. He figures the Christian church as both the embodiment and  the executor of that law:  The faithful were bent less on the destruction of the old pagan temples  than on their conversion to a new and higher use . . . A lready, in accor­ dance with . . . m aturer wisdom, the church of the "Minor Peace" had  adopted many of the graces of pagan feeling and pagan custom; as being  indeed a living creature, taking up, transforming, accommodating still  more closely to the human heart what of right belonged to it. In this way  an obscure synagogue was expanded into the catholic church . . . R itual,  in fact, like all other elements of religion, must grow and cannot be  made-grow by the same law of development which prevails everywhere  else, in the moral as in the physical world . . . In a generous eclecticism . . .   and as by some providential power within her, she gathers and serviceably  adopts, as in other matters so in ritual, one thing here, another there,  from various sources-Gnostic, Jewish, Pagan-to adorn and beautify  the greatest act of worship the world has seen. (ME II, 1 24-27 )   This "law of development" fosters larger, more complex, "eclectic, "  and humanistic institutions. Indeed, the young church represents an  "expanded" order as well as a more human one, "accommodating still  more closely to the human heart what of right belonged to it. " These  are secularizing principles, approving human rather than divine right,  conflating the moral and the physical worlds, regarding a cultural  institution as a natural, "living creature. "  And the notion here that  religion "must grow and cannot be made" emphatically challenges  the orthodox conception of divinity, opposing historical evolution to  immediate creation ex nihilo.  Pater here attempts nothing less than the synthesis of a providential  understanding with an evolutionary understanding of historical  change. This powerful and paradoxical attempt is profoundly indica­ tive of the imaginative trials of the late nineteenth century. In Pater's  synthesis, cultural forms are simultaneously seen to be the expression  of a providential order-to be shaped from without-and to grow  organically from within. Pater rejects organicism as a theory of aes­ thetic creation, as we have seen, because it does not do justice to the  supreme self-consciousness of the creative artist. But he finds it more  congenial as a theory of historical change, through which even aes­ thetic objects are continually recreated. Even so, Pater's theory of  </page> <page sequence="53"> Christian Historicism · 221  •  historical development is not purely organicist, but a complex synthe­ sis that allows him to preserve the divine order without personalizing  its "artist" ;  to reconceive the notion of a transcendent creator who is  immanent in history at times of periodic intervention, as a creative  power internalized within a shapely, periodic process; and therefore  to conceive divinity neither as an external presence nor as an absence,  but as an internal force, a spirit no longer beyond but within creation.  Thus, in the passage above, the divine function has been internalized  by the evolving historical institution of the church, and its paradoxical  status is registered in the tension of a metaphor: "as by some providen­ tial power within her. "  That metaphor testifies to the creative power of the narrative artist,  who may at first be suspected of usurping the place of the divine  "artist . "  The divinely creative or "aesthetic" function does not neces­ sarily disappear when God "disappears, " but its continued visibility  depends, in other novels, on the novelist overtly assuming the role of  "providence" in his fictional world or, in this novel, on the novelist  assuming the role of one who sees divine order still evident in the  "actual" world.2  The voiced commentary of this novel does not repre­ sent the "maker" of this fictional "world, " only its historian and  interpreter. What historical process has internalized, this novelist  externalizes again, bringing out of the vast historical continuum one  representative age, typical of the times when culture renews itself.  The narrator does not presume to replace the divine artist, but to  perform an exegetical function. Culture, not Nature, is the great Book  of inscribed revelation to be interpreted; or rather, Pater's synthesis  of organic and providential models has the added effect or reinterpret­ ing the cultural as the "natural" growth.  The narrative ostensibly presumes to represent history, mimetically  to reproduce the shape of something already shaped. Though this  presumption is disingenuous (as we shall see), it helps us specify the  particular role the nineteenth-century narrative commentator takes  toward developments in the second-century world Marius inhabits.  Those developments take place in stages describing the progress from  a state of nature, through a "worldly" state of culture, to a higher state  of communal self-consciousness in which culture becomes "natural"  once more. While the narrative structure represents the shape of his­ torical time, the nineteenth-century narrator represents the higher  2.

In other words, the narrator of this novel does not adopt the role  of providence, external and prior to creation, but again represents the  creative function absorbed within history itself.  Accordingly, the narrative commentary reinforces the novel's typo­ logical structure with local, more intimate narrative devices that oper­ ate on the level of the sentence. The formal dynamic of prefiguration  and fulfillment is profoundly a part of this narrative vision. Let us  look in detail at one example from the passage we have already been  examining. Again, Pater figures the early Christian church as an em­ bodiment of historical process :  Gathering, from a richer and more varied field of sound than had remained  for him, those old Roman harmonies, some notes of which Gregory the  Great, centuries later, and after generations of interrupted development,  formed into the Gregorian music, she was already . . . t he house of song­ of a wonderful new music and poesy. As if in anticipation of the sixteenth  century, the church was becoming "humanistic, " in an earlier, and unim­ peachable Renaissance. Singing . . . b urst forth . . . ;  the Jewish psalter,  inherited from the synagogue, turning now, gradually, from Greek into  Latin-broken Latin, into Italian, as the ritual use of the rich, fresh,  expressive vernacular superseded the earlier authorised language of the  Church.(ME II, 1 2 5 )  Pater has placed the outer limits of his narrating perspective far beyond  the temporal domain of the novel. This vertiginously "long view"  retrospectively encompasses not just the second century A.D., but also  the sixteenth and the nineteenth centuries-indeed, all ages of history  up until the present time of Pater's writing.  Within this spacious order, the narrative distinguishes between  separate ages, stressing differences in their degrees of development  while at the same time emphasizing the structural analogies between  them. Thus, from the vantage of present fulfillment in the second  century ( "gathering . . .  " ), this passage remembers the prefiguring  synagogue (as well as pre-Gregorian music) and anticipates ( "centuries  later . . . " ) further fulfillments of a developed, "humanistic" sort. The  very structure of these sentences enacts the typological dialectic of  prefiguration and fulfillment. Their temporal layers shift against one  another, switching back and forth between prediction and retrospec­ tion, preserving several levels of past time at once, reviving them in  juxtaposition with the second-century present and with various levels  of the historical future beyond that present.  </page> <page sequence="55"> Christian Historicism · 223 •  The "future" envisioned here in retrospect will be conscious of the  secularizing tendency inherent in history's "law of development, " for  the humanizing principle of that law, when raised to the level of cultural  self-consciousness, will be recognized as "humanistic. " The quotation  marks emphasize that the principle will know itself as such in the pe­ riod later to be known as "the" Renaissance, though the sixteenth cen­ tury is only one renaissance in Pater's historical (and typological ) series.  Already, in fact, the church is becoming "humanistic, " though Pater's  quotation marks also ironically call attention to his anachronistic use  of that term here. The Christian church itself, then, is a type, prefiguring  a later "unimpeachable"  Renaissance, Pater's own favorite metaphor  for historical palingenesis, a process that always blends the absolutely  permanent and the absolutely new. The Christian church embodies the  very principles that will eventually lead culture beyond Christianity.  That shift will occur not through periodic intervention of the divine in  history, but through historically periodic renewal on these Christian  principles, renewal that is always a survival or a revival of earlier forms.  Typologists read history as the great Book in which divinity reveals  itse lf, and they read with a certain interpretive will . The search for anal­ ogous, progressive stages of development is motivated by the desire to  adduce evidence of a divine presence in history, and finding such pat­ terns yields a reassured faith in that presence. Typology, like every other  hermeneutic method, participates in this peculiar paradox of interpre­ tation-and gains thereby a "creative" power-that what is sought de­ termines what will be discovered. To establish faith in the divinity  within history, in other words, is both the motive for and the inevitable  result of this particular method's version of the hermeneutic circle. For  this reason, both change and stasis reinforce the typologist's predeter­ mined faith-because divine power may be felt both in the gradualized  progress marked by successive fulfillments and also in its apparent op­ posite, the steadfast, unchanging analogous structure replicated by each  stage. There is, then, within the method, an incentive to multiply both  difference and similarity, thereby creating a pattern whose greater com­ plexity testifies to the greater presence of divinity within history. A  typological novelist who presumes only to be interpreting may in all  good faith at the same time be exercising a creative function. In typol­ ogy, historical interpretation, exegesis of texts, analysis, and aesthetic  creation of structure and texture intersect, perpetuating a love of design  for its own sake, because signs of power reside in the complications of  the design itself.  Typology in this sense always potentially verges on a kind of aes­ theticism at the same time that it ostensibly remains a purely histori- </page> <page sequence="56"> • 224 • Historical Novelty and Marius the Epicurean  cal method. If this line of argument should suggest that in the nine­ teenth century the method could be used self-consciously to unite  historicism and aestheticism-generating at once a historicist aes­ thetic and an aesthetic historicism-it will only emphasize the appeal  of the method for Pater. The spiritual and the aesthetic dimensions of  typology, indeed, are very close. In fact, its self-conscious recognition  of an aesthetic dimension is a part of its versatility. The method  aspires to be an art, not a science of interpretation, a sophisticated  exegetical system in which history may be read aesthetically, as if it  were a text; the typological text may be read as a representation of  history; and all texts may be read historically, like any other cultural  artifacts, in analogical and developmental relation to one another.  7 · Literary History as "Appreciation"  Pater's novel explores these textual implications of typology and at  the same time calls attention to its own status as literary text. Formal  manifestations of typological thought become more frequent, more  explicit, and more varied in technique as the novel progresses to its  typological denouement, the Christian service in Cecilia's house. That  crucial chapter, for example, as well as the one before it, is introduced  with biblical epigraphs that themselves interact typologically.  The first, from the Old Testament Book of Joel 1 2 : 28 ), prefigures the  second, from the New Testament Acts of the Apostles 1 2 : 1 7 ) . Thus  "your old men shall dream dreams" is fulfilled, both literally com­ pleted and transcended, by the structurally analogous addition, creat­ ing an expanded, later textual order that comprehends both: "your old  men shall dream dreams and your young men shall see visions. " 1   Epigraphs like these, prompting a typological reading, were common  in the period, especially in the visual arts. 2 But a larger point is at  1 .  In theiI biblical form, both verses contain both clauses; the Old Testament verse,  then, is fulfilled by simple repetition within the new context (though the order of  clauses is reversed in Acts 2: 1 7 ) .  Pater's choice to split the verse and divide it between  his two chapters calls attention to its halves as stages in a developmental progression.  2. See Sussman, Fact into Figure, pp. 49, 5 6. A good example is Millais's Christ in  the House of His Parents ( "The Carpenter's Shop" ), which shows the boy Jesus with a  wound in his hand, prefiguiing the stigmata. The painting was originally exhibited with  no title but with the words of Zechariah 1 3 : 6 :  "And one shall say unto him, what are  these wounds in thine hands? Then he shall answer, Those with which I was wounded  in the house of my friends. "  </page> <page sequence="57"> Literary History as 11 Appreciation" · 225  •  stake here, for this is one of many ways the text of Marius calls  attention to itself as text. In this case the epigraphs set in motion an  awareness that whole texts, when viewed in "historical retrospect, "  can be seen to relate to one another typologically, the later text fulfill­ ing and completing the earlier one. Pater develops, in other words, a  typological framework for the novel's dense intertextuality.  This framework demonstrates his view that texts "appreciate"­ literally gain in aesthetic value-over the historical course of their  reception, their active appreciation by later readers . When a text is  appreciated in a later age, it is at once appropriated, preserved, and  transcended, as it is gathered up into a more complex order. Pater's  novel imitates this historical process of literary "appreciation"  through its densely intertextual form.  The historical pastiche of Marius the Epicurean is neither random  nor merely stylized. 3  Instead it is Pater's most articulated literary  experiment in the composite form we have come to associate with  his aesthetic historicism. In addition, and as usual, Pater casts an aura  of generalized value around each concrete work of art he revives from  the past. In literary terms, one consequence of this is that each quoted  fragment possesses not only a concrete textual value but also a generic  value. Because the narrative form of Marius the Epicurean represents  the compendious perspective within which all these earlier texts are  gathered, appreciated, and therefore both historically and aesthetically  transcended, the novel becomes a veritable encyclopedia of genres, an  appreciation of the history of literary change at the moment of its  absorption in the modernist anthology, the repository where "frag­ ments are shored" against the ruin of the end of time.4  The novel as a whole plays on this concept in several ways . Just  before Marius dies, his life is described in a metaphor that compares  his hoped-for vision to the recovery of a unified text :  Throughout that elaborate and lifelong education of his receptive powers,  he had ever kept in view the purpose of preparing himself towards possi- 3. In contrast to mine, see Rene Wellek's view of "the limitations of 1 9th-century  aestheticism, . . . i ts Alexandrian eclecticism, which made it impossible for the age to  create a style of its own and which encouraged historical masquerade" in A History of  Modern Criticism, 1750--1950, vol. 4: The Later Nineteenth Century (New Haven,  Conn. : Yale University Press, 1 96 5 ), p. 399.   4.

(ME II, 2 1 9-20)  The "ampler vision" hypothesized here would incorporate his partial,  earthly experience within a completed, transcendent spiritual order.  At his death he has not achieved this "ampler vision, " though he dies  still hopeful; perhaps death will bring the transcendence he seeks .  This remains, at the end of the novel, a crucially open question. 5  However, transcending both Marius's life, which ends as the novel  ends, and the cultural history of Christianity, which continues beyond  it, Pater's narrative form supplies that "ampler vision. " Like the "lost  epic, recovered at last, " it takes up into itself and comprehends not  "this world's delightful shows" but their literary analogue, "the scat­ tered fragments of a poetry, till then but half understood. " The novel's  vast inclusiveness may be seen, then, in formal strategies other than  the shifting temporal layers that enact the narrator's access to any  conceivable past age of history; it may be seen also in this intertextual  comprehensiveness. The narrative form encompasses and transcends  other literary forms, recontextualizing them as past forms. Thus the  narrative form of Marius imitates the principles of historical develop­ ment advanced in Pater's description of the growth of ritual, in which  the Christian order was seen to absorb and supersede the pagan. By  incorporating and transcending the world of second-century literature  within its nineteenth-century literary order, this novel makes a simi­ lar point about the "growth" and development of literature. The inter­ polated second-century fragments stand in relation to the novel as a  whole as an "old" testament to a "new. " The novel gathers up the  disparate texts of the second century and " comprehends" them-both  incorporates them in a larger, later order and understands them "at  last, " by subjecting them to its historicizing framework and per­ spective.  The novel historicizes those second-century texts in part by regard­ ing them as earlier developments in a long, continuous literary history,  comparing, for example, Apuleius with Swift and Gautier (ME I, 60- 5 .  The possibility of transcendence is belied by the fact that Marius recreates his  original innocence and receptivity through an act of metaphorical self-obliteration,  wiping "the tablet of the mind white and smooth" once more. On the other hand, the  novel argues forcefully that the very possibility of transcendence depends on presenting  such a tabula rasa for "whatsoever the divine fingers might choose to write there" (ME  II, 220 ) . (Note the inscriptive sense of receptivity here. )   </page> <page sequence="59"> Literary History as "Appreciation" • 227 •  6 1  ) .  Regarding the earlier texts as parts of a larger, later whole reduces  their priority, and the greater literary self-consciousness represented  by that later capacity for inclusiveness would, of course, represent a  positive formal value here. But the novel also historicizes second­ century literature by advancing a further judgment regarding the rela­ tive value of entire genres of literature. Many of the second-century  texts are allegories, and by enclosing and transcending them this novel  seems to imply that its own historicizing, typological, "realistic"  techniques represent a higher as well as a later development of litera­ ture. The novel as a genre typically sanctions historical, mediated  access to the spiritual over a more directly spiritualizing mode of  access, such as the symbolic, metamorphic, or allegorical, and Pater's  novel makes that generic sanction a self-conscious part of its particular  narrative form.6  If the novel as a whole suggests that allegory has been superseded  by more historicizing forms, Marius as protagonist exemplifies the  process of "outgrowing" allegory on the individual level. The allego­ ries of the "Golden Book" that stimulated him as a young man to  delight in metamorphosis-in those "sudden, unlooked-for changes  of dreams"-do not serve, as he grows older, to explain how (or  whether) such transformations can actually occur. Other allegories,  such as the tale of Cupid and Psyche, prompted a search for the ideal,  and that search continues all his life, culminating in his experience  on the Sabine Hills, after which Marius decisively commits himself  to search "for the equivalent of that Ideal among so-called actual  things" (ME II, 72 ) .  In this climactic scene, Marius definitively  chooses, after a "lifelong education of his receptive powers, " an inter­ pretive bias. He decides to believe in the presence of a "divine" com­ panion, and he decides, once and for all, "to hold by what his eyes  really saw. " In other words, he raises his lifelong temperamental bias  to the level of self-conscious theory, and with this newly consolidated  self-consciousness he establishes an interpretive will, a principle of  reception, "the will as vision. "  In the two chapters that directly follow this crucial experience,  Marius, explicitly renouncing allegory, sees a typological vision.  These twin chapters are linked by a common title, "Two Curious  Houses, " and by those typologically related epigraphs : "Your old men  shall dream dreams and your young men shall see visions. "  Let us  return briefly to these chapters, for they join the problem of interpre- 6.

In the first curious house, two older men appeal to Marius's imagina­ tion with their allegorical discourses. These are none other than Lu­ cian and Apuleius, " the literary ideal of his boyhood" (ME II, 76 ) .   Lucian's Halcyon examines the divine power of metamorphosis, and  in that dialogue Socrates concludes that it is as easy for the gods "to  refashion the form of a woman into that of a bird" as for children "to  take wax or clay, and mould out of the same material many kinds of  form" (ME II, 8 3 ) .  Apuleius's discourse On the God of Socrates ad­ vances the Neoplatonic notion of "a hierarchy of divine beings, associ­ ating themselves with particular things and places, for the purpose of  mediating between God and man" (ME II, 88 ) .  These "divine powers  of a middle nature" are "interpreters" between heaven and earth,  coming down to man from above (ME II, 89 ) .  At first, Marius is temp­ ted to believe, to receive this mystical theory, but he objects because  it is too easy; it "assumed the thing with too much facility, too much  of self-complacency" (ME II, 90 ) .  He turns away from these "mystic  essays after the unseen, " for after all, "to indulge but for an hour  fantasies, fantastic visions of that sort, only1eft the actual world more  lonely than ever . . . . F or himself, it was clear, he must still hold by  what his eyes really saw (ME II, 90) .   Directly after rejecting the old dream of allegory, Marius sees the  "visionary scene" of the church in Cecilia's house, a "vision" of youth  and renewal, a visible and historically concrete vision, not a mystical  vision (ME II, 105-6 ) .  The scene fulfills, in the typological sense, the  full extent of his life's progression, "accumulating all the lessons of  his experience since those first days at White-Nights" (ME II, 97 ) .  In  this visionary moment it is as if the whole narrative unfolding of his  development were telescoped, conflated, reduced to a single point in  time, a single image, in exact accordance with his newly achieved  self-consciousness, or will : " translated here, " that is, "as if in designed  congruity with his favorite precepts of the power of physical vision,  into an actual picture" (ME II, 97 ) .  This is the single point of imagistic  or scenic typology in the novel, appropriate here to emphasize the  visual actuality of this particular kind of "visionary" moment. Marius  interprets the scene as if he were looking at an early Pre-Raphaelite  painting; he reads and interprets its typology. In fact, the "Two Curi­ ous Houses" form a sort of diptych, whose epigraphs prompt the  </page> <page sequence="61"> Literary History as "Appreciation" · 229 ·  expanded typological interpretation that begins in a reading of the  actual scene. A crescendo of typological techniques has been building  toward the unmistakable explicitness of the chapters' epigraphs, and  Pater chooses this place in the narrative, as we have seen, to use his  most explicit typological language (ME II, 97 ) .   By renouncing allegory, Marius does not in the least renounce the  ideal dimensions of his quest. Typology, too, involves progress toward  a spiritual realm, though its access to the spirit is mediated by the  physical . It stresses "horizontal" or linear progress in time, not the  allegorical, symbolic, metamorphic, or "vertical" translation from one  state to another. But the typological method of reading involves a  "vertical" motion as well, toward a state of spiritual perfection tradi­ tionally conceived as beyond this world and beyond historical time.  This way of reading earthly experience, then, accommodates both past  and future within historical time, simultaneously points "up" toward  a higher, timeless reality and "down" to its foundations in the con­ crete, time-bound world.  What Marius sees in Cecilia's house also links the human to the  divine, but the mediating agents are not Neoplatonic angelic interme­ diaries but concrete, visible, historically specific forms. This progres­ sive fulfillment in the direction of spirituality does not entail abrupt  metamorphic transformations, but gradual historical change :  It was the old way of true Renaissance-being indeed the way of nature  with her roses, the divine way with the body of man, perhaps with his  soul-conceiving the new organism by no sudden and abrupt creation,  but rather by the action of a new principle upon elements, all of which  had in truth already lived and died many times. (ME II, 9 5-96 )   The "divine way" i s  also the historical way. Holding by "what his  eyes really saw, " Marius's interpretive will binds him to contemplate  spiritual realities through the mediation of their most perfect earthly  forms.  To circumvent these actual earthly forms in favor of ideal, immedi­ ate spiritual solutions might be reserved as "a fine, high, visionary  consideration, very remote upon the intellectual ladder, just at the  point, indeed, where that ladder seemed to pass into the clouds, but  for which there was certainly no time left just now by his eager interest  in the real objects so close to him, on the lowlier earthy steps nearest  the ground" (ME I, 1 32 ) .  For now, Marius remains on the "lowlier  earthy steps nearest the ground, " instead of soaring "into the clouds.

In this two­ chapter debate on the relation of the human to the divine, Marius  abandons hope of immediate access to a transcendent realm and de­ cides to read actual experience for signs of divinity gradually unfolding  within historical time. An interpretive language of types in the narra­ tive grows directly from the creative power of this "will as vision, "  and Marius then discovers what he seeks. Marius self-consciously  wills a certain sort of vision: visible, concrete, and historical-not  "mystical . "  Apuleius's allegorical dream had suggested "a celestial  ladder, a ladder leading from heaven to earth" (ME II, 90), but Marius's  vision suggests an earthly ladder, leading from earth to heaven.  We, too, in the course of our reading, must learn to adopt  principles of typological interpretation if we are to understand the  significance of Marius the Epicurean, and especially the implications  of its closure. All the narrative features we have examined-the  overarching analogies between paganism and Christianity, between  second-century Rome and nineteenth-century England; the outright  narrative predictions of the future; the juxtaposed and shifting layers  of narrative time; and especially the serial dynamics of the plot,  through which the cultural milieu surrounding Marius develops in  "typological ladders"-all of these features work together to set up  a powerful prefigurative momentum. As we gradually begin to  perceive this temporal logic, we develop the expectation that pat­ terns of past experience, already repeated and partially fulfilled  within the narrative present, will be repeated again and further  fulfilled in the future, beyond the time of the narrative frame. That  expectation, which amounts to "faith" of a certain aesthetic sort,  is simply the result of learning to read the narrative form typologi­ cally. Just as we begin to understand that analogical relations  progressively unfold throughout the novel, we also understand  the implication that these patterns will continue in historical  development even after the novel ends. The elaborate multiplication  of analogy involved in Pater's typological ladders establishes a  horizontal and vertical momentum that carries the reader's imagina­ tion, with the force of its logic, into the historical future.  Any expectation that the "typological momentum" of the novel  will carry us out of time into eternity is of course thwarted; in its  secularized form, typological momentum points only toward further  fulfillment in the historical future, not toward apocalypse. To main­ tain his synthesis of evolutionary and providential orders in human  history, Pater's secularized typology must set aside creation ex nihilo  as well as apocalypse-Christian concepts of the beginning and the  </page> <page sequence="63"> Literary History as "Appreciation" · 23  I •  end of time-and stay firmly fixed "in the middest, " in history.7 Thus,  the typological ladders point toward heaven but remain on earth,  fixed in their concrete foundations. But their teleological force is  nonetheless relentless. The notion that the typological momentum  continues, once established, is as old as Augustine : "All these things  that we read as having been foretold and fulfilled in the past are still  being done under our eyes in the present. "8 Even though the notion  of an apocalyptic end of time seems more and more remote, faith can  remain in the steadfast progress toward it.  The individual death of the protagonist is one version of the conven­ tional novelistic, secularized apocalypse. But Marius 's death is hardly  apocalyptic, even in novelistic terms, since like his "vision" it is the  perfect fulfillment of his life : tentative, skeptical, receptive, gradual,  silent. Pater chooses not even to represent apocalypse as an internal  phenomenon, in the form of a full revolutionary conversion of Marius  to Christianity. Despite his belief in the "divine companion, " despite  his "vision" in Cecilia's house, Marius does not in the end convert  fully, internally, as an expression of his own will. Essentially passive,  he is taken up, without his expressed wish or consent, into the Chris­ tian communion. As his ancestors were buried long after their pagan  "ends, " Marius officially becomes a Christian only after his death,  and in the retrospective interpretation of 0thers .  The impetus to make Marius explicitly Christian comes not from  within Marius himself, as a feature of his own development, but from  without, from the surrounding community. The central focus of the  novel, its plot of individual development, seems at the end to have  been subsumed by the plot of cultural development. This passivity on  Marius's part has caused frequent complaints about the closure of the  novel : that no progress has taken place, either in Marius's soul or in  the historical culture; that Pater evades the question of Christianity's  doctrinal exclusivity; that the conclusion is inconclusive.9  Marius  7.

But the  closure of the novel comes to seem both organically and historically  inevitable the moment we understand its concern to resolve issues of  greater scope than the religious commitment of one individual.  The total narrative form of this work encompasses the life story  of one illustrative individual in a much larger scheme. Its cultural  specificity is not mere "background" against which an individual fate  is staged, nor simply realistic detail textured in a certain density to  suggest historicity. In this novel the Zeitgeist has its own plot. The  "time-spirit" comes to life and develops within the individual soul of  Marius, but it also has a life and a will of its own. According to the  temporal logic of the novel, that life is understood to continue beyond  the end of Marius's individual life and beyond the end of the novel.  Telos, in its secularized version, becomes teleological momentum;  the apocalyptic "hereafter, " beyond the end of historical time, in its  secularized version becomes the time beyond the novel's closure. Even  the telos of narrative, the aesthetic finality of its closure, is not final,  for this closure remains emphatically "open, " bursting its fictional  boundaries and expanding into the "real" future beyond.  Read in the context of these principles, the ending of the novel  is powerful, even though Marius makes only the most ambiguous  commitment to Christianity. Pater does beg that particular question,  but he does so in order to demonstrate that the question should not  be put; the force and coherence of the narrative do not depend on such  commitment on the part of the individual. Marius dies, but his culture  lives on to express its own powerful commitment to Christianity as  a positive, historical fact.  Marius's individual will is subsumed in the will of the rising cultural  force : to make of him an expression of its most perfect development  at that time. At his death, he is no converted Christian, no Christian  martyr-the narrative tells us explicitly that he is not (ME II, 2 1 3- 14 ) .  He is and remains by nature "the Epicurean, " but he is also the  "last of his !pagan] race" (ME II, 207 ) .  His culture assimilates him,  converts him externally even though he himself never converts inter­ nally, culturally translates him into something he is not by nature,  "takes him up" into a new cultural epoch, exactly as he translated his  own ancestors into the Christian dispensation without their expressed  with regard to the ending of the novel suggested to me the idea of a specifically  "typological momentum, " though Monsman does not invoke a typological context (see  Pater's Portraits, p. 97 ) .   </page> <page sequence="65"> Literary History as "Appreciation" · 2 3 3  •  wish or consent. And this subsumption of Marius by his culture  recapitulates the way that the nineteenth-century narrative form com­ prehends the texts of the second century and the way that present­ day readers, following the logic of Pater's narrative form, try to com­ prehend-to understand, incorporate, and historicize-the text of  Marius the Epicurean . The truly apocalyptic or anagogic position in  this novel is held by the reader in the present, at the "end" of time. 10   An active conversion on Marius's part would falsify the historical  vision of the novel, as a passive conversion by his culture does not.  Pater must leave the soul of Marius "open, " for he must be both  Christian and yet not Christian, in order to represent both the pre­ Christian Epicurean and the post-Christian Epicurean, both of whom  could also be "essentially" Christian. Pater's "ambivalence" about  Christianity and about cultural progress is not indecision but a strong  synthetic tactic. He implies that progress has been made in Marius's  soul and in the culture around him: typological progress that is also  conservative of the essence of the past-in this case of paganism-as  future progress in the 1 880s would have to be in order to preserve the  "essence" of Christianity without its doctrines. To that end, Pater  emphasizes essential features of Christianity other than the ones most  emphatically cherished by the High Victorians. Instead of its ethical  or doctrinal exclusiveness, Pater stresses the cultural self-conscious­ ness of Christianity, its preromantic interiority, and especially its  historical sense, its sense of the "sacredness of time" (ME I, 6 ) .   "Marius could not remain Marius and renounce. ""  And Marius  does in the end remain Marius. He does not embrace Christianity;  Christianity embraces him, fulfilling, in the increasing self-conscious­ ness of cultural life around him, his pagan or "natural" instinct for  devotion, his love of ritual, his reverence for communal life . But  his soul has made progress on its life's journey-internal, spiritual  progress that recapitulates external, cultural progress, as the chapter  titles testify: just as Hadrian's phrase is superseded by Tertullian's,  Marius's "Animula Vagula, " his little, wandering life, has achieved a  higher state of awareness to become "Anima Naturaliter Christi­ ana "-his rational soul, by natural instinct Christian.  He is, at his death, still "unclouded and receptive, " conscious still  IO. Frye's description of the "anagogic phase, " when literature imitates "the total  dream of man . . . i nside the mind of an infinite man, " is very close to my sense of what  Pater's narrative frame accomplishes here.

The typological momentum  promises new cultural forms more various and more beautiful than  those of the second century-perhaps in the nineteenth century or  even in the twentieth. The logic of this narrative form instills a certain  faith that "these things are still being done in the present. "  Pater's  novel is committed to "the devout idea that the essence of Christianity  will somehow survive its doctrines, " the idea that there is in fact a  "religious phase possible for the modern mind. " In that modern phase,  essential Epicureanism and essential Christianity might survive to­ gether in a new, late-nineteenth-century aesthetic form whose tempo­ ral logic, now transvalued and secularized, remains nevertheless a  testimony to the paradox of its "Anima Naturaliter Christiana.
