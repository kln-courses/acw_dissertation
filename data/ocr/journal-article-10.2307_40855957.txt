INTRODUCTION The Early Minoan settlement of Myrtos lies on the summit of a hill called Fournou Korifi (Φούρνου Κορυφή), 3.5 kilometres east of the modern village on the south coast of Crete, 35°oo'N, 25°36Έ. The hill is 66 metres high and rises directly above the sea with a narrow beach at its base (PL iA). On the east it slopes very steeply into the Troulli valley, which is now cultivated with vines and tomatoes and supplied with water from wells sunk into its floor. This valley is likely to have been a water source for the Minoan settlement since there is no water on the site itself. To the north the Fournou Korifi hill is continued by a rising ridge (PL 2, behind the settlement hill). Gypsum, mined on the eastern slopes of the ridge earlier this century, pro- vided a building material used occasionally in the EM settlement. Immediately west of the site and just below it is a small marl plain which is bounded on its western side by another knoll. This in turn falls steeply to the Sarikampos valley, a counterpart to that of Troulli on the east. Fournou Korifi is capped with calcareous sandstone which provided most of the stone for walls and the numerous querns. The geological and botanical locations and the attempted reconstruc- tion of the palaeoenvironment are discussed in Appendices I and II. The site was discovered archaeologically1 on 16 August 1962 by Messrs Sinclair Hood (then Director of the British School), Gerald Cadogan and the writer, during a survey expedition in this part of Crete.2 Plentiful surface pottery included Early Minoan dark on light, Ά. Onou- phrios' and mottled Vasilike wares. Pithos fragments decorated with trickle patterns had Middle Minoan I links, so it was thought the site might extend down to this date, but not later. By contrast the settlement on the Pyrgos hill immediately east of the modern village appeared to begin equally early but continued to be occupied into Late Minoan times.3 The possibility of excavating an Early Minoan settlement seemed to the writer highly desirable. Only one other, at Vasilike, had been uncovered on a substantial scale and that in 1904 and 1906.4 After the highly successful EM levels from Mr Hood's stratigraphie excavations at Knossos5 and the rich evidence of the five EM tombs at Lebena6 there was an excellent case for the recovery of Early Minoan settlement architecture and finds. But the settlement area was small, c. 1250 sq. m. when uncovered, and the stony and rocky hilltop did not appear to promise extensive results. These, however, far surpassed expectations with the recovery in two seasons of a settlement plan with over ninety rooms or areas and large deposits of pottery and other finds. Excavation permits for 1967 and 1968 were kindly granted by the Greek archaeological authorities to the British School, who sponsored the excavation. We are much indebted to the School and its successive Directors, Mr A. H. S. Megaw and Mr P. M. Fraser, for thus facilitat- ing the excavation. Constant help and encouragement has been given by Dr Stylianos Alexiou, Ephor of Crete. Funds were generously provided by a British Academy research grant in 1968 and by the School from 1967 to 1970, while our main finances were given by the Cambridge University Faculty Board of Classics. Without this support we could not have begun.

The author is particularly grateful to John Boardman for many useful suggestions on the organiza- tion of the illustrations and for the considerable time he has given and the patience he has shown in editorial help. Mr Emmanouel Dhaskalakes of Myrtos owned the summit of Fournou Korifi and after a little discussion on a summer's afternoon in June 1967 he kindly agreed to sell a stremma (1000 sq. m.), give or take a little. The excavations were conducted in two seasons, from 25 July to 14 August 1967 and 10 July to 10 August 1968.1 The team in 1967 was : Mr L. H. Sackett, Drs K. Branigan, K. Wardle, Messrs J. Falconer, A. Harding and H. Hewitt. Miss M. Wright made drawings of small finds. In 1968 the excavators were Messrs G. Cadogan, K. Wardle, D. Evely, I. Sanders, N. Wilson, L. Bookless, H. Hewitt and Miss Penelope Mountjoy. Miss Rosemarie Brewer drew small finds, Mr M. Cameron helped with pottery and Miss Mary Wesley achieved palatial cuisine from exiguous resources. Mr Michael Lowe drew the obsidian. Mr K. Minto was archi- tect in both years and is responsible for the main site plan and contour plan of the site area. The final tracings of the site plan and the schematic plan were prepared by Miss Pat Quin and the levels were taken by Mr Dennis Sykes and Miss Quin. Mr P. Petrakis was vase mender through both seasons and during the study seasons of 1969 and 1970 in the museum at A. Nikolaos. By the end he had put together wholly or in part nearly seven hundred vases, the largest of which were found in over three hundred broken pieces. Mrs Warren organized the commissariat throughout the excavations and resolved all the inevitable and numerous μικρά •προβλήματα that the residence of a crowd of foreigners in a Cretan village involves. Our workmen from Knossos included the veteran Spiros Vasilakis and there were about eight Myrtiots. Andones Zidhianakes of Knossos was foreman. To all of them and to the ex- cavators and specialists who laboured on the shadeless site, sometimes attacked by strong, scorching, gritty winds, in temperatures well over H2°F (the figure in the shade) no small thanks are due. Only the gentle Libyan sea, stamnes of Vassilis Pratikakis' cool Troulli water, donkey-carried to the site, or eastern Crete's red wines offered alleviation. For hospitality we thank Manoles Dhaskalakes and another friend, the Papas of Myrtos. In our second season our headquarters were the roof and basement of his village house (the local police occupying the floor between) . Their encouragement and interest, like that of all the villagers and of Mr Andonis Papadhakis in particular, could only be but slightly repaid by their daily delighted inspections of our new finds under the care of Petros Petrakis. In the belief that the natural sciences have many applications which can irradiate and trans- form the excavated products of archaeology, providing much new information on human achievement in the past, the writer sought the aid of specialists in various disciplines. Their work is presented in separate appendices and use has been made of it in the interpretative sections which precede them. In the full knowledge that the equipment for radiocarbon and thermoluminescent dating, X-ray powder photographs, electron-probe, scanning electron microscope and trace element analyses, to say nothing of Cambridge University's Titan com- puter, are all highly expensive and require much time and skill, the writer is profoundly grateful to these colleagues. After the excavations all finds were transferred to the new museum at A. Nikolaos, where 1 Preliminary reports have appeared as follows: Antiquity 42 (1968) 88-9 and PI. 19 a, c.

Mr Petrakis' enormous contribution has been stated above. Mrs Warren drew and traced all the vases and traced all the small objects in this volume. In addition she typed the entire manuscript. The main finds are exhibited in A. Nikolaos museum, opened in 1970, and the reserved pottery and other finds stored in the apotheke of the museum. In April 1970 a further selection of thirty-six vases and small objects was taken back to the village for exhibition in the school with the per- mission of the Archaeological Service and support of Dr Alexiou : a small thank you to our friends beside the Libyan Sea. The site itself will soon have Crete's new southern axial highway (under construction 1969/70) running directly beneath it, so that it will be reached from Hierapetra in a few minutes. At present it is accessible in 40 minutes on foot from Myrtos along the seaside highway, which has widened the path the excavators used before dawn each morning; or one can arrive by turning off the old Hierapetra-Myrtos road at the Troulli junction. From here there is a ten-minute drive down to Fournou Korifi and the sea at the mouth of the Troulli valley, or preferably, a walk of half an hour.</page><page sequence="12">CHAPTER II. THE EXCAVATIONS The system of excavation was trenches and baulks, but the irregular configuration of the site made a strict grid plan impractical. The western and southern sides of the hilltop, comprising much of the occupational area, have fairly steep slopes (Pis. iB, 2), while a modern terrace wall* running across the southern slope indicated a further drop in level. The odd outcrop of rock or tough carob or pistacia bush added to the unevenness of the surface, which was littered with stones from house walls. In consequence it was decided to begin with three 5x5 metre trenches, A, B, C, separated by two 1 m. baulks, AB and BC, on the summit area and to extend from these with further trenches (usually 5x5 m.) and baulks as required until the site was uncovered. This produced the final trench plan shown in Fig. 1.2 A concordance of the main excavated levels and final room or area numbers is given on p. 346. All finds of complete vases and small objects were recorded by trench, and by position and depth (absolutely and by level) in the trench. The architectural plan (in pocket at end) was also drawn by trenches. There were several indications of walls at surface level on the summit area and in one place (Trench A) traces of an ashy level. Hence excavation was begun in this area in 1967. Rooms and Areas 8-10, 16-23, 27~3° and 32-40 were uncovered on this part of the site in trenches A, B, C, D, F, F Extension and G through to the cliff edge on the east, while Κ, Η and H Extension uncovered rooms and the west entrance passage on the north-west slope. At the surface of Trench D lay the Arc-Shaped Building (p. 92). The curved wall was visible at surface level before excavation and had suggested the possibility of a tholos tomb at the time of its first exploration,* though excavation showed that it served a different purpose. High winds causing painful dust storms made it necessary to abandon the summit trenches temporarily in the course of the first season of excavation. For this reason Trench Ε was laid out to test the slope below the summit. Walls and pottery were plentiful and showed that the settlement continued further south than the summit area. It was therefore decided to run a line of 8 χ 2 m. trenches (I, L, Ο and QJ at a still lower level across the southern slope below a modern terrace wall. It so turned out that L, Ο and Q ran at right angles through the well-preserved main rooms of the site (Rooms 77, 79-80, 88-89, 92)· Trench I, which produced possible frag- ments of a field wall, was clearly outside the western limits of the site, which ended towards the western end of L where a little of the westernmost room had been lost because ploughing and erosion had removed the deposit almost to the natural sandy rock. In the final days of the season Trench Ρ was run up the slope beside Q, to connect Trench Ε with the revealed parts of the southern rooms. The 1967 season showed that more rooms remained to be uncovered at the north end, along the whole western slope, in the central area between the summit rooms and Trench E, and along the southern slope. The work was completed in 1968 with four teams (supervisor, assistant and 1 The southern part of the site was cultivated during the 1 939-45 war. 2 Each trench was designated by a letter. The order of letters is irregular because as each new trench was begun the next letter was given and three or four trenches were always being excavated at the same time. I must express gratitude to Mr Mervyn Popham and Mr Hugh Sackett since our system at Myrtos was basically that employed by them at Palaikastro and Lefkandi, where I participated as a student. 3 BSA 59 (1964) 95. 4</page><page sequence="13">THE EXCAVATIONS ο Β i &gt; 's S d 5</page><page sequence="14">6 MYRTOS two workmen to each trench) operating simultaneously. The whole settlement was revealed and a test area was examined outside the site down on the southern slope (MM, OO and QQ,). A circular structure around a hollow in the rock was also investigated on the plain below the site to the north-west (p. 8gf.). Three and sometimes four stratified levels were revealed by the excavations. Details are cited where necessary in Chapter III but in general the character of the deposit was uniform over the site. First came the modern surface, strewn with sherds, querns and stones from walls, and the topsoil, often disturbed by ploughing, erosion or roots of bushes. Under this was a mixed fill containing traces of burnt or decayed red mudbrick, roof and wall plaster, stones from walls, earth and pottery fragments. This level, which varied from c. 10 to c. 50 cm. in the main southern rooms, showed few signs of heavy burning save towards its base where it merged in many rooms to a distinct burnt destruction level. This level contained several floor deposits of pottery, especially in Rooms 5 and 6, Room 25 and Area 26 in the north part, Rooms 17-18, 20, 22 on the summit, Pot Hole 33 in the centre, Rooms 79-82, 88-92 in the south-west and Rooms 53-54, 57, 58-60, and Passage 64-65 in the south-east. The natural calcareous sandstone rock floor had been blackened or reddened by the destruction fire in several rooms, while in many others a whitish clay floor, itself often burnt, had covered the rock. Up over the summit area in Rooms 27 and 28 an earlier, unburnt level lay over the rock below WEST EAST Fig. 2 Section Α-A, through and to west of Room 7. 1 Surface stones and topsoil. 2 Dark earth, many sherds. 3 White, almost sterile. 4 Light brown with small stones.</page><page sequence="15">fig. 3 Section B-B, through Area 2, Area 4, Room 5 and Room 6. 1 Surface and topsoil. 2 Whitish. 3 Dark burnt earth. 4 Light brown. 5 Pebble stratum. 6 Light brown with stones. 7 White, sterile, a Wall line projected from south, β Stone platform. 6 ^3^2 5 fig. 4 Section C-C, through Passage 1 '■ powdery. 3 Dark burnt 0123 * 1 1 j m</page><page sequence="16">topsoil. 2 east th stones. ^s 4 °^™ Im EAST 25 24 o__ ,m through Passage 13, Area 24 and Room 25. 1 Surface and topsoil. 2 Pinkish, lery. 3 Dark burnt earth, stones and pottery. 4 White, sterile.

Rooms 37-40 and 49-51 also contained pure Period I levels over the rock, with a mixed Period I-II fill above and on the surface. The only structure on the site later than the main settlement was the arc-shaped building with platform and bench within.

The history of the site is revealed in the representative sections. The positions of the sections are indicated by lines on the main plan (opposite p. 11). Figs. 2-4 illustrate the shallow eroded remains at the north end though even here remains of the heavily burnt destruction level are preserved. The westernmost wall in each of these sections illustrates a constantly recurring aspect of the architecture, the use of short, steep falls in the rock level against which the walls were built. Fig. 11 illustrates the most extreme example; building work may have been facilitated by cutting the soft rock slightly but there can be no doubt that these sharp changes of level were deliberately made use of. The sections of the summit area, Figs. 7 and 8, show walls of the settlement and the associated destruction debris on or above the rock. Above these buildings lies the arc-shaped structure, preserved two courses high, with a bench or platform within (Fig. 31), up to which ran a floor (PL 29B). Fig. 5 (north face of Trench B), in the section through Room 27, illustrates the whole period of occupation on the site.

The pottery from the lowest level was quite different from that of the burnt destruction level. It is proposed in Chapter VII that the lower level is Early Minoan IIA, the burnt level EM IIB. In the central area the section (north face of Trench C) through Room 37 (Fig. 9) illustrates the same sequence, the unburnt level 7 containing material of Period I and the burnt level 5 that of Period II. In the south-east the section (east face of U East) through Room 54 (Fig. 10), a magazine of pithoi and other large jars, shows its bench and the burnt destruction around it. The clay floor occurred here south of the bench and was burnt in the fire. At the north end of the room there is a steep fall in the rock level, once again utilized for the north wall of the room. The main west-east section1 through the well-preserved southern rooms shows the burnt destruction directly over the rock across the whole area (Fig. 6). The line of this section (north section of Trenches L, O and QJ ran directly below a modern terrace wall which had re-used tumbled stones from the settlement. Hence the masses of loose stones at the surface and upper level. Fig. 1 1 is a section at right angles to the main section; it shows the tumbled stones and the way the west- east walls here leaned over down the hill. The main west- east wall here utilizes the difference of rock level more than anywhere else and the floor of Room 71 stood at least 1.74 m. above that of the lower room, 76. The wall separating these two rooms was, at 2.02 m., the highest preserved on the site. It must originally have stood at least another 1.50 m. to pro- vide the south wall of Room 71. 1 Originally drawn, like that of Figs. 5 and 11-12, by Dr K. A.

The little section (Fig. 12) through the south wall of Room 79, the south wall of the settle- ment, shows its foundations (B) and the footway, 93, with stone slabs (A) which ran along the south front, just outside the buildings. Finally Fig. 13 (part of south face of Trench DD) shows the nature of the deposit in the south-east corner of the site. Here were two rubbish pits, 61, lying to the east of a large wall and outside the settlement, and 62, occupying the lower part of Room 62 which was shut off to the north by a wall. Pit 61 contained large numbers of river or beach pebbles (see also PL 7 A, section left of tub) and both pits were filled with Period I (EM IIA) pottery fragments, closely comparable with those of Rooms 27-28. The rubbish was apparently dumped here at the edge of the settlement when the buildings of the main occupational period, EM IIB, were erected in the southern area. We see then in the sections a main period of occupation over the whole site, terminating in a burnt destruction; it is preceded on the summit and central area by an earlier period (EM IIA) and followed in only one place, by the arc-shaped building on the summit. This building was totally unconnected with the settlement and was stratified well above it, though it did re-use its wall stones and a pithos. The settlement must now be described room by room.

THE SETTLEMENT From the plans it will be seen that the settlement consists of about ninety rooms or areas spread over the summit of the Fournou Korifi hill. Occupation is confined to the top part of the hill, covering the summit and slopes below to west and south ; on the north the hill falls away very steeply and on the east it is almost a cliff; hence the northern and eastern limits were naturally determined. On the west and south the exterior wall, where preserved, is continuous save for two entrances. The wall is not more than half a metre thick but clearly provided some measure of defence. On the south-east corner there is a possible bastion (p. 57). The two entrances are from the west up the steep slope to the summit and from the south where a long passage leads from the doorway up north to the summit rooms, with one jog in its course. The single entrance in the south front wall, which is almost fully preserved, combines with the inaccessibility of the north and east sides to suggest that defence may well have been one of the reasons in the placing of the site. The site plan shows that with the possible exception of the building, 1, at the north end, we are concerned with a single large building complex divided by the two passages mentioned (Passages 13-14 and 64-65) and by one other, the East-West Way, 67. The settlement in no way seems to be separated into individual houses since rooms and areas lead on one to another (though a number of rooms must have been entered from the roof). Nor is there any apparent division into blocks or fairly large houses as in the Late Minoan town plans of Gournia and Palaikastro.1 The divisions in these towns are achieved by frequent use of streets or passages, which are confined to three at Myrtos. It is much easier to see the rooms with known functions (for example kitchen and pithos magazine in the south-east, main rooms in the south-west (PL 3), shrine in the south-west corner) complementing each other within a single, large complex penetrated by the three passages, rather than as separate and self-sufficient living units making up the whole. If this description is accepted certain important architectural and possibly social consequences arise. These are discussed below in Chapter VI. The description of all rooms and areas generally has the following order: location of room or area; description of walls and other structures or features; function of room or area; finds. EW is east to west. NS is north to south, m. is metres. The plan shows the architectural remains of Periods I and II. Rooms and areas are num- bered in sequence for the whole site from north to south. The preserved remains of Period I are described first, the room numbers being taken from the site plan as a whole. Pots and small objects numbered in bold type refer to the catalogues in Chapters IV and V. Small objects referred to but not numbered are listed and discussed with the numbered pieces in Chapter V. PERIOD I (EARLY MINOAN IIA) Area below Rooms 27 and 28 The section through Room 27 (Fig. 5) shows an unburnt, sandy level stratified on the bedrock 1 Gournia Plan facing p. 26. PKU Plan I. BSA 60 (1965) PI. 65. II</page><page sequence="26">12 MYRTOS and below a burnt destruction floor. In most of the eastern half of the room the rock forms a natural hollow up to 0.40 m. deep, which was also filled with the yellowish sandy earth. The level continued northwards, again stratified, into the small triangular area immediately north of the room, and again southwards over the area of Room 28. In the north-east corner of this room the rock dipped down a little to the west, forming a hollow like that in Room 27. In Room 28 the sandy level again lay below a burnt level. The pottery from this earliest level was all fragmentary and quite different in character from that above. Rooms 27 and 28 as they now survive seem not to date from this Period I. The east wall of Room 27 and the eastern half of the south wall are built over the lowest level1 and since these walls are an integral part of the whole structure of 27 and 28 the rooms must belong to Period II. The remains of an earlier wall below and just east of the east wall of 27, on a slightly different line, probably belong with the earliest material. The matter is complicated however by the north wall of Room 27 and the triangular area immediately north, since the unburnt sandy level with the early pottery covered this area. Both the north wall of Room 27 and the south wall of Room 20, which enclose most of the triangle, are built on the rock and thus have the Period I level at their bases. But the north wall of 27 is an integral part of its room, the south-east parts of which were built over the Period I level. The south wall of Room 20 bonds into the west wall of 18 and there is no evidence for Period I within 20 or 18. It looks then as though all these walls, of 18, 20 and 27, were built (on the rock) down into the shallow Period I level, and over it in the east of 27. Within Period II changes were made in the walls of the triangular area (p. 33). From the area of Room 27 and the triangle to the north came about 24 kg. of sherds. From these Vasilike ware was entirely absent. By contrast the fine sherds were predominantly buff surfaced with dark decoration. These included over 50 fragments of Myrtos ware jugs with fan patterns, at least 23 hatched sherds from jugs (PL 30A, top row centre and right; PI. 35A, top left and centre, this last with joining fragments from the area of Room 28), a jug fragment with black horizontal bands on a fine yellow fabric, and three jug bases with a painted cross (PL 35A, below left). There were also fragments on the rock of a large Myrtos ware jug with the lip deliberately crinkled or waved like that of another such jug (P47) from the Period I deposit in Room 37. Two jug handles had raised bands (PL 35A, top right). Several fragments of bowls with diagonal bands also occurred (PL 30A, top left). With these painted pieces were only two scraps of fine grey polished ware. There was a fair amount of cooking pot ware mostly in the distinctive orange fabric with large white gritty inclusions. A fragmentary baking dish in this fabric, P2, was found just in front of the later opening in the north wall of the room. A few pieces of pithos were found, including a handle with pinched up sides (PL 35A, lower right), a Period I feature which occurs again in the South-East Rubbish Pits 61-62. There was a little red and dark painted ware; it included a fragmentary S profile bowl with a knob below the rim, P19, and fragments of a black painted piriform jar and a carinated cup of thin fabric, P35 (Fig. 42). From the area of 28 the unburnt level over the rock produced about 16 kg. of sherd material. Again there was no Vasilike ware. Decorated fragments of jugs and bowls were very common with about 30 hatched pieces and twice as much Myrtos ware with fan patterns (PL 33B, lower row; 31D, P17; 34C, P52; 3 1 A, top left, P9). One band handle from a jug turned up (PL 30A, bottom right) and one with a hole bored through for tying or suspending (PL 31 A, top right). Other finely decorated jug fragments are illustrated (PL 31 A, lower row) and there was one jug base with a black painted cross. Mixed with this material were about 27 pieces of fine grey 1 The level was up to 0.26 m. deep below the south wall and up to 0.40 m. below the east wall.</page><page sequence="27">THE SETTLEMENT I3 burnished ware including fragments of shallow open bowls with inturned rims, a fragment of another with a pair of holes for tying or suspending (like the jug above), pieces of a pyxis with raised collar (PL 33B, top row), two goblet feet, P44 and P45 (with dark burnish) (Fig. 41), a fragment of a conical bowl with grooves above the base like later Vasilike ware conical bowls (cf. PL 32A, lower row centre) and one dark grey burnished, slightly everted bowl rim (this with a reddish core and so not true fine grey ware), (PL 31 A, top centre). There was a fair amount of cooking pot ware, nearly all of it with orange fabric and white grits. The shapes were jars and bowls with circular section handles. A few feet from tripod cooking pots were present, including one with a vertical raised rib. Pithos fragments also occurred. In contrast to the abundance of dark on light painted ware there was only a little dark on red painted ware, including fragments of a jug and open bowls, and other pieces of the piriform jar of which pieces turned up in the area of Room 27. Neither this pottery nor the unburnt level continued in the rooms south of 28. In addition to the fragmentary pottery several interesting finds were made in this earliest level. They consisted of two flat oval loomweights (7 and 8), four spindle whorls (26-29), four pierced stone weights (35-38), a fine conch shell with the end broken and so usable as a trumpet (PL 84D, right) and the copper dagger (p. 213, 9, PL 74C-D) which lay in excellent condition at the top of the hollow in the north east of Room 28. From the east end of the tri- angular area north of 27 came two obsidian blades. Finally there were fragments of three potter's turntables. The finds demonstrate the existence of spinning and weaving and external trade for obsidian and metalwork (not practised at Myrtos) already in the first period of occupation. Areas 30-31 West of Rooms 27-29 is an extremely eroded area where the rock was almost exposed at the surface before excavation. 30 was probably an open area (becoming a rather uneven court in Period II). Between 30 and 31 are the much eroded remains of three stout east-west walls joining a long north-south wall which connects at the south end with the north wall of 38. The walls indicate that 3 1 consisted of at least three rooms originally. The southernmost of the east-west walls had three rough courses preserved, ht. 0.40 m., max. width 0.85 m. ; the next wall to the north again had three preserved courses, ht. 0.30 m., width 0.50 m. The northern- most was part of a large block forming the south end of 23. It was preserved to 0.35 m. in four courses. These stumps of east -west walls look much like the better preserved east-west walls of rooms 41-43 to the south. The north-south wall, where it forms the south-east corner of 31, may have been built before or after the big north wall of 38 since its corner and turn to the east are clearly visible within the big wall. Later a revetment was built up against the west face of the north-south wall in this south-east corner of 3 1 , increasing the width of the wall from 0.54 m. to 0.94 m. Its preserved height was 0.45-0.60 m. Between the central and southern east-west wall stumps in 31 a small cylindrical hole had been worked in the rock, 0.40 m. deep, EW 0.32 m., NS 0.22 m. Its function is not certain. It might have been a post hole, but nothing survived to demonstrate this. Water would soon have drained away and there was no burning to indicate a cooking hole. Very possibly it was used for cool storage, with a cover now gone. There were no floors in Areas 30-31 but the pottery from surface to rock, while not plentiful, was almost exclusively Period I. Decorated fragments included Myrtos ware fan patterns, hatched ware and horizontal and diagonal bands on buff. One sherd had white painted chevrons on a red ground. There were sixteen pieces of fine grey burnished ware, e.g., P20-21, bowl</page><page sequence="28">14 MYRTOS fragments, and P41, a tall goblet stem. The only diagnostic sherds beside the north-south wall on the west (i.e., south-east corner of 31) and in its foundation trench cut in the rock on the east were hatched and fine grey pieces. The one find of interest in 31 came from between the central and northern of the east-west wall stumps. It was a schematic human figurine of limestone (Fig. 95, 6, PI. 72D) and the associated sherds were of Period I. Rooms 37 to 43 South-west of Rooms 27 and 28 lie the group 38-40 with two large rooms or areas, 41 and 42, on the west. The western edge is lost since the rock is now exposed at the surface. The walls and stairway of 41-42 are built on the rock and go with Rooms 38-40 immediately to the east. These latter rooms (see below) are of Period I date and 41-42 must also belong to this time, though the ceramic evidence cannot prove it since the deposit was a mixed fill of Periods I and II. Room 41. Even as it survives this is a fair-sized room (EW 4.40 m., NS 1.28 m.) with a doorway in the north-east corner leading into the south part of 31, which may have been an open area with rough paving on the west to cancel the effect of the slope. The doorway is 1 .00 m. wide on the north side, c. 0.80 m. on the south, where the room is entered, with a flat upright stone as orthostat on each side; stones are built across to form the threshold. The north wall includes large and small stones (unworked as always) but has only two courses preserved (ht. 0.34 m. ; max. width 0.63 m.). The east wall is the west wall of Room 38 (see below). The south wall (width approx. 0.60 m.) had fallen stones on each side but survived to four courses (ht. 0.48 m.) at the east end where its junction with the east wall is badly preserved. In the south-east corner of the room there was an area of decayed mud brick below the modern surface, remains of the upper parts of the east and south walls. Room 42. This lies immediately south of 41 and as it survives is EW 3.40 m., NS 1.88 m. The north wall is the south wall of 41, the east is the west wall of 39 (see below). The stout south wall is in fact a stairway which leads up eastwards and continues on as a narrow stairway up the southern part of 40 before turning north into 37. It was about 1.00 m. wide but the surface slabs had been turned out of position by recent ploughing and stood on their edges on the south side of the structure with the plough marks visible on one slab (PL 4A). The stairway was built on slightly raised rock with additional stonework. Its preserved height was only 0.40 m. Room 43. A rather narrow room south of 42. As with 41 and 42 the west side had gone and furthermore only the eastern end of the south wall was preserved. The north wall is the stair- way of 42 which turns south and then east again along 40. The angle formed by the southward turn forms the little east wall of 43. The south wall was badly disturbed and had only two courses preserved (max. ht. 0.28 m.). There were no floor deposits in 41, 42, or 43 and the unstratified sherd fill, on the stratified evidence of Rooms 27-28 and the pure deposits in 37-40 (see below), was mixed. Period I material included fragments of fourteen bowls with pendent triangles (PI. 30C, top left), barred triangles (P37, Dish) (PI. 30B, bottom right), hatching (PI. 30C, top right), and diagonal bands (P14), as well as several pieces of fine grey polished ware (P4, Fig. 40). There was also a jug handle with raised band and a jug base with a painted cross. From Period II were several sherds of Vasilike ware, part of a strap-handled cup in pseudo- Vasilike ware (P364) and part of</page><page sequence="29">THE SETTLEMENT I5 another cup (P363), a fragment of a large amphora with raised rib on the collar like those of the final destruction deposits (p. 109), and fragments of S profile bowls. Cooking pot wares, baking plates and pithos fragments common to both periods were present and there was even a frag- ment of a late Venetian bowl with pale yellow glaze inside, from the surface level.1 Other finds included a finely carved steatite seal from the eastern end of Room 43, three biconically pierced stone weights and an unfinished one. Rooms 38-40 (PL 4B). These lie east of 41 and 42 and are interconnected. Their only entrance is by the stairway from 42 on the south-west corner of 38. The group was clearly built as a unit, on the bedrock. Room 38. An irregular shape with a short east-west projection in the north-east corner forming a small cupboard right in the corner. The projection as found appeared to be a small stairway of flat-topped stones leading up eastwards out of the room to the north end of 37. It is 0.40 m. wide and 0.60 m . high at the east end. That it was simply a short wall, however, eroded at the west end, cannot be ruled out. Its function would then have been to support the roof construc- tion. The north wall of the room survived up to 0.55 m. in four courses at its east end. Through the south side a doorway leads into Room 39. The rock floor of the room is uneven but the door- way (PL 4B) is well constructed, especially on the west where five courses of carefully placed stones are preserved. Width of doorway 0.68 m., ht. preserved 0.56 m. Room size: EW 2.74 m. (max.), NS 2.04 m. (max.). At the west end of the possible stairway lay the fairly complete globular jug, P51. Its being fairly complete and on a level area suggests that there may have been a floor here well above the bedrock, as there was with complete pots in Room 39. There was an obsidian blade at this level and a small pierced stone disk near the north wall in the level below on the rock. A biconi- cal stone weight was found in the south-west and two such weights, unfinished, on the east side in the lowest level. In this level, directly above the rock, were scraps of hatched painted ware, white grit cooking pot ware and one fine grey ware sherd. Room 3Q. This is roughly square, entered from 38 to the north (see above) and 40 to the south. EW 2.10 m., NS 1.70 m. (PL 4B). The doorway through the southern wall is narrower (width 0.48 m.) than that through the north but is again well constructed with a gypsum block forming the lowest course on each side. The wall, width 0.40 m., has three courses preserved east of the doorway, ht. 0.47 m. The east wall of Rooms 38 and 39 has five courses preserved on its west face, ht. 0.80 m., but is only 0.34 m. wide. It contained a gypsum block and a quern built into it. The west wall of 38 and 39 (east wall of 41 and 42) has up to five courses preserved, ht. 0.45 m., and is up to 0.77 m. wide. In its top surviving course in the south-east corner of 41 was a stone with a rough circle of shallow depressions round the flat top (see Plan). The stone would have been hidden when the wall was complete. On a patchy, white floor about 0.40 m. below the tops of the east and south walls ap- peared the two jugs, P57, P58 (Pis. 5A; 36C; 36D) and in the fill above were fragments of bowls with pendent triangles and dashes on the rim (PL 32D, top left, centre right, bottom right). Another shallow open bowl had solid lozenges, P22 (Fig. 39). In the level below the patchy floor part of the bowl with painted dashes on the rim was found, with a pair of small horns or lugs (PL 32D, top right) and a fragment of a similar bowl (PL 32D, bottom left). 1 Dr Alexiou suggested its date to me, comparing it with material from the fortress at Amnisos. Marinatos, Praktika (!932) 93 Fig. 11.</page><page sequence="30">l6 MYRTOS Vasilike ware was absent from both levels and dark painted vases were rare ; this and the pre- dominance of dark on light geometric decoration and eight scraps of fine grey burnished ware (PI. 30A, lower left and centre) shows that the material in question is of Period I. Room 40. This is a small room (EW 2.10 m., NS 0.90 m.) entered from the stairway on the east and from 39 on the north. The stairway (PL 5B) occupies the southern and eastern part of the room. Its surface, up to 0.60 m. in width, weis composed of flat slabs curving up northwards into 37. In the south-east corner it was rather disturbed. The level above the rock floor was of Period I and included a carinated bowl, P34, in fine grey burnished ware, a sherd with a hatched triangle in white on black (white paint is exceptionally rare in Period I) (PI. 32 A, bottom left), dark on light hatched sherds and a little dark painted, including part of a cup with high swung circular section handle. The level above in this room included the disturbed staircase at the west end and was little below surface. It had in it fine grey ware, a ring base and part of a strainer, P72 (PI. 32 A, bottom right), hatched sherds, but also a Vasilike ware sherd, one red polished, one pseudo- Vasilike ware dark painted fragment, and a fragmentary brown painted flaring bowl, P268. In view of the stratified and pure levels elsewhere and the nearness to surface here this level is best seen as mixed (Periods I and II) fill. While there were few complete pots from 38, 39 and 40 other material from the lowest levels provides evidence that these were living and eating rooms. Here alone on the site was a rela- tively high concentration of animal bones (20), limpet shells (30% of the site total came from 37 to 40), and obsidian blades (10), which were perhaps the tools used on the food. There were 16 animal bones in 40 and the shells were mostly in 38 and 39. Room 3J. This is a narrow room or passage (EW 1.06 m., NS 4.00 m.) to the east of 38-39 and entered from the south by the staircase of 40. It probably continued on northwards into the open Area 30 since the stones across its north end (Plan) are probably fallen rather than part of a wall. The rather narrow west wall is the east wall of 38-39. The east wall was only just below the modern surface and is rather disturbed, but it was clearly stouter than the west; width c. 0.56 m., ht. preserved 0.65 m. in three courses. The rock rises sharply to the east under the wall. There were many loose stones on the modern surface and in this room, fallen from the walls, but some at the south end were probably part of the stairway entering the room. Towards the centre of the room, overlying fallen stones, a sherd deposit was found with large parts of several vessels, though none were at all complete. It was not a floor deposit in situ, but more probably a dump like that over the wall at the south end of 36. The material (PL 5C) was of Period I and included part of a typical bowl with diagonal bands forming a hatched pattern at the rim, P6 (Fig. 40), a fragment of a dish, P36 (Fig. 40), the upper part of a magnificent Myrtos ware jug with large crinkly rimmed neck which was a feature of Period I, P47 (PL 34B),i and part of a high-handled strainer, P71 (Fig. 42, PL 37C). Below this sherd level and the stones under it came a further Period I level above the rock. It included light brown cooking pot fabric with distinct white grits, bowl fragments with hatched triangles below the rim and the more complex hatched bowl fragment, P7 (Fig. 38). At the north end of the room a burnt level occurred just below surface (and extended west- wards over the north part of 38) and there was an unburnt level below this, on the rock (Fig. 9). The lower level was Period I and included part of a fine jug with tall triangles decorated with diagonal bars (PL 36B). The burnt level was typical Period II with Vasilike ware sherds and * It had joins in the surface level 1.</page><page sequence="31">THE SETTLEMENT I7 dark and red painted fragments of piriform jars. It included one fragment of fine grey ware, a tiny piece of a pyxis, P69 (PL 37B) of Period I date; but the burning had penetrated into the top of the white earth level below, so this very slight mixing of one sherd is not surprising. The best preserved of the lids with large knobs, P558 (Fig. 76), came in the burnt level, and may thus be dated to Period II. The pottery from the surface levels over 37-40 was mainly of Period II date with Vasilike ware and red and dark painted sherds. Since it was above the preserved remains of the walls (except at the north end of 37) it cannot be taken as Period II occupation material in situ and it included an occasional scrap of fine grey ware and the fragmentary Period I bowl, Pi 3 (PL 31C). A small human clay figurine, 1, was found in the surface level over Room 37 and the only stone axe from the site was also a surface find here. Deposit in Room 36 The group of rooms east of 37 through to the cliff edge on the east produced a great deal of pottery but only an occasional scrap was of Period I. These buildings clearly belong to Period II. But a natural hollow at the south end of what was to become 36 had been blocked off with a row of stones on the north and filled with large parts of incomplete vases, the whole forming a pure Period I deposit. The fact that half or more of several vases was preserved, but none were whole, suggests that the area had been used as a dump in Period I for broken vessels outside the buildings of 37-40. The pottery was predominantly buff surfaced with geometric patterns and consisted mainly of jugs, in Myrtos ware, P48 (Fig. 43), P53, P54 with a band round the handle, and P55, then one with a curious pattern reminiscent of double-axe or butterfly, P49 (Fig. 42), and one with hatched triangles or bands, P50 (cf. Pis. 30A, top centre; 33B, lower right). Horizontal bands round the lower body were common and one jug fragment had a disc in relief with an incised cross, P56 (PL 34D). A bowl fragment had an open spout and the typical fan patterns of Myrtos ware, P15, and there was a jug base with a painted cross (cf. PL 35A, below left). In fine grey burnished ware there was part of a bowl with strap handles, P32 (Fig. 40, PL 33A) and other fragments, including PL 32A, lower centre. Dark painted ware included neck fragments of three black painted jugs. There were fragments of two pithoi with applied, thumb-impressed bands at the top of the shoulder. Cooking pot fragments occurred with and without the distinct white grits and there were fragments of four tripod feet. Other finds included an obsidian blade, a stone weight and four triangular clay counters cut from decorated sherds. Rooms 47-51 South of Rooms 37 to 43 and contiguous with them lie 47 to 51. Room 49 is a potter's work- shop.1 The north wall of 47 and 49 is built against the staircase on the south side of 40, but this does not prove 47-51 to be of Period I date. More helpful is the north wall of 50 which is the south wall of 43 discussed above. But the remains are very disturbed and eroded here so that a definite architectural link between 43 and 50 is probable, but not certain. At the south end of the group the south wall of 48 and 51 is wide and was obviously strong. South of it is an east- west road or passage, 67, which clearly separates 47-51 from the buildings to the south. Further east this way turns south into the main north-south passage of the southern part of the settle- ment. This clear separation of 47-51 (and so also 37-43) from the southern area is precisely ι Warren, Antiquity 43 (1909) 224-7.</page><page sequence="32">l8 MYRTOS reflected in the pottery evidence since the material from 47-51 is of Period I date with diagnostic hatched and fine grey wares, and not a scrap of Vasilike ware, while the East-West Way has Period II occupation with Vasilike ware sherds and some evidence of burning; this is a reflec- tion of the Period II major destruction deposits over the whole southern area. It is clear then that the preserved south wall of 48 and 5 1 marks the south line of the original, Period I settle- ment. East of this wall the remains are completely eroded to the rock. Room 4J . This is a tiny cell (EW c. 0.86 m., NS c. 0.44 m.) north-east of 49. Its preserved depth was 0.63 m. (against east wall, with five courses surviving) and it must have been used as a storage place. Two flat slabs just south of it were probably steps up to it or to any structure over it. North-east of the cell is a mass of stones forming a wall at the south end of 36 against which the Period I deposit lay in a natural hollow (see above) . This wall (north wall of Room 46) , width 0.80 m., joins the north-south wall between 36 and 37 and must be of Period I date. When the block of rooms east of 36 was built in Period II the now much disturbed north-south wall between 34 and 36 originally had a good soutn-west corner, leaving a small gap between the corner and our Period I wall. Later this gap was bridged by continuing the north-south wall to join our Period I wall. This was clear because the bridge or join stood on earth which continued the Period I deposit in the south of 36. The room south of this wall and east of 47, Room 46, belongs to Period II (p. 47). Room 48. This is another small cell (EW 0.60 m., NS 1.20 m.) lying south of 49, the potter's workshop. It has no entrance, save from above, and is too small to have been anything except a storage place. The preserved depth was 0.95 m. against the east wall. The south wall (the original edge of the settlement) is 0.84 m. wide and continues along Room 51. For the north and west walls see below under 49 and 51. The cell contained only sherds in the fill. Room 4g. Potter's Workshop (PL 6A). A rectangular room, EW 1.08 m., NS 2.08 m. The west wall was almost completely eroded but the entrance to the room seems to have been towards the south-west corner, 0.50 m. wide, over a threshold of three stones. The north wall is eroded at its west end where the rock cropped up just below the modern surface. The wall, 0.48 m. wide, is built directly against the stairway of Room 40. It had three courses surviving at the east end. The east wall had four courses at the north end, surviving 0.58 m. high. The south wall (north wall of 48) was the best preserved: 5-6 courses, ht. 0.71 m., width 0.38 m. As usual all the walls were built on the rock with carefully selected and placed, but unworked stones. The bedrock was very uneven and sloped down somewhat to the south. Above it was an earth level with Period I sherds including the hatched bowl fragment, P16 (PL 30C, top centre) and a fragment with diagonal bands, Ρίο. There was also the base of a large bowl in fine grey burnished ware and a whole profile fragment of a red painted deep flaring bowl. Lying flat on this earth level were eight potter's turn-tables (Fig. 14, PL 6A; five appear, the remainder being then under Trench C/C South baulk). These are discussed below (and see p. 17, n. 1). The fact that they can now be assigned to Period I (c. 2600-2400 b.c.) is of further interest. The fill in the room over the turn-tables contained few sherds but these included pithos and three fine grey ware fragments, one being from a bowl with inturned rim like PL 33B, top right. Room 50. This room stood west of the potter's workshop and gave access to it.

The entrance must have been on the south or west. The north wall is the south wall of Room 43 (above, p. 14), the east and west walls have only a few stones left and the south wall is the north wall of Room 51 (below). Against the north wall was an ashy patch, perhaps the remains of a cooking place. There was not much pottery but the level on the rock included the fragmentary Period I bowl, P31 (Fig. 40), another with a purplish black wash, P3, and the fragmentary knob of a large lid with incised decoration on the top, P64 (Fig. 42), which had parallels in the Period I South-East Rubbish Pits.

Room of the Potter's Pithoi (PI. 6B). As with 50 to the north, the western part was badly preserved. The south wall survives fairly well for 1.50 m. from the east and odd stones on the rock represent its continuation westwards for another 3.10 m. to a point where the rock falls steeply to the west. The rock slope had been packed with stones to support the west end of the wall, which is, as we saw above, the south wall of the original settlement. It is only the eastern third of the room which survives, with a NS measurement of 1.50 m. The north wall had six courses surviving, ht. 0.62 m., width 0.42 m. The east wall (west wall of cell 48) had seven courses and stood 0.67 m. high on its west face. The south wall had four courses in the south- east corner and a preserved height of 0.45 m. Its maximum width was 0.90 m. In the room at the east end were the remains of three pithoi (Fig. 14, PL 6B) . That nearest the east wall, P66 was on its side, broken, but was more or less complete with pieces rotted away near the base. It was 0.656 m. tall originally. The pithos in the centre, P67 (PL 37A), had its upper half preserved complete, but there were only very crushed fragments of the lower half and base. West of this vessel lay P68, with the upper part crushed but preserved, and the lower al- most entirely rotted away. There was no burning in the room and it looks as if the vessels had slowly disintegrated in their lower parts (just the opposite of the big jars in the Period II destruction deposits, which often have parts of their rim missing through surface disturbance) . A possible cause of the disintegration was the fact that the interiors of these pithoi were heavily lined with pale buff earth in places. This looked very like the white clay earth used by the potters in Crete today and it is a reasonable conclusion that these pithoi were used by the potter of Room 49 to store his clay. A rectangular slab in the north-east corner and a roughly circular quern by it on the west (26.0 χ 22.0, thickness 6.0) had served as stands for the vessels. There were no sherds with the pithoi but in the eroded western part of the room the scraps included one hatched fragment. The pottery from the surface levels over Rooms 49 and 50 contained nothing diagnostic of Period II, but included two good Period I pieces, P28 and another fragment (PL 32C and PL 30B, top centre). South-East Rubbish Pits 61-62 The southern edge of the Period I settlement has been described, forming the south wall of Cell 48 and Room 51. The whole area south, south-east and south-west of this was built in Period II and contained the major final destruction deposits on bedrock. There was no evidence of Period I, with the sole exception of an area for rubbish down in the south-east corner. South-east of the main southern entrance, 64, structures project to form the south part of 60 and the small enclosed Area 62, whose walls, as usual, rest on the bedrock. At the south end of 'Room' 62 the rock floor dips down southwards with the slope of the hill. The whole area of the 'room' (EW 1.24 m., NS 2.08 m.) and the area outside it to the east, 61, contained much broken and discarded pottery of Period I date. This deposit even extended northwards beyond the north wall of 62 into the southern part of 60. The structures themselves are Period II, forming an integral part of the south-east building complex and with a final destruction deposit in the centre and north of 60. The Period I material formed pure deposits (Fig. 1 3) , but we cannot be certain whether it was a gradual accumulation of rubbish during this first period or whether it was collected and</page><page sequence="35">THE SETTLEMENT 21 dumped here by the Period II builders when they were extending the settlement. The former is more probable in view of the spread of the material beyond the confines of 62. The fact that the pottery (50-60 kg. in all) consisted of broken and discarded scraps meant that it was earlier than the complete vases of the destruction deposits. In addition its diagnostic features showed it to belong to Period I, with many links with the stratified material from 27-28 and the pure deposits in 36-40. It was predominantly buff surfaced with varied decoration including Myrtos ware fan patterns (PI. 356, below centre; PL 36A), diagonal bands (PL 30B, except top centre and bottom right) and horizontal bands (PL 35!$, below left and right), but especially hatched decoration on jugs (PL 356, top row) and in triangles on bowls (PL 30C, lower row). Jugs were particularly common in the deposit, represented by no less than 211 broken handles. These sometimes had a raised band round the centre and at the junction with the neck (PL 34A, left and right), like those from Rooms 27-28 (Pis. 30A; 35A). One had a moulded band perhaps intended to represent a snake (PL 34A, centre). One or two jug bases with a painted cross occurred (cf. PL 35 A). There was also a fair amount of fine grey burnished ware (52 sherds) including part of a plain bowl, P5, open bowls with inturned or moulded rims, P23-P27 (Fig. 39, PL 32B), a scrap with pointillé decoration (PL 32B, below, centre) and short or longer stems of goblets, P39, P40, P43 (Fig. 41, PL 33C). One sherd, P59, a fragment of a jug neck, had white lines on a black ground (PL 32B, below right). Baking dishes, Pi for example (Fig. 38), and cooking pot fabric were present, especially the light brown variety with distinct white grits, and there were fragments of 65 tripod feet. There was some red and dark painted ware including fragments of two open, carinated bowls, P29, P30 (Fig. 40), part of a red painted bowl with incurving profile and vertical handle, Ρ 12, part of a red painted globular jar, P46, and part of a bowl with strap handles, P33, but it was slight in proportion to the buff surfaced wares. A small lid and a fragment of a larger one with incised knob are also illustrated, P65, P63 (Fig. 42) and there was a fragment of a cylindrical pyxis lid with painted hatched decoration on top. Pithos fragments were present including both types of decoration, applied thumb-impressed band round the shoulder and impressed holes just below the rim. Also decorated with such holes was a lekane on the bedrock of 61 beside the east wall of 62, P60 (Pis. 7A and 36E). It had been discarded because its base was broken away. In all this material (around 1200 sherds) there were two small pieces of Vasilike ware, from the south end of 62. They were certainly part of the rubbish, but serve only to show that Vasilike ware was almost unknown at Myrtos in Period I. North Rubbish Area 2-3 On the rock below the long narrow building, 1, at the north end of the site was a large open area. This is designated 2 on the north, 3 to the south where the rock is higher (Pis. 7B; 8A). The area was used for pottery rubbish and produced a considerable quantity of unstratified sherds (1 10-130 kg.). Most of this was of Period II date, with many fragments of Vasilike ware and red and dark painted. There were, however, about ten fragments of fine grey ware, in- cluding one with pointillé and incision, a carinated and an inturned rim bowl fragment (cf. PL 32B), and about another ten of hatched dark on buff. These few pieces suggest that the area began to be used in Period I, though its main employment came later. Other Period I Material In addition to the areas and deposits described finds of Period I pottery were made here and c</page><page sequence="36">22 MYRTOS there, mostly in surface levels. These included the fine bowl from surface levels in the south-east over and to the north and east of Room 54, Pu (PL 31B), another bowl fragment from over the area of 4-6 and Passage 14 in the north-west, P8 (PI. 30D). Fragments of incised and fringed fine grey ware and goblet stems, e.g., P42, are shown in PL 33D. The fragment of a domed pyxis lid with incised concentric semicircles came from the surface over Room 16, P61 (PL 36F). See also P18, P38, P62, P70. PERIOD II (EARLY MINOAN IIB) The preserved structures of Period I are confined to the central part of the west side of the site. The area of Rooms 27-28 was also occupied but apparently was not built on, unless the some- what irregular line of stones outside 27 on the east represents the remains of an earlier building. Rubbish areas at the northern limit and on the southern slope of the hill were also used The Period II settlement covers a much greater area, from the North Building 1 beside the Rubbish Yard 2-3 down to the South-East Rubbish Pit 62. The whole north, east-central and southern areas were built in Period II and came to an end simultaneously by fire. That they were built in II is clear from the absence of Period I pottery and from the uncontaminated Period II destruction deposits on their rock floors. It would have been clear stylistically that the stratified and pure deposits of 36-40 represented a different period of use from that of the burnt destruction deposits so rich in Vasilike, red painted and dark painted wares and large trickle amphoras. But with the stratification of 27-28 comes proof independent of style. The North Building ι (Pis. 7B, 8A) This long, narrow structure stands at the north-east extremity of the hilltop. It is built on the rock with substantial foundations on the lower, west side (PL 7B). The internal length is 7.10 m., width in the centre 1.78 m. The most remarkable feature is the V shaped projection in the west wall. Its purpose, like that of the building, is unknown but it was not dictated by the lie of the rock, since the wall could have run straight along it. But without some such salient most of the building would have been a long, narrow and impractical passage. At the north end the building turns east with a narrow room or passage, but the east end is lost since the preserved remains come almost to the present cliff edge. This room probably ended in a short north- south cross wall forming a room like that at the south end. The entrance to the whole building appears to have been over a flat slab of rock at the north end of the east wall, with a width of 0.46 m. It is extremely unlikely that there was any way in through the lost but precarious north- east corner. The whole building is well constructed from unworked but skilfully placed stones including a quernstone and one or two gypsum blocks in the east wall. There are four to five courses surviving on the west and north sides and two to three on the east and south (max. ht. 0.55 m.). The walls are c. 50-0.60 m. in width. On the relation of the building to 8 on the south see below, p. 25. The building contained only sherds (which were burnt in the central and southern area) and two vases : a complete conical bowl, P224, which lay on the floor in the narrow section between the room at the south end and the central area, and a typical Vasilike ware jug, P406 (about a third surviving) in the south room ; there were also fragments of a very coarse lekane, P537, between the two pots, of pithoi and a piece of an amphora. These finds indicate a Period II destruction in the building. There were further scraps of Vasilike ware in the fill and the earth level above the rock was ashy and burnt.</page><page sequence="37">the settlement 23 North Rubbish Area 2-3 West of the North Building the rock slopes gently away and the open area was used as a rubbish yard, extending up to 4 metres westwards.1 The north part of the area, 2, is lower than the southern, the division being formed by a distinct rise in the rock on the southern side of the projection in Building 1. Area 2 includes a pit (depth 0.90 m.) in the rock on the west with stones round its edge. Area 3, enclosed on three sides by walls and with the rock ledge on the north, leads off to Room 10 with a doorway in the centre of its south side. South-west of the V shaped projection and again north of it were extensive burnt, ashy areas. There was nothing to suggest these were cooking places ; they were almost certainly connected with the burnt destruction in the building. The few Period I sherds in the fill of rubbish have been discussed above. Most of the 1 10-130 kg. of pottery belonged to Period II with Vasilike, red and dark painted predominant among the fine wares. A large black wash piriform jug, P462, was the only fairly complete vase, found in the centre of 2, north-west of the pit. There were about 115 sherds of Vasilike ware from typical small conical bowls, flaring bowls with spouts, jugs, goblets and teapots. Many fragments of Myrtos ware jugs with fan patterns were also present. In coarser fabrics there were fragments of pithoi, cooking pots (fragments of 51 feet of tripod cooking pots), baking dishes and some pieces of large amphorae with raised rib below the rim and of dark painted piriform jars. All this was typical of the Period II destruction deposits with complete vases. One fragment of a bowl with white chevrons on a black ground survived, P160 (cf. P150), suggesting that the area was in use to the time of the destruction. This was also indicated by the burnt patches in the rubbish. A knob of a large lid with incised decoration could be of Period I or Π, Ρ561 (Fig. 76). It was in the fill of Area 2. Other finds included the painted figurine head, 70, with a tenon for fitting to a separately made body (Fig. 95, PL 72E-G), found in 3 right beside the southern part of the west wall of the north building, two unfinished stone biconical weights, a loomweight, spindle whorl, pestle and a piece of worked steatite probably intended for a sealstone, at the north-west corner of the entrance to Room 10. The rubbish also included four pieces of obsidian and a few animal bones. Finally one of the most instructive finds of the excavation, an olive stone, came from the level directly overlying the rock in the south-west corner of 2, just north of Room 12 (see Appendix V) and east of the platform of Area 4. Area 4 West of the rubbish yard the site is almost completely eroded (PL 9A, left) except on the south where a large rectangular stone platform limits Area 4 on the east. The platform measures EW 1.50 m., NS 2.88 m. (west side). It could only have continued a little further north to meet the pit in the rubbish yard. It is built as usual of unworked stones; its function is unknown but it could have provided a working surface for Area 4 and perhaps Room 12 to the east. There are three courses surviving on the west face. Below the north-east corner of the platform a little jug with a vertical raised rib came up, P434. 4 is the rectangular area below the stone platform on the west. It is divided from Room 5 by a north-south wall whose surviving length is only 1 .30 m. but odd stones continue its north line for another 1.60 m. to suggest an area at least as long as the stone platform beside it. The wall has only one course preserved, ht. 0.25 m. The excavation of Area 4 revealed traces of a surface 1 The scrub on the modern surface included Coridothymus capitatus, identified by Dr Ο. Rackham.</page><page sequence="38">24 MYRTOS cobbled with small stones. The surface may have been for standing to work at the platform. Room 5 On the wall line between 4 and 5 the rock dips down to the west so that Room 5 is on a lower level than the cobbled area. For the fairly well-preserved west wall see below (east wall of 6). 5 may have been as much as 5.40 m. NS, but its exact northern limit is unknown. EW it measures up to 1.60 m. The south wall (width 0.60 m., ht. preserved 0.15 m.) is part of the north wall of Passage 14. In the south-west corner slabs had been placed on the rock to counter- act the drop in level to the west. Pottery was fairly abundant at the south end of the room and included parts of a baking dish, P129, of two plain bowls, one brown burnished, P137, the other black painted, P140, of two red painted open bowls with in turned and everted rims, Ρ 184, Ρ 193, and of a deep flaring bowl, red polished, P266. A red painted jug, P500, and a piriform jar with dark diagonal bands over the buff ground, P592 (PI. 58C) were virtually complete. There was also a jug base with a black painted cross. The group, with nearly all red and dark paint and a piriform jar of typical shape, clearly indicates a Period II destruction in the room. Room 6 A long north-south wall divides Room 5 from 6 below to the west. As it now survives 6 is pre- served only on the east where the wall is built into a marked slope in the rock. It appears now as a rectangular room (EW 1 .70 m., NS 4.60 m.) with a small enclosed area at the north end and a very badly preserved north-south wall on the west dividing it from 7. 6 and 7 may, however, have been a single large room originally, with the south wall backing onto the main east-west entrance and Passage 14. In which case the west wall of 6 would have been a central supporting structure for the roof. The east wall of Room 6 was built on bedrock with no attempt at coursing. The stones included a quern. The east side is built into the rock and has no surviving face; the west face is preserved to ht. 0.60 m. The maximum width is 1.30 m. but this narrows to 0.56 m. in the southern half. A little room is formed at the north end by two small north and west walls ; these had only one course preserved. The stout south wall, width 0.86 m., is the north wall of Passage 14 and had one or two courses surviving. As in Passage 14 and Rooms 25 and 26 in the north-west area a heavily burnt level was found not far below surface. Below it in the centre and north was the floor make-up of packed white clayey earth. At the south end the burning went directly to the rock (Fig. 3). There were scarcely any finds in 6 but a potstand south of the west wall and the base of a pithos or lekane north of the stand beside the end of the west wall, perhaps used as another stand, show that it was a living or storage room. The burnt destruction goes with the others in this region which are dated by the pottery to Period II. From the south end of the room came the lower part of a dark painted jug. Room 7 2.40 m. west of the disturbed wall dividing 6 from 7 (unless they were one room originally) is a section of the outer, west wall of the settlement. It had one to two courses preserved but on the west face rested on some 0.40 m. of earth and sherds (Fig. 2). There was a fair amount of pot- tery beside it, mostly Period II, and no evidence that it was built before or after Period II.</page><page sequence="39">THE SETTLEMENT 25 Perhaps it had slipped forward west from an original position against the steep rock face a little to the east. This is all that remains structurally of 7, with the disturbed wall, the whole area being almost eroded to the rock. The south wall, more or less gone, would have formed the north entrance wall to Passage 14. The pottery on each side of the west wall was all broken fill but included the upper part of an amphora, P93, while its probable base came from the surface level over Room 6. There was also a fragmentary pithos, P596, from each side of the wall and part of the rim of another with a join from the surface level above 6. These remains suggest that 6-7 originally contained a de- posit of large store jars just like those preserved in Area 26 to the south. Perhaps they stood on the pot stands in 6. The sherd fill included red and dark painted pieces, Pi 70, P387, a couple of Vasilike ware sherds and a few Period I hatched and fine grey fragments. There was also a fine flat, almost circular loomweight, 75, and a potter's turntable, 119, both from the lower part of the fill outside the room, to the west. Area 8. Area of the Tub, Hole and Channel (Figs. 15-6) South of the North Building 1 and the yard west of it are the structures comprising 8 and 10 and the little Cell 9 (PL 9B). The North Building, which now appears to stand on its own, has a bonded wall running off south-eastwards from its south-east corner (width 0.55 m., up to three courses preserved). The angle formed encloses the north-east part of 8. At the south-west corner of the North Building a poorly preserved wall (ht. preserved 0.38 m., up to three courses) runs off westwards before turning south to form the north-west part of 8. The south-west corner of the North Building is complete and this poorly preserved wall was not bonded into it. We can- not be sure if it was built right up against the corner since there is now a small gap between them. The poor preservation was caused by a large bush (Pistacia lentiscus) growing directly above the wall. At its west end a short wall runs south forming the east entrance wall of Room 10 and the north-west corner of 8. It is again poorly preserved (width 0.46 m., ht. preserved 0.30 m., up to three courses). The wall enclosing 8 on the south is the well-built and well-preserved north wall of Room 16 (see below). From this wall on the eastern side of 8 a short wall runs out north-east. This little wall seems designed to give protection (from wind) to the area of the tub and hole west of it. It has five courses preserved (width 0.54 m., ht. 0.49 m.). Probably 8 was entered from the south-east down the passage formed by this wall and that running off south- east from the corner of the North Building. The remaining structures of 8 are a short (and poorly preserved) wall on the west, dividing 8 from 10, the Room of the Water Stoup, and in the centre another short wall running north from the hole. This wall was a secondary feature since the burnt area (see below) ran right under it. From the north end of this wall a revetment of small stones runs south-east, built into the rock and with three courses preserved (ht. 0.22 m.). Between the wall and the dividing wall of 8 and 10 to the west there was probably an entrance (width c. 0.50 m.) into the southern part of 8 with the hole and tub (PL 9B, along the line of the ranging pole) . The dimensions of Area 8 are EW 3.80 m. (north side), 2.50 m. (south side), and NS 3.04 m. It is clear from the plan (and cf. PL 9B) that 8 is not a room as such, but simply the area between the North Building and the complex to the south, of which 16 is the northern room. The east and north-west walls described were erected to give protection on those sides. Whether the area was roofed is unknown ; the southern half could easily have been in view of the com- plex of walls; the northern part looks as though it was open. The walls, especially the south wall of the North Building and the south-east prong, must have risen to a good height since the</page><page sequence="40">26 MYRTOS fig. 1 5 Area 8 (Area oi the J ub, Hole and Channel) . whole area of 8 was covered with an enormous stonefall on and directly below surface up to half a metre down. The interest of 8-io comes from the fittings and linking arrangements (Figs. 15-6). In 8 beside the north wall of 16 a lekane or large spouted tub, P533, was revealed right at the surface when excavation began (PL 8B). It was supported on a stand of which an earth packing and two large flat stones provided the top surface. The broken spout of the tub was subsequently dis- covered in a hole cut in the natural rock just west of the tub. The base of the tub was 0.70 m. above the top of the hole, which was 0.30 m. deep and 0.48-0.60 m. in diameter. The finding of the spout demonstrated that the tub was in use over the hole. From the latter a channel had been cut in the rock running down south and then west against the north wall of 16. The chan- nel discharged into either 9 (under the wall) or 10 at their north-east and south-east corners re- spectively. Beside the tub to the north, in the space enclosed by the poorly preserved wall north of the hole and a ledge of rock with a revetment of stones on the north-east, was a burnt area (hatched in Fig. 15) which may have resulted from heating water or food in connexion with the tub. East of the latter, between it and the east wall, was an area of flat slabs acting as a working surface behind the tub (0.20 m. lower than its base) and overlying the foundations of the east wall (Fig. 15). aI I» Ji / r~ pm ^ EARTH PACKlHQ w I I STAND OF EARTH ANO STONES Í I fig. 16 Section through Area 8, with tub in position over hole.</page><page sequence="41">THE SETTLEMENT 27 What was the tub's function ? It was clearly placed for letting out water into the hole and channel. Equally a pithos up to i.oo m. high (none from the site was taller) could have stood in the hole to collect liquid from the spout. The possibilities are: wine press; olive oil separator; wash tub for food or cloth. (The tub itself was not heated so it cannot have been for cooking.) Against use as a grape press are the hole and channel ; in wine-pressing the liquid is collected, not allowed to run off. Olive oil separation is certainly possible : olives are first drenched in hot water before pressing : after they are pressed the resultant mixture, containing more water than oil, is put in a tub to separate and the oil gradually rises. It is collected by first letting off the water and mush through the spout, leaving the oil which then flows into ajar put in position (see Chapter IV, Lekanai). The olive was grown in quantity at Myrtos (Appendix III) and, for what it is worth, the only olive stone found was in the south-west corner of Area 2, just north of Room 12. Washing is also plausible but food washing would not seem to require enough water for a channel with two discharges. Washing or fulling of wool or cloth would require much water (or urine or other alkaline liquid for fulling) and would provide an explanation for the channel. Loomweights and spindle whorls from the site show that textiles were being produced and the fleeces, which originally contain much grease and dirt, would have to be washed somewhere. Chromatography analysis of the clay from the parallel tub on a stand in Room 59 suggests that the fats which had soaked in were animal and not vegetable (Appendix X). Most of the animal bones are of sheep or goat, perhaps kept for wool (Appendix VI). A wash tub for wool and an olive oil separator are the most suggestive possibilities. Hot water would be useful for the former and necessary for the latter operation, and the burnt area beside the tub stand indicates that something was heated here. For a development of this discussion on a variety of uses for the spouted tubs or lekanai, see p. I38f. Cell 9 This is the little room or cell south-west of 8 and south of 10 (Room of the Water Stoup). It measures EW 1.02 m. and NS 1.12 m. max. The east wall (ht. preserved 1.35 m.) is the south- ward return of the long north wall of Room 16. It has twelve courses and the very good construc- tion involves many long flat stones with small stones as filling. This type of construction is used for the walls of the southern area of the settlement. The south wall is preserved to a similar height but was not of such good construction (width 0.52 m.). The west wall, bonded into the south, marks the east end of a thick wall running out westwards. For the north wall see below (Room 10, south wall). The cell has no entrance and may simply have been an enclosed area taking the discharge from the channel of 8 in its north-east corner. Two Vasilike ware pots, a jug, P421, and conical bowl, P253, lay on the floor. The jug was against the north wall, the bowl in the south-east corner. There was also part of another jug, P480. The other find was a large, thin stone disk (diam. 0.50 m., thickness 0.015 m.) standing upright on the floor against the south wall. This may well have been a cover for the hole or more probably for a pithos in the hole in 8. Room 10. Room of the Water Stoup (PL 9B) This lies west of 8 and was entered on the north side from the Rubbish Yard 3. It is named from the fine stoup set on the rock against its east wall. This wall is short, and poorly preserved (one to two courses) . Just north of the stoup it turns west to connect with the north-south entrance wall of the room. The little east-west section (width 0.49 m., one course preserved) was</page><page sequence="42">28 MYRTOS originally a good wall but is now badly ruined. The stoup itself (EW 0.40 m., NS 0.45 m., depth c. 0.15 m.) is set on an abutment of rock which juts out west of the wall and immediately falls away, leaving standing space in front of the stoup. It is a rounded stone hollowed out into a shallow bowl. It was presumably used for water or for mixing substances such as dyes. The south wall (width 0.46 m., ht. 0.45 m.) exhibits unique construction on its top surface. This now consists of a series of large flat slabs running the width of the wall. As this feature is not paral- leled elsewhere and the slabs look so suitable as a working surface the wall may have risen to just this height originally. The west wall (up to four rough courses, width 0.82 m.) bonds into the south and is the party wall with Cell 11. The north-west wall (width 0.59 m., ht. preserved 0.42 m.) runs along to the entrance (width 0.63 m.) from the yard to the north. The room measures EW 2.10 m., NS 1.54 m. Below the surface and stonefall the fill consisted of a very tough white clayey deposit, nearly half a metre deep to the rock. In it lay a destruction deposit of pottery. 1 Clear explanation of the white earth eludes us ; it might have been decayed roof or wall plaster, though elsewhere that was preserved in lumps, often with reed impressions. But here there was no burning to calcine the plaster and so it might have decayed into this tough mass. The same was observed in the rooms and passage immediately to the south. Again it might have been accumulated sediment connected with washing operations in 8, perhaps carried out in the large vessels which stood here originally. The bulk of the pottery in the tough clayey deposit consisted of three large vases, a fine pithos, P610 (ht. 0.78 m.), an amphora, P99, and a piriform jar with collar neck, P582, whose height would have been 40-50 cm. These were squashed but still in fair-sized pieces. They stood originally in the south part of the room. There was a tripod cooking pot, P337, and a fragmen- tary large jug from the same area, P481, and part of a curious low vase, P700. In all probability this originally had attached figurines of worshippers or dancers since it closely resembles such a vase from the Kamilari tholos tomb (p. 153). Nothing in Room 10 suggested any ritual or religious context. Fragments included parts of four conical bowls and a jug in Vasilike Ware, which combine with the evidence of the large vessels to make this a typical final destruction deposit. An incised knob of a large lid, P559 (PL 57B) suggests that this type continued in use from Period I. It may have been the lid for the pithos or amphora in the room. Cell ι ι This is roughly square (EW 1.20 m., NS 1.40 m.) and lies directly west of 10. It has no doorway but may have been entered from the south or south-west corner by a stairway which comes up from the west. The east wall is the west wall of 10. The stairway and combined north wall of Room 22 on the south are 1.20 m. wide. The thick west wall (width 0.94 m.) is built against the stairway while the north wall (three to five courses preserved, ht. 0.42 m.) faces on to the Rubbish Yard 3. The room contained a white clayey fill similar to that in 10, but few finds. The only fairly complete vase was a red painted jug, P504, and there was a rim fragment of a Vasilike ware conical bowl. Structure between ii, 13 and 22 This area comprises a mass of stones, somewhat disturbed, since they appeared just below the modern surface. There seem to be three main elements giving a total NS measurement of about 1 Arch.Delt. 23 (1968) Χρονικά PI. 372a.</page><page sequence="43">THE SETTLEMENT 29 2.80 m. from Passage 13 to the entrance to Room 22 on the south. On the north is the south wall of Passage 13, width c. 0.70 m. It has only one to two courses of disturbed masonry surviving. South of this and built against it is a stairway with large flat slabs (including a quernstone) for steps. Its width is c. 1.10 m. It leads up to Cell 1 1. At the lower, west, end the remains are very disturbed but the stairway seems to have begun from the north part of 24. On its south side it has built against it the north wall of the entrance passage into Room 22. This wall, now c. 0.84 m. wide, was rebuilt (in Period II) with an added face on the south side, facing the en- trance passage. The original width was about 0.62 m. Room 12 Between the Rubbish Yard 3 on the east and 4 with its large stone platform is the small Room 12. The short north and south walls (each 4 courses, widths 0.47 m., 0.60 m.) end before the stone platform (which forms the east side), leaving a north-south channel along the west side. This is 0.26 m. wide at the north entrance, 0.31 m. at the south. The rather thin east wall (3-4 courses) is built up against the rock which falls sharply here on the east. Like 10 and 1 1 the room con- tained a white clayey deposit. The unusual features of 12 are the two entrances. They seem too narrow, or unnecessarily small for human use and the arrangement looks more like a channel for water leading along and down into Passage 13 at the south end. Washing operations in the east part of the room or on the platform to the west could have utilized the channel, but it would have been almost as easy just to tip waste water straight into Passage 13, unless there was a wall on the platform at the south end. Alternatively the room might have been used as an animal pen, easily blocked off and yet with easy access at each end. Passage 13-14 This is the main east- west passage at the north end of the settlement, entered at 15 on the west and running 9.80 m. up the west slope to reach Room 12 at the top on the north. Strangely it seems to have had no exits to the rooms it goes between and only the narrow entrance to 12. It is possible, however, that there were exits at the lower end to 6 and 7 on the north and 25 on the south, but the walls are eroded away at these points. The upper part of the passage, 13 (PI. 10A), is much wider than the lower (NS 1.48 m. as against 0.70 m. below in 14). It is hard to see any reason for this since the rock shelves very steeply in 13, making the eastern, upper end use- less. Yet the south wall could have been built on straight instead of turning south to form this wider area. As with 12 the area might have been used for herding or counting animals (sheep or goat) . The only sure point is that the space was intentional since the east, south and west walls of 1 3 are carefully built, while the south end of the stone platform between 4 and 1 2 forms the northern side. The walls have up to five courses preserved and are built of large and small flat, rounded and block-shaped stones. The only finds were a fragmentary plain bowl in the fill beside the west wall, Ρ 133, and a stone weight towards the north-east corner. Below 13 to the west the passage narrows to 0.52 m. and then continues down as 14, widening to 0.82 m. before becoming very narrow, 0.28 m., at the top of the steps leading down to the Entrance Area 15. The north wall has been described under 4, 5 and 6, of which it forms the southern side. The maximum surviving height was 0.45 m. The south wall, with two to three courses is 0.50 m. wide. It included flat slabs in its construction and was preserved to a height of 0.60 m. At the west end the passage terminates in five steps, neatly cut in the soft rock which falls steeply here (PL 10B).</page><page sequence="44">30 MYRTOS Step ι, up from the rock floor, was not well preserved, but had traces of plaster on it. This was probably to protect the soft rock. The height was 0.15 m. Step 2 was cut very smooth and was the best preserved, ht. 0.18 m. Step 3 was again well finished, ht. ο. 11 m. Step 4 had lost its front edge, ht. 0.25 m. Step 5 was rather worn, ht. 0.16 m. Above this in the passage two ledges of rock formed two more rough steps. The width of the stairs at steps 1 to 4 was 0.92-0.98 m. but at 5 the entrance was narrowed to only 0.28 m. by the south wall of the passage which came down and terminated at this point (see Plan) . Above this narrow point the passage widens at once. This is a similar width to the entrances of 12 at the top of the passage. Human beings can pass through but the width seems unnecessarily small if it was intended for human use only. Perhaps it was regularly used for herding sheep and goats which could be both easily penned in and protected (from theft or attack) in the passage. The badly ruined wall on the north side of the steps has been discussed under 7. The south wall was better preserved. It included two used querns tones on its north face and had three courses surviving (ht. 0.45m. at east, 0.29m. at west). The little northward return from this wall to meet the end of the main south wall of the passage also had three surviving courses (ht. 0.45 m.) and made a clear corner with the passage wall. Above the steps in 14 typical destruction debris was found: burnt earth and plaster as in Room 6 to the north and 25 to the south, together with a little pottery. This included part of the rim of a large bowl with dark paint, P300, half of a black polished, plain bowl, P134, and frag- ments of a buff surfaced piriform jar. Entrance 15 The steps of 14 ascend from the middle of the east side of a flat, rectangular floor of rock. This is delimited on the west side by a section of the outer wall of the settlement. At the north end is an open entrance, the outer west entrance to the settlement, up rough steps formed by the ledges of rock. At the south end there is an east-west wall which divides 15 from 26 to the south. The rectangle of flat rock thus defined is EW 1.20 m. at the steps, 1.86 m. at the south end, and NS 4.30 m. It forms a well-planned entrance area, and a raised ledge of rock at the south end prob- ably served as a bench for people waiting or resting. The area would have been suitable for goods in transit and, if the need for defence arose, gave protection to the steps through the enclosing wall and outer entrance. One curious feature is a rock cut hole, diam. c. 0.30 m., like that in Area 3 1 . There was no evidence that it was a posthole, which anyway would have been pointless so close to the west wall. As with that in 31 it may have been for storage. The east wall (south of the steps) is strongly built of rough blocks on rammed earth. It is set in against the steeply falling rock on the east and survives to 0.81 m. The south wall (width 0.36 m., ten courses at west end, ht. preserved 1.26 m.) appears not to have extended far enough west originally to meet the west wall. This south wall of 15 and the long stretch which runs south from its west end seem to have been constructed before the west wall of 15. Thus the steps may have been the first and only entrance originally. Later the west wall of 15 (width 0.72 m. max.) was built and joined up to the south wall with rough masonry in the south-west corner of the area. Later still the west wall seems to have been rebuilt on its west face (see Plan) . The wall is poorly preserved at the north end towards the outer entrance. West of it at the south end among fallen stones were ash patches and burnt mudbrick, indicative of the final destruction. Room 16 (Fig. 17) On the summit area is a series of interconnected rooms south of Area 8 with its tub and hole.

The wall is well built (width 0.30-0.46 m.) and has twelve surviving courses (ht. 1.10 m.). On the east the rock rises sharply and the east wall has only two courses left (ht. 0.20 m.). Directly west of it is a ledge of rock which is faced with a wall on its west edge (three to four courses, ht. 0.35 m.). This is a kind of inner north-south wall within 1 6 and the ledge may have been used as a working sur- face. The south wall meets the south end of the ledge wall but does not go further east to the main east wall. There may then have been an entrance from 17 through this gap onto the ledge. The width of the gap is 0.76 m. The rather thin south wall has its main face preserved in Room 17 (see below). The western part of the room is not revealed since it lies under the north end of the curved building, the northern half of which was left in position. Against the south wall was a well-built low bench, constructed with three courses of flat slabs (ht. 0.18 m., width 0.40 m.). On the rock floor were slabs acting as paving and a clay pot stand (going into the section). The whole floor and slabs and lowest level were marked by very heavy burning. The room measures EW 1.80 m. (c. 2.48 m. including unexcavated part), NS 1.34 m. The section exposed under the curved building contains fragments of pithoi and in the excavated fill just above the floor was half the upper part of a small pithos like P620. The room was probably a magazine (perhaps for oil which intensified the burning) with the jars placed on the floor slabs. Room 17. Room of the Pithos and Tub (Fig. 17, Pis. 11A-B, 12A) This room is directly south of 16, from which it may have been entered in the north-east corner. On the south side there is an exit into 18 and on the east into 19. The north wall is interesting architecturally since as one goes from east to west it makes two right-angled turns south then west, then south and west again through the doorway into 19. It now stands 0.70 m. high in about six rough courses. The east wall continues down from 16, but is lost at its south end. The south wall likewise is lost where the rock rises on the east end. It is now 0.80 m. high with four or five rough courses. At its west end there is a doorway (width 0.54 m.) into 18. The west side of the doorway is marked by a projecting anta (ht. preserved 1.05 m.) the top stone of which was used as part of the platform of the later curved building (Fig. 7). On the west side the entrance (width 0.62 m.) to 19 passes under the curved building. Mud plaster still adhered in patches to the south wall and there were many fragments (including some painted red) from the burnt destruction fill. Also in the fill were lumps of roof plaster with impressions of thin reeds (see Appendix III). The maximum dimensions of the room are EW 3.32 m., NS 1.82 m. On the west side the decayed rock floor was covered with flat stone slabs and circular clay bases used as pot stands (PI. 12A). The disk in the entrance to 19 and the broken one north-east of it were inverted and re-used pithos bases ; the smaller one between was a re-used potter's turn-table (105). Against the wall and just north of the stone slab was a jug in pseudo- Vasilike ware, P463. Against the south wall lay a smashed but virtually complete pithos, P609 (PI. 59D). It was on its side and must have stood in the south-east corner below a ledge of rock. This ledge forms the east side of the room below the east wall and was made more useful as a working sur- face by large flat slabs placed on top of it. Below the ledge and beside the pithos on the north were the remains of a large tub (lekane) in situ, with two stones neatly inserted underneath as a wedge against the slope of the rock (PI. 11B). Only the base of the vessel was preserved but from its size (diam. 0.615 m.) it was certainly a large tub like that in 8. It almost certainly had a spout, like all others of this size, but the vital part of the base was broken away (PI. 11B).</page><page sequence="47">THE SETTLEMENT 33 Clearly Room 1 7 was a workroom involved with liquids (wine, oil or water for washing food or cloth). 1 Other pottery from the room included a fragmentary cooking pot jar, P322, and a small, burnt juglet or pyxis, P647, and a black painted jug, P482, whose pieces were found throughout the thick burnt debris above the rock. There were also two biconical stone weights. Room 18 (Fig. 17) The room is entered from 1 7 in the north-west corner. At the entrance the rock level rises and the floor of 18 is about 0.40 m. higher than that of 17. This meant that the pottery deposit was much nearer to the surface and consequently it is poorly preserved. The north wall is the south wall of 1 7. There may have been a short wall projecting from it, but the remains are insufficient for us to be certain of this. The rock rises on the east and the east wall has gone save for a few stones which suggest its continuation south from 16 and 17. The south wall was also badly dis- turbed and has lost its eastern half. At the west end it is c. 0.48 m. wide and two courses high. The west wall is far from straight but has about five rough courses, ht. 0.50 m. On the rock floor were rough stone pot stands. Maximum dimensions are EW 3.14 m., NS 2.50 m. Above the floor was a mass of fallen stones, in among, on top of and below which was a badly broken pottery deposit (PL 12B). There were about a dozen fragmentary vases including a red/ brown burnished shallow open bowl, P206, the base of a large bowl, P302, the lower part of a jug, P510, two piriform jars, P563, P567, a cooking pot, P319, and two tripod cooking pots, P338, P340. A pithos sherd may have been used as a lamp, P527. A fairly complete teapot, P648, lay beside the north wall and fragments of another, P658, were scattered about. There was also a broken cup, P358, in the deposit. These are all small or medium-sized vases, so that the room was probably a living and eating rather than a work place like 1 7. The vases are typical of Period II and were part of the final destruction of the settlement. Above them lay the white floor going with the Curved Building and its platform. Some time before the final period of use of the room building changes had been made in the south-west corner. When the room was first constructed at the start of Period II the west wall did not run south to meet the south wall. It stopped about a metre short and turned west with a well-built corner (PL 13 A, right-hand side), leaving the triangular area between 20 and 27 open to the room. At this stage the north wall of 27 was unbroken from east to west. Then in Period II the west wall of Room 18 was continued south to join the south wall (north wall of 27), thus blocking off the triangular area from 18. Probably therefore at this time an opening was made in the north wall of 27 to give access to the triangular area from 27. Since the area was now cut off from 18 the extended west wall of this room had no proper face on the west side. The burnt destruction occurred through the area, as well as in 18 and 27. Under this burnt debris, as noted above (p. 12), in the triangular area and in the spot where the south extension of 18's west wall was to be built, was the unburnt sherd deposit of Period I pottery lying on the rock in yellow sandy soil. The walls of 27, 20 and 18 had all been built on the rock in this shallow deposit. In the surface level above Room 18 a green steatite bead seal was found (Fig. 97, PL 77A, top right), 128. 1 The earth in the pithos was distinctly fine and almost white. To discover whether it might have been some kind of fuller's earth a test was carried out by Dr Ο . Rackham in the Cambridge University Botany School. This produced a pH measurement of 7.6, showing that the earth was distinctly alkaline. But the figure is not high enough to suggest without doubt that the earth was a fulling agent.</page><page sequence="48">34 MYRTOS Room 19 The room is entered at its south-east corner from 1 7. The eastern part remains unexcavated under the preserved section of the Curved Building. The north wall is the south wall of Cell 9 (see p. 27). The south wall has ten to thirteen courses preserved (ht. 1.25 m.). Against its face is an outcrop of rock with a series of ledges which may have been used as stands. These, like the floor and lower level, had been badly burned in the destruction fire. The west wall is in some ways the most interesting on the site. Its preserved height is 1.30 m. and width 0.44 m. The east face still retained large areas of its lime and mud plaster, hard, rather coarse and light sandy in colour (PI. 13B). The average thickness was 2.4 cm. and the surface was unpainted. The plaster did not extend down to the floor but stopped about 0.50 m. above it. The bottom edge of the plaster was marked by a definite horizontal line, preserved for 0.74 m. at the south end and suggesting that a bar of wood had been held against the wall as a guide line or frame when the plaster was applied. As a result it stood out some 1.5 cm. from the lower part of the wall. The wall itself was built of the usual assortment of rounded and flat stones of various sizes. Its top surface (1.30 m. above the floor of the room) consisted of a mixture of decayed plaster and mudbrick, showing that this was the point where the mudbrick courses began. An additional feature was a line of flat slabs which had fallen over Room 22 with the westward tilt of the wall. These slabs (PI. 13C) were unconnected with Room 22 and cannot have been any kind of stairway. They seem to have fallen from the plastered wall and thus indicate a vertical stone frame within the mudbrick superstructure. They came about midway along the wall and were presumably to strengthen the upper part. They may even have defined a window on each side but there is no positive evidence for this. In the fill of the room was a piece of a mudbrick with parts of three faces preserved (length preserved 0.20 m., width preserved 0.16 m., ht. preserved 0.14 m.) with a niche or cutting for a small wooden beam or branch on one edge. The room measures EW 1.44 m. (c. 2.20 m. with part under Curved Building), NS 2.40 m. There was no floor deposit of pottery but the destruction level above the rock contained a fragment of an open bowl, P191, a red painted spouted bowl, P249, the lower part of a dark painted piriform jar, P568, and the upper part of a pithos, P631, with the usual applied band at the base of the collar. The remainder of the vessel is probably in the section under the Curved Building. The room may then have been a work room connected with the tub and pithos group in Room 17. Room 20. Room of the Raised Hearth (Fig. 20) This is a roughly rectangular room south of 19 and 22 and, at the east end, directly north of the triangular area discussed above (p. 33). It is EW 3.70 m., NS 1.94 m. max., and was entered through a doorway 0.54 m. wide at the west end. The north wall is the south wall of 19 (see above) and 22. It ran through eastwards (under the Curved Building) to join the east wall (west wall of 18). As with the west wall of Room 19 the lowest part (0.45 m.) was unplastered, while traces of plaster remained on the preserved 0.40 m. above, at the east end. But unlike the wall of 19 the lower, unplastered course projected slightly. About midway along the north wall a stone structure was built against the wall (see Plan) . It was 0.80 m. wide and projected 0.80 m. from the wall. Although badly preserved about six courses of large flat stones were discernible (ht. 0.60 m.), on top of which was about half the rim and neck of a large pithos, P598 (rim diam. 0.42 m. ; PI. 14A). The pieces looked as though</page><page sequence="49">THE SETTLEMENT 35 FIG. 18 Room 20. half of the upper part of the vessel might have been used to form a curving back on top of the stand. Above them was a heavy flat slab, semicircular in shape, which could have covered the pithos. Under the slab, within the pithos fragments, was a mass of heavily burnt earth and ash. The whole appears to be the remains of a raised oven, open at the front and with the upper part of the pithos forming its rear. Traces of white plaster were preserved on the western face of the stand. The east wall of the room is the west wall of Room 18. The south wall (width 0.48 m.) forms the north side of the triangular area (p. 33). Against the wall is a line of footings 0.22 m. wide which could have been used as a bench or stand. This south wall at the east end does not con- tinue as such westwards ; the south wall of the western part of the room is in fact the westward continuation of the north wall of Room 27 (see Plan). But both parts of the south wall must have been built about the same time since the eastern section of it has a well-made corner with the east wall (PL 13 A, from Room 18), while the western section has a return forming part of the doorway unit. The maximum preserved height on the wall is 0.80 m., in nine courses which include some gypsum blocks. The room as found contained a series of large vessels smashed and burned on the floor. The latter had a coating of plaster in the west and consisted of a thin layer of white clay in the east. In front of the raised oven on the floor was a roughly circular stone stand from which a small pithos had fallen westwards, P624 (PI. 60D). In the north-west corner was another large slab on which had stood a dark painted piriform jar, P569. Parts of two more such jars came from the destruction level, P570, P593. In front of the slab was a fine quern on a preserved patch of white plastered floor. On the south side the footings against the wall ended on the west with larger slabs. On these had stood a pithoid jar, P625, found smashed on its side. West of it, near the south-west corner, was an amphora, P87, like those of the southern area destruction de- posits. Fragments of this large vessel occurred all along the southern side and there were even a</page><page sequence="50">36 MYRTOS few pieces in the surface levels. At the east end of the room was a pithos, P597, the upper parts of which were fairly high in the fill (on a level with the top of the raised oven) while a base fragment came lower down, close to the east wall. Against this wall a dark painted jug, P507, was found just above the floor with its neck and spout pushed in between the stones of the wall, possibly though the action of modern roots which had penetrated even to the rock in the rooms here. From the destruction level came other fragmentary vases including parts of four baking plates, P107, Pi 10, P125, P126, a Period I type bowl, P144 (the only instance of a Period I vase or vase type in use in the final destruction), the lower part of a pithos, P632, a spouted jar in pseudo- Vasilike ware, P693, and parts of a hand lamp, P526, and of a large lid with the handle on top, P539. There were also two biconically bored stone weights and a pounder. One other find of great interest was a coarse piece of pottery, 231, a fragment of a clay stand. It came from the destruction level directly above the rock and has on its surface and throughout the fabric impressions of wheat and barley (Appendix V and PI. 84 A), left from the strong chaff tempering. This was one of the best pieces of evidence for the agriculture of the settlement. With the raised oven, quern on the floor and various large and small vessels in use on stands it is clear that this was a workroom (probably with provisions for storing and preparing food) and not a storage magazine. It must have been in full operation when it was overwhelmed on the final day. Area 21 West of the entrance to Room 20 is an open area or passage where the rock slopes down fairly steeply, providing a natural ramp up into the room. The area was entered from the larger open space, 30, on the south. The west side is bounded by a north-south wall built into the slope of the rock and forming the east wall of Room 23. The wall is badly eroded but has about four courses on its west face at the north end. At its south end the wall overlaps the Period I north- south wall dividing areas 30 and 3 1 (above, p. 13). The latter wall had been built slightly lower to the west and bonds with the stout east-west walls of 31. The north-south wall of 21/23 does not quite continue the earlier wall's line but joins it at a slight angle. The north part of Area 21 consists of a stone platform flanking the passage into Room 22 on the south. The platform is built right up to the west wall of 22. It was set on a white clay bedding and its purpose must have been to counteract the fall in the rock level as one goes north to the passage of 22 and to provide a useful surface for goods going in and out of the room. The whole platform and rock to the south of it was marked by very heavy burning like that in Room 22 itself. There was no pottery deposit in 21 but a few Period II sherds of pithos, red and dark painted bowls and baking plate fragments had worked down between the stones of the platform into the clay bedding which rested on the rock. There was also a much rotted spherical loomweight, 101, on the floor. In type it is like other Period II weights from Room 58. Area 21 measures EW 1.80 m. (across the platform) and NS 4.50 m., to the north end of the platform which has roughly two courses above the passage to 22. Room 22. North Pithos Magazine This is entered from the east-west passage (EW 2.10 m., NS 0.80 m. minimum) at its north-west corner. The passage opens on the west into Room 23 and Area 24. On its south side it is flanked</page><page sequence="51">THE SETTLEMENT 37 by the stone platform just described and on the north by the east-west wall built against the large stairway leading up east from 24 (above, p. 28f.). Room 22 is rectangular, EW 1.54 m., NS 2.80 m., divided from Room 19 on the east by the plastered wall (p. 34). The north wall is built against the big stairway and seems to have a re- built face in the north-west corner of the room and along the passage (see Plan and p. 29). The south wall is the north wall of Room 20. The west wall survives to 0.50 m. in five courses on its west face. One other feature of the room are the raised ledges of rock forming useful surfaces at the south end, larger than those in 19 to the east. The floor of white clay (with two paving slabs in the centre) and the thick destruction level above it had suffered from intense burning. The vessels in the room may have been for storing oil, which would explain why the burning was so fierce in this room (cf. p. 255). Against the east wall almost opposite the entrance stood the largest pithos found on the site, almost a metre high and 0.835 m· ^n diameter, P599 (Fig. 79) . It was badly smashed and burned but its lower part was still in position, set down on to two quernstones bedded in the soft rock to make the vessel stable. In front of it had stood a smaller pithos, P633, which had fallen west- wards towards the doorway and had lost most of one side and the neck and rim (PL 14B) . In the north-east corner had been a piriform jar, P571, of which the lower half survived. On the floor was a tripod cooking pot, P341, and a rim fragment of a large deep bowl with spout was found between the big pithos and the jar. Probably the whole vase was here at the time of the destruc- tion, but this is not certain as so little survived. The presence of three large vessels in situ and absence of other features suggest that this was a storage magazine with a probable working sur- face on the raised rock shelf at the south end. Room 23 This is a narrow room bounded by Area 21 up to the east and by the completely eroded north part of 31 to the west while at the north end it opens on to Area 24 and the passage into Room 22. The east and south walls have been described above under 21 and 31. The west wall, as so often, is built into a steep drop in the rock; though eroded on top (width 0.64 m.), it has four good courses preserved on its west face. At the north end the remains are very jumbled. The dimensions are EW 0.84 m. max., NS 2.98 m. The room contained several fragmentary vases marking the final destruction. These included body and base fragments of a pithos, P634, towards the centre, parts of a buff piriform jar with black bands, P583, towards the north end, and a small Myrtos ware jug, P508, near the south wall. A serpentine polisher, 194, was found near the pithos fragments. Area 24 West of the passage into Room 22 and north of Area 31 is the almost completely eroded area designated 24. On the north-east the big stairway leading up east begins (p. 29). There is no east wall but a few loose stones may represent a westward continuation of the north wall of the passage into 22. In the south-east corner a short wall seems to have projected northwards (ht. preserved 0.40 m. with three rough courses), forming the north end of the west wall of Room 23. Jumbled and loose stones on the south probably indicate a south wall dividing the area from 31 . Over the area the rock slopes down westwards and the western limit is formed by a north- south wall built into a fall in the rock and with two courses surviving on the west face. Whether this ever rose as a true wall is doubtful since 24 has too steep a slope to suggest it was used as a D</page><page sequence="52">38 MYRTOS room. There may have been just a low wall designed to protect and facilitate the use of a line of low slabs and stands built against it on the west. These slabs and stands rest on the rock and pro- ject up to 0.58 m. from the wall. The area is open now on the north and there may have been no east-west wall until that of the main east-west Passage 14 is reached. Room 25. Room of the Stamp Seal This room lies south of Passage 14 between the north end of area 24 on the east and the Entrance Area 15 on the west. The north wall is the south wall of the passage (p. 29). The east wall is badly preserved on the surface but is built against a sharp fall in the rock and has about five courses preserved. The south wall has only a short section preserved and survives to only 0.30 m. The west wall is the east wall in Entrance 15 (p. 30). There may have been entrances in the north-west or south-west corners, but this is uncertain as the structures are so eroded. The room size is EW 3.14 m., NS 1.28 m. A heavily burnt black destruction level occurred above the white clay floor which overlay the rock (Fig. 4). Rim fragments of a large, deep bowl, P301, a medium-sized red painted bowl, P285, and of a large amphora, P91, occurred in the burnt level but there was too little of these vessels for us to be sure that they stood as whole vases in the room before the destruction. A fragmentary cup in cooking pot fabric, P360, and a miniature dark painted jug, P516, were also present. One other find in the burnt level was the serpentine stamp seal with engraved marks, 127 (PL 77A-B). Area 26. Area of the Fallen Pithoi Below Area 24 the rock fills away steeply to the west and if there were ever any structures on the slope they are now completely eroded. The area is bounded on the west by a continuation of the outer wall of the settlement south from Entrance Area 15. The wall survived to a height of 1.36 m. on the west face, with nine to ten courses. Its present top is covered with hard, decayed, calcined plaster suggesting that above c. 1.00 m. much plaster was used in the construction. At the north end the wall turns in west to the rock forming the first phase of the south wall of Entrance 15 (p. 30). This short east-west wall has ten surviving courses, ht. 1.26 m., at its west end. The masonry at this west end near to the join with the main west wall consists of well- laid, large, flat stones in the lower courses with rougher work including quernstones and earth packing above. At the south end of the main west wall there is again a short westward return into the rock face. Six courses with traces of plaster survived here. In contrast to normal practice on the site the west wall was not built directly against the rock face but stood away from it leaving a narrow north-south trench, 0.50 m. wide at the bottom. The trench grows wider higher up as the rock slopes away up to the east. Excavation to the south of the wall (trenches RR Extension and NN) showed that all trace of the continuation of the wall southwards was lost since the rock was exposed almost at the surface. To the great surprise of the excavators a deposit of three fine, large pithoi was found in the trench (PL 15A). They were smashed but essentially complete and probably stood originally in the trench on large, circular stands. One of these was the re-used base of a lekane, 106, diam. 0.52 m., another a heavy disk of reddish sandstone, 107, diam. 0.358 m.; both are visible in PL 15A, below left. The whole destruction level was marked by burning which had scorched the sandstone rock and caused it to crumble. The jars, from north to south (left to right on</page><page sequence="53">THE SETTLEMENT 39 PL 15A) are P618, P600 and P619. The centre one was 0.77 m. tall. The function of the vessels is unknown but none of them has holes above the base and as it is unlikely that Area 26 was roofed they may have been used to collect rainwater in the winter months. Curiously the in- terior of the central and largest pithos was stained red, especially the lower part. With the pithoi, and broken into many small pieces, was a large amphora, P94, a red burnished shallow open bowl, P218, two jugs (P407, Vasilike ware and P422, brown polished) and two Vasilike ware teapots (spouted jars P659, P667). There was also a fragment of a plain bowl in fine grey burnished ware (see after P4). Too little survives for us to know whether it was in use at the time of the destruction, but it was burnt and it would not be surprising if an occasional Period I vase continued in use through Period II, though no complete or even fairly complete vase in this fabric was found in any of the final destruction deposits. Room 27 The unburnt occupational debris of Period I spread over the rock in the triangular area and Rooms 27-28 to the south of it has been described above (pp. 1 1-13). The section through Room 27 (Fig. 5) shows a burnt level stratified above the unburnt material. This burnt level is the Period II final destruction in these rooms. The building remains themselves were seen to belong to Period II since the east wall and eastern half of the south wall of Room 27 (PI. 15B) were built on top of the Period I stratum and these walls are an integral part of the 27-29 block. Room 27 is rectangular, EW 4.00 m., NS 1.85 m. There is no doorway, so it must have been entered from above by steps. At the time of the final destruction an opening 0.58 m. wide had been made in the centre of the north wall by removal of the upper courses. The burning had spread through into the triangular area on the north, itself blocked off from Room 18 on the east before the destruction (p. 33). The north wall, width 0.50 m., survived to c. 0.80 m. in eight rough courses. The east wall, width 0.72 m., rested on the Period I level which was up to 0.40 m. deep because of the dip in the rock in the south-east part of the room. In the centre the wall had four surviving courses, ht. 0.33, but went deeper to meet the rock which rose in the north-east corner. Outside and below the wall to the east were the remains of an earlier wall on a slightly different line. This is probably the remains of a Period I structure. The south wall, width 0.50 m., rested on the Period I level 0.26 m. thick at the east end. The wall had about seven courses, ht. 0.70 m., here at the east. On the west it is built on bedrock, with five courses surviving, ht. 0.65 m. Roughly midway along the wall a small anta projects into the room. It is bonded into the wall with a rounded corner at the point of junction on the west. Opposite, on the south side of the wall, is a short projecting wall. The purpose of the anta and this short wall is unknown. The anta is too small to have been for extra roof support. Perhaps it was at the point of entry from the roof and provided support for steps or ladder. The west wall, built on the bedrock, is 0.76 m. wide and has seven preserved courses (ht. 0.80 m.). In the north-west corner it is bonded in with the north wall. Its western side here had been destroyed by the roots of a large bush growing above. At the base of the burnt destruction level were three paving slabs in the eastern part of the room, like those on the floors in Rooms 16, 17 and 18. There was no floor deposit of vases but the sherd material in the level includes fragments of a pithos, a dark painted piriform jar, a dark painted pseudo- Vasilike ware sherd, bits of a Vasilike ware jug and conical bowl, of Myrtos ware jugs, several red painted sherds and a few baking plate fragments. Most of the sherd material was burnt. There were also two fragments of hatched ware. This slight con- tamination from the Period I level below is not surprising since the burnt floor was only trodden</page><page sequence="54">40 MYRTOS earth over the earlier unburnt stratum. Within the triangular area north of the room the top of the burnt level included a few dark painted fragments with parts of a purplish painted jug. The burning continued down but there was a thick deposit of unburnt Period I material below (p. 12). Room 28 (PL 16A). This is another rectangular room, lying south of 27. The north wall is the south wall of 27. From it a wall projects south towards the centre of the room. Its south end is now broken off so that it is not known how far south it came. It has three preserved courses. The east wall is now badly disturbed and out of line. It does not exist on the south-east corner and we cannot know whether it continued to the corner or whether there was an entrance to the room here. No other doorways occur. The wall is c. 0.55 m. wide and has two to three courses only. The south wall (width c. 0.44 m.) is also disturbed at the east end. The west wall has about four courses sur- viving (ht. 0.45 m.) . The width is c. 0.43 m. Immediately west are the badly disturbed remains of what was probably the northern continuation of the Period I wall between 36 and 37 to the south. There is no reason to suppose that Room 28 was unroofed, which means that the early Minoan builders were able to span a distance of 2.60 m. in their roof construction. The room measures EW 2.60 m., NS 4.04 m. As in Room 27 a burnt level overlay the unburnt Period I sandy stratum on the rock (p. 12). There was no floor at the base of the burnt level and for this reason the pottery from the level, while including much that is typical of Period II and which does not occur in the level below, also has sherds of Period I. There are then two clear levels: a pure Period I stratum, unburnt, on bedrock, overlain by a burnt stratum with no observable floor, containing Period II material with sherds of Period I mixed in it. Dark painted and red painted wares (including part of the neck of a piriform jar) were common among the fine fabrics together with a few Myrtos ware jug fragments, and several Vasilike ware sherds including a fragment of a spouted jar, of a bowl or goblet and the bowl, P182, part of which came from tumbled stones in the south-east corner and part from the burnt level in Room 35 to the south. Cooking pot sherds occurred, but few had the distinct orange fabric with white grits of Period I. Pithos and amphora fragments (typical of Period II), some burnt, were also found. With all this came six fine grey ware sherds, ten dark on light hatched (PI. 32A, top row centre) and a fragment of a jug base with a black painted cross, these pieces being typical of the Period I level here and to the north. There was also a fragment of a strainer (PI. 32A top row right), datable only as Period I- II. The burnt level also contained two spindle whorls, a loomweight and an unfinished stone weight. There were also two more whorls and a clay bull's head figurine (PL 73G), 71, in the surface level. Since the Period I level contained three spindle whorls and a loomweight (p. 13) it might be argued that those in the burnt level are Period I admixture or else re-use in Period II. But neither the two spindle whorls in the burnt level nor the two in the surface level nor 1 7 of the 18 from Period II final destruction contexts elsewhere had the distinctive white gritty fabric of Period I, while three of the four from that level in 27-28 did; the other was painted and the fabric not visible. It looks then as though Room 28 was a spinning and perhaps weaving place in Period II, as the area had been earlier in I. With such a function it is not surprising that Room 28 had no floor deposit of vases. Room 29. Room of the Clay Sealing This is a little narrow room immediately west of Room 27. Its east wall is the west wall ofthat</page><page sequence="55">THE SETTLEMENT 4I room. The north wall is the south wall of Room 20. The short cross wall at the south end is built against the disturbed remains of the north-south wall of Period I coming up from between 36 and 37 to the south. It is 0.70 m. wide with four surviving courses, ht. 0.70 m. The west wall was once substantial but is badly preserved. There are three courses in places but it is only c. 0.25 m. high and 0.46 m. wide. Among the loose stones was a lump of ceiling plaster and traces of decayed mudbrick from the upper part of the wall. In the fill of the room were many more pieces of fallen plaster. The entrance lay at the north-west corner over a threshold of large flat slabs, 1. 00 m. wide. The dimensions of the room are EW 0.64 m. max., NS 2.60 m. The room was devoid of finds save for a small, burnt juglet, P517, in the south-west corner, a pestle in the centre and a spindle whorl just inside the entrance. But an interesting find came to light just outside the entrance on the north side. This was a clay sealing with impressions of an engraved seal (134, Fig. 97, PI. 77G). In view of the find spot and the fact that only one sealing occurred its function may have been to seal the door into Room 29. Such a usage obtained in the MM II Palace of Phaistos, in Egypt and at the Palace of Mari.i There was a little pottery in the fill, including several Period I hatched and fine grey sherds (PL 33D, lower row, second from right). But the room was probably not built until Period II since its south wall bonds in with the west wall of Room 28. Areas 30-31 The Period I wall construction and the pottery evidence for the use of these areas at that time is set out above (p. I3f.). Area 30 must have been in use in Period II, as an open court sloping down somewhat to the west (approximate size, EW 2.00 m. widening to 2.52 m. at the south end, NS 4.24 m.), since it gives access to Room 20 on the north where there was a major final destruction deposit. The fill of Room 29 and Area 30 included part of a Vasilike ware bowl, P145. Whether Area 31 with its remains of strong east-west walls was in use in Period II is doubt- ful. As noted above, p. 13, there were no floors or stratified levels in this very eroded region, and the pottery was almost exclusively Period I. There was no Vasilike ware, but rim and neck fragments of three large amphoras and probably a fragment of a red burnished bowl, P200, belong to Period II, and there was probably access to Area 26 with its final destruction deposit of pithoi and to the Period II rooms to the north-east. But there is no evidence now that the buildings of 31 were in use in the second phase, since nearly everything is eroded. Room 32 South-east of Room 28 on the eastern edge of the site is a narrow room or passage, EW 1.14 m. max., NS approximately 4.26 m. The north and south ends ançl the south-east corner are badly disturbed. In the north-west corner there may have been an exit into Room 28. Two large stones at the north end may be all that remains of a north wall. The east wall is poorly pre- served at the north end but it turns and makes a wider passage to the south. Here it is well built with up to six courses preserved (ht. 0.53 m.) with plaster in place here and there. Towards the south end it turns east with a carefully built corner. There was probably a doorway here, leading outside the settlement on to an open space between the wall and the cliff edge. The space was probably used for north-south access along the eastern edge of the settlement. South of the 1 E. Fiandra, Πεπραγμένα του Β' ΔιεΟνοο* Κρητολογικοο Συνεδρίου.

Across the south end are stones (mostly querns) in two courses (ht. 0.17 m., width 0.34 m.) which may be the remains of a south wall. The west wall has a well-preserved face (ht. 0.38 m., three courses). Its original width is problematical since on the south there is no proper west face while to the north it appears to be 1.35 m. wide, built against the stairway up from Room 34. The rock floor was extremely uneven and much burnt. There was a large patch of burnt wood by the doorway on the east side, c. 0.40 χ 0.40 m. It may have been the remains of a doorpost. Six pots remained from the final destruction. At the north end was a fragmentary jar in a polished yellow fabric, P396, which had been scattered about. Towards the centre and south- wards a magnificent Vasilike ware jug lay scattered and intensely burnt, P413 (PL 50B). Also in this area was a flat, disk lid with a groove on the underside, P556. It has a rough dark on light pattern. In the south-west corner against the wall was a fragmentary dark painted jug, P484, and a little further south again by the wall lay a complete Vasilike ware cup, P371, and by it a complete teapot in pseudo- Vasilike ware, P649. Also from the room came a large deep bowl with black paint, P275 (with fragments in Area 33 also), a fragment of a shallow open bowl in Vasilike ware, P210, and a fragment of a similar bowl in pseudo- Vasilike ware, P165. These pots suggest the area was in use as a room. Area 33 and the Pot Hole The badly preserved south wall of 32 bounds a little area to the south in which lies a large natural hollow in the rock with a decayed rock floor forming soft yellowish sand. Flimsy lines of stones bound this hollow on the south and east and may be the remains of walls. The area is open on the west while a north-west corner is provided by a bastion-like projection from the south wall of Room 34. The area defined, lying on the east edge of the settlement, seems now to be totally insignificant in terms of the whole site with its well-built rooms. It was therefore a matter of great surprise that the excavation of the natural hollow and the rock floor just north and west of it yielded a magnificent final destruction deposit of twenty-seven vases and six small lids. Most of the vases had been affected by the destruction fire. Their positions are shown in Fig. 19. The deposit as a whole illustrates most of the types in use at the time of the destruction (VW = Vasilike ware) : Amphora, P81. Bowls: plain, red paint, P135; conical spouted, VW, P248; deep spouted, VW, P286; large, deep, with thickened rim, P277, P275 (some of it was in Room 32 to the north), P303 (fragment only); small, incurving profile, everted rim, polished buff, P151. Burner, P318. Goblets: VW, P385; red paint P388. Jugs: VW, P419, P398; red/brown burnished, P432, P435; black paint, P464; dark paint P466, P485, P483; red paint P465, P486; Myrtos ware, P438, P439, P446. Lids, five miniature and one small with bird's head knob, P540-P545. Piriform jar, buff surface, P594. Spouted jars: red burnished, P680; pseudo-VW, P681. With the vases were six stone polishers, probably pottery burnishers, of serpentine and dio- rite, i99a-f. The deposit seems to have remained undisturbed since the destruction. Why it was located here is not known, but it is unlikely that the hollow was part of a room. It was perhaps a store for vases not in use. Since some of the vases were complete (and probably all were before the destruction) the place was definitely not a rubbish area.</page><page sequence="57">THE SETTLEMENT 43 fig. 19 Pot Hole 33. Area 33 extends 3.16 m. westwards from the hole, south of Room 34. The western part is bounded on the north by the south wall of Room 34. This is badly disturbed, with about three rough courses surviving, but seems to have been a stout wall originally, width c. 0.70 m. The projecting piece on the south has a roughly curved face and looks like a small bastion (Fig. 19, left) . It would have provided a good viewing point east and probably south down towards the main north-south passage. On the west of the area is a short north-south wall, again with only about three courses. Within these north and west walls was a mass of stones. They might well have fallen from the big north wall and bastion but, since the rock dips down here, they may have been a deliberate filling or packing to provide a rough cobbled, open area. This would have been sensible since the area stands at the head of a passageway up from the south and gives access to the pot store on the east, in which direction the rock rises before dipping into the pot hole. In either case 33 west seems to have been an open area south of Room 34. (The plan shows stones in the south part which seem to have been put in to fill up the rock hollow) . There were a few sherds among the mass of stones and rather more in an earth level under them, above the rock. They were all of Period II and included a flaring bowl, P267; of earlier date was one hatched fragment only. Room 34 All the walls of this room and of 32 to the east were in a very poor state of preservation. Their existing tops had been further disturbed by ploughing in World War II. Cleaning of the modern surface revealed at once a mass of fallen stones and great quantities of sherds (PL 16B). This fill of broken pottery continued right down to the rock, a level c. 0.50 m. thick. From the north-east corner a short passage leads north, flanked on the west by a wall (width 0.50 m., ht. preserved 0.77 m., in five courses including two blocks of gypsum) and on the east</page><page sequence="58">44 MYRTOS by a stairway built against the wide dividing wall between 34 and 32. The stairway must have provided access up into Room 28. In its first phase of use (within Period II) the passage had two steps of stones set into the rock (see plan for the south step; the north lay under the stones at the north end). At the head of the passage were stones set against the rock which rises abruptly to form the floor of Room 28. In the final period of use the north end of the passage had become filled up and a hard white earth floor ran across this end and just over the stone top of the stair- way. On it were two small dark painted jugs, P509 and P514 and in the fill above was the painted bowl, P143. Many large wall stones lay across the north end of the passage (included on the plan) and these might represent the very disturbed remains of the east end of the south wall of 28. Since, however, there was no recognizable structure here they were probably all tumble, the south wall stopping on the western edge of the passage way from 34 and forming a corner with the west wall of the passage. The north wall of 34 west of the passage was preserved to 0.54 m. in about five courses (width 0.55 m.). The east wall south of the stairway has only a few stones remaining and its line is lost. For the south wall see above under Area 33. The disturbed west wall (width c. 0.76 m.) has only four courses left, ht. 0.47 m., and the west face is ill-defined. The stones include one gypsum block. The room size is EW 2.80 m. approx., NS 2.00 m. The pottery fill consisted of 160 kg.± io%* of sherds, vastly more than from any other single area of the site. All of it was sherd material, though some vases had a fair amount preserved. With the exception of an incised grey ware goblet foot, P42 (Fig. 43, PL 33D, top centre), from directly above the rock in the north-west corner of the room, and five other sherds (see below), this mass of material was of Period II. It was quite unstratified with fragments of individual vessels coming from various areas and depths. The catalogued fragmentary vases are as follows ( VW = Vasilike ware) : Baking dish, Pi 12. Bowls: incurving profile, VW, P142; S profile, red painted, P146, P148, P149; shallow open, P164; shallow open, beaded rim, red painted, P190; everted rim, red painted, P192; flaring, black painted, P232, P251, red burnished, P245, red painted, P233; deep, flaring, handles at rim, red painted, P262, P273. Burner, P315. Cooking pot jar, P323. Cup, red painted, P357. Jugs: black painted, with incised 'twisted' handle, P487; red painted, P488; Myrtos ware, P447 (at the south end of the stairway), P448-P450. Spouted jars: VW, P682; dark painted, P672. These are the better preserved pieces from the hundreds represented by the sherds. The character of the material is more fully revealed from the sherd count.2 The 5669 sherds (not including the catalogued vases) were mostly dark or red painted, Myrtos ware and cooking pot ware (which breaks into small pieces) . The first group, the red or dark painted, was predomi- nant. There was less pithos (212 pieces) and 85 pieces of Vasilike ware. Cooking pot included 65 whole or broken tripod feet. With all this were the incised goblet foot and only three other fragments of fine grey ware, a clear indication that this ware was almost non-existent in Period II, or in fact non-existent since these few pieces could easily represent survivals from Period I. Of hatched ware there were only two small scraps in the surface level, where one fragment of Late Roman combed ware was also found. From the surface level came the unfinished sealstone, 129 (Fig. 97, PI. 77A, top centre) and there were five pierced stone weights and four unfinished ones from the fill. The reason for the mass of sherd material in the room is not known. The absence of complete vases argues against a pottery store. It may then have been a rubbish dump for broken vessels 1 Eleven zembils (rubber buckets) of sherds. 2 Carried out by Dr Wardle and Dr Branigan in 1967.</page><page sequence="59">THE SETTLEMENT 45 which had accumulated throughout Period II.

Possibly too a short projecting structure from the south wall of 35 represents a stairway or sup- port for steps or ladder. The north wall is the south wall of Room 28 (p. 40), the east and south walls are described under 34. The south wall is badly disturbed at the west end and may originally have continued westwards blocking off 36, which was not in use in Period II. The west wall is not well preserved but continues on south dividing 36 and 37. Its Period I date is discussed above (p. 16). Below the surface level Room 35 was filled with dark burnt earth which extended west into the south-east corner of Area 30 and into the north end of 37 and part of 38, where it covered the Period I remains. The burning is of Period II, but it was probably due to the use of 35 as a kitchen rather than to the final destruction fire. The pottery in the ashy fill in the central and east parts consisted of many fragments of baking dishes (cooking pot fabric) with a few cooking pot, Myrtos ware and dark painted sherds. There was also a fragment of a dark on light bowl like the more complete piece, P143, from the fill in the passage to the east. Below the ash level was a white clay floor in the make up of which were a few Period II sherds of pithos, Myrtos ware, red and dark painted wares, including part of a brown burnished shallow open bowl, Ρ 157, fragments of two others, P181, P185, and a typical dark painted cup with rising handle. In the burnt level at the west end were more baking dish fragments with the upper part of a black painted jug, fragments of a brown painted jug or piri- form jar and one scrap of Vasilike ware. There was also one scrap of fine grey ware. The burnt deposit continued into the south-east corner of Area 30 and the pottery was again mostly fragments of baking dishes and cooking pots. It continued under the stones in this corner of the area, showing them to be tumble from the west wall of Room 28 and making it likely that there was direct access from this corner into Room 35. Area 36 The Period I deposit blocked off in the rock hollow at the south end has been described. It is probable that the area was not used in Period II. The burnt earth of 35 did not extend south into 36 and there was no Period II pottery evidence. The base of a pithos, P635, came up in the surface level. Room 37 At the south end the first structure below surface was the collapsed stairway from 40 with the remains of a Period I pottery deposit above it. Towards the north end the burnt level with Period II sherds (p. i6f.) overlay the unburnt Period I level. At the north end itself the burnt deposit went down from immediately below the surface to the rock as in Room 35, and con- tinued north into the corner of Area 30. The pottery from the burnt level consisted mostly of</page><page sequence="60">46 MYRTOS more baking dish fragments (P103, Pin (surface level) and P119 were catalogued), with fragments of a plain, dark painted bowl, Ρ 138, of a shallow, open bowl, also dark painted, P171, of a tripod cooking pot, P343, of a brown painted, long-spouted jar (teapot), P660, and of a red painted jug and dark painted piriform jar. All this is typical of a Period II destruction. There were also two scraps of fine grey ware. As with the south end of 36 no evidence survived to show that the stairway at the south end of 37 continued in use in Period II. The kitchen area was confined to the south-east corner of 30, to 35 and the northern half of 37. The burning petered out on the west over the north-east part of Room 38. Rooms 38-40 The Period I remains were covered by the surface level. The pottery from this level was mainly Period II (p. 17) but no evidence survived for associated structures and the buildings below were probably not in use at this time. One suggestive indication that they were out of use was the spread of the burnt level from 35 and 37 over the north-east of Room 38. Rooms 41-43 It was shown above, p. I4f, that these large rooms on the western preserved edge of the settle- ment were of Period I date. They may have continued in use through II since the unstratified fill of pottery with them included pieces of the later period (ibid.). Area 44 South of Area 33 and the pot hole the structures are extremely denuded. The remains of a north-south passage survive, leading up to 33, with a stretch of wall 2.86 m. long on the east. It has up to three courses (ht. 0.23 m.). A once substantial, but poorly preserved wall (with a single course) to the west gives the passage a width of 0.90 m. At the north end the rock is shaped to form steps before the passage terminates over stones put in to fill the rock hollow. To the east of the passage were a number of scattered stones, probably representing the remains of a room. Among them was a circular, cylindrical cutting in the rock like those in Area 31 and Entrance Area 15. It was 0.36 m. in diameter and 0.32 m. deep. It contained a piece of a dark painted piriform jar, a fragment of a red painted shallow open bowl and other scraps. A red painted goblet without its base, P375, lay among the stones north-east of the pit and by it was part of a small red painted bowl, P141. All this pottery is typical of Period II. At the south end of the passage, as preserved, against the east wall, were fragments of a large tub or lekane, P536· Area 45 This designates the completely eroded space west of 44 and south of Room 46. In the west are the Period I rooms 48-51. Along the south side ran the East-West Way, 67, which forms the northern limit of the whole southern area. With passages on the south and east 45 may well have been an open area or court. The unstratified pottery was of Period II with several fragments of Vasilike ware, including the profile of a conical bowl, P230, and that of a red painted, flaring bowl, P304.</page><page sequence="61">THE SETTLEMENT 47 Room 46 This room lies north of Area 45 and was entered on its south side. It is rectangular and measures EW 2.12 m., NS 1 .60 m. The north wall is the thick Period I construction at the south end of 36 (p. 18). It was a well-built south face for Room 46, with three preserved courses. The dis- turbed east wall divides the room from the passage in 44 to the east and is described above. The south wall runs out from this east wall but does not extend to the south-west corner where there was probably an entrance. The wall is 0.42 m. wide and has up to three courses preserved, ht. 0.34 m. The west wall is the east wall of Cell 47 (p. 18) ; it was preserved to 0.29 m. in Room 46. The floor was paved with large, flat slabs. One of these may have had a religious or a sport- ing connexion since it contained small holes in a rough circle on its top surface (see p. 231, 167). On the paving was a small deposit of four fragmentary Period II vases. The room came into existence in Period II with the building of the east and south walls and the paving of the floor. The walls formed a rectangle with the Period I construction on the west and north (see p. 18). The partially preserved vases on the floor were : a red painted, small conical bowl, P234, near the south-east corner; another, more flaring, P225, towards the centre, and near it a fragment of a Vasilike ware jug or long-spouted jar (teapot), P408. A small Vasilike ware spouted bowl, P309, also came from the room but had fragments scattered as far as Room 66, more than 8 metres to the south-east. Cells 47-48. Rooms 49-51 These Period I constructions have been described above. There is no ceramic or other evidence that the surviving remains were in use in Period II. This may appear surprising when the site is studied today. On the ground the rooms would appear to be contemporary with the others of the site. But the ceramic evidence, though slight, pointed without doubt to Period I (p. 1 7-20), while two other points need to be kept in mind: the floor deposits in Rooms 49 and 51 were unburnt, unlike all the 21 final destruction floor deposits, but like the Period I material elsewhere, and these rooms are on a lower level than Room 46 up to the east and could easily have been covered over in Period II if these walls then survived no higher than they did on excavation. The southern area is next described, first with Room 52 on the eastern edge. Room 52 This little room stands close to the cliff edge and was probably the easternmost room of the settlement. The rock rises steeply to the north and there was no trace of buildings above the room. The entrance, width 0.62 m., is from Room 53 to the south. The north wall is built against the rock face. It is up to 0.52 m. wide and has up to seven courses preserved (ht. 0.72 m.). At the west end it bends slightly to the south and here its lower courses project, giving a small ledge 0.42 m. above the floor. The east wall, also built against the rock, has three to four courses of flattish stones, preserved to 0.54 m. The wall seems to have continued south as the east wall of Room 53 but it is very scrappy here. The structure on the south side, very ruined at its east end, has five to six courses (ht. 0.62 m.) on the west. The width here is 0.60 m. It is un- certain whether this was a wall or simply a low bench on the rock, serving 52 and 53. The west wall, like those on the north and east, is built against the rock, with five courses preserved to 0.40 m. The room size is EW 2.06 m., NS 1.00 m.</page><page sequence="62">48 MYRTOS On the floor of the room in the south-east corner was a small red painted jug with horizontal rim, P520, and beside it part of a buff surfaced flaring bowl with vertical handle, P243. Part of a brown painted shallow open bowl, P172, also came from the room, as did a spindle whorl and pierced stone weight. Room 53. South-East Pithos Magazine A The southern and eastern walls are lost since the rock cropped up almost to the modern surface. The north wall or bench is described above under Room 52. For the west wall see Room 54. The room measures roughly EW 2.40 m. and at least 2.50 m. NS. Against the west wall and towards the centre a group of four large vessels was found in a thick burnt destruction level (Fig. 20). These were three pithoi, P611, P627 and P636, of which the lower part survived, while a large amphora, the upper part surviving, P92, stood a little to the south against the end of the wall. Beside P636 was found a tiny lid, P549. Most of the inside of P611 was much rotted, perhaps from the acids of wine or olives in salt. Oil preserves interiors and would not have rotted the vessel, which was intended for liquids since it has a small hole just above the base. P627 likewise had a hole so that one function of the magazine was the storage of liquids. Room 54. South-East Pithos Magazine Β (PI. 1 7Α-Β) The room lies to the west of 53 and is separated from it by a north-south wall with a bench Τ ' *' - «=a-&lt;3^í S R C C K P)/4 y BENCH ' ^^Í^'. - / S LEDGE / M ( Pm F0*™ ) I STAND 'Wj O1U fig. 20 South-East Magazines 53 and 54.</page><page sequence="63">THE SETTLEMENT 49 built against it within 54. The north wall (PL 17B) is built against the steep rock face and was preserved to 1.05 m. in nine rough courses. Plaster was preserved on its face. The east wall, width 0.64111.J had up to five courses preserved to 0.81 m. at the north end. The bench (Figs. 10 and 20) was built of large rough stones in two levels, resting on the rock. It was 1.26 m. long on the west face and 0.53 m. wide. The maximum height was 0.45 m. The south wall of the room was not well preserved and had only one to two courses in Room 54. The width was c. 0.52 m. and it was built across the rock slope, dividing the room from 56 to the south. The entrance may have been in the south-east corner, below the bench, but we cannot be certain since two large amphoras stood here and any structures to the south-east have gone completely. It is possible that 53 and 54 were one large room originally, with the bench in the centre and the entrance in the south wall to the east of 54. The west wall was preserved to 0.91 m. with up to eight rough courses. Plaster was still in position on its face in Room 54. The upper courses had leaned westwards; the width was c. 0.70 m. The floor of the room consisted of hard-packed white clayey earth over the rock; it had been much burnt by the destruction fire which had strongly affected the whole deposit (Fig. 10). The room size was EW 1.66 m. at the north end, NS 3.30 m. Lumps of ceiling plaster with reed impressions were found high in the fill, as was an area of burnt wood over and to the west of the bench. This may have been the remains of roof timber. At the north end was a deposit of large storage vessels (Fig. 20) which had been well pre- served since their tops were just below the preserved heights of the north and west walls (PL 17 A).* In the north-east corner was a pithos, P607, still in position, while P628, a smaller pithos beside it, was able to be taken out unbroken over four thousand years since the day it was last used. The base had rotted away in its lifetime and it stood on a re-used potter's turn-table, no, The lower two-thirds of the interior were burnt, so that, with the separate base, the pithos was not storing liquid but probably grain. The same may have been the case with P607, and with the large amphora, P84, which had no holes above the base but were heavily burnt in places on the inside. Stones had been packed round the base of P84 to keep it steady on the floor. In the north-east corner was a piriform jar, P579, which had fallen southwards. Inside was only a snail shell and a bone. The vase was well above the floor and might have stood on the north wall if it had a ledge at its preserved level. Right in the corner behind the piriform jar and scattered against the north wall was a fine spouted jar, P697, whose base had fallen into the complete pithos, P628. Further south the lower part of another large pithos, P637, came up in situ. The walls had not survived high enough to save the upper part. Like the others it was burnt inside and had no hole above the base. Under it was a door socket, 61. South of the bench were two large am- phoras, P95 and P96; the upper part of P95 had gone while P96 had only the base and lower part of the body. Beside it was a potter's turn-table, in, which must have been used as its stand, or for P95. A spindle whorl, 146, lay just south of P95. In addition to these large storage vessels fragments of five smaller vases came from the destruction. Probably they were in use in the room as whole vases. Bowls: shallow, open, with inturned rim, P186, P187; open, flaring, P212; large, deep, thickened rim, bridge spout, P296. Piriform jar, buff with dark band and collar, P584. A large fragment of a cooking pot, P328, came from the surface level. The presence of the large vessels in situ with strongly burnt interiors and no spout hole above the base suggests that Magazine Β was a grain store. In Magazine A, Room 53, two of the three 1 Arch.Delt. 24 (1969) Χρονικά PI. 432f.</page><page sequence="64">50 MYRTOS large vessels with the lower part intact had a hole above the base and must have been for liquids. Hence this magazine was probably a liquid store, perhaps of wine or olives in salt water, but not olive oil (see above) . Whatever their purposes ten large vessels in use in these two small rooms are part of the evidence for the considerable storage capacity of the settlement. Area 55 South of Room 53 the slope held only tumbled stones above the rock and it is impossible to say if there were any structures here. The slope northward is steep but at the top there was probably an entrance to 53-54. On the west are the badly disturbed remains of a wall, the east wall of 56. From the south end of this wall another runs eastwards, built into the slope of the rock. This wall limits Area 55 on the south. It has three courses preserved, ht. 0.54 m. and is c. 0.35 m. wide. The wall is 2.80 m. long and at its east end there is a stump of a return wall going south for 0.50 m. The whole area south of the wall was a mass of tumbled stones on the rock and, as with the slope north of the wall we cannot say if there were once structures. The lower part of a dark painted jug was found among the tumble and a stone weight came up on the rock north of the wall. Area 56 This long narrow area lies west of Area 55 and south of Magazine 54. There is no trace of a southern wall and it may have been an area providing access to Room 57 (see below), with the west, north and east walls standing as external walls of the settlement here. The area is c. 1.40 m. EW and the west wall has a preserved length of 5.63 m. The north wall is the south wall of Magazine 54 (above, p. 49). The east wall is now only a rough mass of stones, but was once substantial. The preserved height reaches 0.56 m. and the width was perhaps 0.70-0.80 m. From above the wall came a specimen of roof plaster with an impressed hollow running down it, 7.5 cm. wide. This is too wide for a reed diameter and was clearly the impression of a wooden pole. Decayed mud brick also overlay the wall and continued westward. The west wall is much more interesting. Towards the north end it is preserved to 0.85 m. in five rough courses. In the north-west corner the rock rises steeply. Over it was an area of burnt earth without sherds. Just south of it up on the wall was a flat circular area of plaster, 0.28 m. in diameter, its centre 1.26 m. from the corner of the wall with the north wall. The thickness was only 1 cm. It is possible that this circular plaster on the wall indicates a column base and the burnt earth by it against the wall might have been the decayed remnants of a wooden column. However, a column would have been pointless unless the wall north or south of it rose no higher than the base, or at any rate did not rise to the ceiling level. In which case the column would have supported the roof and there would have been a window in the upper part of the wall. With a roof support of this kind wooden poles or beams rather than reeds would certainly have been needed to run north-south above the wall. Interestingly, as we have seen, a plaster frag- ment just to the east did have an impression which must have been from a pole, and there were similar fragments above the rock outcrop in the north-west corner of the room. But the existence of a column is conjectural, and the evidence is insufficient to indicate the use of the column in Early Minoan architecture. The wall continued down south of the circular plaster and had plaster in position on its east face. It was preserved to 0.90 m. here in about six courses where it becomes the east wall of Room 58. It seems originally to have ended with a good corner where it is joined by the south wall of</page><page sequence="65">THE SETTLEMENT 5I Room 58. Later it was continued further south, abutting and not bonded in with the northern part. This southern section, which is poorly preserved (ht. 0.42 m. up to three courses), forms the east wall of Room 60, which means that this room in its final state is a later construction than and an addition to 58-59 to the north. The wall is broken away at the south end and may have continued further south. The only material from the area was a broken and much scattered My r tos ware jug, P451, part of a shallow open bowl, P173, among the burnt debris, and a big spherical loomweight, 82, near the original external corner of Room 58. Room 57. South-East Kitchen This lies north-west of 56, surrounded by very thick walls. There was an interesting floor deposit of cooking pots, unfortunately fragmentary since the rock is much higher here than in the sur- rounding rooms and the floor was close to the modern surface. The walls are not well preserved. On the north side is a line of footings which could have served as a small ledge, 0.30 m. wide. Above rises the north wall to 0.56 m. Towards the east end is a projection south, perhaps a bench c. 0.45 m. high in four courses. From the preserved top of the wall a surface of stones ran back c. 0.75 m. to the south face of the south wall of Room 66. Since twenty- two burnt bones (a high concentration for the site), a blade and flake of obsidian, a large piece of baking plate, P108, and a burnt jug, P522, with the same fabric and paint as several vessels in the room deposit were found among the stones, it is possible that this upper area was used for eating food cooked in the room below. The east wall of the kitchen is the west wall of 54 (p. 49). It is 0.80 m. wide at the south end. The south wall was in very poor condi- tion (width c. 0.58 m., ht. 0.45 m., up to two courses) but there was probably a doorway at the west end through to the south part of 57 (width 0.48 m.) over a stone threshold. The west wall appears to have been a massive structure flanking the main north-south passage on the west. At the north end it is 0.96 m. wide and at the south 0.52 m. It has up to four courses, ht. 0.40 m., on the room face. The room measures EW 1.40 m. max., NS 1.90 m. The floor was of the usual hard-packed white clayey earth which had been badly burned in the fire ; the latter had greatly affected the whole deposit. On the east side a pit had been dug in the rock, 0.29 m. deep, 0.33- 0.40 m. diameter at the top passing into a little cylindrical lower hole (0.15 m. diam.). A ring of stones, including a gypsum block, surrounded the pit on the north and east. Immediately north of it was a flat stone slab (PL 18A, right), out of position and with burnt material below. It had perhaps rested on the ring of stones and covered the pit. The only thing in the pit was a cowrie shell, but its function was doubtless a cooking hole within the kitchen. South of it, in the corner of the room, was an area of very heavy burning. The room has no entrance, save from the area to the south which was itself probably en- closed all round. This is strange since it was clearly a place of everyday use, as the floor deposit showed. Unless the southern area had a way in from outside entry to the kitchen itself must have been by ladder. The burnt level above the floor was thick with fragmentary kitchen vessels (PL 18A). Ajar with moulded rim, P393, was crushed in the centre with part of a cup with a large handle north-east of it, P348. Beside the jar against the west wall was part of a baking dish on low wide feet, P131, and beyond this in the north-west corner was the upper part of a Myrtos ware jug, P452. With it was cooking pot P325. South of the crushed jar, P393, was a much broken, dark painted jug, P490. Beside it to the east lay a cooking pot jar, P327, and a baking plate fragment, Pi 13, with it. Between the cooking pot and the east wall was a brown burnished juglet with</page><page sequence="66">52 MYRTOS horizontal rim, P437, and to the south was half of a Vasilike ware goblet, P377 (PL 18A, lower right). In the south-west corner were the remains of another cooking pot jar with large handle, P326. Parts of two more came from the deposit, P324, P329. Scattered along the eastern edge of the room was the top part of a large amphora, Ρ 100, and the upper part of another, P90, also came from the deposit. Since, however, there was so little of these two large vessels it is not certain whether they formed part of the original destruction deposit. A fragment of a clay weight was found in the north part of the room in front of the wall footings, two obsidian blades in the north-east corner and a fragment of a spondylus shell bracelet beside the cooking pot, P327 (at the lower corner of the flat stone in PI. 18A). With several cooking pots in the deposit, a hole probably for cooking and animal bones among the stones to the north there can be little doubt that Room 57 was a kitchen. The ob- sidian blades, two lumps of pumice (one certainly used for rubbing) and a piece of worked cal- cite would have been kitchen tools used in preparing the food. The doorway in the south wall leads into an interesting area. This had a floor of stones which had been carefully plastered; a patch of plaster 0.48x0.33 m. survived in the centre, 0.02 m. thick. On the north side a short projection from the north wall (south wall of the kitchen) ended in a stone which was coated with plaster round its sides. Perhaps the whole projection was plastered originally. Fragments of mudbrick from the walls were found in the surface levels including a piece with three finger-prints. The area was about EW 2.00 m., NS 1.60 m. but the figures are very approximate since the faces of the east and south walls are not preserved and the others are disturbed. Other than from the kitchen there does not seem to have been access to this area. On the south there is a considerable drop into Room 58; the west wall was very thick and the east wall is too high, in the adjacent Area 56, for there to have been a threshold on to the plaster floor, though the circular plaster patch, even if not a column base (p. 50), might indicate the top of the wall at that point, which is the south-east corner of our plastered floor. In the north-west corner of 56 the rock rises up in ledges but these seem too uneven to have been used as a way on to the plastered floor at its north-east corner. Since the floor was plastered the area was probably roofed and ceiling plaster with pole impressions was found east of the east wall. The south wall of the area now seems rather thin and this side may have been open with a view into the possible weaving place, Room 58. The plastered area, however, may itself have been the weaving place (see below). A small lid, P550, was found in the doorway through to the kitchen. Room 58. Room of the Loomweights (Fig. 21) This little room lies south of the plastered floor. It was covered by and filled with an enormous mass of calcined plaster which had fallen from the walls and roof (PI. 18C). From the mass came a very fine piece of plaster built up in thin layers by replastering and painting (Appendix IV). Decayed mudbrick lay over this mass in patches at the surface. The north wall is built against the rock and survives in five courses to the level of the plastered floor above. The east wall is the central section of the west wall of 56 (p. 5of.). Decayed mudbrick from its superstructure lay to the east in 56. The south wall (width c. 0.38 m.) has up to three courses in this room, ht. 0.32 m. The west side was probably open to Room 59. A group of large, burnt stones, across the west side, was probably a threshold or step rather than part of a wall. The room size is EW 1.30 m., NS 1. 00 m. A burnt level lay above the yellow, sandy, decayed rock floor. In the plaster fill, near the south wall, were three spherical loomweights, 93-95, while four more, 83-84, 96-97, lay on the burnt floor towards the south-east corner (Fig. 21). An eighth,</page><page sequence="67">THE SETTLEMENT 53 82, was just outside in the fill of Area 56 and a ninth had fallen into the north-east corner of Room 60 just to the south, 98. Near the centre of the room was a fine pestle, 178, and four rubbers and a pounder were also found. A stone with a circular depression, 62 (PI. 71B) may have been a door socket or, in the context of the loomweights, a spindle stand.1 No pots were found in the room. With the group of heavy clay loomweights there can be no doubt that a loom stood hereabouts, either in 58 (but the space is small and absence of light would have been a problem) or on the roof of 58 or on the platform of 57 to the north. The discovery of weights high in the plaster fill of Room 58 and the odd weight in the fill of 56 strongly suggest that the loom was on the roof of 58 or the platform of 57. Some of the weights could easily have fallen through to the floor while others got caught in the superstructure.2 As usual in the ancient world the loom would have been upright, warp- weighted.3 The wood charcoals analysed from the room were predominantly oak (Appendix III), which means that there is a good proba- bility that the loom was made of this wood. The stone tools in the room must have been used in preparing the wool. For this the large tub found in position immediately to the west in Room 59 is very suggestive. Room 59. South-East Tub Room This room lies west of 58 and was entered on the south-east from 60. Its size is EW 2.90 m. (to the threshold of 58), NS 1.74 m. The north-west corner consists of a large outcrop of rock, unusable, across which the north wall is built. The rock continues to rise to the north and the wall is built right against it. Its width is c. 0.40 m., but at the top level (which is the south end of the main north-south passage before this turns west and south again in its final section to the main entrance) there is only one course left. The south face, however, in Room 59, has four to five courses. Further east the wall turns and then runs east, becoming the north wall of 58 (above, p. 52). There is no east wall since the room opens here on to 58. At the south-east is the door- way into 60, 0.86 m. wide. The south wall is not well preserved in Room 59. The width is c. 0.38 m. In the south-west corner the remains are very disturbed. The west wall, which divides the room from the passage, is very wide, 0.80 m., but the original width was only half this and it was later doubled by the addition of a strengthening wall in the passage. This wall does not continue to join the south wall of the room at the corner but stops and forms the north side of a niche in the passage (below, p. 58). At this north side (or termination of the double wall) there are nine courses preserved to 1.20 m. The chief find in the room was a large spouted clay tub, P532 (exactly like that in Area 8) in position on the floor and set resting on three large flat stones (Fig. 21). Immediately north was a long quernstone. The spout was pointing east and water could have soaked away easily in the soft rock which slopes down to the south. Lumps of plaster had fallen into the tub and there were huge pieces in the fill of the room (as above, Room 58), some with red painted surface. Near the tub were parts of three baking dishes, P104, P105, Pi 14, of a shallow open cooking pot bowl, P174 and of an S profile cooking pot bowl, P158. Clearly these had been in use with 1 Such a stand (To θρομύλι) is often used by Cretan women.

The Chromatographie analysis of the lipids which had soaked into the base of the tub (Appendix X) suggest it was used for animal sub- stances and not vegetable (e.g., oil).1 Since there was a weaving area near by it is likely that the tub was for washing the wool and textiles being produced. Wool contains much grease which has to be washed out or fulled and this may well explain the animal fats in the tub. The large, 1 The earth in the tub had a pH measurement of 7.6 (see p. 33 note 1).</page><page sequence="69">THE SETTLEMENT 55 shallow baking plates could easily have been used for drying the wool and the long flat quern- stone would have been a good stand. Room 60 (Fig. 21) This seems to have been a large, roughly square room with a central 1 shaped structure prob- ably intended as a roof support. The south-east corner of the room is lost, however, and the Period I rubbish material stretched as far north as the point where the east wall of the room is broken off. The room measures EW 3.60 m. and, on the fully preserved west side, NS 3.88 m. Although the room is smaller its plan bears a close similarity to the big Room 80 near the south- west corner. Both are roughly square with a central structure of the same shape, and both have a doorway in the centre of the north wall. Each also has a few features of its own, such as the bench or seat in the north-west corner of 60 and the pot cupboard in the same place in 80. These are the two largest rooms on the site and their locations, one in the south-east corner, one in the south-west, suggest a sense of careful planning for the southern area as a whole. The western part of the north wall is preserved to 0.75 m. in three to four courses. Built against it in the north-west corner is a bench or stand. This is made of flat stones topped by two large slabs and is c. 0.25 m. high. The length is 0.90 m. and the width 0.48 m. The entrance into Room 59 is 0.86 m. wide, with the wall end on either side carefully constructed. East of the doorway the wall is preserved to 0.59 m., with up to five courses. The east wall is badly disturbed. For the description see Room 56 of which it is the west wall, southern part. It had much plaster over it and was preserved to 0.42 m. On the south side there is no wall preserved in the eastern part but a few flat stones may be the remains of a wall, step or entrance. This is not certain, but these stones do mark the northern limit of an area packed with small stones which continues on south as Area 62 on the east side of 61 and into the excavated section (PL 7A). At the south end the stone level goes deeper and forms the fill of a pit. The quantities of old, broken sherds with these stones were all Period I (p. 2of.) and the whole deposit may have been laid as packing for a roadway up into Room 60 in its south-east corner. The western part of the south wall forms the north side of 'Room' 62 (which was a Period I rubbish pit with material closely parallel to that in 61, save for the absence of the thick level of small stones). On its north face in Room 60 it is preserved to 0.44 m. in two to three courses. Since the rock slopes down southwards, the south face, which had plaster in situ, is higher, 0.68 m. The width is 0.40 m. At the east end of this south wall a poorly preserved but stout wall runs north-south. For the south part see below under 62. The northern bit seems to have run right up to the central 1 shaped structure, but as it is so poorly preserved we do not know if it in fact stopped short to form a kind of buttress like that on the west side. The west wall of the room is the east wall of the main south entrance passage. It is both poorly preserved and complicated. The wall is about double the usual thickness, width 0.98 m., and the western side from the buttress of Room 60 south to the entrance sill may have been added for strengthening after the original construction, as happened further north in the passage, where a second thickness was added to the west wall of Room 59. The west side of the wall and the niche are described with the passage, 64. On the inner or Room 60 side the preserved height in the south is 0.41 m. in two to three courses, in poor condition. Towards the north end it has four courses of large flat stones, ht. 0.74 m. From the wall a buttress 0.77 m. wide projects 0.70 m. into the room, doubtless as a support for roof construction to counteract the distance of the north-south wall from the central structure. Its preserved height is 0.42 m. The central structure, probably designed as a support for the roof of reeds and wooden poles,</page><page sequence="70">56 MYRTOS was preserved to a height of 0.54 m. in the northern east-west section (width 0.44 m.), 0.28 m. in the central, north-south section (width 0.40 m.) and to only 0.18 m. in the southern east- west section (width 0.40 m.). The structure was free-standing unless the north-south structure below it to the south ran right up to its south face. The rock floor of the room was reddened and cracked in the north-west and south-west, pre- sumably by the destruction fire. Flat stone slabs, perhaps intended as stands, lay on the floor in the north-west corner on the east side. A strongly marked destruction level covered the floor, black, ashy in the north-east and with burnt debris, earth, stones and plaster generally. In this level was a good pottery deposit on the west side. Unfortunately its nearness to the modern sur- face and ploughing had rendered it rather fragmentary. The deposit (Fig. 21) included a pithos, P622, beside the buttress and a large amphora, P79, which had stood in the spot enclosed by the arms of the central structure. Both vessels had fallen southwards and fragments of the amphora were found several metres to the south and east. In the north-west corner was a Vasilike ware goblet, P389, and by the buttress the upper part of a Vasilike ware long-spouted jar (teapot), P661. A shallow open bowl with raised ears on the rim, P198, also came from the corner, as did two ring weights (214 is one), two serpentine rubbers (192 is one), and a rubber /polisher. Fragments of a pithos, P612, occurred in this corner some- what above the floor and it is not possible to say whether the vessel was part of the room's de- posit. Against the north wall of the central structure was another ring weight and beside it an obsidian core (Appendix VIII). In the south-west area were the remains of four jugs, P441 (Myrtos ware), P492 (dark painted), P505 (red painted) and P493 (brown painted), of which last only the upper half was preserved. With the jugs was a shallow, open bowl, red brown burnished with raised ears on the rim, P202, and in the south-west corner was the lower body and base of another pithos, P638, beside a stone stand. Presumably the jugs and bowl had been used for ladling substances from the large vessels, of which the amphora, P79, was the tallest (0.80 m.). Two spindle whorls, 149, 150, were also found in the deposit in the south-west corner. Room 60 was clearly a large work-room with large and small vessels in use at the moment of destruction and with access to the tub room and weaving place on the north. The number of stone tools from the north-west corner (two rubbers, Stone Tools type 5B, p. 234f. ; a rubber/ polisher type 6B, p. 235^, and two stone weights) and from the north-east (three quern rubbers type 5A, p. 234) is notable. They must have been for work in connexion with the tub or weaving place or the pots in Room 60. Someone would have sat on the bench in the north-west corner, using the tools. Clearly the group of rooms 58-60 was a working area in contrast to the kitchen further north, 57, and the storage magazines 53, 54 on the eastern edge. Area and Pit 61 The Period I material making up a possible packing for a south-east approach to Room 60 is discussed above (p. 2of.; see also p. 57). 'Room' and Pit 62 The contents are again Period I (p. 2of.). The structures almost certainly belong to Period II since the east and west walls continue south from Room 60. The north wall is the south wall ofthat room. The east wall is preserved to 0.79 m. on its east face beside Pit 61 and to 0.26 m. on the west face where the rock is higher. Standing out somewhat from the west face are three</page><page sequence="71">THE SETTLEMENT 57 large vertical slabs, apparently in position and forming an orthostatic eastern face for the pit. They are set against the rock which falls steeply here to form the pit. From the end of this big east wall a block of stones runs roughly northwest, forming a south wall for 62 and the pit. On its north face the structure is preserved to 0.61 m. in four to five courses. The width is 0.59 m. The west wall of 62 is poorly preserved at the south end, but the surviving stones are mostly gypsum blocks. Further north it has four to five courses, 0.61 m., on the east face, and is up to 0.83 m. It is in a jumbled state here but runs on north as the west wall of 60 and east wall of the main entrance passage. The room size is EW 1.25 m., NS 2.08 m. The walls of 62 as a whole at the south end like a roughly rounded bastion in plan. Such may have been the intended shape but the remains are too disturbed and ruined for us to be certain. They do, however, form the outer limit of the settlement and if they had possessed a walk on top would certainly have provided useful defence and a protection point for the main entrance and any entrance to 60 on the east. Since the associated pottery is of Period I date it might be thought that the walls belong to this period. But several points suggest otherwise: a very strongly built structure seems un- necessary for a rubbish pit, which would in any case have been an inexplicably isolated con- struction in Period I; the walls are actually a continuation of the main Period II construction to the north; the pottery of 61 may have been brought in as part of the road packing at the time of construction of the Period II buildings and in 62 as part of a fill (possibly cleared rubbish from the settlement) in the construction of the 'bastion'. This would have taken place at the begin- ning of Period II. Area 63. South-East Yard West of 62 and south of the main entrance and Room 78 the area outside the settlement was a yard consisting of hard-packed whitish earth laid on the sandy rock and with rough paving slabs set on it here and there. The white level ran up to the west face of 62 while on the north a line of slabs set in the white packing provided a footway westwards along the south side of the settlement, set against the footings of the south wall. This path certainly extended as far as the south-west corner of Room 79, and continued, perhaps without slabs, to 87. Here in 63 a thin burnt level lay over the footway and north part of the yard. The yard was overlain by tumbled stones from the surrounding walls. Main Entrance and Passage 64 (PL 18B) The southern entrance to the site lies between Rooms 78 and 60. From it a passage 0.86-1 .00 m. wide runs up north for 6 metres before turning east, then north again (as 65) for a further 84 metres to give access to the central part of the site. The entrance itself consists of a doorway (width 1.05 m.) with two narrow sill stones, now broken, across the whole width. The outer, southern stone may, however, be a step or even the remains of a fallen lintel. The disturbed stones below it to the south were probably a step originally. Immediately north of the inner or real sill, at the base of the east wall, was a door socket in position (PL 19A).1 The socket was a stone with a circular hollow (8.5 cm. diam.) worn in the middle. In this hollow were marks of burning, indicating a wooden door post.2 The 1 For a similar socket in situ, but outside the doorway, see J. L. Gaskey, Archaeology (1970) 339 figure at bottom left (Kea, early Middle Helladic house). G. E. Mylonas, Aghios Kosmas (1959) Pis. 14, 18 (EH II houses). 2 I was told in A. Nikolaos that such stone door sockets can still be found in Cretan village houses. This socket is called στρουφογκαρά (turning head).</page><page sequence="72">58 MYRTOS east wall of the passage is preserved to 0.71 m. in five to six courses. Its width is 0.42 m. and it may have been added to the existing west wall of Room 60 making a wall 0.98 m. wide, since there seem to be two separately constructed lengths here, as further north. The face of the wall in the passage had its plaster still in situ on the lower courses (PL 19B). There were at least three layers visible; that mainly visible in the photograph is the second and it is painted red. Beyond this section is a carefully built niche in the wall, 0.64 m. deep (EW) and 0.54 m. wide (NS). The north side of the niche is in fact a pier (well built, with eight courses surviving) since a second niche is let into the wall immediately north. This is somewhat larger than the southern niche, 0.64 m. deep (EW), 0.64 m. wide (NS). Behind it is the south-west corner of Room 59; although the wall is disturbed and stones gone there was no access from the niche into the room. Beyond the niche the wall continues north with double thickness (width 0.80 m.) and ends with the eastward turn of the passage. At the south end of this section, which forms the north side of the niche, the wall stands to 1.20 m. (see above, p. 53). The west wall of the passage has several interesting features. Just beyond the main entrance on the left is the plastered doorway into Room 78 (see p. 68f.). The threshold of the door was reached by a step up from the passage. The step was made of flat stone slabs in two to three courses and was tapered in towards the threshold at the south end. It was 0.26 m. wide (EW) in the centre and 0.27 m. high. Beyond the step was a carefully constructed bench with two courses of flat stones and a white plastered top. The bench was 1.00 m. long, 0.33 m. wide (EW) and the same height as the step. At each end it appears neatly recessed since to make its north end a little anta projects from the west wall of the passage (and thus balances the pier between the niches opposite) while at the south end there is another slight projection since the north wall of Room 78 sticks out a little at its east end beyond the line of the west wall of the passage, thus neatly terminating the bench and dividing it from the step to the south. Beyond the north anta of the bench the west wall climbs up the rock to reach the back wall of the passage here (south wall of Room 70) and the turn east. The wall is c. 0.40 m. wide and was well constructed with long flat stones. Many are now cracked and the wall leans westwards. At the north-west corner of the passage it has ten courses preserved to 1.20 m. The passage was filled with tumbled stones from the walls, plaster and burnt destruction debris. From a point opposite the northern niche the rock slopes steeply up to the north. Consequently a stairway of large slabs had been laid here, though they were badly preserved (see Plan and PI. 18B, base of the ranging pole). The top three slabs, up to the doorway on the east, had been well set to make the turn east, with easy rises of 0.10 m., 0.20 m. and 0.15 m., though the top slab was not properly aligned with the doorway. This seems odd only because a corresponding top slab, to bridge the rest of the stairway just below the door, had been lost. The doorway itself is 0.50 m. wide and appears crudely built, not faced with the neat slabbing of other doorways in the southern area. But this may be due to disturbance. On the north side it has eight courses preserved to 0.80 m., on the south six to 0.60 m. The threshold is formed of a large rounded stone now shattered by fire. Among the destruction debris of the passage was a much broken pithos, P602, fragments of which occurred below the doorway and in the pottery deposit above it, and half of an S profile bowl in cooking pot fabric, P361. From the section beside the niches and bench came fragments of a large amphora, with a few more pieces scattered south and north. Passage 65 This is the northward continuation of the passage for 8£ metres after the turn from the lower</page><page sequence="73">THE SETTLEMENT 59 section, 64. The width varies from 1.30 m. at the south end, above the doorway from 64, to 0.65 m. in the centre, increasing slightly further north. The thick east wall (see p. 51) is rather disturbed and is now higgledy-piggledy in appearance, though it was well constructed originally. In the passage at the south end it stands to 0.63 m. in six courses. In the centre is a revetment (narrowing the width of the passage) and the northward continuation (west wall of Room 66) has five rough courses, ht. 0.50 m., width 0.44 m. The entrance to Room 66 is 0.82 m. wide, after which the passage wall continues north. Its eastern face is now undefinable since the re- mains are eroded almost to the rock. The passage face, however, survives from 0.30-0.80 m. but is disturbed. The natural rock is incorporated into the base of the wall in several places. The south wall of 65 is part of the north wall of Room 59 and is described on p. 53. The west wall runs without exits from the southern doorway up to the north end. The absence of exits is because the rock is higher west of the wall and the floors of the rooms too high above the passage for access. At the south end there are eight courses preserved to 0.95 m.; in the central section it stands to 0.60 m. and includes one or two blocks of gypsum; in the north it is unevenly preserved with heights from 0.19-0.63 m. Plough marks are visible on the top stones at its north end. The west face is ill defined and so therefore is the width, but this seems to have been about 0.60 m. In its central section another wall runs parallel close by, from Rooms 69 to 70; the gap between is too slight to have been of use and it must simply be a case of separate building work, not necessarily at a different time from that of the passage wall. As in the lower section, 64, slabs are set into the rock to form steps at intervals to help the climb northwards. At the north end there are two courses, making a rather high structure for a step and suggesting an end wall with the passage turning east. The stones may nevertheless have been part of a step, especially if there had been another course originally on the rock slab immediately below them, while the passage itself is continued directly north in Area 44 (p. 46). The passage was filled with destruction debris including masses of decayed mudbrick, roof and wall plaster, stones and broken pottery. Pieces of mudbrick show that whole bricks mea- sured over 0.20 m. in length, c. 0.16 m. in width and 0.10 m. in height.1 Some of the wall plaster showed at least three layers, with a yellowish surface. Above the rock there was a heavily burnt, destruction level. At the south end this included a deposit of vases. These were part of a shallow, open bowl with dark paint, P203, a large, deep, spouted bowl, P288, half of a cup of cooking pot fabric (the other half was just below the doorway, in 64), P361, a very fine jug with dark triangles on the buff ground, P459, and a fragmentary Myrtos ware jug, P440, of which pieces occurred 12.60 m. away to the west with the large amphora, P88, in Room 80. There was also a piriform jar with orange paint, P595, and a large pithos, P630, which may have been standing in the south-east corner and had fallen with its mouth to the west. A rim fragment of this vessel was also found 1 1 metres away to the west. The vases were on the burnt rock floor and were probably in situ, abandoned at the moment of destruction. Further north, in the narrow section south of the entrance to Room 66, there were many good- sized broken pieces in the thick destruction fill; these include, P150, a fragment of an S profile 1 Six fragments measured: Length Width Height 1 0.19* 0.16* 0.10 2 0.15* 0.15 0.10 3 0.14* 0.15 0.10 4 0.15* 0.15 0.09 5 0.17* 0.15 0.10 6 0.20* 0.14 0.09 * Surviving length or width.</page><page sequence="74">6o MYRTOS bowl with white chevrons on black paint, P236, a red painted deep bowl and P269, part of a large bowl, also red painted. There was also the incised knob of a large lid, P560, part of a long-spouted jar (teapot) with black paint, fragments of two Myrtos ware jug necks and two or three in red or dark paint, a few Vasilike ware sherds and one or two pieces of a large amphora. Further north still the pottery debris was still plentiful, including six fragmentary vases: P211, a large, shallow, open bowl with dark paint; P270, a red painted flaring bowl with everted rim, found near the entrance to Room 66; P175, an open bowl in cooking pot fabric; P359, a dark painted cup with the usual high-swung handle; P588, the lower part of a piriform jar; and P409, the upper part of a dark painted jug. The sherds included fragments of at least five Myrtos ware jugs, a few Vasilike, red burnished and dark painted pieces and fragments of several baking dishes and tripod cooking pots. Just in the entrace to Room 66 was the head of a clay bull figurine, 72, probably a rhyton (Fig. 95, PI. 73D) and another piece, probably part of the body at the rear (Fig. 95), 73. Room 66 This oddly shaped little room is entered from the passage. The entrance area is roughly square, 0.80 m. χ 0.80 m. The wall at the north side has six rough courses preserved to 0.72 m. From the south-east corner of the area a small doorway, 0.31 m. wide, leads into the room. This is roughly rectangular, NE-SW 2.14 m., NW-SE 0.74 m., with a small projecting anta on the north side by the entrance. The north and east walls are built against the rock face and are badly preserved and peter out into tumble on the rock above. In the room the north wall has seven courses preserved up to 0.70 m. The east wall stands only to 0.40 m. The south wall is wide (c. 0.70 m.) at the east and backs on to the stony, probably open area above Room 57 (p. 51). It stands to 0.42 m. at the west end, where it is 0.54 wide. The west wall is now rough and disturbed, surviving to only 0.34 m. (width 0.43 m.). Pottery from the eastern half of the room included a shallow, open red painted bowl, P201 (with fragments widely scattered over the south-east area of the site), and two Vasilike ware goblets, P376, P379. There were also pieces of baking plate and a fragment of a cup with rising handle. In the western half was a Vasilike ware conical, spouted bowl, P255, and goblet, P373, the feet of a tripod cooking pot, part of a cup and the lower part of an amphora or pithos, with a small hole just above the base for liquids. In the entrance and western area was part of a baking plate, P101, the upper part of a dark painted piriform jar, P572, while the upper part of a dark painted jug, P491, came in and above the west wall. The function of the room was revealed by the presence of fifty-one animal bones in the eastern part. This was food rubbish, probably eaten from the shallow bowl and baking dishes, while the three goblets and conical bowl were for drink to wash down the meat. The wine or water perhaps stood in the pithos or amphora whose base was found on the western side. East-West Way 67 This road or way runs for 9 metres from Area 45 and Passage 65 on the east to the north-east entrance of Room 74 on the west. It forms the northern line of the southern area and, through Room 74, links several of the south-western rooms both with the central part of the site beyond Area 45 and with the south-east area down Passage 65. To the north of the way in its central section lie the Period I rooms 48, 51 and others. They are separated from the way by their thick southern wall (p. I7f.), which bounds the way on the north side. This wall almost certainly</page><page sequence="75">THE SETTLEMENT 6l continued west to the corner of Room 74 but only a few stones remain on the western section. On the east the wall stops against the rising rock in the south-east corner of Area 45. The south wall has a very short piece remaining at the west end by the entrance to 74, then nothing for 3.06 m. eastwards. From here the wall survives poorly to its east end, but is built against the rock and has up to four rough courses preserved on its south face. West of the preserved west end there was probably an entrance south into Room 68. Near by was a door socket (0.14-0. 17 m. ; diam. of door-post hole 0.06 m., depth 0.02 m.) indicating that the door opened to the right as one entered from the way, just as the main door opened to the right as one entered the main South Entrance 64. The width of the passage in the preserved central section is 0.50-0.80 m. and the two preserved, stone-built steps rise 0.16 m. and 0.19 m. There were clear signs of activity in the passage at the time of the final destruction. Part of a burnt, shallow, open red painted bowl, Pi68, was found on the western of the preserved steps, with parts of a tripod cooking pot to the west and near-by animal bones. A fragment of a flaring bowl, P237, part of a Myrtos ware jug, the long spout of a black painted spouted jar (teapot) and pieces of two red painted S profile bowls also came from the destruction level. Other finds included fragments of a spherical loom weight (like those in Room 58), an unfinished stone weight, and a potter's turn-table lying against the south wall, between the two preserved stone steps. Room 68 Room 68 was a long rectangular room lying south of the East-West Way 67. The western end is poorly preserved, as in 67, but the room size was EW c. 6.10 m., NS 1.20 m. As noted above there was probably an entrance on the north side from the way. The north wall is the south wall of the way and the east wall is the west wall at the north end of Passage 65 (p. 59). The south wall is preserved for 3.50 m . from the east end and scattered stones indicate its westward con- tinuation. There may have been a doorway through to 69 on the south in the section no longer preserved. The wall is 0.46 m. wide and was preserved to 0.47 m. in height with up to four rough courses. The west wall is poorly preserved on top but is built against a north-south drop in the rock and has up to four courses on its west face. Between this west wall and Room 74 to the west was probably a little room (EW 1.24 m., NS 1 .80 m.), bounded by the East- West Way to the north and possibly having access to Area 69 on the south. Part of the north wall survives in one course and is the western end of the south wall of the East-West Way. For the west wall of the room see under Room 74. The rock floor lay not far below the surface. The white clayey level on the rock produced the buff burnished bowl, P136. In Room 68 a small red painted jug, P515, was found south-west of the door socket, just north of the line of the almost non-existent south wall. The jug has a low belly and is similar to that on the floor of the passage leading north from Room 34. The fill over Room 68 and Area 69 was slight and the bedrock came up only a little below the modern surface. A number of fragmentary vessels came from the surface levels and these are listed after Area 69. Area 69 The large area south of 68 and above Rooms 70 to 72 is designated 69. Since the rock slopes unevenly down to the south-west 69 was probably an open area with access to 68 on the north and 71 on the south. Into these rooms at least it would have allowed light. There are no internal</page><page sequence="76">62 MYRTOS structures or walls and the delimiting walls are parts of other rooms (south wall of 68, west wall of Passage 65, north wall of 70 and 72, east wall of 74). The area measures EW 6.16 m., NS 2.50 m. (east end), 1.90 m. (centre), 2.06 m. approx. (west end). A large bowl with open rim spout, P290, lay just south of the north wall at its preserved end near the centre. Just west of the bowl an engraved sealstone of blue/black steatite was found (Fig. 97; Pis. 77A, below left; 77B, above right), 131. Pottery from the shallow fill of Room 68 and Area 69 included the following fragmentary vases : Baking dishes, Pi 17, P127. Bowls: plain, red painted, P139, P147; shallow, open, cooking pot fabric, P176; red painted, P188, P204; flaring, red painted, P238, P244; large, with open rim spout, P297. Cooking pot jar, P330; with tripod feet, P344. Spouted jar {teapot), Vasilike ware, P662. Strainer, P702. Sherd material included parts of three Myrtos ware jugs, twelve feet of tripod cooking pots and thirty-five fragments of baking dish rims. This suggests that cooking was done in the open area. All the material was of Period II. Room 70 This room lies south of the east end of Area 69 and above the north end of Passage 64. It is entered from 69 and 71 at the north-west corner, the entrance being 0.40 m. wide. The north wall has three surviving courses, ht. 0.33 m. In the north-east corner the returning east wall is not that of Passage 65 but a separate wall running on north into the corner of Area 69 and standing clear of the passage wall with a small gap between them. Probably the 69/70 wall was built earlier since it would have been pointless if the passage wall was already standing. The wall has three surviving courses, ht. 0.35 m., and is well built. At its south end there is a step in the rock and a little cross- wall was built east-west to link the 69/70 wall with that of Passage 65. Then in the south-east corner the much disturbed passage wall forms the eastern limit of the room. The south wall is built against the great drop in the rock which runs east- west and marks off the southernmost line of rooms at a lower level. The south wall (width 0.50 m.) forms the eastern end of the great east- west wall built against the rock. On its south face, where it forms the north end of Passage 64, it stands to 0.95 m., but within Room 70 it has only one to two courses, ht. 0.20 m., surviving above the floor. The west wall of the room has two to three courses, ht. 0.30 m., width 0.50 m., and ends on the north with two upright slabs forming the south side of the doorway into 71. Within the room the rock slopes down somewhat to the south and so a packing of large stones had been put in in the southern area against the south wall and northwards to make a level, roughly paved or cobbled floor. The room size is EW 1.74 m. (north), 2.70 m. (south), NS 1.90 m. The only find of interest was a fragment of a stone bowl, 209 (Fig. 104), in blue/black serpentine. Room 71 Room 71 is west of 70 and south of the central part of Area 69. It is open to 69 on its north-west and north-east corners. In the latter there is also a flat stone forming a threshold and step up into Room 70. The room has no north wall but is bounded on this side by a sharp rise in the rock to the north. Against the rock large slabs are set upright to form a small triangular enclosure with the rock face as the1 north side. The height of the enclosure is c. 0.60 m. It contained only sand and a few stones, so that its function is unknown. It can only have been a kind of cupboard.</page><page sequence="77">THE SETTLEMENT 63 The east wall of the room is the west of 70. Its western or Room 71 face has four courses preserved. The south wall is almost wholly lost since it had leaned south into Room 76 and was mostly loose tumble. As in Room 70 a packing of stones had been inserted against the north face of the wall and flat slabs laid on top to provide a level floor for the room. The weight of the packing had helped to push the wall forward. The west wall, width 0.45 m., has two courses preserved to 0.35 m. on its east or Room 71 face. In Room 72 to the west the floor is lower and the wall therefore stands higher. Traces of mudbrick survived on top of it in places. At the north end the wall is very poorly preserved but it does form a corner with the north wall of 72. In front of the triangular cupboard on the side of the room had stood a pithos on a stone stand. The vessel, P608, had fallen north-eastwards and was much shattered, as was the stand (diam. 0.35 m.). In the south-east corner was the upper part of another pithos, P603, in the disturbed stone packing. Since this was the context and only about one-sixth of the vessel survives it is not certain that the vessel stood in the corner originally. Just north of it was a large deep bowl with a hole just above the base, P276. It is clear that the room was a working place with operations involving the use of pithos (or pithoi), bowl and probably the cupboard on the north. Room 72 (Fig. 22) Room 72 lies to the west of 71. Access was on the west side from the long Room 74. The north wall is built a single course in width against a vertical fall in the rock and survives with five courses (ht. 0.58 m.) to the level of the higher rock on the north. The east wall is the west of 71. In Room 72 it has five courses and survives to 0.65 m. The south wall, width 0.36 m., stands to 0.30 m. in three courses in Room 72 but is much higher on its south face in Room 79. The west wall is very poorly preserved and interpretation of the layout is uncertain. In the northern part there was a doorway, width 0.40 m., into Room 74, the north section of the wall being a short projection built on a raised ledge of rock. In the centre there seems to be a small, free- standing section of wall, width 0.36 m., south of which was perhaps another doorway connecting the room with the little Area 73. This doorway would have been only 0.30 m. in width and it is possible that the wall really existed here but has now gone. But in that case there may have been a link between 72 and the big rooms to the west and south-west (see below on 73). The room had a white clayey floor over the rock, both floor and rock being strongly affected by the burning of the final destruction. A few slabs formed rough paving in the south, laid over stone packing, and flat rock was exposed in the north-west corner. The room measures EW 1.90 m. (south part), NS 2.25 m. Scattered over the floor and in the burnt destruction level on it was a deposit of nineteen small vases (Fig. 22, PL 20A), while two more lay on top of the north wall which perhaps formed a ledge here with the rock and rose no higher. In the south-east corner was a fragmentary pithos. Nearly all the vases had been affected by burning. Most were upright on their bases, a few were on their sides and scattered ; nearly all were broken. The bowl, P263, was set into a rough hole in the floor (PL 20B). Across the centre of the room the vases were covered by stones, including a large flat slab on edge. These stones were in all probability tumble from the eroded east wall. The vase deposit was as follows (VW = Vasilike ware) : Bowls: S profile, with four rim lugs, brown polished, Ρ 154; shallow open, VW, P213; shallow open with rim spout, red polished, P217; flaring conical, VW, P259; dark painted, P260; dark painted with white chevrons, P227 (found inside P259) ; flaring, conical, with bridge spout, VW, P251 ; cylindrical, with bridge spout, horizontal handles and crescent</page><page sequence="78">64 MYRTOS lugs, brown polished, P252 ; flaring, medium sized, with lugs or little handles at the rim, red painted, P263 (unburnt, in the hole in the floor, PL 20B), P264, P274; incurving profile, with bridge spout, horizontal handles, VW, P310. Burner, P314. Cups, cooking pot fabric, P365; small lip at right angles to handle, red polished, P369. Jugs, VW, P415, P416. Pithos, P613 (in the south-east corner). Spouted Jars: piriform, VW, P683; dark painted, P674; on pedestal base, bridge spout at right angles to handle, VW, P696; teapot, red polished, P668 (above the room on the ledge of the north wall, with the open bowl, P217). Such an array of small bowls, cups, jugs and spouted jars suggests that Room 72 was used for eating and drinking, while the burner, P314, kept the air sweet. One bone tool, 57, was found with the pots, as were twelve small pieces of haematite or red ochre, presumably intended for making red paint for vase decoration. From the surface level over Rooms 71 and 72 several fragments of vessels were recovered: Baking dish, P120. Bowls: open, flaring, red painted, P177; open, carinated, everted rim, red polished, P195; flaring, buff surface, P242; large, deep, horizontal handles, dark paint, P305. Spouted Jar (teapot), lower body and base only, VW, P663. Area 73 (Fig. 22) West of the south part of Room 72 is a little area, approximately square (EW 1.08 m., NS 0.84 m.), with access down a step (ht. 0.22 m.) on the west side into Room 81 and beyond. As noted above there may have been a doorway on the east through to Room 72. The south wall is part of the north wall of Room 80. On the north side of the area are two large flat slabs, upright, which block almost the whole opening through to Room 74 on the north. A wall across this opening seems pointless, but equally the slabs seem to be in situ, and not, for example, the remains of a disturbed staircase. On balance it seems more likely that they are out of position ' 4 I Sri &amp;s* I ' ^&gt; «■ ?V)°™ P""^/m ~&amp;V] ν fig. 22 Room 72, Area 73 and Area 74, south end.</page><page sequence="79">THE SETTLEMENT 65 and fallen from elsewhere. If they are in situ (and the presence of five complete vases immediately north of them suggests they are and that they protected these vases) their function remains unknown. Within 73 the only finds were a spherical loomweight, 87, spindle whorl, 147, and biconically bored stone weight. Since similar finds were made just north of the orthostat slabs and down the step to the west in Room 81 it is clear that this was an area for spinning and weav- ing. It is just possible that 73 may have contained the loom. Room 74. Room of the Single Pithos Room 74 is a long narrow chamber running north-west from the doorway out of 72. To the east of it is the open Area 69 and in its north-east corner is a doorway on to the East-West Way 67. The little north wall, width 0.28 m., blocks off the room from the rock cutting 75 to the north and is built up against the cutting at its east end. It has two surviving courses, 0.40 m. in height. From the north-east corner a poorly preserved bit of wall leads off north-eastwards. This is in fact the remains of the west end of the south wall of Room 51, which is also the north wall of the East- West Way. Room 5 1 and the rooms to the north and east of it were seen to be Period I in date and this should be the case for this western end of 51's south wall. The structure is too badly preserved for us to be certain but it is suggestive that the wall is not built into and seems quite unconnected with the other walls of Room 74, which belongs, like all the southern rooms, to Period II. The entrance here on to the Way is 0.40 m. wide. The east wall of the room is built against the rock face and survives on its west face to 0.42 m. in three rough courses. Its width is 0.35-0.40 m. At the south are the problematical orthostats discussed above. The west wall is a fine long structure, width 0.40 m., but has only one to two courses surviving in this room. The room measures NW-SE 6.00 m., SW-NE 1.50 m. Towards the south end of the room was a smashed pithos, P606. It had stood beside the west wall and fallen eastwards. The white clay and decayed rock floor of the room were less than half a metre below surface and part of one side of the pithos did not survive. North of it in the centre of the room was the badly burnt base of a large amphora (diam. 0.23 m.). At the south end of the room just north of the orthostat slabs a wonderful group of six complete vases came to light (Fig. 22, PI. 21 A). They consisted of a shallow open bowl with white chevrons on a black ground, Ρ 196, a red painted conical bowl, P226, a spouted bowl with curving profile in Vasilike ware, P308, a spouted goblet in pseudo- Vasilike ware, P39i, a Vasilike ware jug, P401 and long-spouted jar (teapot), P650. The jug, chevron bowl and goblet were on the edge of the doorway into Room 72. Just west of the vases were two spherical loomweights, 86, 99, and a biconically bored stone weight, and just north, near the jug, was a spindle whorl, 148. In view of the open doorway into Room 72 the group here in 74 is seen to be a continuation of the large deposit in the eastern room. The total of twenty-seven vases forms an excellent repre- sentative series of small vases in use at the end of Early Minoan II. Two pieces with white on dark decoration were in use alongside the many dark painted, red painted and Vasilike ware specimens. Fortunately the group in 74 had been but little affected by the burning. From the fill of Room 74 proper, to the north, came several fragmentary pieces : Baking dishes, P124, P128 (fragments of about eight others came from the room). Bowl, conical, flaring, red painted, P240. Cup, dark painted, P355. Goblet, Vasilike ware, P381 (one fragment was found in Room 81 to the south).</page><page sequence="80">66 MYRTOS Area 75 North of Room 74 and on the western edge of Room 51 the rock falls very steeply. The north wall of 74 is, as we have seen, built up against the rock face. Standing away from the face is a west wall and 75 is the cutting enclosed by this west wall and the north wall of 74. The west wall is 0.48 m. in width and runs north-west to end against the rock face. It has three surviving courses and stands to 0.40 m. on the east face. The area measures EW 1.20 m. (south end), NS 2.40 m. The main point of interest about the area is that at the east end of the south wall the upper half of an inverted pithos, P601, is built into the rock and partly under the south wall, replacing the bottom course of the wall (PL 21B). The reason for this arrangement is hard to see. Area 75 can hardly have been a working area, being a narrow cutting against the steep rock, while the inverted fragment of P601 can hardly have been for storage, even though it was set on a flat slab of rock. The description continues with the southernmost rooms, westward from the main south entrance passage. Room 76 (PL 22A) Rooms 76 and 77 are connected by a doorway but can only have been entered from outside through the roof since neither has any external exit (see below, p. 71). Room 76 is a little chamber, EW 2.52 m., NS 1.08 m., west of the north end of Passage 64. It is built up against the steep rock face on the north with Room 71 above it. The entrance is at the south-east corner from Room 77. The north wall had almost gone in the western part, pushed forward and loosened by the packing of Room 71 (p. 63), though in the north-west corner of the room it stood to 2.02 m. (the highest preserved wall on the site). At the east end it was well preserved and survived to 1.62 m. Large, rounded, beach or river stones had been used in the lower courses while above were the flatter, slab-like stones usual in the southern rooms. The upper part had considerable areas of plaster in situ. The east wall survives to 1.70 m. in the centre, 1.82 m. in the south-east corner, in about eleven courses, with traces of plaster. Its width is 0.40 m. and it divides the room from Passage 64. The south wall again has plaster on and be- tween the stones. At its west end, flanking the doorway, there are about sixteen courses standing to 1.70 m. The doorway is narrow, only 0.56 m. in width, but the sides are well constructed. The east side is the west end of the south wall and the slabs run across the whole width of the wall, 0.40 m., presenting a neat face. To balance this east face a carefully constructed anta projects 0.20 m. from the west wall (PL 22A). There was no threshold stone, but a door socket was found a little to the south in Room 77. In the rubble fill below surface directly over the doorway was a long (0.70 m.) slab which may have been the lintel. The short west wall, 1.84 m. high in the corner, has flat slabs at its base set up on edge as orthostats to form a small enclosure or cupboard in the corner, like the larger structure in Room 71. The structure projects 0.46 m. from the west wall and is 0.31 m. high. The rock floor is uneven and slopes down from the north-east. The room was filled with the usual destruction debris of stones, mudbrick fragments, plaster and earth and the fill was heavily burnt above the floor. There was no floor deposit of pottery, but in the centre and at the east end were lumps of wood charcoal on or near the floor. These provided two C-14 samples, Q;95i (centre of room) and 0,-950 (east) (Appendix XV) and a</page><page sequence="81">THE SETTLEMENT 67 wood sample (Appendix III). It is very possible that this wood represents the remains of a burnt ladder up to the roof (see below, p. 71, on Room 79). In the fill of the room and very possibly from the roof floor were three fragmentary vases : two pieces of a shallow, open bowl with spout, in pseudo- Vasilike ware, P219, half of a cup with a high strap handle, P350, and the lower half of a Myrtos ware jug, P453. There were also several scraps of Vasilike ware. Room 77 (PL 22A) This room is south of 76 and west of the Entrance Passage 64. It is roughly square, EW 2.56 m., NS 2.50 m., with a wall projecting south from the north wall and clearly intended as a roof support. The doorway to Room 76 has been described above. The floor around it was a layer of packed white clay earth. The north wall is the south wall of 76. In Room 77 plaster remained on its face at the east end. The east wall, width 0.40 m., is the west wall of Passage 64 continuing southwards. In the north-east corner of the room it has about twelve surviving courses to 1.70 m., but further south has leaned over severely towards the west.1 The south wall is well built but stands to only 0.70 m. Its width is 0.42 m. and it has good bonded corners with the walls running north. Later a second thickness of wall was added on the south in Room 78 (see below). The west wall of the room is well built with long flat slabs and is well preserved, standing to 0.81 m. with eleven courses. The width is 0.45 m. The wall seems originally to have ended at the south with the exterior corner of Room 77 since there is a clear vertical joint marking off the less well-constructed southern section (west wall of Room 78). This vertical joint runs west- wards defining the original south edge of the south wall of 77, against which the second thickness of 78 was built. It is not known when in Period II the west wall of 77 was continued south. It may have been immediately after the primary construction since otherwise the south part of Room 79 would have presented difficult roofing problems. There is a span of at least 3 metres if the southern part of 79 is to be roofed without any dividing wall between 78 and 79, involving a diagonal laying of reeds from the south-west corner of 77 over to the western and southern walls of 79. Three metres is far longer than any other roofing span on the site (maximum elsewhere about 2% metres). For this reason it would seem that the west wall of 77 must have been continued south as the west wall of 78 soon after the original constructions, unless of course the south part of 79 was open to the sky. This is unlikely as the walls were plastered like those to the north, the area contained pots and other objects and would have been an intolerably hot sun-trap if open. The remaining wall of Room 77 is that projecting south from the north wall as a buttress and roof support. It is well built like the others in the room, width 0.42 m., and it survives to 1 .40 m. in eleven to twelve courses. Most of the walls had slight traces of plaster surviving and at least one piece in the fill of the room was painted red. The floor is the natural rock which rises in the north-east corner. In the south-west corner flat slabs make a low, raised stand. This projects 0.37 m. from the south wall and is 1.03 m. long (EW). It closely resembles the structure in the north-west corner of Room 60. As in 76 there was no floor deposit of pottery. Only a small S profile bowl with red paint, P155, lay on the white earth floor in the doorway to Room 76 and a cooking pot jar, P321, was in the southern area. In the fill of destruction debris in the north-east part of the room were 1 At the close of the excavations in 1968 the wall, like others in the area, was patched and rendered with cement to assist its preservation.</page><page sequence="82">68 MYRTOS ' PLASTER 79 78 fig. 23 Schematic plan to show original (shaded) and secondary construction in Rooms 77 and 78. Arrows point to unbonded, vertical joints. two fragmentary pots, P356, a typical S profile cup with dark paint, and P454, the upper half of a Myrtos ware jug. Further south in the fill came part of a flaring bowl, brown burnished, P287. A probable door socket, 64, was just above the floor in the destruction debris south of the doorway, against the west wall, and a perforated weight was found further south, 215. Room 78. Room of the Plaster Doorway Room 78 is south of 77 and is entered by the plaster doorway on its east side from the Entrance Passage 64 (PL 22A-B). The room is not rectangular since the south wall runs at an angle south-westwards. The size is EW 2.60 m., NS 2.00 m. (west end), 1.60 m. (east end). All walls except the south present problems in interpretation. The north wall, as we have seen, is the second thickness added to the south wall of 77, giving a total width in the western part of 0.64 m. The wall survives to 0.65 m. in four to five courses. The lowest stones are blackened by the destruction fire. At the west end it is not bonded into the west wall (see Fig. 23). The wall does not continue to the east end since here there is a low stone bench with plastered top and sides, similar to that just outside in the passage. At the western end of the bench plaster was in situ on WEST" EAST ROOM 78 Ι &lt;λ THRESHOLD I 1 - ~^' | &lt;-&lt;"&gt; PASSAGE 64 | »■ £J «J STEP rock ;J ROCK mm Plaster in situ ? , , , . , ] m fig. 24 Section through Passage 64 and plaster doorway of Room 78.</page><page sequence="83">THE SETTLEMENT 69 NORTH I I I SOUTH ' Η DOORWAY yvJ. f""~ ~~-^-»_ I bench ΓΧ ^^fV vJ^b/! · I ] nJ^/ PLASTER AND / · I Γ^^Χ STONES OF (V^f "" ' ^~~f~~ J r -J ' steps Vy ^ ' /wall / Burn{ level _ ' . .

Clearly the whole back must have been plastered originally. The bench is 0.25 m. from front to back and about 0.90 m. long (EW). The seat is 0.25 m. above the floor (PI. 22A, top right corner of room in centre foreground). The east wall and doorway had much plaster in their construction and the severely calcined and ruined state of the whole structure makes interpretation difficult. In the centre was a doorway, width 0.65 m., reached 0.20 m. up from the step in Passage 64 (p. 58, and Fig. 24) . The doorway had a threshold of solid plaster, and the jambs on each side and both the east and west faces of the wall were also plastered (Fig. 25, PL 22B), at least three layers being evident. Below the threshold there appears to have been plaster steps down into the room, the first step being only 0.06 m. below the threshold, and the threshold itself being 0.55 m. above the floor (PL 22B). Immediately right of the threshold as one entered from 64 were two biconically bored stone weights which in this position were almost certainly door sockets. The lower and larger one was in fact set in the plaster, level with the step. South of the doorway the wall by the corner is very disturbed. The problem of interpretation of the doorway is that not only was the floor of the room covered by a black, burnt destruction level (like all other rooms in this area), but this burning, together with sherds, also extended under the plaster steps (Fig. 25, PL 22B). The step was certainly in situ, since the continuous, though cracked, moulding of the plaster down from the threshold can be seen clearly. We have noted that the north and west (see Room 77) walls of the room are later than the original north wall and the south wall. There remains two possible interpreta- tions, neither entirely satisfactory. Either the burning of the final destruction and a little debris had managed to spread somewhat under the western part of the plastered steps1 or the burning under them was caused by an earlier fire after which the steps were constructed, perhaps along with the north and west walls. The difficulty here is that there is no reason to dissociate the burning under the steps from that on the same floor throughout the room, which was caused by the final destruction.2 1 The western edge of the steps was badly ruined and no satisfactory western limit was found for them. 2 A third possibility can certainly be ruled out, that the elaborate plastered doorway marks reoccupation after the destruction fire, a reoccupation which would be attested by this doorway alone (save for the curved building on the F summit), one of the most carefully constructed features on the site, while no other marks of reoccupation were found in the room itself. In any case the doorway was so burnt that it can only have been destroyed in the great fire which de- stroyed all the site.</page><page sequence="84">70 MYRTOS The south wall of the room runs on from 79 to the west but is badly ruined at the east end. In the preserved western part it is 0.41 m. wide and stands to 0.45-0.50 m. on the outside face, with footings below by the paved path outside the settlement (above, p. 57). The west wall was described with that of Room 77. It is preserved to 0.75 m. in seven courses. There were clearly two stages in the construction of the room. First : open on the west to Room 79, the north wall being the original south wall of 77, on the east possibly the plastered doorway. Second: closed on the west by the west wall (unbonded at both north and south ends), with additional north wall with bench at east end, and plastered doorway on east side. It is most reasonable to infer that the final burning spread under the steps of the door, though this is not an entirely satisfactory interpretation. There was no floor deposit of vases save for a dark painted jug near the north-west corner, P513, and part of a Vasilike ware goblet on the west side, P378. On the threshold was a small globular jar, P397, with lightly incised diagonal grooves. It is unlike any other vase in the settlement and might be an import (Fig. 67, PL 48D). By the curved plaster at the west end of the bench was a conical bowl, spouted, P256. It was only 0.22 m. below the preserved top of the wall, and so well above the apparent low seat of the bench. However, it was at the level of the plaster steps and door sockets (PL 22B), and a fragment of it actually lay on the steps, so that it is possible that the seat level of the bench was much higher, and stood at this upper level, 0.43 m. above the floor. But the plaster mass was too calcined and ruined for this to be determined. The lower parts of two Myrtos ware jugs also came from the steps area, P455, P456. A stone weight and a loomweight, 88, were found in the surface level with tumbled stones and mud- brick. Room 79. The Long Room (PL 22A) This room lies west of 76, 77 and 78, but was entered on its west side from Room 80. It runs all the way from the long east-west back wall built against the rock down to form part of the south line of the settlement. It measures EW 1.80 m. (towards north end), 1.85 m. (south end), NS 6.14 m. (PL 22 A). There are no internal structures but the rock crops up unevenly, 0.60 m. above the level floor, at the north end. The walls are the best preserved on the site. The north wall continues west from 76 and stands to 1.34 m. in ten to fourteen courses. To the north above it is Room 72 with its pottery deposit. The east wall is the west wall of 76, 77 and 78 and has been described with these rooms. In Room 79 the central part illustrates the best construction in the southern area with the use of long flat slabs (PL 23A). The width is 0.45 m. Plaster was in situ at many points on the wall, especially on the more roughly constructed southern section which is later than the central and northern parts (see under Room 77, west wall of 78). At the north end the wall survives to 0.95 m. in eleven courses, to 0.81 m. in the centre and 0.55 m. at the south. For the slot in this wall see below. The south wall continues west from Room 78. Within 79 it stands to 0.55 m, and outside, with its footings, to 0.78 m. in seven to eight courses. Large areas of plaster survived on the inner or room face. The exterior south-west corner had partly collapsed. The west wall is again well built with large slabs in rough courses, 0.50 m. at the south end and about 0.70 m. at the outside on the south where it is disturbed. The width within Room 79 is 0.42 m., but at the south end, where it forms part of the exterior wall of the settlement, it is stouter, 0.70 m. wide. The doorway into Room 80 is 0.90 m. wide and is well built with flat slabs running across the whole face of the wall ends on north and south, making a neatly finished opening. There is a stone threshold of two courses, with a step up 0.25 m. from the room. On the north side the</page><page sequence="85">THE SETTLEMENT 7I doorway survives to 0.95 m. in ten courses, on the south to 0.65 m. Plaster adheres to the wall in many places. Quantities of roof plaster were found in the upper part of the fill of the room, as usual in these southern rooms, and there was at least one piece of red painted wall plaster. About 1.20 m. from its north end the east wall was disturbed, more so on the Room 79 face than on that of 78 to the east. At this point was a slot (PI. 23B) running the whole width of the wall (0.45 m.). It begins 0.65 m. above the floor and is c. 0.18 m. wide (north-south) at its base where it is fully preserved. The faces of the slot are neatly finished, like the doorways, and are preserved to a height of 0.35 m. The slot contained only rubble and stones and no traces of carbonized wood. It cannot have been for a horizontal roof timber, since it begins only 0.65 m. from the floor (and there are no corresponding slots east or west). A vertical timber is possible, but it is most unlikely that there should have been just one in all these well-preserved southern walls, at a spot which seems to have no structural significance whatever for the roof. It is much more likely that the slot held a beam which projected a short way into the room (and perhaps also into 77 on the east) and that this beam was a support for a ladder up to the roof. There was a fair amount of burnt wood north of the slot in the north-east corner of 79 up on the rock and this may well have been the remains of the ladder supported by a beam in the slot. A well- preserved lump of wall plaster, 233, found in the room south of the slot has a finished wall face and marks of the bark of a wooden beam and hollow for a stone on the side (Fig. 107). It could well have come from the wall in the area of the slot and the wood impression be from the slotted beam. That the roof of 79 was in use as a floor is clearly suggested by the number of small pots found high in the fill at the south end of the room (see below). We noted above that Room 76 to the east can only have been entered by ladder from the roof and that much burnt wood, perhaps the remains of the ladder, was found in that room. A final piece of evidence for the use of the roof hereabouts is the closeness of the walls in 76 and 77 (with its special roof support wall), clearly suggesting that with such easily bridged spans the roofs would be strong enough to walk on. From the roof there would have been easy and immediate access to Rooms 70-72 on the higher level to the north. That the roof floor was itself covered, that is, that there was a full upper storey, is possible, but there was no positive evidence, such as two distinct roof/floor levels in the fill of the rooms below. The arrangement then in this southern area was probably a row of rooms on the upper level to the north with access on to an open roof or terrace over the lower, southernmost rooms. The same arrangement may well have obtained in the south-east area with the plastered floor of 57 giving access to the roof of Rooms 58-60 below. Room 58 in particular had close walls like 76 here. This type of architecture with rooms on a higher level opening on to the roofs of rooms below is still common in the hillside villages of Crete today, for example at Kritsa. Room 79 had a good number of vases. In the north-east corner on the rock by the burnt wood was a highly burnished Vasilike ware bowl, Ρ 153, and south of it, directly below the beam slot, was a Vasilike ware flaring bowl with a painted cross on the base, P281, and a spouted jar with white chevrons on the black ground, P675 (PL 24A; note the plaster in situ on the wall behind). The jar was wedged on to a lump of plaster and might have come down from the roof above. Directly west of these two vases was a black painted jug, P467, also on the floor, and by it a piriform jar, P586, and a fine Myrtos ware jug, P442, both smashed in pieces. On the threshold of the doorway into Room 80 were three pots, an unbroken Vasilike ware conical bowl with rim spout, P247, a red burnished, flaring bowl, P279, with bridge spout and a red painted cross on the base like P281, and a red painted cup, P353. A little further south, opposite the south edge of the doorway, was the upper half of a jug with horizontal rim, P521. Half-way down the room, against the west wall, a large amphora, P80, was lying smashed on its side on the floor. From</page><page sequence="86">72 MYRTOS the burnt level on the floor in this central part came a miniature jug with horizontal rim, P436, and a small lid, P546. Higher in the fill was the lower part of a piriform jar, P585, and frag- ments of a baking dish, Pi 15. In the southern part of the room there were no less than fifteen pots, but all were up in the mudbrick, plaster, stone and earth fill, well above the floor. They are nearly all complete and had very probably been on the roof floor and had fallen with the collapse of the roof. The vases are: Bowls: small flaring, red painted, P239, P271 ; small conical, white chevrons on red paint, P223; flaring, open rim spout, white chevrons on black ground, P250; large, deep, flaring (lower part only), P306. Cooking pots with tripod feet, P339, P347. Cup, red painted, P352. Goblets, red painted, P380, P382; in Vasilike ware, P383, P390; in pseudo- Vasilike ware, P374. Lamp, P523. Piriform jar, dark painted, P564. With these cooking pots, goblets, cup and small bowls, it seems that the roof was used for eating and drinking. In the burnt level at the north end where the rock begins to crop up was a variety of small objects: a bead of clay, 230, and one of stone, 238, an unfinished sealstone of calcite, 132, two spindle whorls (157 is one), much burnt fragments of a white marble vase on a pedestal foot, 210, a stone weight and a sherd rubber, 138. At the south end of the room, high in the fill with the small pots, were two stone weights and a door socket, 66, which was above the floor, opposite the vertical joint in the east wall which runs on through the wall between Rooms 77 and 78. Room 80. The Room of the Central Structure (Fig. 26; Pis. 24B, 278)1 This, the largest room in the settlement, lies west of 79. It has a doorway to that room (see above), and another to Rooms 81 and 82 on the north. The room measures EW 5.14 m., NS 4.85 m. (west side), 5.00 m. (east side). The north wall, width 0.40 m., stands to 1.08 m. on the east in nine courses, 0.48 m. on the west, forming the north side of the cupboard in the north-west corner. The doorway into Rooms 81 and 82 is 1.05 m. wide and well built with the flat horizontal slabs of the wall forming neatly finished sides. The threshold is 0.35 m. above the bedrock floor of the room and was made of three large slabs set into the rock. On its west face the doorway is preserved to a height of 0.42 m. above the threshold, on the east to 0.61 m. The east wall is the west wall of Room 79 and is described with that room. The south wall is the exterior wall of the settlement here. It is less well preserved than the others in the room but in any case seems not to have been so well built, with much rougher coursing. It is c. 0.53 m. wide and is preserved to a maximum height of 0.53 m., at the east end. Large numbers of stones fallen from the wall were found in the tumble to the south. The west wall, width 0.40 m., is well built with largish blocks. It stands to 0.55 m. at the north end, but only to 0.26 m. at the south. At both ends it has good corners bonding in with the north and south walls of the room. The central part of the room is occupied by a free-standing stone structure (Fig. 26, PL 24B). Although it survives to a maximum height of only 0.88 m. there was no indication that it was used as a bench. Almost certainly it was built to full room height like the walls and was intended as a roof support. Its shape and position mean that no span in the room is greater than 2.60 m., which fits normal building practice in the settlement. The maximum span was probably well under 2.60 m., since reeds and timbers could have been laid diagonally across the corners of the room. The structure is well built with walls 0.45-0.70 m. in width. It stands to 0.88 m. in the 1 Arch.Delt. 24 (1969) Χρονικά PI. 432e.</page><page sequence="87">I ~" C^^ f &gt;. ^-^ /"^UPRIGHT ° if I I _J 7fv~ n-^' *T~^/ /slabs «î»^ &lt;£&gt;Ρ5'*ί ^, 5' ι ν L ^ _ "V^Piii /VUS } $ Í J ?^# ^ α^ί Ι fig. 26 Room 80 with floor deposit.</page><page sequence="88">74 MYRTOS south-east corner, 0.70 m. in the south-west and 0.63 m. on the north side, in four to five courses. All wall faces have traces of plaster surviving. The other structure in the room is the 'cupboard' in the north-west corner. The east and south sides consist of flat upright slabs built against the north and west walls of the room. An interior row of slabs divides the structure into two compartments. The slabs are set in white clayey material and on the outside this forms a plaster-like facing. Since further upright slabs could not have been poised on top of those now standing it follows that the structure is preserved to approximately its original height. On the south this is 0.50 m., at the central partition, 0.49 m. and on the east side 0.40 m. For the vases inside see below. In the south-east corner, along the wall, flat slabs were placed on the rock floor to serve as stands for the large jars which stood against the wall. Room 80 contained no less than fifty-three vessels of all shapes and sizes lying burnt and usually broken on the floor. These may be taken as (a) the vases in the cupboard in the north- west corner, (b) those north of the central structure, (c) those in the north-east corner, (d) the south-east area, (e) along the south wall, (f ) on the south side of the central structure, (g) west of the central structure, (h) against the west wall.

A Vasilike ware bowl, Ρ 152, was wedged into the burnt floor towards the south-west corner of the room. A fragmentary large, deep bowl with bridge spout, P298, was scattered about the western area. From the destruction debris in the north-west area, but not in the cupboard,</page><page sequence="89">THE SETTLEMENT 75 came another large deep bowl with bridge spout, P292, a fragmentary cooking pot jar, P332, and another, with tripod feet, P346. The magnificent range of vessels in the room suggest that it had several functions. The large amphorae and pithoi were almost entirely confined to the southern half, standing against and forward from the south wall. These were clearly storage vessels and the identification of pips and skins from pressed grapes in P605 demonstrates that wine was among the contents. The northern half of the room had mostly smaller vases, including ten jugs and bowls large and small. This area may have been for the preparation of food, especially liquids ; the few cooking pots from the room further suggest such preparation. The contents of the north-west cupboard give no indica- tion that it was destined for anything save storage. The destruction burning in the room was intense. The fire might have been fed by stored oil, but there was no positive evidence for this. Room 81 This irregularly shaped room is entered by the doorway from Room 80 on the south, by the steps from the little Area 73 on the east and by the wide opening into 82 on the west. Along its north-west side it is 2.06 m., on the south (to the west face of the doorway of Room 80) 2.46 m. The unusual alignment of 74, 81 and 82 is dictated by the north-west to south-east line of rock which drops steeply between 74 and the two lower rooms. The long north-east wall of 81-82 is built against the line of the rock. The north-west wall of 81 must have had a dual function, as a roof support and as the buttress for the long north-east wall. It is well built, width 0.47 m., with six courses of flattish stones pre- served to 0.80 m. Plaster was in situ here and there. The north-east wall, width 0.39 m., has eight courses preserved to 0.88 m., again with traces of wall plaster. The west side of the room consists of the little step up into 73 (p. 64). The south wall is the north wall of Room 80. Here in Room 81 it stands in four courses to 0.35 m. The doorway into 80 has been described (p. 72). The opening into Room 82 is 0.84 m. wide. The rock floor of the room is uneven and rises in the northern part. A slab of stone was set against the north-east wall, packed to provide a level surface. 81 was clearly a work-room since a lekane or tub (without a spout), P528, was found smashed in the north corner (PL 26A) and a large amphora, P75, just below it. One of these probably stood on the large slab. With them was a small cup, P351, while in the south-west corner, against the face of the doorway into 80, was a small black painted jug, P472, which probably belonged with the other small pots on the bench in 82. On the floor in the doorway to 82 was a large quern. The only other finds were a stone weight and a stone implement and two spindle whorls (one, 152, in the surface level) towards the south-east. The two last probably belong with the whorls and loomweight just east in 73. Neither the amphora nor the tub had a spout or hole, so perhaps they were used for grain, with the one-handled cup as a ladle. The quern in the doorway would have been used for the grinding, possibly with the stone tool, 205. On the other hand the juxtaposition of the tub here and a spinning and weaving area in 73 and 74 notably parallels the arrangements in 58 and 59, so it is possible that the tub in 81 was used for washing wool or cloth, even without a spout. Room 82. Room of the Great Vase Deposit (Fig. 27) Room 82 is entered at its south-east corner. For the alignment see above on Room 81. The room measures 3.60 m. on the north-west side, 2.60 m. on the north-east and 2.48 m. on the south. The north-west wall is very poorly preserved, with only one surviving course, width 0.42 m.</page><page sequence="90">76 MYRTOS ' 80 CU fig. 27 Room 82 with floor deposit. The north-east wall actually consists of two walls, the lower of which is the Room 82 wall, built against the higher south-west wall of Room 74. The lower wall is preserved to 0.90 m. in eight courses. Its width varies from 0.38 m. at the south-east end to 0.80 m. at the north-west. It was probably built to strengthen the rather thin south-west wall of Room 74 up above. The south-east wall is the north-west wall of Room 81 and is there described. The south wall of the room (north wall of 80, west end) has only two preserved courses and is 0.40 m. in width. A low bench, height 0.20 m., is built against it, projecting up to 0.54 m. from the wall. The bench, as usual, is built of stones packed with earth, but no traces of plaster survived. The rock floor of the room was reddened and crumbled by the destruction fire, as in the adjacent rooms.</page><page sequence="91">THE SETTLEMENT 77 Room 82 was filled with a magnificent deposit of forty-four vases, of all shapes and sizes (Fig. 27, PL 26B). These were nearly all smashed over the floor, but little groups of small jugs and spouted jars, mostly in Vasilike ware, survived only slightly broken against the north-east wall and on the bench beside the south wall (PL 27A). They gave the impression that but a day or so had passed since they were poured from, instead of more than four thousand years. Amphorae, large, trickle decoration: P73; P97 (base only; sherds from this amphora were scattered over the whole southern area of the site) . Bowls: shallow, open, red burnished, P209; P178, P189 (both fragmentary); incurving profile, everted rim, red burnished, Ρ 162 (fragmentary) ; deep, flaring, lugs on rim, P272; deep, flaring, bridge spout, Vasilike ware, P280; large, deep, thickened rim, bridge spout, P291, P293, P294; spouted, pedestal foot, Vasilike ware, P312. Cups: P366 (fragmentary), P368, P370. Hydria: P392. Jugs: Myrtos ware, P444, P458; black paint, P473, P474, P518; red paint, P496, P497 (upper part only) ; red and black triangles on buff ground, P461 (a twin of that from Passage 65) ; Vasilike ware, P410 (upper part only), P414, P417, P4l8&gt; P425&gt; P426 (lower part only), P429, P430; red/brown burnished, with small impressed dots imitating stitching or metalwork, P433 (a twin ofthat from the Pot Hole 33). Piriformjars: P587, P590, P591. Pithoi: P616, P626 (smashed and scattered in the centre of the room), P629. Spouted Jars: long spouted (teapots), Vasilike ware, P651, P652; red painted, P653; piri- form, small bridge spout, Vasilike ware, P686 (scattered in centre of room) ; pseudo- Vasilike ware, P685. Apart from the pots the only other finds were a loomweight, 80, a spindle whorl, 158, two stone polishers and a quern rubber. The pottery suggests that this room was a working place, with small vessels (no less than eighteen jugs) in use for pouring and transferring substances to and from the large storage vessels. The pouring vessels (jugs, spouted jars) and bowls with bridge spouts make it clear that the room had to do mainly, if not entirely with liquids (water, wine or oil). But there can have been little room to move since three pithoi and two amphorae stood in position (each with diameters of 0.40-0.50 m.), as well as three piriformjars and the large hydria. Perhaps the users stood on the low benches and rock by the south and north-east walls in order to ladle out from the big store jars more easily. The small pots tended to be near the side of the room, the large jars on the floor in the centre. Room 83 This is another room whose irregular shape is dictated by the north-west to south-east line of the rock. It lies north-west of Room 82 and north of Room 90. The entrance was at the northern corner, the north-west wall stopping 0.90 m. south of the rising rock ledge which forms the north side of the doorway. The room measures NE-SW 3.60 m. (maximum), NW-SE 2.00 m. The north-east wall, unusually for the site, is not built against the rock face but away from it, leaving the narrow area 75 with its pot built into the rock (p. 66). The wall is 0.60 m. wide and stands to 0.65 m. in Room 83 in seven rough courses. The south-east wall is poorly preserved and is part of the north-west wall of 82. These two walls, north-east and south-east, do not form</page><page sequence="92">78 MYRTOS a corner since the thick lower north-east wall of Room 82 projects between them, producing almost a fifth side in Room 83 (see Plan) . The south-east wall is described under Room 90 (north wall) . The north-west wall is bonded at its south end and stands to 0.63 m., being 0.43 m. wide. At its north end is the doorway into the room. There was no deposit of vases on the white clay floor laid over the rock, but a number of good-sized pieces in the fill and over the floor are from vases in use in the room at the time of the destruction. These included part of a baking plate, P106; half a Vasilike ware flaring bowl, P229, a fragmentary shallow open bowl with red paint, P214, part of a large, deep bowl with bridge spout, P229, the upper half of a black painted jug, P498, and a complete open bowl with an incised handle on the inside, P701 (Fig. 91; PL 68B). This is probably a spinning bowl, the wool protected and prevented from falling out by the handle (see p. 209). Other finds included a sherd rubber, a pestle and a burnt fragment of a spondylus shell bracelet, like that from the kitchen, Room 57 (Appendix VII). The sherd material included fragments of a large amphora but consisted mostly of cooking pot and baking plate fragments, and mostly burnt. The room may well have been used for cooking, eating and other work such as spinning wool and rubbing it smooth. The occupant, we see, was wearing a spondylus bracelet. Room 84 The doorway at the north corner of 83 leads out on the west to what may have been a separate room but which at present is only distinguished from 84 on the south by a short piece of wall running east-west. The north and west edges have been eroded away here but there was no trace of structures further west of this room. For discussion of the western edge of the site here see below on the Shrine 92. Room 84 is preserved to EW 3.30 m. and measures NS 2.16 m. The floor is irregular because of a rock ledge running roughly east-west across the room. The usual white clay for levelling was preserved in places. The short piece of wall on the north is 0.47 m. wide and has five to six rough courses of flattish stones. The surviving top surface consists of large flat slabs, so the structure may have been a bench rather than a wall. It is bonded in to the east wall which is the north-west wall of 83. The south wall has up to four courses preserved, height 0.43 m., width 0.46 m. One top stone is badly scarred by plough marks and explains why so much of the walls is lost here. There was no deposit of pots, and sherds in the shallow fill were few. They included a few scraps of fine grey ware and hatched painted of Period I and a few of Vasilike ware and red and dark painted pieces of Period II. The other finds were a small stone disk and an unfinished stone weight, 226. Another such was in the doorway to Room 83. The remaining rooms are those of the south-west corner, 85 to 92. Open Area 85 Outside the south-west corner of the big Room 80 and south of Room 88 is a little rectangular area, 85, open on its south-east side. It is paved with large slabs which descend in two rough steps, each 0.13 m. in height, to an open yard on the south (see Plan) . The paving and absence of south and east walls suggest that the area was open to the sky. The function of the paved area is problematical. Certainly the area was used : there is a bench of stones 0.39 m. wide set into a rock ledge projecting from the south wall of Cell 86; another rock ledge would have formed a good bench against the south wall of Room 80 here at</page><page sequence="93">THE SETTLEMENT 79 its west end; thirdly there were considerable traces of burning just south of this rock ledge, beside the paved area, perhaps because this area was an outside cooking place. But why the paving up into 85 ? The north and west walls of 85 (see under 86 and 88) have no doorway and so the paved area, which looks like a stepped threshold, does not lead into the settlement. But the walls, though well built, have only one or two courses preserved. The south wall of Room 88 could have been a step up into the room from 85 and the east wall of 86 a step down into that little cell. There was in fact a door socket lying in the north-east corner of 86, so there may have been a door on the east side, in from the paved Area 85. The only find was a fragmentary Vasilike ware bowl, P283, from the fill, south of the south wall of the paved area. Cell 86 This tiny walled area, 0.90 χ 0.90 m., lies west of the paved Area 85 and south of Room 89. The north wall is the south wall of 89, the east has two courses, height 0.23 m., width 0.40 m. The south wall, which continues west as the south wall of Room 87 and projects east with a little section into the paved Area 85, has three surviving courses, to 0.22 m. In the eastern projection it stands to 0.40 m. South of the wall runs the rock ledge and stones forming a bench for the inhabitants to sit in the sun and recline against the wall. The west wall has only one course left, width 0.45 m. In the north-east corner lay a door socket, a roughly circular stone, diam. 0.16 m., with a curved depression 0.08-0.10 m. It is, however, difficult to see any purpose at all in a door into this tiny cell; there would scarcely be space to stand in the cell if the door were being opened or closed. But the pivot may have been for a door up into Room 89 (which has no entrance other- wise), since the south wall of 89/north wall of 86 has only a single preserved course, so could have been a threshold rather than a wall. But if the pivot was in situ the door must have opened into 86, which leaves the problem of movement in this small space. A further problem is the function of the cell, which seems too small to have been of any use. It may be that 86 was in fact a tower or that these Areas 85 to 87 were built with the walls close together to support a roof which could be used for defensive purposes here at this exposed south- west corner of the settlement. Protection would thus have been given to the paved Area 85 on the east. None of these little rooms contained any finds to indicate their function, since everything was eroded away down to the lowest course of stones. Room 87 This little rectangular chamber is west of 86 and south of Shrine 92. It measures EW 1.04 m., NS 1.73 m. The north wall, width 0.42 m., has three courses surviving to 0.35 m. The east wall, narrow at the north end, 0.35 m. wide, runs down as the west wall of 86. The west wall, width 0.38 m., has only one course surviving. The floor consisted of the usual hard, white clayey packing. There were no finds. There is no doorway, so that if the room was used it must have been entered from above or possibly over the east or west walls. This last would, however, be unparalleled on the site, save for the slight possibility between 85 and 88 discussed above. Wherever walls are preserved high enough for us to judge none have a low cutting or opening in the stones used as a threshold. Where stone thresholds do occur they are made quite separate from the walls. Hence it seems that 87 was entered from above. Like 86 it may well have been a defensive tower with a usable roof.</page><page sequence="94">8o MYRTOS Today Room 87 forms the preserved south-western point of the settlement. No traces of structures came to light further west or south (where trench Ν was dug to determine this), though Shrine 92 to the north did extend further out to the west. Room or Tower 87 probably formed the original south-west corner. Room 88. The Room of the Long Bench (Fig. 28) This is a long, narrow room lying west of the big Room 80. It measures EW 1 .30 m., NS 4.46 m., though half of the northern end is taken up by a long stone bench (PL 27c, room on the right). The north wall is the western end of the south wall of Room 82 and is described with that room. It has good corners and is well bonded at its west end with the wall running north (north-east wall of 82) and at its east end with the wall running south, the east wall of our room here. It has four courses of large blocks surviving to a height of 0.39 m., width 0.50 m. The north end of the bench abuts the wall and is not bonded in. The east wall of the room is the west wall of Room 80 (p. 72). In 88 the northern half is masked by the bench, which again abuts it and is not bonded in. The southern part of the wall has five courses surviving to 0.50 m., width 0.45-0.50 m. The south wall of the room is not bonded into the east wall, which ends a little further south than the point where the south wall abuts it. The south wall (north wall of Area 85) has only two poorly preserved courses, height 0.24 m., width 0.54 m. The possibility that this was a threshold or step up from the paved Area 85 into the room is noted above (p. 78f.)· The west wall of the room is one of the most interesting on the site. In the southern part it has three courses preserved to 0.30 m., width 0.35 m. The preserved top surface here is very flat, as if mudbrick courses had been used from here up. On the northern half the mudbrick was still in situ (PL 27C, central wall). Though it was compacted and fused three courses of mudbrick were discernible, separated by thin layers of small pebbles and clay. The preserved height of the wall here was 0.60 m., consisting of 0.30 m. for the three stone courses and the same again for the mudbrick and horizontal interstices. The mudbricks were 0.075 m. high and the interstices 0.015 m. It was impossible to distinguish the length of the bricks, since there were no vertical interstices, and the bricks may in fact have been continuous long strips of material. The original height of the bricks was probably a little more, since allowance must be made for settling and fusion over so long a period. The width of the wall was 0.40 m. Mudbrick on a stone socle of only 0.30 m. is not otherwise known at Myrtos. Decayed lumps of it were prominent in the fill of the room. The north-east part of the room is occupied by a bench. This is 2.40 m. long and 0.66 m. wide, abutting the north and east walls. Its height now is 0.57 m. This may have been the original height since the top surface consists of a flat layer of stones (PL 27C). There are one or two courses of these, height 0.14 m., laid on to hard, compacted clay 0.40 m. in height. A few small stones are packed into the clay. The clay rests on the natural sandstone but this has decayed and left a sand layer 0.09 m. thick between the clay and actual rock. At the south end traces of plaster were in situ and the sides must have been plastered originally. The whole forms a neat and carefully built structure. At the south end of the room, in the south-west corner, is a cooking hole, roughly circular (diam. 0.35 m.), hollowed out of the soft rock. It was full of ashes and a piece of baking plate. In the opposite, south-west, corner the rock crops up and would have formed a useful slightly raised surface. The finds were few. At the south end of the bench, on the floor in the angle between its south face and the wall, was a small tub or lekane, without spout, P529. Doubtless it was used in con-</page><page sequence="95">THE SETTLEMENT 8l nexion with the bench. On the latter at its north end was a fragmentary cooking pot, P334, while below in the north-west corner were parts of three baking plates, P122, P123, P132. A little further south was a flat stone slab (0.40 χ 0.29 m.) used as a stand on the floor. Smashed on and beside this was another cooking pot, P335. The other find was a pierced stone weight south of the stone slab, beside the bench. With cooking pots, baking plates and a cooking hole in the south-west corner it is clear that Room 88 was a kitchen and probably eating place. The bench would have formed a very suitable table. Room 89. The Room of the Hearth and Skull (Fig. 28, PL 27B-C) Room 89 is another long, narrow room, lying west of 88 (PL 27B-C). Like the latter it must have been entered from the roof unless the south wall was really a threshold. As we noted under Cell 86 it is difficult to see how there could have been a threshold here. The room measures EW 1.62 m., NS 6.00 m. The north wall is well built with smallish stones and mud filling. On its north face in Room 90 larger stones used for the first course project out slightly from the vertical line of the wall above. It survives to 0.60 m. in height in Room 89, to 0.75 m. in Room 90 and is 0.43 m. wide including the wider first course. The east wall is the west wall of Room 88 and is described above. The south wall is described under Cell 86, whose north wall it is. The west wall is carefully built with small flattish stones and much mud filling. It survives to 0.29 m. and is 0.47 m. in width except at the south end where the width is reduced to 0.36 m. The room contains several features of interest. Against the east wall there is a tripartite struc- ture consisting of two little, low benches or tables with a hearth between them. The hearth is formed by the south face of the north bench, north face of the south bench and, on the west, by a line of upright slabs like those of the cupboard in Room 80. The interior was heavily burnt and contained sooty earth to a depth of 0.26 m. The whole tripartite structure measures NS 2.18 m. and projects 0.60 m. from the wall. The north table is 0.60 χ 0.51 m., height 0.1 1 m., the south 0.60x0.80 m., height 0.25 m., and the hearth internally is 0.55x0.60 m. and is 0.40 m. high (Fig. 28, PL 27B-C). The benches were clearly for use as stands for pots or food or as seats in connexion with the hearth between them. But the tripartite arrangement is unique at Myrtos and strikes one as highly elaborate if the room were simply a kitchen. The possibility that the room had a special and possibly ritual character is discussed below in conjunction with the most interesting find. At right angles to the northern and southern edges of the hearth are two shallow steps running across the room to the west wall. The rock, which slopes up slightly to the north, has been care- fully cut and set with two lines of stones on a clay filling to form the steps (PL 27C). Further north the rock is again cut and with stones set in on the east side forms a third step up. This step is 0.23 m. high, the central one 0.14 m. and the southern 0.17 m. Several smashed pots were found in the north-east corner of the room (Fig. 28). A small pithos, P620, had stood in or just south of the corner and had fallen westwards. Against the north wall was a smashed piriform jar, P589, and south of it, beside the pithos, was a dark painted jug, P475. By this was a vase of unusual shape, a small three-legged pyxis, P643. The only other such pyxis came from the Shrine Store 91. The fifth vase was a flaring bowl with rim spout, P258, broken right in the north-east corner. A pierced stone weight lay against the north wall. In the centre of the room, over the steps were more vases : a large, deep bowl with bridge</page><page sequence="96">V.-í^^^ P62I ^ BURNT EARTH ^^&lt; " *"^" V-^ / * V ' J *- r I KOO KIN (A f ο η Γ Κ Γ -°^ * V ' J ^&gt;-^ - &lt; Λ *- 89 ί r KÜ?

Just beside P574, to the south-west, lay the strangest find from the site, fragments (about a quarter in all) of a human skull. Like the pots the bone was burnt by the destruction fire, but the pieces were identifiable as those of a young adult male (Appendix XIII). No other bones, human or animal, were found. How is the skull to be interpreted ? It was certainly not the remains of a burial, nor could it be a last inhabitant who had failed to escape at the moment of destruction; in both cases other bones would have survived. The skull can only have been an object as such, deliberately situated near the tripartite structure with central hearth. Thus the possibilities of ancestor worship (cf. the plastered skulls of Neolithic Jericho) or even human sacrifice cannot be ruled out. The vases were not scattered randomly through the room but were mainly here on the steps before the hearth and in the north-east corner. It is a distinct possibility that the elaborate hearth structure had a ritual function and that sacrifices were made at it, with the bowl and jars on the steps used for pouring or placing offerings and the group in the north-east corner for storing or replenishing them. The skull would have had some function in the rites. Just south of the northern bench or table lay a broken but complete jug, P402, in Vasilike ware and near it were three fragments of a baking plate, P121, while other pieces from the northern and central part included a fragment of a baking plate, Pi 18, in the white clay floor packing, part of a small black painted bowl, P241, a hand lamp, P524, and a fragmentary ring, P699 (miscellaneous vases). The purpose of this strange, thin object is unknown. A purely practical function seems improbable. It is too slight to have supported a vase, while all the vases have flat bases anyway. It might have played some part in ritual. Finds other than pottery included a stone weight, 216, and, at the top of the destruction level, a little human figurine of green steatite, 69 (Fig. 95, PL 73A-B). This was situated just north-west of the northern bench. At the southern edge of the hearth was a pestle. The remains were strongly burnt, as usual, in the southern area, but there was a particularly heavily burnt area beside the east wall, extending from the northern step to the edge of the northern bench. This might represent the remains of a wooden ladder giving access from the roof, but there is no proof. The fill of the room, above the destruction, contained much hard-packed white clayey earth, for the most part burnt grey or black. It was ashy in appearance and seemed to the excavators different from the white clayey floor coverings. It was probably the burnt remains of the roof of reeds, white plaster and probably timber, compacted into a solid mass with the disappearance of the walls over the years. Similar material was found in the fill of Room 88. Room 90. South- West Tub Room (Fig. 28) Room 90 lies north of 89 and is entered on its west side from 91 . It is a little rectangular chamber measuring NW-SE 2.00 m., NE-SW 1.22 m. The north wall, width 0.42 m., stands to 0.87 m. in height in irregular courses with mud filling. The east wall has two surviving courses built on an outcrop of rock. The preserved height is 0.40 m., width 0.44 m. The rock rises to the east under the wall and the floor of Room 82 is on a higher level. The south wall is the north wall of Room 89 (p. 81). The preserved height on the north face is 0.75 m. On the west side the doorway, 0.53 m. wide, is set between two little antae which have neatly finished faces like the well- preserved doorways of Room 80. The uneven floor had the usual white clay packing for levelling. Against the north wall in the centre was a fine low bench of flat stones set on hard-packed white clayey earth, like the bench in Room 88. The bench is 0.90 m. long, projects 0.30 m. from</page><page sequence="98">84 MYRTOS the wall and is 0.28 m. in height. Beside it in the north-west corner was a large stone pot stand, 0.32 χ 0.68 m., 0.07 m. high. In the north-east corner is the rocky outcrop. The room had a number of interesting finds. In the centre was a large, spouted tub or lekane, P534. Since its base was high in the destruction fill and body sherds were below, on or near the floor, it had clearly fallen. Its original position was probably on the bench, the width of which would have allowed the spout to project over the edge and release liquid into a vessel under- neath. With the lekane in the fill was about a third of a pithos, P639; since no more of it sur- vived it is probable but not certain that it stood in the room. The upper part would have been removed with the gradual denudation of the room. On the stand in the north-west corner was a fragmentary large, deep bowl, P307, which would have had the usual bridge spout below the thickened rim. The rim fragments which survived were right in the corner, so that the spout would have faced into the room, in position for pouring out liquids. Inside this bowl were re- mains of grapes (Appendix V, Sample 1). On the floor west of the lekane was a red painted jug, P476, certainly used for transferring the liquids. A hand lamp, P525, and two spouted jars, P654 (long-spouted teapot) and P676, also came from the room. The finds other than pottery consisted of a perforated stone weight, a spindle whorl and a small pounder with a knob handle, 206 (Fig. 103). A large quern lay in the doorway. The quern and pounder must have been used in preparing things for the lekane and bowl. They tell against washing of wool, and suggest grinding or crushing. The spouted vessels imply liquids. In view of the grape remains in the bowl on the stand it may be that the room was used not just for storing but for making wine. Moreover the function of the room ought to be considered in rela- tion to the room from which it is entered, 91. Room 91 was probably a shrine store for the Shrine, 92, so that the preparation in Room 90 may have been for wine offerings in the Shrine itself. Room 91. The Shrine Store (Fig. 28) Room 91 lies north of 92 and west of 90, with well-built doorway into both. The north wall (south wall of 84) has about five irregular courses packed with clayey earth. It stands to 0.65 m., and is 0.50-0.56 m. wide. The west end had long been eroded away. The wall is built on a ledge of rock which projects south into the room and which, set with stones, provides an irregularly shaped low bench or stand. This projects from 0.28 to 0.48 m. from the wall and is about 0.22 m. high. The east wall at the north end bonds well with the north wall but is really the pro- jecting north anta of the doorway into Room 90. It survives to 0.60 m. and is 0.44 m. wide. The southern section again has irregular courses of small stones with mud filling; a large block of gypsum is used in the first course. The wall stands to 0.52 m., width 0.42 m. At its base is a low bench or stand of stones set in clayey earth. This projects 0.40 m. from the wall and is 0.16 m. high. The south wall is poorly preserved, save for the little anta at the east end. This has five rough courses surviving to 0.48 m., width 0.48 m. The doorway face is, as usual, carefully finished. The doorway itself is 0.80 m. wide. The western section of the wall has only one to two courses surviving and the west end has completely gone. The cause of destruction has been ploughing since disturbed wall stones in all the rooms on the south-western edge were scored with plough marks. The wall survives to 0.26 m. and is 0.47 m. wide. As with the north and east walls of the room a low bench of stones was built against its base. This is now somewhat dis- turbed and originally it probably projected a little less than 0.50 m. from the wall. Like the east bench it is only one course high. The west wall no longer survives. Including the benches the room is preserved to EW 3.12 m. and is NS 2.00 m.</page><page sequence="99">^^„^ ■¥ CC / Ο</page><page sequence="100">/';-=09 )(8* =-0/']</page><page sequence="101">Ob 8 © ^ γ0^«,»</page><page sequence="102">U°H&gt;äJA/C£ +59 33'J ζ~' 60.35 i °fc ( ά'2^ ® +59·17 β</page><page sequence="103">59.17 yé$ï ']&amp;Oyt7.ss ^^&lt;§^''Π ® +57&lt;6Λ 456.92</page><page sequence="104">6319 + 63.60+ ffffi^lß)* 5902 59.07 0 1 2345678 SCALE 1 '80 metres</page><page sequence="105">^3 62.92 /^Λ αυ^1^62.88 / Γ^ +62.53 / {% ^62.68 @ /^Λ + (/ -»-62Λ8 / ' f)Q cJ-p 62 51 (^ 1 ^-&gt;v U ^ 4-61.61 /^^^ ^ J^^^ .53 Ο ç^n ^. gn on 7 8 9 10 1 MYRTO!</page><page sequence="106">60.98 ra κ Ν ^^5j fc r ^RTOS 1967 : 68 spot he.</page><page sequence="107">y Igá 60S5 O 6 / &gt;y /Ï-^P + C7 tít58·05 SPOT HEIGHTS ABOVE SEA LEVEL ^°^ -»</page><page sequence="108">J^*SQjj7 ο/α?&amp;ί° 57°14 .1 ©56.57 jBjf +SSJ&amp;2^Y&amp; 57.03 τ DO, Qw</page><page sequence="109">THE SETTLEMENT 85 The contents consisted of a massive deposit of sixty-six vases smashed over the whole floor. Though most of the vases were probably stored on the benches originally there seem to be too many for this to have been a work room or living room. Rather it was a store for fine vases. Since it is entered from the Shrine to the south it may have been a shrine store with pieces kept for use with offerings. With its large number of pieces in a small area it forms an early parallel to the little shrine stores (θησαυροφυλάκια) of the palaces of Knossos and Zakro with their quantities of fine stone vessels and rhytons.

Spout emerging directly from body, without tubular section, P671, P677-P679 (all wide-mouthed jars), P687-P692 (all piriform), P694? P698 (large). Only five of these sixty-six vessels (amphorae, piriform jar, pithos, spouted jar P698) are large. The remainder are small and nearly all in fine wares, namely red and dark painted, Vasilike and red-brown burnished. Shallow open bowls, jugs and spouted jars are particularly common. The large number of pieces in a small area, and its consequent unsuitability as a living or working place, was noted above. It was much more probably a store for fine pieces. In this connexion the analysis of types shows the deposit to be different in character from the large deposits in Rooms 80 and 82. These had a higher proportion of large storage vessels (34% in 80, 20.4% in 82, as against only 7.6% here in 91) and in 80 there was plenty of working space. Finds other than pots consisted of a small chisel, probably of copper, 102, on the floor beside the eastern bench, a fine marble rubber on the bench, 197, perhaps used as a whetstone for the chisel, three bone tools in a group of bones, 58-60, near the north bench, a small stone disk, 164, a stone weight, 220, a triangular clay counter, 228, and a scrap of red ochre, 241. Room 92. The Shrine (Fig. 28, PL 28) Room 92 (PI. 28A) is south of 91 and communicates with it by the doorway in the north wall, G</page><page sequence="110">86 MYRTOS described above. The east wall survives to 0.55 m. and has some large blocks in it as well as smaller stones in four to six rough courses, with mud filling. The width is 0.47 m. The south wall has three courses preserved to 0.35 m., width 0.42 m. Its west end, like that of the north wall, has gone, as has the whole west wall. The preserved EW measurement is 2.52 m., and the room is NS 4.00 m. How far west the room extended is unknown, but, given the sizes and shape of all other rooms on the site, it is most unlikely to have run more than i£ metres further west. This would have produced a square room, like 60 and 80. A group of loose stones on the floor near the centre of the preserved west edge (PI. 28A, central area) may be the remains of a central structure, again like those in 60 and 80. Whether the settlement extended further west than Room 92 is not known, but it is most unlikely: beyond 92 the ground begins to slope noticeably down to the west and a few metres on are the possible remains of a field or terrace wall in an area certainly outside the settlement (below, p. 89). No pots or structures remained between 92 and this possible wall, and 92, 91 and 84 were almost certainly the westernmost rooms of the settlement. Features within the room were a line of four stone potstands against the south wall (from which stands large vases had fallen) and a small structure built against the east wall. This structure as it now appears is a small, low stand, consisting of two flat-topped stones packed with clayey filling and set on the rock floor (PL 28A, midway along left-hand wall). The northern stone is a block of the calcareous sandstone of the hilltop, the southern is multi- coloured conglomerate brought on to the site. The size of the structure is NS 0.66 m. and it projects 0.44 m. out from the wall. It is now only 0.13 m. high but may well have been at least twice this height originally as a loose slab was removed from it at the beginning of the excava- tion of the room. The function of the structure, beside which there was no hearth or other bench, is suggested below. The floor of the room was the usual soft, decayed sandstone overlain with hard white clay. At the southern end there appeared in excavation to be a later or higher surface, some 0.16 m. up, on to which P82, P578 and P615 had fallen (PL 28C). This stratum of hard, burnt material must have been the remains of the collapsed roof. The pots had certainly stood on their stands (which lay on the white clay floor) against the south wall, and fell northwards into the room after the roof had collapsed. P77 stood on the actual white clay floor, without a stand. The preserved part of the room contained eighteen vessels and the unique female figurine, P704 (PL 28B). The figure lay just south of the stone structure and was unbroken until dis- covered by the point of the little pick. There can be little doubt that it had stood originally on the stone structure, though when found it was on the clayey earth fill, some 0.15 m. above the floor of the room. This clayey earth was not a separate structure or stand, but simply part of the fill which had accumulated before the figure was disturbed from the stone structure just to the north. Certainly the fact that a fragile object with long neck and long, thin arms had remained quite unbroken shows that it had not fallen from above. The figure itself (Figs. 91-2, Pis. 69-70) cannot have been of any practical use. The little jug which the lady holds gives access through a hole in the wall to the interior, but there is no other hole. The extraordinary long neck sug- gests the figure was not intended to represent a human being since the makers of all Early Minoan figurines, including those of Myrtos, represented the human form in roughly correct proportions. The combination of factors, extraordinary shape of the female, the little jug held in the crook of the arm, the impracticability of the piece for everyday, domestic use, the find-spot beside the stone structure, suggests that we have a representation of a goddess originally on an altar, and therefore that Room 92 was a shrine, the oldest of the Minoan household shrines. This arrangement of a goddess figure on a stand against the wall at once recalls the similar</page><page sequence="111">THE SETTLEMENT 87 Late Minoan shrines of Gournia and the Double Axes at Knossos. One function of the goddess with her jug must have been the special protection of the water supply, something of crucial im- portance in the life of the settlement, since there were no wells on the hill and all water had to be carried up in jugs. Since she is a household goddess protection and support of the household crafts and industries of the settlement must also have been her province. The eighteen vessels in the room (Fig. 28) were concentrated mainly in the southern half but one or two were near the altar and one or two more at the north end. They include a high pro- portion (50%) of large vases, but there is nothing against these containing offerings to the female figure. Amphorae: P77, P82, P83. Bowls: shallow, open, P180, P183 (under the broken amphora P83), P205; Large, open, P278. Cooking pot jar, P336. Cup, pedestal foot, Vasilike ware, P372. Jugs: P479, red paint; P503, cooking pot fabric. Lid, large, bow-shaped handle, P538. Piriformjars: P566, P575, P578. Pithoi: P617, P621. Spouted jar, P669, Vasilike ware. A small scrap of Period I fine grey incised ware, P70, also came from the room, but it was not from a vase in use at the time of destruction. The only non-ceramic find was a magnificent pestle, 179, on the floor by the wall, south of the goddess figure. 93 South Paved Way Along the southern edge of the settlement, from the main Entrance 64 on the east to Area 85, the possible entrance in the south-west, a definite attempt was made to provide a raised walk. This consisted of a row of flat slabs, about o. 10 m. thick, set in white clayey material and resting on the natural bedrock. These slabs were best preserved outside Room 79, lying a little below the level of the foundation of the south wall, Fig. 12. A few were preserved eastwards to the main entrance. To the west is the yard area outside Room 80. This had a few large slabs of stone on the rock spread at random before the descending paving of Area 85 (see p. 78f.). Similar random slabs occurred on the rock south of the paved way below Room 79 and they represent very rough paving over the external yard area. The raised line of slabs forming the walk is well designed against mud or dust and we may certainly see it as the forerunner of the carefully built raised ways across the courtyards of the later palaces. Patches of burning were found over the raised way below a massive tumble of stones from the walls. The burnt material may have originated from collapsed roofs at the time of destruction. Further patches of burning on and under the stones in the yard area are the remains of accumu- lated cooking and other fires during the occupation of the site. AREAS OUTSIDE THE SETTLEMENT 94 South Slope Trials Although the southern edge of the settlement was clearly defined by the south wall some 30 to 40 metres of the southern slope of the hill remain before the southern cliff edge is reached.

Trenches MM, OO and QQ,were excavated (Figs. 1 and 29), an area of 34 sq. m. lying 15 metres south of the main Southern Entrance. The decayed sandstone of the bedrock came up some 0.15 m. below surface, save for the central area where there were rough traces of walling for about 2.00 m. east-west, behind a boulder of conglomerate, and built up against the rock. There were three rough courses, ht. 0.32 m., width 0.30 m. In front (i.e., south) of this rough bit of wall and the boulder were the remains of three vessels in situ on a flat ledge of rock. That on the west, below the boulder, was the base of a pithos (diam. 0.38 m.) which had been set in a cutting in the soft rock; that on the east was the base of a large tub or lekane (diam. c. 0.60 m.). These were left in position. The vessel in the centre was a fairly complete lekane, P530, without a spout. A little to the south part of a turn-table, 126, and an unfinished weight came up. The large vases were clearly in an outside area, open to the sky. The rough walling and use of the natural rock gave no suggestion of a room and the surface of the vessels was weathered from exposure. The latter were intended for some outside operation such as washing or food prepara- tion. The finds are interesting in that they demonstrate, as expected, that day-to-day work was carried on outside as well as in the settlement.</page><page sequence="113">THE SETTLEMENT 89 A fragment of an incised and burnished dish with white painted blobs on the rim, unique on the site, was found in the surface sherds north of the rough east-west walling, in Trench QQ. This is P38 and it could well be an import since there is nothing at all like it from the site. The sherds from the surface and fill of this area were in no way different from the settlement pottery. They were all scraps from pithoi, amphoras, dark and red painted jugs and bowls, Myrtos ware jugs, cooking pots and baking plates with a few pieces of Vasilike, fine grey and hatched painted wares. There were 68 broken jug handles (see below on Area 95). 95 South-West Trials When the southern area was first investigated in 1967 Trench I was the westernmost to be put down (Fig. 1). It produced remains of a probable field or terrace wall, 0.50 m. in width, run- ning north to south. The wall lies 8.46 m. west of the preserved west edge of the south wall of Room 92 (Shrine). It was built against a drop in the rock and survived to 0.80 m. Many tumbled stones from it lay immediately to the west. Trenches I North and I South in 1968 showed that the wall continued, with very rough and disturbed construction, to the north and south, giving a total preserved length of about 4.50 m. Again large quantities of tumbled stone lay to the west. The rough construction and absence of buildings favours identification as a field or terrace wall ; nothing suggested it was ever part of a circuit or defence wall. Its position shows that the western limit of the settlement lay to the east and confirms the suggestion (p. 86) that Rooms 91-92 were the westernmost rooms in this corner of the settlement. The pottery was rather worn and weathered in comparison with that of the settlement, but in type was no different. It consisted of scraps of pithos, amphoras, cooking pot wares, Myrtos ware, red and dark painted wares, a few bits of Vasilike ware and one or two Period I fine grey and hatched painted pieces. There were seventy-four broken jug handles, confirmation of the evidence from the settlement for the high frequency of the jug among the fine ware shapes. 96 Circular Building on the Plain At the north end of the little plain which lies to the west of the settlement, 128 metres north-west of the hill summit, lies a roughly circular stone structure (Fig. 30A-C) . The diameter varies from 2.42 m. to 2.80 m. The structure consists of a thick wall, 0.62-1.30 m. in width, built on the bedrock, with one course now surviving. The original height above ground is unknown but many loose stones on and around the building suggest it was much more than one course high. In the centre the natural soft kouskouras rock of the plain was hollowed out to produce a hole which was faced all round the sides with stones except at the lowest level, just above the rock floor (Fig. 30A). The hole, with stone facing, is 0.64-0.76 m. in diameter at the surface and widens to 0.88 m. lower down. The maximum depth from the surface is 0.82 m. The circular wall has an opening on the east side. This is 0.58 m. wide at the east or outer edge and consists of a rock-cut ledge sloping gently down towards the central hole. The ledge does not run right across to the hole but has a step, height 0.20 m. (Fig. 30B-C). The downward slope of the ledge and the step means that the point where the entrance reaches the hole is only 0.32 m. above the floor of the hole. This suggests that access was meant to be obtained not just to the hole, but to its floor. The sides of the entrance were carefully faced with flattish, upright slabs. There were no sherds in the hole, only fallen stones and, above the floor, a little burnt wood. The date of the building can only be conjectured (see Appendix XV sample Q7954 for the</page><page sequence="114">90 MYRTOS ROCK STEP-*! c - ^ Β ?...,, In» " jSCvj ÇQ CL o ^ Β fig. 30 Circular Building 96. a Section Α-B. β Section G-D. c Plan. wood, which is Medieval in date) . The masonry looks Minoan and is no different from that of the settlement. It consists of unworked stones carefully placed. No brick or cement or plaster is used, to suggest a post- Minoan date. Secondly, the only period of occupation of the area is the EM II settlement itself and EM II sherds on a hillock just north of the structure. A date con- temporary with the settlement seems the most probable. The function of the building is unknown. There were no bones or other evidences for a tomb. It seems too small for a kiln and in any case is unburnt. A water-holder (δεξαμενή) is almost as unlikely. Rain water would soon have soaked away; there is no spring on the spot now and almost certainly there never was one in the uniform marl table of the little plain. The thick wall, small hole and numbers of loose stones suggest that it may have been a rough beehive vault, with carefully built entrance to the little stone-lined chamber, the latter not even large enough for one adult to move about in. Religious or ritual interpretations are often cited as a last resort : this building certainly seems too small to have had any practical or domestic function1. 1 This structure K. Branigan calls a well (Studi Mic. ed Egeo-Anat. 13 (1971) 10-11).</page><page sequence="115">THE SETTLEMENT s 1 ! ! &lt; CO s 91</page><page sequence="116">92 MYRTOS 97 The Arc-Shaped Building (Fig. 31) The only construction on the main site later than the settlement is the arc-shaped building on the summit of the hill. Its position over Rooms 1 7-20 can be seen on the Plan and in PL 29A. Its stratigraphical relation to these rooms is apparent in the sections (Figs. 5, 7, 8). Part of the arc was visible on the surface before excavation (cf. BSA 59 (1964) 95, where the possibility of a tholos tomb was mentioned). A mass of tumbled stones over the modern surface suggests that the structure was originally higher than the two to three surviving courses. The unworked sand- stone and limestone blocks used for building are no different from those of the settlement and were almost certainly re-used from the walls below. The building1 consists of a carefully constructed arc, with a maximum, internal measurement, north to south, of 4.90 m. The arc is open to the east and the wall varies in thickness from 1.00 to 1.15 m. Within the curve was a rough stone platform at a lower level than the wall; the plat- form terminated in a still lower bench in the southern half (Fig. 31). Running up to the bench and platform was a floor of hard, white clayey earth. In the southern area the floor was pre- served for 1.50 m. east of the bench before it petered out near the modern surface. Several finds lay on the floor in the northern area. A pithos, P641, originally 0.85 m. high, had stood near the centre and had fallen northwards across the floor (PL 29B). It is like the pithoi of the settlement in shape and size and was clearly one such re-used. Beside the smashed fragments on the west side was a quern and on the east a perforated stone weight, 217. The date of the building is uncertain. It is clearly later than the destruction of the settlement, which came at the end of Early Minoan II. The masonry is certainly Minoan. The EM II pithos could of course have been re-used at any date, but it is noteworthy that no pottery later than EM II was found on the floor or in the shallow fill (save three fragments of a Byzantine bowl) . For instance no Middle Minoan I material appeared although the near-by Pyrgos site was extensively occupied from at least that date. This suggests that little time had elapsed after the destruction before the rebuilding. Early Minoan III may be put forward tentatively as the date. The function of the building, which is unique, remains unknown. With the pithos, quern and stone weight it would seem to have had a domestic purpose, but with its extraordinary shape and its solitary existence on the summit it can hardly have been an ordinary house. Equally it was not a tomb. No bones were found and the structure was in any case an arc, complete at each end, and not a surviving fragment of a circle. At this date a peak sanctuary would seem an obvious possibility, with the whole structure open to the east and the rising sun. But there was no positive evidence for a sanctuary. No figurines or votives were found. Another possible explanation is that it is a look-out point, but again there was nothing positive to suggest this, and the obvious point against it is that it could have served no one usefully. There was no accompanying settle- ment and the Pyrgos site to the west is at any rate on a higher hill. 1 It was necessary to remove the southern half in order to elucidate the complicated structures of the settlement under- neath.</page><page sequence="117">CHAPTER IV. THE POTTERY In the analysis and classification of the pottery attention has been focused on three features: surface decoration, fabric and shape. Figures and percentages are based on the 704 catalogued pots. The sherd material of course shows that a far greater number of vessels was in use at some time or another in the life of the settlement, but the catalogued pieces are sufficient in quantity to be representative of the settlement pottery as a whole. Surface Decoration A few terms which enjoy a variety of meanings in descriptions of ceramic surface decoration are used here as follows : Burnished: the painted or slipped surface of the vase has been burnished or polished with a bone or a stone polisher (see p. 235) ; this often leaves irregular striations visible in the paint. Paint: the painted decoration (red, black, or any shade in between, after firing), applied on to the slip by brush, in patterns or all over the surface. The paint consisted of a solution of clay, often rather weak on vases that are painted all over. Red, brown, brownish or pur- plish red is most common and for this ochrous or haematitic red clay earth, rich in iron oxide, must have been used in an oxidizing firing (see p. 130 on the use of such earth today at Kendri near Vasilike) . Black surfaces will have been achieved by firing this same paint in a reducing atmosphere. For white paint some other substance must have been used. Slip: a weak solution of the same clay from which the vase was formed. The solution is normally of the grey clay used for most of the vases, firing to a yellowish buff surface in an oxidizing atmosphere (to grey in fine grey ware, fired in a reducing atmosphere). Cooking pots and apparently a few dark 'painted' pieces were slipped with the purplish to reddish solution otherwise used for painted decoration. Vases were immersed in the solution, so that the whole surface, inside and out, was covered. But in the case of the large vessels like amphorae, lekanai and pithoi the slip would have been applied with a brush. Yellow or ivory burnished pots had a thicker slip and no painted decoration. Fine grey ware is the same clay with thick slip, fired by reduction. Apart from these pieces the pottery is fairly thinly slipped, with painted decoration added before firing in patterns or all over the slip. There were eleven main ways of giving surface decoration to the EM II settlement pottery. In order of frequency (Fig. 32) these are: (1) red to brown paint, unburnished, all over the sur- face; (2) dark, purplish black or black paint, unburnished, all over the surface;1 (3) Vasilike ware, red, brown, yellow and black paint, mottled, burnished, applied on to a buff slip all over the external surface except the base; (4) dark (brown-black) trickle decoration, painted on the buff slip of amphorae, lekanai and pithoi; (5) dark on light painted (dark patterns on a buff slip) ; (6) purplish/reddish/brownish paint applied all over cooking pot jars and over the interiors of baking plates; (7) red-brown paint, burnished, all over the surface;2 (8) grey burnished (a pale grey slip, all over, lightly burnished ; occasionally incised) ; (9) brown surfaced 1 Cf.

Of the 615 medium-sized and small, fine ware pieces (i.e., all vases except the 89 large, trickle decorated amphorae, hydria, lekanai and pithoi) 28.7% are burnished (176 pots), 71.3% un- burnished (439 pots) . Since it is often thought that burnished wares are uncommon after the Neolithic this high proportion for EM II is noteworthy. Over half of it is Vasilike ware. In Period I dark on light painted and grey burnished are by far the commonest of the fine wares. Red and dark painted pieces, burnished and unburnished, occur far less frequently and Vasilike ware is absent. In Period II grey burnished pots are no longer in use, dark on light painted is much less common than earlier, Vasilike, red and dark painted wares are very com- mon. Eleven vases in this period have white painted decoration (seven on dark paint, three on red burnished, one on red unburnished). Cooking pot wares and the large, trickle-decorated vessels occur in both periods. Fabrics Nine distinct fabrics were used. The relation of these to the types of surface decoration is analysed below. The fabrics in order of frequency are as follows. 1 Pure, with few or no gritty (tempering) inclusions; usually fairly soft (scratched by finger nail), sometimes firm to hard; thick (i.e. producing thick- walled fine wares such as Vasilike ware, whose walls are 6 to 9 millimetres thick) ; usually buff coloured, sometimes greyish buff or orange buff. 2 Gritty: a firm to hard, buff coloured fabric with purplish to black grits (occasionally white as well as dark). Usual fabric for dark on light painted ware. Basically similar to pithos fabric, but much finer. 3 Fine brown with tiny white grits : a fine, sandy fabric, sandy brown in colour (sometimes grey brown or orange) with tiny white and often gold (mica) grits. 1 Cf. Seager, Vasilike I 2 1 7, style 3.</page><page sequence="119">THE POTTERY 95 4 Pithos : coarse with distinct purple, dark and sometimes white grits ; firm to hard ; usually buffbut varies from grey core (not fully fired) to pink at surface edges. Used for lekanai and pithoi. 5 Cooking pot ι : coarse, rather friable, with dark grits; brick red to dark brown to purplish brown in colour. 6 Thin orange with tiny white grits : a very thin-walled fabric, firm to hard, well-fired, orange (sometimes brownish) in colour with tiny white inclusions. Very similar in composition to 3. Frequently used for Piriform Jars which have walls only 2 to 4 millimetres thick and are 0.40 m. in height. 7 Fine grey: a pure, light grey fabric, with no gritty inclusions. Soft. Thick- walled and very similar, save in colour, to 1. Always given a light grey slip which is burnished. Used only in Period I. 8 Cooking Pot 2 : a firm to hard fabric, light brown or orange brown in colour with distinct white marble grits. A cooking pot fabric used almost exclusively in Period I. 9 Pale buff: a pure fabric, without grits (like 1 and 7), pale creamy buff in colour; given a pale creamy or ivory slip which is burnished. 10 A few others with various fabrics: soft, orange-greenish grey, very gritty (3), pale pink (1), deep pink (1), plain buff (1), thin reddish (1), dark grey, poorly fired (1).

The variety of distinct fabrics shows that the potters practised a developed ceramic tech- nology with an excellent control and understanding of the uses of different clays and fabrics for different purposes. The robust pithos fabric was necessary for those large capacious vessels; the well-fired thin orange fabric ensured that the piriform jars, 0.40-0.50 m. high, were not too heavy to carry around and yet at the same time held a good amount of liquid. Cooking pot fabrics were suitable for use on fires. The fine 'table' wares required a purer, smoother fabric, suitable for bowls, cups, jugs and spouted jars. Vasilike, red, grey and ivory wares were thick- walled and of pure fabric which could easily take an attractive burnish. The hard, gritty fabric of the dark on light Myrtos ware jugs produced vessels strong enough to withstand hard usage in the continuous journeys to fetch water. The jugs were both strong and not too heavy to carry up the hill to the site. This developed technology began at the source since we know from analyses of the clay that at least two distinct beds were exploited by the potters (Appendix XII and p. 26if.).</page><page sequence="120">96 MYRTOS Fabrics and Surface Decoration A few fabrics have only one type of surface decoration; for example, grey fabric has only grey burnished slip (occasionally incised), pale buff ware an ivory burnished slip, cooking pot 1 fabric reddish/purplish brown cooking pot slip, pithos fabric a buff slip with trickle decoration. But the commonest fabrics, pure buff, gritty, fine brown and thin orange each had a variety of surface decorations, best illustrated in the Table, Fig. 34.

Equally, certain surface decorations are found on only one fabric : Vasilike ware on pure, buff fabric, grey burnished on grey fabric, ivory burnished on pale buff, reddish/purple cooking pot paint on cooking pot fabric 1. Other decorations occur on more than one fabric, Fig. 35. The general picture is one of considerable variety, some fabrics having only one type of decoration, some decorations being restricted to one fabric, while all kinds of combinations were tried with other fabrics and decorations. Together with the variety of fabrics and the choice of many colourful systems of decoration goes a very considerable competence in potting and a wide range of shapes. The whole produces a ceramic industry of high artistic and func- tional achievement, all the more surprising in that none of the vases was made on a fast or freely revolving wheel. Shapes The classification by shapes is divided into material of Periods I and II.

There is very little. In the catalogue under each numbered vase, special shape features, if any, are given first, then the fabric. The latter is described very briefly; reference should be made to the discussion of fabrics above, p. 94f. for a fuller description. After the surface decoration, the preserved amount of the vase is noted. Measurements are in centimetres, e.g., 5.2 is 5.2 cm. Abbreviations : Ht., height; Diam., diameter; près., preserved; frag., fragment or fragmentary. Next comes the find spot (see Chapter III for each room and for plans). Surface means the surface level (usually above definable rooms), fill means the fill of earth, stones, plaster, sherds, etc., in a room, and floor means that a vase was found on the floor. The find spot is followed by the original excava- tion pot number, e.g., P499. This is to facilitate reference to the actual vases, inscribed with the excavation number in Aghios Nikolaos museum. PERIOD I The Period I, or Early Minoan IIA material comes chiefly from five areas of the settlement (above p. 1 if.) : the unburnt level of fragmentary occupation material stratified on the bedrock below the burnt material of Period II in Rooms 27 and 28; the pure deposit at the south end of 36; the occupation levels, partly stratified below Period II material, otherwise pure, above the</page><page sequence="122">98 MYRTOs bedrock in Rooms 37-40; the pure deposits of Rooms 47-51 ; and the homogeneous Rubbish Pits, 61-62, in the south-east corner of the site. Material from a few mixed deposits and surface levels can be associated stylistically with that from the stratified and pure deposits. In the cata- logue below vases not from the stratified or pure deposits are marked with an asterisk. Baking Plates Large shallow baking plates, so common in Period II, begin already in the first period. There are two fabrics : that characteristic of Period I cooking pot ware, rather coarse, hard, deep orange with distinct white marble inclusions,1 and secondly the ordinary cooking pot fabric (above p. 95, &gt;No. 5) of both periods. The shapes are the shallow, curved dish of Period II (p. in) and flat-based dishes. This latter form was more common and several fragments occurred in South-East Pit 61. Large, shallow baking plates occur in the EM II levels at Knossos excavated in 1957-61 (information from Mr M. S. F. Hood). Pi Shallow dish; flat, ring base; hole above base for pouring out liquid.

Since only a fragment was preserved (ht. 13.7, diam. c. 30.0) it is not known whether the original had handles only (cf. Period II Bowls 5D) or handles and a bridge spout (5E). It had reddish brown paint outside and a red band on the buff slip round the edge of the base on the inside. Such interior dark on buff decoration is not found on the Period II bowls.

H</page><page sequence="126">102 MYRTOS Cooking Pot Jars Fragments of cooking pot jars occurred in most of the main Period I deposits. They had the usual incurving profile (cf. Figs. 60, 62 of Period II) and fragments from below Room 27 and in Room 37 (deposit with stones) had vertical handles below the rim. Some were clearly tripod pots since 81 tripod feet came from these earliest deposits (65 from South-East Pit 61). Of these, 5 were of circular section (as in the EM II levels at Knossos excavated by Mr Hood in 1957-61), 7 were thick oval, 45 oval, 22 flattish-flat oval and 2 rectangular with rounded corners. For a thick oval example see Fig. 63, 6 (SE Pit 61), and for one of circular section, Fig. 63, 7 (Room 50, west part). Both the orange/brown fabric with white grits and the coarse purplish brown fabric with dark grits were used, the former being slightly more common than the latter. Cups The S profile cup with large handle, common in Period II, seems to have been very rare in the first period. A fragment with dark paint all over occurred in the basal level of Room 40, in a clear Period I context. Another piece, belonging to an S profile bowl or cup in cooking pot fabric, was found in the Period I level below Room 28. A more fully preserved cup comes from the same spot.

Goblets Two types of goblet were in use in Period I, that with a roughly cylindrical, hollow stem, flaring out slightly at the foot, and that with a low pedestal foot. The former, in pale grey or brown burnished ware, seem to be descended from the high-pedestalled chalices of Early Minoan I Pyrgos ware. The second type, again in pale grey burnished ware, with lower foot,</page><page sequence="127">THE POTTERY IO3 is probably a variant of the higher stemmed goblets. One example, P45, has part of the grey surface burnished to dark grey (the only instance at Myrtos), while another, P42, has incised horizontal rings round the foot (again unique here). Each of these features seems to have sur- vived from EM I, where they appear on the Pyrgos ware chalices. But, even apart from the context, the low feet and pale grey burnished fabric are clear indications of EM II. It is the second form alone, with the low pedestal foot, which survives into Period II, where Vasilike and dark painted goblets of this type are a hallmark of the period. The development from high-pedestalled chalices through pedestalled goblets to low-footed MM I egg-cups is clearly seen in the stratified and homogenous deposits excavated at Knossos in 1 95 7-6 1.1 A similar series to ours comes from the Trapeza cave (unstratified) and low- pedestalled and a tall-stemmed example are probably contemporary with ours of EM IIA.2 Another goblet, from Mochlos, has a cylindrical stem and, since it is also in fine grey ware, must be contemporary.^ (1) Tall, roughly cylindrical stem, with flaring foot4 P39 Grey/brown, hard, with grits.

The magnificent large jugs of Period I with the dark on light pattern of fans, called Myrtos ware, are also distinguished occasionally by wavy or crinkly rims. This feature does not look like an imitation of metal work. Another feature appearing only in Period I is a raised band around the handles of dark on light painted jugs (PL 34A, left and right (SE Pit 62) ; PL 30A, lower right (below Room 28) ; PL 35A, top right (below Room 27)). Sometimes there is also a raised band of clay at the junc- tion of the handle and neck (PL 34A, right (SE Pit 62) ; PL 35 A, top right (below Room 27)), while once an applied band looks like an imitation snake (PL 34A, centre (SE Pit 62)). This jug may have had a ritual function in a snake cult like the Late Minoan tubes and other vases with applied snakes from a house beside the Palace at Knossos.1 If this interpretation is accepted we have evidence for a household snake cult in the settlement. The existence of a snake cult already in Early Minoan times is clear from the female figure entwined with snakes from Koumasa, EM II in date.2 In Period II the cores of the handles are often pushed through the wall of the jug. This feature was noted only once in the first Period, on a fragment from below Room 28. Period I jugs usually have dark on light painted decoration, of two main kinds : hatched triangles on the shoulders and solid horizontal bands round the belly and lower part, and the Myrtos ware fans. One unique decoration consists of solid butterflies or double axes round the shoulder of P49. One fragment, P59, seems to come from a jug neck and has white horizontal bands on a black ground. White paint is extremely rare in Period I. ( 1 ) Depressed or slightly flattened globular form P47 Tall neck with slightly moulded or crinkly rim. Buff with small grits.

Although the spouts did not survive (so it is not known whether the long teapot spout began in Period I) the type is secure because of the small raised collars which are charac- teristic of the many complete examples of Period II.

A fragment of the base of another strainer came from a mixed level above the pure Period I level under Room 28 (PL 32A, above right). Another miscellaneous form, restricted to Period I, seems to have been some kind of large bowl with a high, raised base. The walls and base are thick and in coarse pithos fabric. The underside or top side of the base (the fragments do not show which is which) has black paint. There was a fragment from below Room 27 and another in SE Pit 61, each with ht. près. 16.0, the base being half way up. Fragments of another such vase occurred in the fill of Room 80 (cf. P62) . These fragments preserve a whole profile and show that the rim was thickened and that the base came about one-third of the way up the vase. Vasilike Ware South-East Pit 62 produced two sherds of Vasilike ware in 10 to 12 kilogrammes of pottery. 1 This was the only occurrence of the ware in a Period I context and it shows that the hallmark of Period II was virtually unknown at Myrtos in the earlier phase. It is important to notice that in the otherwise closely parallel EM IIA period at Vasilike itself Vasilike ware is regularly found.2 This makes it clear that the ware did not begin at Myrtos. PERIOD II The Period II pottery comes almost entirely from the floor deposits of the final destruction of the settlement. Although there are clear continuities in vase types the material as a whole is different in character from that of Period I. Shallow open bowls, cooking pots, goblets with pedestal foot and pithoi continue as before. Shapes that were rare (perhaps by accidents of preservation) in Period I now become common : plain conical bowls, S profile bowls, cups with prominent handle, lekanai, small or miniature lids with knob handle, piriform jars and spouted jars. Other types continue as frequently as before, but with changes of shape: baking plates are mostly of the shallow, round-bottomed form, jugs are nearly always piriform. Some Period I shapes no longer appear: goblets with tall cylindrical stems, flanged lids. Other shapes are new, especially the fine large amphorae, several forms of deep flaring bowl with open or bridge 1 Three-quarters of a zembil (large rubber bucket) . 2 Seager, Vasilike I 213; II 114.</page><page sequence="133">THE POTTERY IO9 spout, burners, hydria, varieties of small jug, lamps, cylindrical pyxides. Above all there is a major change of emphasis in decoration : though trickle ornament continues on large vessels as does the fan motive on jugs, hatched painted patterns and fine grey burnished ware no longer appear; instead the fine wares are mostly decorated with red or dark paint all over, Vasilike ware being one prominent type. Dark on light pieces still appear but are now fairly rare in the assemblage. White painted patterns on a dark ground were very rare in Period I and are only a little more common in the final destruction deposits. The white grit cooking pot fabric of Period I is hardly ever used. Unless otherwise stated vases are in destruction deposits and are complete or lack only small pieces. Amphorae These fine store vases are new in Period II. Though superficially they resemble pithoi with the invariable trickle decoration (in imitation of overflowing liquids) they have sufficient differences to make them a distinct type. The fabric is always sandy brown to buff, with small white and gold (mica) inclusions, quite different from pithos fabric. The shape varies from a roughly ovoid, rather plump barrel (e.g. P73) to a high-shouldered piriform type (e.g. P76). The rim is thickened or slightly everted in profile and a shallow collar is formed by a raised horizontal rib running below. Occasionally there are two ribs (P75) or an applied band of thumb-impressed decoration instead of a rib. The collar is always covered with dark paint. Three small vertical handles go from the rib to the shoulder and there are three larger vertical handles lower down, below the point of greatest diameter and placed symmetrically between each of the smaller handles above. On nine out of twenty-two amphorae with the lower part preserved there is a small hole just above the base, showing that these vessels at least were used for liquids. The amphorae with heights and diameters preserved are from about 60 to 87 cm. high and 51-65 cm. in diameter. Technically they are splendid vessels since, in spite of the size, the walls are only 0.7 to 0.9 cm. thick. The average capacity of an amphora is 114 litres. For the economic implications of this see p. 144-6 in the discussion on amphorae and pithoi. Fragments from the Trapeza Cave (Late Neolithic to MM I, unstratified) are similar, with rib and handles at the base of the collar. The fabric, however, is different, coarse red with a red slip.1 The excavators remark that these vessels were probably 75 to 100 cm. high and some, e.g., No. 909, had a hole just above the base. In size and shape, with one or two horizontal ribs or rope decoration just below the rim, they are so similar to our vessels that they may well be of EM II date rather than MM I, the date the excavators gave, since EM pithoi were then un- known. All the amphorae have the fabric and decoration described above, one rib below the rim and three small and three larger vertical handles unless otherwise stated. P73 Ht. 86.8.

Baking Plates The name baking plate is given to a class of shallow open bowls with a very large diameter, 40 to 60 cm. ; they usually have a purplish/red or purplish/brown slip inside while the exterior underside is roughened, without paint. The fabrics used are fine brown with tiny white grits, thin orange with tiny white grits (a finer version of the former) and ordinary purplish red/brown cooking pot ware with dark grits (above p. 95). The walls are thin and because of this and the large size the plates never survive as more than fragments, usually only a few centimetres in width. They would have been very fragile for frequent handling and the finding of fragments of several plates together in burnt contexts with cooking pots or holes (Rooms 35, 57, 66, 88) suggests they were used for cooking. Thus the underside could be left rough and the thin walls would ensure quick heating. There are two basic shapes: A, a shallow bowl with curving underside and thickened rim; the rim may have a little projecting ridge (P101-P115) or be simply curved but still well marked off from the underside (P116-P123). B, a shallow bowl with flat base and flaring sides (P124-P130). Finally, C, come one or two variant forms. The plates do not have handles (save one or two rare instances where a handle is preserved on the inside of the rim), but are well adapted for holding under the projecting ridge or offset curved rim. Sometimes the rim is folded over inwards to form a flat ledge for about 10 centi- metres of the circumference (e.g., P108). This provides another form of internal handle. Several fragments have the rim made lower on one part of the circumference. On the one bowl where most of the rim is preserved, Pug, this dipped rim is opposite the section folded inwards. Presumably therefore the dipped part was for pouring, opposite the fold, which served as a handle. Fragments of large shallow baking plates were common in the EM II occupation levels excavated at Knossos in 1957-61 (information from Mr M. S. F. Hood). These had slightly different rim profiles but the undersides were roughened as at Myrtos. All pieces in the catalogue are fragments. Width means the distance in a straight line between each broken off end of the rim. A. Shallow bowls with curved underside and thickened rim P101 to Pi 15 have the projecting ridge, Pi 16 to P123 the curved and offset rim.</page><page sequence="136">112 MYRTOS Pioi Orange with tiny white grits.

Burners There are five of these unusual vases from the settlement. They are all in coarse, deep brick red to brown cooking pot fabric with dark grits, and they have the usual purplish brown cooking pot slip. Each piece has a small bowl surrounded by an outer cover with two handles. From the top of the cover and bowl rises a low neck, with one or two rows of holes perforated in its sides. The interior of the bowl is burnt black and the underside of the cover is rough, which suggests that the vases were used as illustrated here, and not with the rough side uppermost. Since the holes in the neck are functional the top of the neck must have been closed when the vase was in use, to force an exit through the holes. Since the interior bowl is too small to have received enough charcoal to provide heat, but is nevertheless burnt black, the vases must have been used as incense burners or for some other sweet-smelling substance the fumes of which would have been dispersed through the holes in the neck. The alternative possibility, that the vases were used the other way up, has in its favour the fact that the holes would have served as vents to keep what was in the bowl burning. This would presumably imply a heating function, with food or liquid placed on and around the inner bowl. But against this are several points: (1) the charcoals could easily have dropped out if the vase were moved; (2) food or liquid would have been heated on the rough, unslipped surface (a practice not otherwise paralleled on the Myrtos pottery) ; (3) above all, little or no heat could have come from the few charcoals in the small and rather thick-walled interior bowl. It seems therefore fairly clear that the vases were used as burners for sweet-smelling substances and not as any kind of heater or brazier. P313 and P316 at least are made from four parts, the outer cover with two handles, the circular neck with holes, the inner bowl and a ring which joins the bowl to the outer cover. P3X5 seems to be made in one piece but the joins may have been carefully smoothed over. There is only one parallel for the type, a vase like P313-P316 from the EM II-MM I circular tomb at Marathokephalon.1 This has little lugs rather than handles. The distribution of the type, five at Myrtos, one in the Mesara and none elsewhere, suggests that the Maratho- kephalon vase may have come from Myrtos. Part of a similar, but smaller vessel was found in the EM II levels excavated at Knossos in 1957-61. The type is the earliest in a long Minoan tradition since fire-boxes or incense-burners with a distinct interior bowl in a larger bowl are known at Mallia and elsewhere in MM and LM times.2 1 Xanthoudides, Arch.

Cooking Pot Jars including Tripod Cooking Pots Vases classified as cooking pots have a profile curving into the rim, with one or more vertical handles or horizontal lugs on or just below the rim, and are made of a coarse, red/brown-deep purplish grey, gritty fabric with a red/purple or purple/brown slip. The only refinements of this basic form are slightly thickened or everted rims and, on some pots of the simplest basic form ( 1 ), the presence of three legs, pointing slightly outwards. The legs were separately made and the base of the pot is scored to receive them and make a good bond. Sometimes the interior base is burnt (but not the rest of the interior), sometimes the under- side of the base. This suggests that the pots were used for cooking, as does the finding of several together with baking plates in Room 57. As for the method of cooking, fire was clearly placed below some of the pots (hence the tripod form), while the burnt interior bases suggest either charcoals or pot boilers in the pot, or careless cooks. There is no reason to suppose that the pots were all or always used for cooking. Some have no marks of burning. ( 1 ) Simple incurving profile.

In addition to these catalogued tripod pots the settlement produced 433 whole or fragmentary tripod feet, from all areas and levels except those of exclusively Period I date (see p. 102). This</page><page sequence="149">THE POTTERY I25 indicates a minimum number of 156 tripod pots in use through Period II (including those cata- logued above), whilst the mean number of pots from the whole or fragmentary feet found is 289. The settlement in both Period I and II produced 514 whole or fragmentary feet (81 plus 433). Of these, 94 were complete and may be analysed as follows: Length: longest 10.5, shortest 6.2; the great majority 7.0-9.2 (only seven are 9.5 or more, only four are under 7.0). Shape: 12 have a pronounced flat end (e.g. Fig. 63, 2, PL 45B, left), 16 have a pointed end (e.g. Fig. 63, 3, 5, PL 45B, right) and all the rest are in between with a rounded end (e.g. Fig. 63, 1, 4, 6, 7.). For the angle of the foot to the vase P339 is typical. Five feet only curve out more at their lower end (Fig. 63, 7). Decoration: this is rare. Of the 433 non-Period I corpus 14 have a vertical raised rib (four of these are from two pots which have a rib on each side of the leg) . See Fig. 63, 1 ; PL 45B. centre. The ribs are never decorated. Section: of the 94 complete legs, 45 are flat oval (or occasionally rectangular with rounded corners) (Fig. 63, 1-2), 37 are oval (Fig. 63, 3-4), 10 are thick oval (Fig. 63, 5-6), 1 is almost circular and 1 is circular (Fig. 63, 7). Thus the sections are predominantly flat oval to oval. All these occur with flat, pointed and rounded ends. This wide range of shape and section is of special interest since the Myrtos tripod pots are among the earliest yet found in Crete. Elsewhere only at Knossos (1957-61 excavations) is the type clearly dated to EM II, and there the feet are small and circular in section (information from Mr Hood) . Cups One-handled drinking cups have four forms, the first being much the commonest : ( 1 ) S profile with a thick strap or a circular section handle. The handles are commonly large and rise high, but smaller ones do occur. (2) A plain incurving profile with fairly small handles, though they still rise above the rim. This form sometimes has a small moulded lip on the rim for drinking, set at right angles to the handle. (3) An almost globular form with a raised collar and handle rising well above the rim. (4) A single example on a small pedestal foot. Surface decoration of all forms is nearly always red (sometimes burnished) or dark paint all over, or Vasilike Ware. A cup like those of form (2) and with a large handle (horizontal, not high rising) occurs in the EM II levels at Knossos (1957-61 excavations). The large handle is a hallmark of EM II.1 Type 1 is the characteristic form of EM II Myrtos. The type carries on into EM III2 and is clearly the forerunner of the fully carinated forms of MM I/II.3 Type 2 with plain incurving profile is very simple and, not surprisingly, continues on to EM III and MM I.4 In EM III- MM I at least two new types have come in and expanded the range of cups : an elegant form with straight or slightly flaring sides sloping into the base5 and a tumbler form with strap handle.6 This form is very much commoner without a handle. A handleless bowl, almost certainly used for drinking, is also new in EM III.? It has vertical sides curving below into the base or sides sloping out slightly to form a low belly. 1 Seager, Vasilike I Fig. 6 (EM II B, House on the Hill Top). Gournia PI. XII, 17.

One is from a Period I context, one could be Period I or II by context (Fig. 40), the third may be an import and came unfortunately from a surface level (Fig. 40) . Thus it is uncertain whether this type continued in use in Period II. Goblets The pedestalled goblet continues from Period I and is one of the characteristic shapes of Period II. It occurs with a plain deep bowl, P373-P383, or with slightly incurving profile, P384-P388, and there are one or two with an open rim spout. The pedestal feet have slightly varying sec- tions, illustrated in Fig. 65. Vasilike ware or red painted decoration is used almost exclusively. These are abbreviated to VW, RP, RB (red painted and burnished) in the catalogue. Close parallels are found at Vasilike and elsewhere.2 Type 1 occurs at Knossos (see note 2) and in north Crete, but a form with a slightly more flaring bowl and a rather lower and wider foot is very much more common there in EM II.3 This form is the clear antecedent of the typical central Cretan egg-cup of MM I A with its even lower foot.4 1 H.

The pot may well be an import. Jugs These are classified as: (1) Vasilike and Burnished Ware, (2) Dark on light painted and dark painted ware, (3) Juglets, (4) Jugs with horizontal rim. Types 1 and 2 are mainly piriform or globular, but have differences of detail in shape and are of quite distinct fabrics; (3) consists of miniature jugs of several forms, while (4) is self-explanatory. Jugs make up 19.7% of all the catalogued pottery of Period II. ( 1 ) Vasilike ware and red or brown burnished ware The walls of the vases are always thick in genuine Vasilike and burnished ware. The fabric is soft to medium (never hard) and pure, without grits.1 It usually fires to a light buff colour. The technique of mottled surface decoration has always been of interest.2 The most convincing explanation to date has been that of Noble.3 The pots were fired once in an oxidizing atmosphere and the resulting red surface was given black patches after firing by the application of the flame of a burning twig. This in effect produced a reducing condition and turned the ferric oxide of 1 It is the συρω-rós πηλός of modern Cretan potters, clay filtered through water and drained of all particles. It is thus smooth and able to take the good burnish of Vasilike ware. 2 The best discussion of genuine Vasilike ware and imita- tive Vasilike ware (what I have called pseudo- Vasilike ware) is by the excavators of the Trapeza Cave (H. W. and J. D. S. Pendlebury and M. B. Money-Coutts, BSA 36 (1935-6) 71-2). They point out that the genuine mottled surface was achieved by firing, but by inequalities rather than controlled atmospheres, while imitative surfaces resulted from different coloured paints. In this last they agree with Banti on the imitative pieces from the Mesara (Annuario 13-14 (1 930-1) 84-5). This is probably true for Trapeza and the Mesara, in view of the sharp demarcation noticed between the different coloured areas of the imita- tives ; but at Myrtos it was probably due to firing, since the imitative mottling always shows merging and mixture of colours rather than sharp differentiation. 3 The Techniques of Painted Attic Pottery (London, 1966) 34-5·</page><page sequence="154">I30 MYRTOS the red painted surface black on these patches. Noble suggests that the yellow colour surround- ing some of the black spots was caused by partial reduction. This explanation does not account in a wholly satisfactory way for the mottling as it actually appears. The vase surfaces, always burnished, are coloured in several ways (and not as simply as Noble describes).1 Some are predominantly red or reddish brown or dark metallic brown, with well-defined pale orange-yellow areas. Within these orange-yellow areas are black blob-like patches (see P401, PL 49C and P656). It is quite clear that these areas are not little peripheral extensions around the black blobs (as is implied in Noble's explanation), but are fairly large areas on which blobs are found here and there. The pale orange-yellow areas are often separated from the main red painted surface by a thin, outlining black band (see P401). This is one type of surface, the most common. Another is well exemplified by P414, PI. 50C. Here the main sur- face, burnished as always, is black, while again there are distinct and quite large areas, this time yellow/buff or pale orange, with small black blobs.2 A third type is an amalgam of these two, with distinct red and black areas, and also, equally distinct, one or two pale orange-red areas with small black blobs. See P403, PL 49D, pale orange-red area with black blobs on left side of shoulder. This is how Vasilike ware surfaces appear. An explanation of the colours may be set out tentatively as follows ; it is one of firing techniques and does not involve the use of different coloured paints. 1 . The vase was formed of grey Cretan clay, which fires buff and so presumably contained little or no iron oxide. 2. To the sun-dried surface a clay slip was applied. This consisted of a weak solution of the same grey clay, which produced a buff slip after firing. On to the slip (before firing) was put a coat of red paint, sometimes more thickly in some places than in others. The paint consisted of a solution of red clay (ochrous or haematitic earth) rich in iron oxide.* This red paint was not applied over the whole vase; distinct areas were reserved, leaving the (unfired) grey slip exposed. The outlines of the reserved areas were carefully defined by a thin, extra band of red paint. On to the reserved, grey areas were put small blobs of red paint. These were either a solution of the same strength as the red paint on the main surface, or were more concentrated. The base of the jug received no red paint. The main surface, including the reserved areas, was then burnished, probably with a smooth pebble (below p. 235). 3. Firing then took place. For vases with red, reddish brown or dark metallic brown main sur- faces, with reserved pale orange-red-yellow areas with black blobs,4 the firing will have been three phase. First an oxidizing atmosphere would make all the painted areas red (ferric oxide), but would leave the reserved, unpainted areas buff. Then a reducing atmosphere would make all the red areas black, but still leave the unpainted areas yellow/buff since the original slip contained little or no oxide to change its colour. Finally a reoxidizing atmosphere would begin to turn the black areas red again. Firing stopped at the point when the paint from the weaker solution had gone back from black to red, but before the paint of the concentrated solution (i.e., the blobs in the reserved areas, the outlines of the reserved areas and sometimes patches on the main painted surface) had changed colour again. This concentrated paint still remained black. The reserved yellowish buff areas were only slightly reddened during this third phase, and remained much paler than the painted areas. Hence the vases as they appear finished, with the surface colour as described above. 1 Noble does not mention the initial buff slip, which is basic to an understanding of the colour system. 2 The two surfaces are illustrated in colour in Marinatos and Hirmer, Crete and Mycenae PI. IV, below left (Gournia) ; PL III (Vasilike). 3 Potters today at the village of Kendri, near Vasilike, use two clays, one of which is red earth from the hills im- mediately to the east. 4 Marinatos and Hirmer, op. cit., PL IV, below left, is an excellent example, in colour.</page><page sequence="155">THE POTTERY I3I Vases such as P414, PL 50C, would have been removed after the second stage of firing, when all red painted surfaces had gone black by reduction, the reserved areas remaining buff. It is clear from the vases that the potters had mastered oxidizing and reducing techniques. See also Appendix XI, sample 2, where the same conclusion is reached independently. There is no question of the mottled surfaces being due to chance conditions within the kiln (or heaped coals touching the surface) . The decoration was carefully applied and controlled, as is apparent from the deliberate and approximately repeating patterns on P401, P656, P657 (Pis. 49C, 63C-D) and on the Gournia juglet.1 Jugs with a monochrome red or brown burnished surface, e.g., P405, PL 50A, were pre- sumably fired in a single, oxidizing phase.

(2) Dark on light painted and dark painted (all over) These jugs are mostly piriform; a few have ovoid, globular, depressed globular or low-bellied bodies. Of the 50 piriform jugs in type 2 with the relevant area preserved, 20 have the handle core pushed right through or just beginning to project through the wall of the vase. Bases are always flat; nearly all are plain, a few are moulded. (a) Piriform. Dark on light painted pieces are catalogued first. Most of these have five groups of vertical fans in black to red paint on a buff slip. The neck is painted with horizontal bands with one vertical line at the front opposite the handle. The handle has a solid band at the junction with the neck, another in the middle and another at the junction with the body. Between the three bands are two solid circles in the same red-black paint. The frequency of this system of decoration at Myrtos (fragments occurred in most excavated levels) and its rarity elsewhere4 enables it to be called Myrtos ware. Apart from these jugs there are three other dark on light painted pieces. The fabric of type 2 jugs is fairly hard, reddish to buff in colour, with dark grits, unless otherwise stated. 1 Cf.

Lekanai or Tubs These large vessels are of two kinds: 1, a tub with two horizontal handles; 2, much larger than 1, a tub with two vertical handles between which is a trough spout with a small hole just above the base. Both forms have a thickened rim and are in coarse, gritty, pink to buff pithos fabric with a buff slip and dark trickle decoration which was always painted on when the tub was upside down. The function of type 1 is uncertain. There are no accompanying lids so permanent storage seems ruled out, but they may have been used for short-term storage of food like bread or olives or fruit. The absence of spouts, in contrast to type 2, suggests that these tubs may not have been used for liquids. Very possibly they were for preparing drier foods from cereals. P528 was used with an amphora in Room 81 . P529 was found in situ below the south end of the bench in Room 88, a room which had good evidence for use as a kitchen. This does no more than help the sug- gestion that the type 1 tubs were for food. Tubs of the second type, with trough spout flush with the base, were obviously concerned with liquids. Four were found in situ. P533 was set up on a stand with its spout over the hole with the channel in Area 8. In Room 1 7 only the base survived but it was wedged on two stones in such a way that the liquid could have flowed away through a spout; this tub was used in conjunction with the adjacent pithos, P609, but its position on the floor with little wedges shows that it was not meant to have a collecting pithos below it. P532 was on flat stones on the floor in Room 59. Its spout pointed away down the slope but there was no position for a collecting vessel below. P534, however, like P533, does seem to have been on a raised stand originally, in Room 90. Closely similar tubs have been found in Late Minoan I contexts at Gournia, Palaikastro, Vathypetro, Epano and Kato Zakro and there was one in a Hellenistic house at Praisos.1 At Gournia that in D 30 was on a raised stand over a hole just like ours in Area 8. At Kato Zakro it was also on a stand with a pithos in position below to collect liquid. At Palaikastro there were two pithoi below the tub; at Epano Zakro was the most elaborate arrangement of all. Two tubs set in a plastered stand gave into a collecting pithos, below which, set in the floor, were two more collecting jars. This system would have improved the draining off and, consequently, the purity of the liquid. The tubs have been interpreted in two different ways. Marinatos and Platon state that they were wine presses, while Miss Boyd Hawes followed Bosanquet, who argued that they were olive oil separators. When Bosanquet found the first one, at Hellenistic Praisos, he described the analogous modern process carefully. The olives are first drenched in hot water. After pressing (see below p. 255), the mixture, which contains more water than oil, is put into a separator. In the tub the oil would gradually come to the surface. The water would be drained off through the spout and a collecting pithos put in position when only oil was left. Such a usage is entirely 1 Gournia 27-8 and Fig. 11 and PL I, 14.

On the other hand grape pressing is equally plausible, the juice flowing into the collecting pithos either after fermentation if this took place in the tub, or ready for fermentation in the pithos.1 Despite the conflicting interpretations there is no reason whatever why the tubs should not have been used for both processes, since they are equally well suited to both. Wine pressing takes place in the early autumn, olive oil manufacture in late autumn and winter, so the time factor enabled the plant to be free for each operation. Furthermore two of the Myrtos tubs were in situ on the floor and so probably had some additional function such as the washing of food and/or wool. The tub in Room 59 provided a little evidence from the rémanent lipids that the contents were animal in origin (e.g., wool) and not vegetable. We may conclude therefore that these stout tubs were used for the variety of purposes dis- cussed above. The greatest interest of the Myrtos tubs is that we now know that the usage of the type is extended by over seven hundred years back into the Early Bronze Age. This is a powerful witness to the direct continuity in Minoan ceramics and industrial life and an eloquent con- firmation of Harriet Boyd Hawes' words which are quoted at the beginning of the present work.

They may just have been the pieces from some kind of game with the bird's head pieces as the leaders. Equally, however, three of the six from Pot Hole 33 were horizontally perforated which would seem to have been for tying the lid to a pot. 1 Warren, Minoan Stone Vases (1969) 68-9. H. W. and J. D. S.

PiRiFORM Jars with two Horizontal Handles These noble jars, from over 30.0 to 60.0 cm. in height, are Very typical of the Period II destruc- tion deposits, though the type began in Period I. The commonest fabric is thin orange with tiny white grits (assumed in the catalogue, unless otherwise stated). This produces vessels with walls sometimes only 4 mm. thick, though over 40 cm. in height. 1 Such manufacture is at the summit of what could be achieved with only a hand-turned potter's disk. It is not surprising that a slight unevenness of profile occurs from time to time, while P580 is badly warped. The collar necks are either cylindrical with everted rim (e.g., P579, P589), type A, or slope inwards from the base with a sharply everted rim above (e.g. P565, P580), type B. The latter type occasionally has a single small pimple of clay at the base of the collar (P565, P580) . This feature might be an indicator of particular contents (e.g., only wine or oil) in the jar, if it is not purely decorative. 1 Because the thin sherds were broken into so many pieces it took up to forty skilled man-hours to mend a dark painted jar like P565 to completion.</page><page sequence="166">142 MYRTOS Many of the jars are covered all over with dark paint (DP) or red paint (RP), P563-P579. The last four of these have a raised rib round the base of the collar. Some have a buff slip with the collar painted black and a black band round the belly and handles and another above the base. Of these P580 to P587 are in the thin orange fabric with white grits, P588 to P591 in a thicker, buff fabric with grits. Two, P592 and P593, have more varied patterns. P594 and P595 have a more dumpy form. The type with painted bands on buff is known from the EM II A phase at Vasilike.1 The difficulty of searching for joins and rebuilding may have deterred earlier excavators of EM II sites from putting dark wash examples together.

PlTHOI The fine series of forty-four pithoi in use at the time of the final destruction is of considerable interest for the history of Minoan ceramics and, with the large amphorae, for the economic life of the settlement. The Cretan coarse ware pithos appears to begin in Early Minoan I,2 perhaps replacing a smaller and rougher Middle and Late Neolithic store jar.3 It is clear now from our settlement that by EM II the pithos was one of the commonest vase types in use, a condition which was to obtain throughout the rest of the Bronze Age, and indeed to continue in village communities to the present day.4 The range of forms from the settlement gives an initial corpus for the Early Bronze Age of Crete.5 That the series is at an earlier stage of development than other major series like the MM I-LM I pithoi of Pakhyammos or the MM I- II ones from the first Palace of Phaistos6 is clear : these Middle Minoan pithoi have large and heavy moulded rims for better grip, while those of Phaistos also have several thick handles just below the rim and just above the base. By the Late Minoan period pithoi are very large and elaborately decorated with applied rope patterns. The Knossos Palace West Magazine series provides good examples. 1 Xanthoudides, Arch.Delt. 4 (1918) 144 Fig. 5,4 = Zoes, "Ερευνα PI. 25, top left. 2 Fragments of pithoi with deep scorings on the interiors occurred in the EM I well excavated by Mr Hood at Knossos in 1958, studied by the writer. 3 Evans, Ρ Μ II Fig. ßr.

Pithoi are commonly used in Cretan villages today, for storing oil (and, as a secondary use, as chimney pots or flower tubs). For modern pithoi see R. Hampe and A. Winter, Bei Töpfern und Töpferinnen in Kreta, Messenien und Zypern (1962). 5 The only other recorded EM II pithos is a 'small pitharia' with 'drip pattern* from Vasilike, EM IIB, Seager, Vasilike I 217.

Since these vessels are basically piriform one can treat them as approximately two truncated cones (small upper part, large lower part) in order to calculate their capacity. The calculation, though necessarily approximate since the shapes are not true truncated cones, should be reasonably accurate be- cause what is added in excess (a) by using external dimensions, (b) by taking as straight on the upper cone a collar which is usually concave) is compensated for by taking as straight on the lower cone the walls of the lower part which are in fact convex. The formula for the volume of a truncated cone is ^(R^H-r^h), where R is the radius of the base of the cone (i.e., half the body diameter of a pithos), //is the height of the cone, r the radius of the base of the cut-off portion of the cone (i.e., the radius of the pithos rim in the upper cone, the pithos base in the lower cone), and h is the height of the cut-off or projected top of the cone. Λ h"~ / Γ ' Η RIM &gt;j ■ ν - MAX. DIAMETER - &gt;£ ή ~ XjlJ Χ / H BASE - XjlJ Χ / _ '/ h V fig. 37 Pithos represented diagrammatically as two truncated cones, with cut-off or projected portion of the cones shown in dotted lines. Of the forty-four pithoi in use as pithoi (that in Area 75 had some other function) twenty-six have their full dimensions preserved for a calculation of capacity as set out above (height, diameter of rim, body and base, and depth of the greatest diameter below the rim, this last giving the cone base). The average dimensions of twenty-five of these come to: Ht. 66.4, diam. rim 34.1, body 53.0, base 24.9, height of greatest diameter (body) below rim 26.8. By the use of the formula given above (and adding together the volumes of the two truncated cones) this produces an average volume of 89 litres (89,050 cu. cm.). The remaining pithos (P630) can be taken as a single truncated cone, volume 134 litres. It is the third largest of these vessels. With an average volume of 89 litres per pithos multiplied by forty-three pithoi we get 3827 litres; add 134 litres for P630 (the only instance ofthat form) and we get a minimum storage capacity in pithoi in the settlement of 3961 litres. Since fragments of pithoi occurred in almost all excavated levels the actual capacity was</page><page sequence="169">THE POTTERY I45 probably a good deal greater. It is of interest to note that the largest pithos (P599, much larger than any other found) had an approximate capacity of 332 litres, and the second largest, P616, 148 litres.i The capacities of the other class of large storage vessels, the amphoras, may be added to that of the pithos. Twenty-eight amphorae were in use at the time of destruction (p. 109). Since fragments were not uncommon in the excavated levels the total number, as with pithoi, was probably a good deal higher. Of the twenty-eight, all but one (P98) are canonical in shape and can be treated as two truncated cones for an approximate estimate of capacity. Thirteen of the twenty-eight have full measurements preserved, giving the following averages: Ht. 75.6; Diam. rim 36.8, body 56.7, base 24.0, depth of greatest diameter (body) below the rim 29.3. The range of measurements among amphorae is much smaller than with pithoi; for height it is 63.0-86.8, most falling between 70 and 80; for rim diameters 30.5 to 43.0, most between 34 and 40; for body diameters 51.3 to 65.0, most between 53 and 63; for base diameters 21.3 to 37.6, many between 29 and 33. The average metric capacity of an amphora is 1 14 litres, a good deal more than the average pithos since the amphorae are larger vessels. Twenty-seven multiplied by 114 litres gives 3078 litres. To this 80 litres, the capacity of the odd amphora, P98, must be added, giving 3164 litres. Thus the storage capacity of pithoi and amphorae combined is 7125 litres. This is a minimum figure, the actual capacity of the settlement at the day of its destruction being probably a good deal higher, as noted above. But the minimum figure of 7125 litres is of much interest. Since the only likely contents of the vessels are oil, stored olives, wine and cereals, and wine, being unsealed, was unlikely to keep for long, we may infer a quite considerable storage capacity for oil, olives and cereals. This confirms the material evidence (Appendices III and V) that the community had achieved a flourishing agricultural production in these foodstuffs. If one allowed a third of the storage capacity to oil (which is probably ungenerous) that would give a minimum of 2375 kilogrammes. A single olive tree today produces 5-10 kilogrammes with a reasonable to good crop.2 If this were the case in EM II we should have 237.5 to 475 trees, to be multiplied by two, since olives are usually biennial crop producers.3 Thus 475 to 950 trees. But it is unlikely that EM II trees were good enough to produce such modern bumper crops, so that the total number of trees under cultivation was probably much above 950. This high and interesting figure receives some confirmation from the fact that 85% of all the wood charcoals identified are olive (Appendix III). Let us assume about a thousand trees. Now of 43 communi- ties sampled in Crete in 1948 the great majority reported 10 to 20 olive trees per stremma (1000 sq. metres, 0.2471 acres).4 Since the soil requirements of Early Minoan olive trees are 1 The pithos in the Classical period had a capacity of 311 .43 litres or 6 medimnoi, M. Lang, A New Inscription from Thasos, BCH 76 (1952) 18-31, especially 21-2. Since Professor Lang was publishing an inscription, not an actual pithos, she used Hero's formula for calculating the (Max. diam + min. diam)2 capacity, 11/14X χ depth. See F. Hultsch, Metrologicorum Scriptorum Reliquiae 202 sqq. For the Myrtos pithoi it seemed to me advisable to work from the known shapes treated as approximately two truncated cones. After calculating the figures I noted that a pithos from Olynthus of similar dimensions (Ht. 110.0 cm., Diam. rim 55.0 (internal 41.0), body 80.0) to our largest (P599) was estimated to have a capacity of 340 litres, D. M. Robinson, Excavations at Olynthus VIII 313 (quoted in Lang, op. cit., 28 η. ι). This figure agrees well with our 332 litres for P599. 2 Economic and Social Atlas oj Greece (Athens, 1904) text to Map 316. 79,000,000 trees in 1961 produced about 200,000 tons (1 ton = 1000 kilos). But only half these trees would have had a crop (see next note) , hence an average of about 5 kilos of oil per tree. An olive owner from Samos informs me that 10 kilos of oil would be a very good crop from one tree (from about 30 kilos of olives). In Crete just after World War II, in 1947, 91% of Cretan farms produced from 1.28 to 7.68 kilos per tree (L. G. Allbaugh, Crete. A Case Study of an Underdeveloped Area (Princeton, 1953) 547 Table A 89). 3 Atlas, loc. cit. But the fact is common knowledge in Greek villages. 4 Allbaugh, op. cit., 545-6, Table A 88.</page><page sequence="170">I46 MYRTOS likely to have been similar to those of modern olives, our figures suggest that at least 50 to 100 stremmata (about 12 to 25 acres) were under cultivation by the settlement for olives alone. The fabric of the pithoi is fairly hard and coarse, with many dark, purplish and sometimes also white grits. It fires from grey to pink or buff. There is always a buff slip and dark painted trickle decoration, applied when the vase was upright or inverted. There are normally three vertical handles, circular or thick strap in section, placed on the belly at about the point of greatest diameter. This contrasts with the six-handle system on the amphorae. Occasionally other handle systems are used on the pithoi and, if so, are noted in the catalogue. Thirty-one out of forty-five have sufficient base preserved for the presence or absence of a small hole just above the base to be observed. Fourteen have a hole, seventeen do not (all eight of type 1 which are sufficiently preserved lack a hole) (cf. Amphorae, p. 109). Those with holes must have been for liquids, but at least one of those without a hole was for liquids also since P605 contained the remains of pressed grapes, probably wine lees. For the possibility that Room 53 was a store for liquids and 54 for grain see p. 4gf. Division into five groups is most suitably done on the basis of collar or neck and applied band of thumb-impressed decoration. The classification consists of deep collars (1), smaller collars (2), very small collars or rims (3), wide mouth and no distinct collar (4), and one other wide- mouthed example of truncated conical shape (5).

Fig. 84. Spouted Jars Spouted jars all have some kind of spout projecting from the shoulder, or, in one or two cases, from just below the rim. They were clearly vessels for pouring liquids and usually have a handle on the shoulder opposite the spout or two horizontal handles at right angles to the spout. The spouts have various forms and these are the basis of the classification. Vasilike ware (VW) is much the most popular, the remainder being in pseudo- Vasilike ware, red burnished ware, or having a dark painted surface. Type 1 has a horizontal or up-turned open spout joined to the shoulder by a short tubular section. There is a vertical handle opposite the spout. (iA) Long spout; piriformjar with small raised collar and pedestal foot (VW unless otherwise stated) These vases, richly represented in the settlement, are the well-known EM II Vasilike ware teapot, one of the hallmarks of the period.1 P648 Two pieces missing, including handle.

The ring seems too large in diameter and unhelpfully crescentic in shape to have been a ring stand for a vase. In any case all vases have flat bases. Its finding in Room 89, the Room of the Hearth and Skull, may mean some special, possibly ritual function, but this can in no way be proved. A practical, domestic function, however, does seem un- likely. P700 Fragment of a shallow vase and decorated with plastic figures on the rim and interior. This interpretation is certain in view of the raised bases on the rim and base, though all the figures are broken off. The original must have been similar to two famous cult vases, MM I(?), from the Kamilari circular tomb.2 It is of interest therefore that the type is now dated back to EM II, with a domestic as well as a funerary context.

The function of the bowl was for a ball of wool to be kept clean within it and for the line of wool to be led up from the hole under the handle. The handle acted to steady the ball and prevent it from slipping out, by providing tension when wool was drawn from the bowl. Similar spinning bowls are known from Egypt and Palestine.2 In Egypt they occur from the Xllth Dynasty onwards, in Palestine from the Late Bronze Age onwards. Two handles are usual, but examples with one are found.3 Xllth Dynasty tomb paintings demonstrate their function and usage.4 Among Dothan's conclusions we find5 'the varying number of threads (one, two, three) drawn from the bowls in the wall paintings and models indicates the number of handles within the bowls'.6 A bowl with one interior handle from the MM I tomb at Dhrakones in the Mesara may now be interpreted as a spinning bowl.7 P702 Strainer.

Because of the shape, with tall, thin neck and long, stringy arms, and because of the pouring arrangements a purely practical function for the vase can be ruled out. It was probably a representation of a female divinity who was here concerned with liquids. The find context in Room 92 strongly supports the divine interpretation. Since it is a female figure, plausibly in a domestic shrine, we may reasonably infer that it is the earliest instance of the Minoan Household Goddess, whose history is thus taken back firmly into the third millennium. This is particularly important evidence for continuity in Minoan religion from the Early Bronze Age onwards (see further p. 265^). Shrine 92. P259. /ZJV8 February 1969, 26 Fig. 1. Arch.

OTHER FINDS Finds other than pottery are classified by types, alphabetically. For cereal, faunal and other food remains, obsidian, plasters, plaster impressions, shells and wood charcoals the reader is referred to the relevant Appendices. All measurement are in centimetres, Ht. = height, L. = length, W. = width, Th. = thick- ness.

PERIOD I Figurines The plastic arts reached no high peaks at Fournou Korifi. There are few animal and anthro- pomorphic figurines, the latter exhibiting a certain perkiness, nothing more. Two little clay figures came from the South-East Pits 61-62 and are securely dated to Period I. Two others are from surface levels (2 from the surface east of Pit 61) but are so similar in style to those from the Pits that they also are very possibly of Period I date. 1 has a flat cap or hair curled jauntily on the back of the head like 3 and 2 is very similar to 1 (Fig. 95. PI. 71 C, D). 4, from Pit 62, is also of clay but the arms are only short projecting stumps. 1 and 3 have traces of their red slip surviving; 4 had a brown slip. No trace survives on 2 but it was also probably red. There are no indications of sex. The function of the figures is not known. Pits 61-62 provided no evi- dence of being votive, in fact part of 61 may have been road packing (p. 57). A little clay figure from Palaikastro is comparable and came from an EM II level below Block Chi at that site.1 One from the Trapeza Cave may be dated to EM II with confidence. It closely resembles our 1, though it is seated on a little chair.2 5 is problematical. The distinct orange-brown fabric with white grits dates it to Period I (see p. 95), though it is from a surface level. It may or may not be a rough figurine head. In favour of the suggestion is the spade shape (PI. 72 A, C) and backward tilt in profile (PL 72B), both of which are characteristic of Cycladic marble heads.* The piece is only slightly worn at the 'top' and can hardly therefore have been any kind of handle. The widening shape also precludes its being a tripod foot. It is, however, possible that it is part of some vessel not otherwise known. 6 is the only stone figurine from a Period I context. It is schematic in form and carefully made. 1 Clay, orange/buff, pure. Red slip (traces only). Ht. 4.7. Surface over Rooms 37-40. 9. Fig. 95. PI. 71C, left; 71D, left.

Both are of the flat oval type. 7 is the finest of its type from the site; it has three holes for the attachment of the warp threads and, like a few others, a groove along the top edge. This groove must indicate that a horizontal bar or rod, probably a cane, ran along the top of the weights to keep all the warp threads level and prevent individual groups of threads from swinging to and fro. With one such bar the warp threads would have remained undivided and the shuttle would have been literally woven through them. But there could easily have been two such bars, so that half the warp threads could have been brought forward with the bar, the other half remaining and hanging vertically with their own bar, and the shuttle being rapidly thrown through the open division between the threads. The bar would then be released and the shuttle woven through on its return journey since the second bar could not be drawn forward (to create the open division again) as the first bar was in the way. The fact that not all the flat oval weights have a groove on the top edge shows that not all weights were attached to the bar. Possibly it was just the ones at each end or selvedge of the warp. The presence of the bar implies that the warp-weighted loom is a stage on the way towards the more efficient upright loom with warp fixed at both ends, as for example on Greek upright carpet looms today. Attachment of the warp at the bottom as well as the top produces a more taut warp and a tighter weave. Perforated loomweights, roughly domed or cuboid in shape, are known already in Neolithic Knossos.1 A flat oval type like ours came from an EM II context at Palaikastro. It had a seal impression on it.2 Late Minoan examples with groove are exemplified by some from Tylissos.3 7 Clay, buff, with grits. Buff slip; red paint all over. Flat oval type. Three holes.

The dagger (or knife) was in good condition when found and would seem to have been accidentally lost or dropped by its owner. An indication of the value of metal goods in the settlement is provided by the rivet holes. The object had been re-riveted twice. Originally there were three rivet holes in an arc across the heel; these broke and two new ones were inserted a little further down. One of these proved unsatisfactory so another was added just beside it.1 The dagger has no exact shape parallel but comes clearly in Branigan's long daggers type II.2 Four EM examples are fairly close.3 For the electron microprobe analysis see Appendix IX. The deliberate use of about 3% of lead is of great interest. Although, as Branigan has shown,4 EM copper objects with lead seem to have arsenic alloyed also, this is not the case with our dagger, where arsenic is absent. The presence of a small amount of tin along with the lead makes the composition comparable with Cycladic artefacts from the East Aegean,5 but the presence of nickel also is a positive indicator that the object was made in Crete and not elsewhere.«* The nearest supplies of lead ore (galena) to Myrtos are in the Asterousia mountains above the Mesara.7 This is also the main region of copper ore sources.8 It is very possible that our dagger came from the Mesara, perhaps from the Lebena region where most of the metals used occur. The amount of lead is notable. There is more than in any of the copper objects detailed by Renfrew from the Cyclades9 and more than in any of the EM-MM I copper objects analysed by Junghans and colleagues.10 It shows clearly that by early EM II the Cretan metallugists were competent in producing lead alloys. 9 Dagger or knife.

Potter's Turn-tables Eight clay disks found on the floor of Room 49 were in all probability potter's turn-tables.11 They are flat on one face, convex on the other, and the centre of the convex face has usually been rubbed away with turning (Pis. 75B, left; 76B-C). Sometimes there is a slight groove round the edge of the disk (Fig. 98. 15), which suggests that a cord might have been used to help the turning. None of the disks has any kind of hole in either face to indicate the use of a spindle, and thus a freely rotating (fast wheel) disk. 1 An EM dagger from A. Triadha has three rivet rebores.

They might be thought of as plates ; but they are surely too thick and heavy for this and the site produced an abundance of shallow, open bowls in pottery. Plate moulds may be ruled out since the disks are far too shallow to have been moulds for any of the surviving open bowls ; the latter are in any case normal, hand-turned pots. Lids or covers are possible, but the absence of handles, absence of any suitable vessels to receive them in Room 49, and finally the convex surface, inexplicable if lids, exclude this interpretation. The convex surface makes a primary use as potstands improbable though some were re-used as stands in Period II along with re-used pithos or lekane bases. One re-used disk in Period II had a spindle hollow, quite inexplicable if the disk had been made as a potstand. Most of the disks have a painted cross on one or both faces and sometimes a band round the edge of the flat face. This decoration also appears on fragmentary examples. Diameters of those in Room 49 range from 17.3 to 25.8. There are no other recorded potter's turn-tables of Early Minoan date, though Xanthoudides and Franchet had inferred the use of a simple wheel for hand-turned EM pottery as long ago as 191 8.1 Our disks are entirely suitable for the pottery of the settlement, which is all hand-made, i.e., hand-turned on disks with the potter himself supplying the energy. They are of much interest for the history of ceramic technology since technically they stand, in their simple form, at the beginning of the potter's wheel tradition.2 The next well-dated disks in the Aegean are a Middle Minoan I example from Mallia^ and an approximately contemporary and possibly Minoan one from Middle Helladic Aigina.4 But both these have hollows in one face for attach- ment of the disk to a shaft or spindle for quick rotation, as is the case with the subsequent MM III-LM I potter's wheels. s The fabric is coarse, orange/buff with buff slip (pithos fabric), unless otherwise stated. 10 Red band round edge of flat face, thick cross with a blob in each quadrant on convex face.

Spindle Whorls Four clay spindle whorls and a probable one in stone came from Period I contexts. It is of interest that three of the clay ones are in the orange/brown cooking pot fabric with distinct white grits, used for pots only in this first Period. Clay spindle whorls are known already in the Cretan Neolithic.1 The biconical shape was the most popular, while at Myrtos a much greater variety is found. These five are of different shape and correspond to the Period II groups 1, 2, 4, 3 and 7 respectively (p. 228f.). 26 Cylindrical, slightly raised round each end of the hole. Clay buff, pure.

The spindle holes are from 0.6 to 0.8 in diameter. Stone Tools Four pounders are from Period I levels. They were probably used with the querns, for grinding, rubbing and pounding. There are two elongated quern rubbers, from Room 26, like those of Stone Tools type 5 (a) under Period II (p. 234) and one rubber or polisher of serpentine like those of Stone Tools type 5(b) in Period II. 30 Roughly spherical with 6 or 7 faces smoothed from use as rubber, two ends rough from pounding and hammering.

Stone Weights Stones with a biconical perforation (finished or unfinished) were common on the site. The perforation is carefully made and centrally placed; its shape in section varies from convex to strongly biconical (Figs. 104-5). The surface round the rim of the hole on each face is usually pitted (PL 79D, top centre, top right), which shows how the stone was struck to start the open- ing of the hole. After that the hole was ground out, probably with abrasive sand since the sides of the hole are quite unpitted. Drills were not used at all. The stones themselves are beach or river pebbles, flattish in section and roughly circular or oval seen from above. Fine-grained limestones of varying colours are used. Examples are known from other Minoan sites.1 The specific purpose can only be conjectured. The choice of smooth, regular pebbles and the carefully made holes suggest some kind of weight. The biconical holes would make the stones quite unsuitable for hafting as weapons or tools. Loomweights are certainly possible, though clay ones with quite different systems of holes were available. Moreover, the distribution of the weights from Period II and mixed contexts, random over the whole settlement, not con- centrated in particular areas (p. 237) seems slightly against loomweights. Fishermen's weights to keep their nets down in the water are also possible, although the site provided no other evidence for extensive fishing. My own suggestion is that they were weights for tying to cloth in order to hold it down when drying after washing or dyeing. Similar perforated weights were a noticeable feature of the assemblage in the Hellenistic dye-works on the Rachi at Isthmia near Corinth.2 1 Gournia PI. Ill, 41. BSA 59 (1964) 98 and PL 17h, right.

Nine are of Period I date and seven from surface or mixed levels. Two points are notable : all the counters are re-used pieces of clay vessels, cut into triangular shape, sometimes with neat bevelled edges ; secondly, in nearly all cases the original vases were Period I fine grey burnished or hatched dark on light painted ware. Sherds from broken vases were deliberately chosen to show hatched or other painted patterns or incised and pointillé decoration from fine grey ware. Many counters show a slight curvature and the original vases will have been jugs and fine grey pyxides. They have been called counters purely for want of a better name. We have no evidence for their use. One may speculate that they were for some kind of game. Not all are bevelled, so they were presumably not for inlay. The occurrence of nine in Period I contexts and only two in Period II is suggestive of pre- ference for them in the earlier phase. But the re-use of these two particular wares is a neat con- firmation of the evidence of the whole vases for the decorative types in use in Period I. GB is fine grey burnished ware.

Door Sockets Seventeen stones were recorded with a roughly circular depression, the latter often strongly marked with circular striations caused by something turning in it. Some, possibly all, of these stones were door sockets or pivots to support an upright wooden pole which turned as part of the door. The clearest instance was at the main South East Entrance 64, where the stone lay in situ to the left of the door sill as one went out (PI. 19A) . Its depression showed marks of burning left by the post. Another stone was near the doorway from Room 77 into 76 and two more, in this case probably re-used perforated weights, were in situ one on top of the other, to the left of the doorway as one went out of Room 78. Another seemed to be in position in the north-east corner of Cell 86, though it is not easy to see how there could have been a door there. The remainder were from surface levels, the fill of rooms or occasionally (Rooms 79 and 82) on or very near the floor but not near doorways. These cannot therefore be proved door sockets by context but this was their most probable function ; since we know of two or three undoubted door sockets there were in all probability many more. Other possible functions are mortars, for which the depressions are far too small, and spindle stands. Some may have served this latter purpose (see p. 228 for spindle stands). The roughly circular depressions normally have a diameter of 7-9 cm. (the range is from 3.0 to 10.0) which indicates a wooden pole of about that diameter.</page><page sequence="243">OTHER FINDS 219 Village houses in Crete are said still to use a stone door socket (see p. 57, n. 2, Entrance 64). 61 Calcareous sandstone, fine grained, greenish grey.

(2) Spherical or cylindrical Of the 19 spherical or depressed spherical/cylindrical loomweights no less than 10 are from Room 58 or near by and reasonably associated with the same group. It was suggested (p. 53) that a loom stood in 58 or, more probably, on the roof above or on the platform at the south end of 57, from which the weights would have rolled into 58. Three other weights are part of the spinning and weaving equipment at the south end of Room 74 and Area 73. Again there was probably a loom here. Six of the weights were complete enough to be weighed (see below 82, 83, 85-88). 83 from Room 58 and 82 from the adjacent fill in 56 are 690 and 669 g. respectively, a good deal heavier than the others, except 88. This would suggest that the loom associated with Room 58 was for weaving a heavier, stronger material than that associated with Area 73. Two weights from here, 87 and 86 were 507 g. and 332 g.

Metal Artefact The only metal object from the final destruction deposits was the little chisel from Room 91. This dearth of metalwork almost certainly does not mean that so little was used in the settle- ment. Metal objects would have been efficient and valuable (cf. the re-riveted dagger, 9) and would have been taken away by the inhabitants or later rummagers in the ruins. The chisel was perfectly complete and could not be analysed. In shape it is pointed at one end, flat-bladed, with slightly outcurving blade, at the other, and square in section. A chisel from Koumasa is similar but is round in section.1 Tools of similar size, square in section, and with one pointed end but no blade at the other come from Koumasa, the Kyparissi Cave, Plátanos and Pyrgos.2 Similar awls, pointed at both ends, were very common in the Early Cycladic tombs of Syros.3 The contemporary metalsmiths of the EM and EC sites very probably had knowledge of each other's work. The closest parallels to our chisel in fact come from Naxos,4 Syros5 and from Troy.6 There was no evidence in our settlement for metalworking and the chisel may well have been imported from the Mesara or the Cyclades. 102 Chisel.

Pot Stands As was to be expected on a site with uneven earth or rocky floors, stands of clay and stone were frequently used to support large vases, amphorae, piriform jars and pithoi. The stands were either natural slabs, as along the south wall of Room 80 or in 91, or circular. The latter are either carefully worked stones or re-used pithos or lekane bases or potter's turn-tables. The manufactured stands are catalogued here. The main groups of these were in Room 1 7 (along with natural slab stands) (Fig. 98. PI. 12A), Area 26 and the south end of Shrine 92. For quernstones used as stands see Area 8, Room 51 and Room 59 (Chapter III). 109 and 1 Branigan, Copper and Bronze Working in Early Bronze Age Crete (Studies in Mediterranean Archaeology 'XIX (1968)) 32, 90 and Fig. 8, 7. 2 Branigan, op. cit. 32, 90-1 and Fig. 9, 3.

It became badly worn on this face (PL 76B) and so was discarded as a turn-table and re-used as a base. In the centre of the underside is a small circular depression (diam. 2.0-2.2, depth 0.8) which serves no pur- pose on the base and was clearly for attachment of the disk to some kind of spindle, to enable it to revolve freely. No other potter's turn-table has a spindle hole. The presence of one on 105 shows, however, that the spindle principle was already known before the destruction of Myrtos, producing a sort of proto-true-wheel.1 105 illustrates therefore just that stage in the history of ceramic technology between hand-turned disks and true 'fast' wheels.2 106 Re-used lekane base.

Three others, 105, no-iii, had become too worn on the convex face and were suitably put to use as pot stands. In addition fragments of eight others were recorded from surface or mixed levels or Period II fill. For discussion see above, p. 2i3f, and on 105, 110-111. The fact that these stands were origin- ally turn-tables is clear not only from their shape but also from the remaining traces of painted decoration; this is the same as on the Period I turn-tables. The clay is coarse, pithos fabric save for 119. 117 Flat on one face, convex on the other and much worn in centre from turning.

A turn-table from the Period II destruction in East-West Way 67 was probably a re-used Period I disk closely similar to those from the adjacent Period I Room 49. See 13 and Fig. 98. Querns The number of quernstones scattered over the surface was one of the most noticeable features when the site was first visited. A total of 164 was recorded from the excavations, of which 4 came from clear Period I contexts. Many others without clear context could of course belong to the first phase also. Querns were commonly built into walls, although they were not too worn out for further use. The reason for this lavishness is that most were made of the fine-grained, greenish grey calcareous sandstone so plentifully available on the stratified slopes and in the ο ο I 1 A ß fig. 93 a Saddle Quern, β Flat, circular quern. Scale 1:10.</page><page sequence="249">OTHER FINDS 225 vicinity of the site hill itself. Sometimes the stone is reddish in colour, probably from the effects of fire which had so coloured most of the wall stones of the southern area. By far the commonest form is the saddle quern, a roughly oval or rectangular stone with rounded ends, seen from above (Fig. 93 A). There were 146 of these. 12 were roughly circular (Fig. 93B), 4 triangular, 1 rectangular and 1 semicircular, as seen from above. The working surface of the main type was either worn down from use into trough or saddle or still flat, indicating relatively little use. The hollow was created by the tool used with the quern, a long stone rubber (see Stone Tools, rubbers type 5 (a)). The circular type always had a flat working surface. Sometimes the main and the circular type had both surfaces worn flat from use. PL 76D illustrates both forms (mainly saddles), with rubbers in the foreground. This small selection is from Areas and Rooms 8-10 and 19-22 on the northern part of the site. The main type ranges from 21.0 to 44.0 in length, from 12.5 to 30.0 in width and is from 3.0 to 12.0 thick. 68.5% have a length within the range 25.0 to 35.0. A quern from Areas 68-69, fill, is the largest. It measures: L. 44.0, W. 28.3, Th. 6.6. The proportions are typical. The circular querns are around 25.0 in diameter. 1 The main use of the querns must have been for grinding grain. The worked surfaces are always regularly rubbed, not dented or pitted from any kind of hammering. Cereals must have formed a major part of the diet if one judges by the number of querns. Other substances such as dye stuffs or food other than grain could have been prepared on them. Additional uses were as building stones for walls,2 supports or stands for large vases as in Area 8 and Room 59, and as seats. We may conjecture the last usage with confidence. The inhabitants must have sat down occasionally and a hollowed quern would have formed an excellent seat in preference to the rocky ground. The excavators took little time to discover this. Distribution was random over the settlement, both in surface and room deposit levels. Querns came from the following specific find places (total number in brackets), surface levels excluded: North Building 1(1). North Rubbish Area 2 (6). North Rubbish Area 3 (3). Wall between Rooms 6 and 7 (1). Area 8 (2). Room 10 (3). Room 18 (1). Room 19 (5). Room 20 (3). Area 21 (2). Room 22 (3). Room 23 (1). Room 27 (Period II floor) (2). Below Room 28 (Period I) (1).

Thus the querns were not confined to the rooms or areas with functions distinct from those of other rooms or areas, with one possible exception. The group of rooms 19-22 produced thirteen querns. Since these rooms were for storage, with several pithoi and other large vases, it may be that the fairly high concentration of querns implies grinding of grain here for storing in some of the adjacent vessels. Querns tones have not been loved by Cretan archaeologists. Although they must occur on all sites the Knossos Neolithic series is the only one treated in publication. There the querns are of several types.3 The saddle-quern occurred4 but was less common than a rectangular slab with a long, oval hollow in the upper surface. 1 Full measurements of all querns are recorded in the author's general excavation notebook, deposited with all the excavation books and papers in the British School at Athens. 2 Gf.

The assemblage is a modest one, but important for three reasons. Chronology: the seals are clearly datable to Early Minoan II, to which period only a very few others, out of the hundreds in existence, can be dated by their find context. Secondly, they show seals not only being made but also in use in daily life, whereas the majority which have an archaeological con- text are from tombs. Thirdly, the group, with one exception, consists of stone stamp seals; they demonstrate the popularity of the type of an east Cretan site, in contrast to the ivory cylinders of the Mesara.1 The stones used are good evidence for exploitation of local sources. Steatite (soapstone, talc) occurs in the Sarakina valley running north from beside the modern village of Myrtos up to Malles.2 Serpentine similar to 127 is found on a coastal hill near Tertsa, 5 kilometres west of Myrtos village. The pretty amygdaloid basalt of 129 is common as a beach pebble along the Myrtos coast. Banded calcite must have been easily available in any water-affected deposit in the limestones. On the four finished seals the decoration is simple (PI. 77B). 131 has square hatching, 128 and 130 unorganized scratches producing rough hatching. Only 127 is of greater interest. The face has been engraved, probably with a sharp obsidian flake or blade, with simple marks. These may be purely decorative or may just be deliberate marks with some intended value. The seal would then belong to Evans5 Primitive Linear class3 and be an example of a first deliberate step which eventually produced proper writing. The Primitive Linear group in fact has a slight east Cretan bias, all the more noticeable since so few EM seals come from the eastern part of the island in comparison with the numbers from the Mesara tombs. The clay sealing is of much interest. It documents a practice in Crete contemporary with the sealings from the EH II House of the Tiles and other buildings at Lerna4 although our single piece is but a poor offering in comparison with the rich harvest from the mainland site. None the less the practice of sealing clay with impressions can now be seen to extend back into the Early Minoan period and is a forerunner of the similar practice at Phaistos in MM II. Our sealing lay by the doorway into Room 29 and it may have been a door sealing for that room. Its curved, applied surface (Fig. 97) could as easily have fitted a post or knob as a store jar, and there were in fact no storage vessels in this part of the site. 127 Stamp seal.

On the spindle is a little section of reed, on to which the wool is wound. The winding is done by turning the spindle with the right hand in a stone with a hole (το θρομύλι), the left hand leading the wool across from the ανέμη. 141 Limestone, grey-reddish, fine-grained. 11.3x15.9.

Stone Libation Tables A group of stones from the settlement is distinctly marked with a ring of small, shallow depres- sions round the edge of one main face. Four of the stones are flat slabs, the other two are thicker. The number of little holes ranges from 12 to 29. They are made by human hand and several have percussion marks in the hollow. The stone with 29 hollows also has the centre of the main face hollowed out into a bowl. Three have no proper context, being surface finds. Of the three others two were paving stones in situ on floors, the third was built into a wall. The function or functions cannot be demonstrated with certainty. 166 may have been re-used in the wall. We must look first at examples from other sites. One is found in the EM II paved West Court at Vasilike (personal observation). Several such are known from EM III/MM I to LM I, especially at Mallia. That from the EM III-MM I construction below and to the east of the Chrysolakkos building provided no clear indication of function. But it contained a central hollow as well as 31 little holes.1 Another came from Chrysolakkos itself and was certainly a funerary cult object. It had a central bowl and two rings of little hollows.2 A plaster offerings table with bowl and little hollows came from the same building. The Mallia palace produced an LM I example with a central depression and a ring of 40 shallow holes.3 A stone of the same date came from the palace of Phaistos. It has a central bowl and 14 smaller depressions.4 Evans did not favour a religious interpretation for the Mallia stones but thought they were a kind of gaming table.5 Banti6 considered the example from Phaistos to have no cult significance since it was an object in a corner by a pithos without any apparent ritual associations. Nilsson, however, following the Mallia excavator Chapouthier, argued that they were cult objects, 1 Demargne, Ét.Crét. 7 (1945) 4 1 and PL 57, 2. 2 Demargne, op. cit., 33 and PI. 48. 3 Ghapouthier, Demargne and Dessenne, Ét.Crét. 12 (1962) 31-2 and PL 30, 2-3. 4 Fermer and iJanti, l1 estos 11 20b tig. 128, trom Room tftf, on the floor in the north-east corner. 5 Evans, Ρ Μ III 390-6.

On the evidence of this object and the two in stone and plaster from Chrysolakkos I think Nilsson was correct in his interpretation of the whole group. The context of the two from Chrysolakkos and the elaboration and prominent position ofthat in the Mallia palace are posi- tive indications which the contexts of the other stones do nothing to disprove. Our stone 169 may then be interpreted as a libation table but for the other five the question is open. Two points need to be noted : firstly, all five lack the central bowl, as does the Vasilike paving stone. This perhaps weakens the case for offerings tables slightly. At any rate no great amount of liquid could have been offered. Secondly, two of the three in situ at Myrtos were floor paving slabs, again like Vasilike, and it is not easy to see them as tables of offering. 168 and 170 were not in situ but look very much as if they too were floor slabs. All four would, on the other hand, have been very suitable for pavement games. We are in the dark. It may be that there was more than one function for these objects. Those with central bowls, including 169 from Myrtos, would seem to have been offering tables. Thus the type is now known already in the Early Minoan period and was used continuously from then onwards. The four Myrtos slabs (without bowl), however, could as easily have been for games (prototype bagatelle or solitaire) as for religion with little offerings in each hollow.3 165 Calcareous sandstone, greenish grey, fine-grained.

Whatever may have been the extent of the usage of metal objects there is no doubt 1 The Minoan- Mycenaean Religion1 (iq^o) 106-7, 120,-qo. 2 ChapouthierandJoly,J&amp;.Crétf.4(i936) i6ff.and Pls.4-6, 27. 3 Since 165 and 167 were paving slabs the possibility that the two similar slabs without context, 168 and 170, were set upright for some kind of eye cult may be ruled out. Another possible interpretation for the whole group, put to me by Mr Philip Cambridge, is that of anvils for cracking open shellfish; similar stones were found by him on a shell midden site in Aden. But in the case of Myrtos, the ring of many small hollows carefully placed all round the edge of the stone seems unnecessarily elaborate if the stones were intended for culinary usage.</page><page sequence="256">232 MYRTOS that stone tools played a major role. Querns (p. 224), stone weights (p. 237) and obsidian (Appendix VIII) are discussed separately, but there were at least six other types of implement in use. The stones themselves are mostly local limestone, serpentine or altered igneous pebbles selected from the beach or stream beds like those north of the site (cf. Appendix I, p. 273). Chlorite and diorite pebbles were also chosen occasionally. The different materials were care- fully picked out for their intended function : fine-grained, slightly abrasive limestone for quern rubbers; smooth serpentine pebbles for rubbing or polishing without damaging a surface (e.g., cloth or pottery) ; hard, metamorphic (altered basic igneous) stones for pounders and hammer stones. It is probable that contemporary settlements relied heavily on a varied stone tool kit. The detailed evidence from our site (134 recorded tools from Periods I and II) is probably repre- sentative of the Early Minoan period. Pounders, like querns tones, are not the most favoured finds of investigators in the Bronze Age. (1) Axe Only one stone axe was found. In view of the number of other stone tools it is reasonable to con- clude that axes were almost unknown at Myrtos. Such tools are, however, known on other EM sites1 and are plentiful in the Neolithic of Crete.2 There appears to be no evolution of shapes. We do not know if the EM examples are survivals from the Neolithic or were made in the EM period. 171 Chlorite or greenstone. Butt end broken off. Surface weathered but blade still sharp.

The site produced no evidence for manufacture and the pieces were probably imports. 210 is closely paralleled in shape and material at Mochlos and almost certainly came from there or one of the other north Cretan sites in that region. The scarcity of stone vessels in Early Minoan settlements is interesting, only a few pieces being known from Knossos, Mochlos and Phaistos and others mentioned (but not now known) from the EM III remains at Vasilike.2 Clearly they were made almost exclusively for use in tombs. 208 Serpentine, brownish grey with dense network of blue/black veins.3 Body fragment of 1 I owe this latter suggestion to the excavator of the object, Mr Nigel Wilson. There does not, however, appear to be any evidence that pots at Myrtos were made by the paddle and anvil method. Interiors consistently suggest that the pots were built up in strips. z Warren, Minoan Stone Vases (1969) 182-3.

They occur in considerable numbers, finished and unfinished, from Period II and mixed contexts. Calcareous sandstone or different varieties of limestone are the stones used. The distribution is fairly uniform over the whole settlement. This suggests the stones were not (or at least not primarily) loomweights; these one would expect to find in more concentrated groups, as is in fact the case with the clay weights in Room 58 and Area 73 with 74 south end deposit. But the few in stone of type 2 from these areas were presumably loomweights. (1) Perforation finished. Biconical, with hole in centre of weight (40 examples) The illustrated examples, Figs. 104-5, a show the perforation at its largest, a complete cylindrical hole, down to its smallest, where the biconical hollows have only just been pierced with a small hole. The method of manufacture is as in Period I : the hole is begun by chipping out a circle, probably with obsidian tools ; the conical hollow is then ground out with a borer and abrasive powder (sand) . 211 Limestone, fairly hard, dark grey.

Some of the holes look very rough and are probably natural (19 examples) The one from Passage 65 has two holes, like some clay loomweights; this was probably its function, like the examples from Room 58 and Area 73. The position of the hole, often near the edge, shows that these stones were meant to hang, but there is no way of proving that they were loomweights, other than those from the weaving places just cited. 217 Calcareous sandstone, greenish grey. 6.8x7.6.

ECONOMY AND SOCIETY One measure of the success of an excavation in a settlement is the extent to which the evidence recovered enables one to illuminate some major questions: what was the economic basis of life? What were the material achievements and industries of the inhabitants and how far do these give knowledge of other aspects of life, such as art and religion ? What can be said about the social organization ? Were there external relations ? The more instructive is the documentation of these matters, the more worth while the work of the excavation team and the specialist scientists will have been. The particular value of a one-period site which can be uncovered in its entirety is that the economic and social factors may be examined much more fully than can those of any single period in a deep site with many occupation levels, which necessarily can only be sampled. The evidence from our settlement may be briefly summarized. i. THE ECONOMIC BASIS A. Agriculture and Stock Raising The inhabitants practised a system of mixed farming to ensure food production. Barley and wheat were grown (Appendix V) though we know nothing of quantities. The little plateau by the site on the west and the adjacent valleys below Fournou Korifi would all have been suitable. Vines were cultivated and the remains of grapes found in Rooms 80 and 90 seem to be from wine or wine-making (Appendix V). One of the most important results of the excavation is the evidence for extensive olive cultivation. The great majority of the wood charcoals analysed are olive (Olea europaea L.) and the type and condition of the wood was apparently the result of pruning (Appendix III). The single olive stone found (Appendix V) suggests that the tree was domesticated. The timber was certainly used in roof construction and probably for ladders in rooms like 76, entered from the roof. The olives themselves must have been for oil. When burnt earth samples from the store jars in Room 22 were immersed in water in flotation tests for grain the mixture appeared distinctly greasy with an oil-like film. It is most probable that these jars contained oil. No evidence for olive pressing came to light1 but the separation of the oil from the hot water and pressed mass of olives was probably done in the large lekanai (p. 138). An estimate of the minimum number of olive trees and amount of land bearing them, based on the capacities of the amphorae and pithoi, is given above, p. i44f. Sheep, goat, pig and cattle were all kept, the caprines greatly outnumbering the other species (Appendix VI). As Dr Jarman points out, the hilly environment would have been rather un- suitable for a large number of cattle, but much better for caprines. He shows that there is a good probability that these were bred for wool. The diet also included, in a very tiny propor- tion, the meat from shells, especially limpets. We may be sure that fruit and probably nuts were 1 For Minoan stone olive presses see Evans, BSA 7 ( 1 900-1) 82-3 (Knossos, Room of the Olive Press, with a brilliant discussion) ; Dawkins, BSA 11 (1904-5) 276-7 and Fig. 8 (Palaikastro) ; Marinatos and Hirmer, Crete and Mycenae (i960) 140 and PI. 62, below ( Vathypetro) .

Greens like the modern varieties of χόρτα will certainly have been used, as will herbs. This reconstruction of the Myrtos diet and the mixed farming economy behind it is so far unique for Early Bronze Age Crete, but was probably in fact typical. Naked hexaploid wheat, emmer and barley as well as animal stocks had been produced since the Early Neolithic at Knossos1 but the vine and the olive are not known earlier than at Myrtos. Olive stones are re- corded from the Early-Middle Minoan tombs at Lebena2 and grape pips like ours (Vitis vinifera) are known from a Middle Minoan II pithos at Phaistos.3 Outside Crete a comparable agricultural and stock-raising economy is known from EH II Lerna,4 and remains of olive and vine wood were identified, though not definitively, at Thermi, where the settlement was con- temporary with Troy I.5 At Troy itself, in addition to vast numbers of shells, cattle, pig, sheep, goat, deer, hare, dog and tortoise were also found.6 The varied food supplies assured by these mixed farming economies, often supplemented by hunting (though evidently not at Myrtos), provided the basic subsistence on which the artistic, industrial and social achievement of the Aegean Early Bronze 2 flowering was built. In Crete the long Early Bronze Age established the economic basis for the palatial civiliza- tion which was to follow. The store rooms and magazines of Knossos and Phaistos demonstrate the importance of large-scale olive, vine and cereal production. Without these rich, assured food supplies the palatial achievement could not have come about. The olive and the vine are of further significance in that they require, in comparison with cereal production, only a modest and seasonal amount of time and manpower in their cultivation, thus enabling most of the population to be free for other work. The origins of this cultivation are now seen to be firmly rooted in the small farming communities of the Early Minoan period, as documented by the findings at Myrtos. Olive growing and viticulture were new in this period and the realization of their potential gave a wholly new pattern to life and an impetus to progress. B. Industries The main evidence for the industrial skills of the inhabitants lies in their building and pottery. Textile production was also a primary activity, though the extent of this is less apparent. Other industrial activities are noted below. (a) Architecture and building methods WALLS The method of building was fairly simple. Walls were usually 0.40-0.50 m. wide and were made of carefully selected and placed, but unworked stones. These were pieces or slabs of calcareous sandstone or else limestone pebbles gathered from the Fournou Korifi hill or near-by slopes and gullies (cf. Appendix I). Quernstones were frequently incorporated and occasionally there were blocks of gypsum or conglomerate, again local materials. Blocks of the sandstone bedrock of the hill were sometimes used, but these were unsuitable because they weathered so easily. Construction was not in regular courses; this term (Chapter II passim) is to be taken to mean rough coursing. Rooms 38-40 (PL 4B) illustrate Period I walls. This simple style continued in 1 Evans, BSA 59 (1964) 140. M. R. Jarman and H. N. Jarman, BSA 63 (1968) 241-62. 2 Alexiou, ILMo August 1900, 22b. 3 Levi, Bollettino d'Arte 41 (1956) 274 n. 29 4 N. G.

The style of building and width of the walls is probably much influenced by the way these stones were available in weathered and cracked pieces. No tool marks are apparent. This style is used for the main Rooms 76-81 in the southern area and a section from the east wall of Room 79 (PL 23A) is typical. The slabs enabled good high walling to be constructed, which in many cases had survived four thousand years in excellent condition. The magazines in the south-eastern area are built in the less careful style (PL 17B, Room 54). The elevation of the walls was of two kinds. Room 76 has its walls preserved in stone up to 2 metres in one place and it is virtually certain that stone was used for the whole height. This may have been the case with other rooms like 77, 79 and Passage 64, all of which have stone preserved to a good height, but to less than 2 metres. The reason for the full use of stone was doubtless to provide the strongest support for the roofs in this area, which were certainly used since Rooms 76, 77, 88 and 89 at least were entered from them. Apart from this particular area the superstructure of the walls was in mudbrick, the decayed orange-red fragments of which regularly characterized the surface levels and fill of rooms. We cannot give any general conclusions about the height at which the mudbrick courses began, since there was insufficient evidence; but the north-south wall dividing Rooms 19 and 22 was preserved in stone to c. 1.30 m. and above this remains of mudbrick were in place. On the other hand the north-south wall dividing Rooms 88 and 89 was built in stone to a height of only 0.30 m., above which a further 0.30 m. of mudbrick was discernible in three courses (see p. 80). There is some evidence for the size of the bricks. In the 88/89 wa^ they were 7.5 cm. high; their length here could no longer be determined and there may in fact have been a continuous long strip of sun-baked clay. The width of the wall was 0.40 m. but again it was not possible to work out if this was made up of one or two or more bricks. In general bricks seem to have been larger, or at least higher than those of 88/89. A fragment from Room 19 was preserved (but not com- plete) in length, width and height to 0.20, 0.16 and 0.14 m. respectively. Pieces in Passage 65 show that bricks were more than 0.20 m. long and were c. 0.16 m. wide and 0.10 m. high (p. 59)· A third type of superstructure was revealed by the west wall of Area 26, part of the outer wall of the settlement. This was preserved to c. 1.00 m. in stone and above was a mass of hard, cal- cined plaster. The upper part here was probably a mixture of plaster and stones. The surfaces of the walls usually consisted of plasters with a fine smooth finish, sometimes painted red (Appendix IV). The plaster had a dual function, to decorate the wall and to strengthen it by retaining the stones in position. Wood was not used in wall construction, in contrast to the settlement at Vasilike (cf. Appendix III), though there was almost certainly a wooden beam support in the wall slot in Room 79 (p. 71). Wooden poles must have been regularly employed in the roof structure (see below). One other feature of wall building was noted above, p. 8. This was the frequent and de- liberate use of sharp slopes in the rock, against which walls were built. This was a neat way of ensuring stability on one side. DOORWAYS AND THRESHOLDS Doorways are simply openings in the walls, with neatly finished faces. The best examples are from Rooms 17 to 18, width 0.54 m., from 21 to 20, width 0.54 m., into 29, width 1.00 m., between 38, 39 and 40, widths 0.68 m. and 0.48 m., into 52, width 0.62 m., between 59 and 60, width 0.86 m., between 76 and 77, width 0.56 m., into 78, width 0.65 m., between 79 and 80,</page><page sequence="282">258 MYRTOS width 0.90 m., between 80 and 81, width 1.05 m., between 90 and 91, width 0.53 m., and be- tween 91 and 92, width 0.80 m. The widths of the entrances seem small, especially since pots and other objects were carried into rooms. The size may have been to minimize the roofing problem, since stone door lintels were not used, save probably over the 76/77 door and perhaps over the South Entrance 64. Of these doorways listed all are of Period II, save the two between 38, 39 and 40. Thresholds or door sills were normally not used, the earth floor or natural rock continuing uninterrupted from one room to the next. But several rooms in the southern area, the best built part of the site, do have raised thresholds of flat slabs forming a step up out of one room into another. The thresholds between 79 and 80 and between 80 and 81 are the best examples. There were others into 29, 49 (Period I), 54 and probably 58. The finest of all was the elaborate plastered step into 78 from Passage 64 (p. 68f). The main southern entrance also had a stone threshold, possibly of two long slabs. One of these slabs, however, may have been a fallen lintel. Some evidence for the door system survives in the stone pivots or door sockets (p. 218), the best example being that in situ at the main south entrance. Clearly a door, presumably of wood or wood and reeds, was fixed to an upright post which turned in thé socket. We do not know how the doorpost was fixed at the top, but it may be presumed to have projected up through a hole in a wooden lintel or in a stone which would have projected from the wall. Thus the post would have been secured at the top.1 Between most of the internal rooms, however, there was no door but just the opening. The full height of the doorways was not preserved. The best surviving example is that between Rooms 76 and 77, where the wall end or east door jamb stood to 1.70 m. In connexion with doorways and thresholds one other point must be emphasized : many rooms had no door and were entered from the roofs. Burnt wood in Rooms 76, 79 and 89 was very possibly the remains of ladders and there were probable ladder supports in Room 27 (stone) and Room 79 (wood). This is a matter of importance for communications within the settlement; it emphasizes the degree to which the place was an inter-connected complex with many roof- top points of access to the chambers below. FLOORS Floors of rooms in both Period I and II consisted of the natural calcareous sandstone bedrock or, more usually, a packing of hard, white, clayey earth brought in and laid down to make the area level. This earth may have come from a hillock c. 400 m. north-west of the site (cf. below, p. 272, n.2). Sometimes the earth floor was sterile, sometimes destruction material was embedded in it, as in Room 54 and Passage 65, south end. But in no case did sherds from an earth floor differ in type or style from those of the Period II destruction deposits, except of course in the Period I rooms themselves. ROOFS Aspects of roof construction are discussed below in the Appendices on wood charcoals (III) and plasters (IV). Although no walls survived to roof height the methods of roof construction can be reconstructed with confidence. Rough wooden poles or small beams, usually of olive 1 Exactly this method can be observed today on the island of Andros. In February 1971 I saw a wooden gate fixed solidly to a post; the post turned in a stone socket set in the ground and was secured at the top by running up through a hole in a stone which projected from the field wall. The gate was on the north side of the main road west of Khora (the capital) between Pitrofos and the turning for Menetes.</page><page sequence="283">ECONOMY AND SOCIETY 259 wood, occasionally of oak or pine, were laid across the walls; probably there was some packing with twigs or brushwood. At right angles over these timbers were placed one or more layers of reeds, probably the species Phragmites communis which still grows in Crete but is much less common than the larger and thicker Arundo donax so frequently seen. Over the reeds was put one or more layers of coarse plaster which hardened and must have provided an excellent, impermeable surface. Impressions of the reeds were frequently found in the calcined plaster. Although no direct evidence survived we may be fairly sure the roofs were flat since they were used for walking on and had holes of access to some of the rooms. No traces of large ridge timbers survived as charcoal or in impressions. The small size of the rooms, the largest being only just over 5x5 metres, may have been dictated by the difficulty in spanning roofs. No span is greater than 2.60 m., many are much less. Whenever there was an apparently large span special structures were built, as in Rooms 60 and 80, or buttress walls were added to the rooms walls, as in 77 and 81. Although roofs as such were used no evidence survived for a built upper storey. For this one might have expected to find not just collapsed ceiling plaster in the fill but some trace of upper floor deposits of pottery with further evidence of roof plaster above them. However it does look as though the southern rooms 57 and 70-72 may have opened out on to the roofs of 58-59 and 76 and 79 on the lower ground immediately below them. For further discussion of this use of terraced slopes see Room 79. ROOM FITTINGS One of the most interesting architectural results of the excavation was the extent to which rooms had particular fittings. These are described in detail under the relevant rooms but may be briefly summarized. Low benches built against walls were not uncommon (Rooms 16, 20, 54, 60, 78, 82, 88, 90 and 91 and Passage 64); these benches must have been used as seats as well as stands for vases, for example in Rooms 82 and 91. Larger and higher benches were carefully built in Rooms 54 and 88. They must have been intended as working surfaces. In Areas 4 and 21 stone platforms were built, the former possibly a drying place for washed or dyed textiles, the latter a stand for jars or produce going into Room 22. The central structures in Rooms 60 and 80 were probably not benches but supports for roof spans in these two large rooms. Other fittings included pot stands, spread over the room in 17 and 18, lined along the wall in 80 and 92. These stands were either natural slabs of limestone or re-used clay bases from pithoi or lekanai, or re-used potter's turn-tables. Cupboards or bins were built with upright, flat slabs. The most elaborate was that with two compartments, housing jugs, other pots and cowrie shells, in the north-west corner of Room 80. Others were built with single compartments in 71 and 76. Another interesting fixture was the raised hearth or oven in Room 20, with a structure tall enough to provide a comfortable working surface. In Room 89 a hearth was built on the rock against the west wall, with small, roughly square, tables or benches on each side of it and low seats or steps extending across the room at right angles from them. Another raised structure was the support for the lekane or tub in Area 8, whereas wedged stones on the rock served in Room 1 7, a quern and flat slabs on the rock in 59 and a slab packed with stones set on rising rock in Room 81. The tub in Room 90 probably stood on the low bench against the wall. Other fixtures were the water stoup in Room 10 and the regular, cylindrical holes or pits cut in the rock. Those in Rooms 57 and 88 were cooking holes, but others in Entrance Area 15 and Areas 31 and 44 may have been storage pits. Apart from pot stands and probably querns used as seats no evidence of any movable furniture survived, of clay, stone or wood. Possibly there was none, except for ladders up to the roof in</page><page sequence="284">26o MYRTOS rooms like 76 and probably 79. A loom too must have stood on the platform south of Room 57 or on the roof of Room 58, and another in Area 73 or at the south end of Room 74. Despite the apparent paucity of movable furniture the extent and variety of the fixed pieces is of great interest for our understanding of living conditions in an Early Bronze Age village. It is of course a far cry from these simple fittings to the elaborations within the Palaces, but the basic systems of fixed furniture is already apparent, carefully devised for the industrial and recreational activities of the community. Particularly important in its demonstration of one aspect of architectural continuity from the pre-palatial into the palatial period is the frequent use of low benches against the walls. Frequent at Myrtos, they are again common in the pre- palatial EM III buildings along the south front of the Palace of Mallia1 and appear later, for example, in the Phaistos First Palace Shrine (see below, 265, n. 4) and in the Throne Room at Knossos. SETTLEMENT PLAN A last feature of the architecture which needs to be emphasized is the settlement plan. This is discussed more fully below in section 4, but architecturally two aspects of much interest suggest themselves. (1) In the plan of the settlement as a whole with its dozens of little rooms and areas separated by three main passages, 13/14, 64/65 and 67, we see in fact a prototype of the fully developed Late Minoan settlement plan, best exemplified at Gournia2 and Palaikastro.3 The constructional achievements and quality of masonry are of course better in these later villages and the house blocks are more carefully defined by streets or passages. None the less a comparison of the schematic plans of the three sites will make the basic similarity of arrangement clear. (2) While on the one hand we can see here the Later Minoan settlements in a less evolved form, I think there are also several features which are reminiscent of, or rather find their full develop- ment in the Minoan palaces. The site is a large, single building complex (save possibly for the North Building 1) divided by the three main passages. Within the complex particular areas had particular functions : store-rooms and work-rooms towards the north end, possible spinning and weaving places in the centre (Rooms 27-28), south of Room 57 or over 58 and in or near Area 73, magazines, kitchen and work-rooms in the south-east part, larger rooms which were prob- ably living places west of the South Entrance Passage, more work-rooms, 71-74, 80-82, 90, towards the south-west, and a Shrine, 92, in the south-west corner with a probable shrine treasury, 91, next to it and another possible cult room, 89, adjacent on the east. This whole system of distinct though not too rigorously defined units of use is basically the same as the functionally distinct areas of the palaces. In particular features Myrtos and Vasilike of course differ largely from the palaces, chiefly in the absence of any central court; but Areas 30, 45 and 69 were open places near the centre of the settlement. 45 in particular had the function of a central court, at the meeting place of Passage 65 and East- West Way 67 and with access to rooms on the north. Vasilike had a paved west court like the Palaces.4 At Myrtos there was a 1 Chapouthier, Demargne and Dessenne, Ét.Crét. 12 (1962) Plan II. These buildings look in plan closely similar to the Fournou Korifi settlement. 2 Gournia, Plan opposite p. 26. 3 Popham and Sackett, BSA 60 (1965) PI. 65 for the fullest plan. 4 Alexiou, Arch.Delt. 19 (1964) Χρονικά PI. 522P. See now S. Sinos, 'Eine Untersuchung der sogennanten Palastanlage von Vasiliki', AA (1970) 1-24. This is a fundamental and most welcome re-examination of the House-on- the-Hill-Top and associated walls. The chief product is an excellent and detailed architectural plan, Fig. 1 . Sinos distinguishes eight building phases. After the fourth there was a destruction and phases 5-8 represent a considerable rebuilding and expansion (ibid., 23-4). Phases 1-2, the earliest, have hatched painted and, with Seager, fine grey incised wares. The final phases are clearly those of the last big period of the complex which contained destruction deposits of EM II Vasilike mottled ware in quantity. This is a primary archaeological and chronological fact which must take precedence over Sinos' extension of the last phases into early Middle Minoan, on the basis of similarities in the</page><page sequence="285">ECONOMY AND SOCIETY 261 Raised Way, 93, along the south front of the settlement, an architectural feature prominent in the palatial courtyards. Also reminiscent of the Palaces are some apparently deliberate and careful details of planning. On a small scale we have the antae of doorways in Rooms 77, 90 and 91 and the detailed arrangements in Passage 64. On a larger scale we note that Room 60 in the south-east is, though smaller, closely similar with its central structure to Room 80 on the south-west. Here surely is planning on the basis of a single large complex. Equally we saw that cRoom' 62 may perhaps have been a rounded, defensive bastion in the south-east corner. This is balanced by the prob- able towers of 86 and 87 at the south-west corners. The similarities must not be exaggerated, but the single, large architectural complex with several distinct areas organized for specific purposes, does suggest that the origins of the palaces are to be sought here in settlements such as Myrtos and Vasilike, architecturally in part and economically in full. Finally, a chronological aspect of the Period II architecture must be emphasized. Though there are no stratigraphically distinct Period II building phases there are many examples of small rebuildings and building changes in the period. These occur in Area 8, Entrance Area 15, the triangular area between Rooms 18, 20 and 27, Area 21, Room 22, the northern passage of Room 34, the north-south wall dividing Area 56 from Room 60, the wall dividing Room 60 from Passage 64 and the wall additions affecting Rooms 77, 78 and 79. Period II was, on this evidence, not a short phase. (b) Pottery making The main artefactual industry on the site seems to have been pottery manufacture. A potter's workshop, 49, has survived from Period I, with eight turn-tables still on the floor. These simple disks were all turned by hand, but by or in Period II an incipient stage of the freely revolving wheel had been reached. This is shown by the interesting turn-table, 105, with a small hole to receive a spindle. This disk was being re-used as a pot stand by the time of the destruction. Technically the pottery of Myrtos has reached the summit of what can be achieved without a freely revolving wheel. Slight irregularities of shape are often apparent, especially the sloping rims, but some types such as amphorae, baking plates and piriform jars have incredibly thin walls in relation to the size of the vases. A real mastery of ceramic techniques was needed to produce these pots on hand-turned disks. Aesthetically many of the vases, particularly some of the large amphoras, some bowls, jugs and piriform jars ( especially P98) seem to exhibit a real feeling for an elegant shape. Decoratively, however, the achievements seem meagre, particularly when compared with the glories of Middle Minoan design. Appendix XI discusses firing temperatures. It is to be noted that most of the pottery seems to have been fired at rather low temperatures, nine out of fourteen samples below 88o°C (cf. Appendix XII p. 336). Three samples, however, 4, 5, and 6, were fired higher, around 900o- iO5O°C, and it is of interest that just these three are of the same composition among themselves plastering of the walls at Vasilike, Phaistos and Phylakopl. With Sinos' clear architectural observations we see that Vasilike and Myrtos experienced a closely similar history: a small settlement in EM 1 1 A, characterized chiefly by hatched painted (Dr A. Zoes' 'Koumasa style') and light grey burnished and incised wares; after this came a con- siderable expansion in EM I IB (Seager's Period III/Sinos' Phases 5-8; Myrtos Period II) with much rebuilding and further alteration within the period, terminating in a burnt destruction of these most developed buildings, characterized primarily by Vasilike mottled ware, and defined as the end on EM II. The settlement plans in their final form look remarkably similar, even to the division of each by a main north-south passage (our Passage 64/65, Sinos' between Vasilike Rooms XXI-XXIII and XXXIV-XXXV). Myrtos has a preserved east-west measurement of about 29 metres and was a metre or so larger originally; Vasilike is about 31.5 metres east-west, excluding the paved West Court. As at Myrtos Vasilike has many little rooms entered from the roof. S</page><page sequence="286">2Ö2 MYRTOS but have a different composition from all other fabrics (Appendix XII). Since the three include the class of amphorae, the largest vases in the settlement, they were clearly made locally. Since many, if not all the pots in the other fabrics must be local too we have evidence that at least two clay beds were being exploited, and possibly more than one kiln or type of kiln. There is a further, negative observation to be made. None of the firing temperatures appears to have reached the melting point of copper, which goes some way to confirm the absence of evidence for metal- working in the settlement. The Myrtos vases also contributed to our understanding of the continuous development of shapes in Minoan pottery. Details are noted in the discussion of each type in Chapter IV, but we may note here that certain types like cups and goblets fall easily into place in the Minoan sequence and provide evidence additional to that of Vasilike for well-dated EM II specimens. Pithoi of clear EM II date were virtually unknown before Myrtos and the rich series from the settlement fills a major gap in our knowledge of the Bronze Age large store jar. Tripod cooking pots are now not only known from EM II (they occurred in the EM II levels at Knossos also) but were very common. So far they are not known before this period. Spouted jars (type 3 B) are clearly the ancestors of the common MM I- II hole-mouthed or bridge-spouted jar so common in the first palaces of Knossos and Phaistos. Again the type is carried back into the Early Minoan period. So too is the clay hand-lamp, not otherwise known before MM I. There was clearly a continuous development in Minoan pottery from the Early Bronze Age into that of the first palaces. Changes of shape and decoration naturally occur, but each form and pattern can be clearly seen to have its forerunners in the earlier periods. The piriform jug is the best example, remaining basically the same from EM II to the end of the Bronze Age, and with clear predecessors in EM I. (c) Textile manufacture Loomweights and spindle whorls show that cloth was woven in Periods I and II. It is suggested that the perforated stone weights which were so common on the site were also part of the textile- making equipment. The smooth rubbers of serpentine (p. 234f.) may well have been used for the necessary rubbing smooth of wool.1 The analysis of the animal bones by Dr Jarman (Appendix VI) shows that there is a good possibility that caprines were bred for wool as much as for meat. The details of the manufacturing system are not preserved, but certain processes had to be carried out for cloth to be produced at all. Wool2 had to be washed and cleaned. This was probably done in the large clay tubs (cf. Appendix X). An alkaline cleansing agent is required; urine would have served, but it may be that a particularly efficacious plant, salsola kali, was gathered; it is common in the Myrtos coastal region today (see Appendix II). There is no direct evidence that cloth was dyed, but this is likely. The hatched panels on the dress of the Goddess certainly represent dress and it may be that red was used for the garments as for their representa- tion. The kermès oak, Quercus cocci/era L., host of the kermès insect (Kermococcus vermilio) which produces cochineal grows above the Malles valley north-west of Fournou Korifi and the tree is 'K.J. r or Des, òtuaies in Ancient lecnnoiogy 4 (,195b; 94. 2 Although no evidence survived it is not impossible that flax was used for linen garments. Linen was known and used in Egypt from early Dynastic times (Forbes, op. cit., 31) and also in the Gypriot Early Bronze Age (A. Pieridou, Report of the Department of Antiquities, Cyprus ( 1 967) 26-7) and it was found adhering to a sword blade in the Chieftain's Grave at Zapher Papoura, Knossos, of LM III A date (Evans, Ρ Μ IV 866 Figs. 851-2). The Linear Β tablets also indicate mat the plant grew m quantity at Jvnossos ana Pylos (Ventris and Ghadwick, Documents in Mycenaean Greek (1956) 131, 295 sqq.). The plant, Linum bienne Mill (L. angustifolium Huds.), was well known in Greece in anti- quity (Pausanias v. 5, 2; vi 26, 6; vii 21, 14; viii 24, 11. Cf. Forbes, op. cit., 37-8) and still grows in Greece and Crete (A. Huxley and O. Polunin, Flowers of the Mediter- ranean (1965) 111-12).</page><page sequence="287">ECONOMY AND SOCIETY 263 of high antiquity (Appendix II). It may have been there in the Bronze Age. Other possible red dyes are alkanet from the root of Anchusa tinctoria, common now in Crete. Madder comes from the root of rubia tinctorium, known in Greece. Yellow dye was obtained from the dried stigmas of the saffron crocus, Crocus sativus L., known from the Linear Β tablets.1 Murex shells were another source of purple and red dyes known to the Middle Minoans,2 but so few were found in the settlement that we cannot know if they were exploited there for dye. A part of the settlement that may have been used for washing and possibly dyeing wool and cloth is Area 8 and Rooms 10-12 with the platform of Area 4 as a drying and working surface.3 Warp-weighted looms were located in, or more probably above Room 58 and near the south end of Area 74.4 It also remains unknown whether textiles were produced at Myrtos for home use only, or were exported. We may feel that the latter is possible, in view of the numbers of finds connected with textile manufacture in so small a settlement.5 (d) Stone industry The considerable use of a variety of stones enables us to separate this as a distinct activity in the settlement. Obsidian blade tools were prepared from cores (Appendix VIII), perforated stone weights were made, many stones were selected as querns, pounders and rubbers with attention to particular rocks for chosen purposes ; abrasive calcareous sandstone for querns, harder rocks for pounders, smooth serpentines for polishers and rubbers. Stone pestles were faceted and shaped. A few stone figurines and seals were carved. (e) Other industries No evidence survived for the practice of other crafts or industries on any scale. There was nothing to indicate metal-working.6 Two small points weigh slightly against it : the lead content of the dagger, 9, suggests that the piece came from the Mesara or Asterousia region, and the firing temperatures of the pottery (Appendix XI) did not reach that required for melting copper. 2. THE ECONOMY, INDUSTRIES, ENVIRONMENT AND ITS EXPLOITATION Agricultural and industrial activities obviously involved extensive use of the environment, Evidence for the climate and vegetation at the time of the settlement is discussed in Appendices I- II and V. The most instructive material is the wood charcoals; extensive growth of olives, the occurrence of oak and pine and the growth of cereal crops and vines suggest strongly that the climate was probably akin to that of the more heavily cultivated parts of Crete today, that is, that the Myrtos region was then less arid than now. The work of Dr Rackham in Appendix II also makes it probable that evergreen forest cover may never have been extensive for climatic reasons, not for the reason usually argued for the European Mediterranean, namely human 1 For ancient dye materials in Greece see Forbes, op. cit., 100 sqq.

It is then possible that an absence of extensive evergreen forest played a part in the choice of the region for early settlement. The extent to which the environment was exploited may be briefly summarized. Soils reason- ably near the site must have been used for the cereals, olives and vines. The plateau just below and beside the site on the west was presumably used, though any soil-retaining slopes and terraces would also have been suitable (cf. Appendix I). The hilly terrain could not have supported many cattle but would have been right for caprines and pigs. Water may have come from springs now dry, or from the valley floors to east and west. The industries, as is suggested below, may be divided into extractive and manufacturing. The extractive stage is the initial one and works on the environment. Thus clay earth for pottery came from at least two separate beds (cf. Appendix XII), iron earths were needed for vase paint, building stones were brought to the site, gypsum from the slopes north of Fournou Korifi, conglomerate and limestone pebbles from gullies in the same area. Olive, oak and pine were cut for timber needed in roof construction. Artefact stones like serpentine and amygdaloid basalt must have come from the beaches or the gullies. Steatite occurs in outcrops in the large Sarakina valley near Khristos, north-west of the settlement. For the lime plasters limestone had to be extracted and burnt in kilns, and slaking processes were necessary (Appendix IV) . Plants were probably used in fulling and dyeing. The sea was apparently little exploited, on the evidence of the comparatively few shells (Appendix VII) and the absence of fishbones. The way life went on, the various definable processes and their necessary interdependence together made up the living system of the community. This system may be represented in a diagram, Fig. 108, which sets out the subsystems such as agriculture and manufacturing industries, and analyses the way in which they were combined in larger systems, food supply, water supply and industries. The interconnections of the different activities are represented by lines; thus agriculture, which gives food (stored in pots), needs tools, probably obsidian blades, which come by trade. Water supply is fundamental for food, drink and various manufacturing industries; it may have been protected by religion (the Goddess and her jug), which in turn would have needed offerings. Clay is needed for pottery and other objects, but it must first be dug out with made tools. Thus the processes of living were connected at every turn and a dia- gram (Fig. 108) represents the resultant living system conveniently. 3. RELIGION The settlement provided two main sources of evidence for this. If Room 92 is accepted as a shrine certain important consequences follow. The strongest point in favour of the room's religious function is the similarity to later shrines like that of the Double Axes at Knossos.1 Both have a low bench or structure against a wall, a female figure (which can have had no practical domestic function) originally on the structure and a number of good-sized vessels on the floor near by, presumably for offerings. The consequences are that the Minoan household shrine2 is now known to begin in the Early Bronze Age, earlier than any peak sanctuary, and that this type of building has a continuous history beginning before the Palaces and taken over in them. 3 The Phaistos palace shrine of MM II is the next known example.4 A further 1 Evans, PM II 335-43. 2 Banti, Annuano 3-5 (194 1-3) 28-50.

Nilsson, op. cit., 94-6.</page><page sequence="290">266 MYRTOS consequence is that the Minoan household goddess is also known continuously from the Early Minoan period. The Myrtos figure is the one example actually from a domestic context, but similar figurines with EM II and EM III contexts from Koumasa, Mallia, Mochlos and the Trapeza Cave probably represent the same divinity or divinities.1 Our Myrtos figure with her jug may have been thought of as protectress of the water supply (vital for a waterless settlement), as well as domestic crafts and industries which all needed water. These attributes recall Athena Ergane, who was especially concerned with spinning and weavingz and also had connexions with water. 3 Athena was certainly a pre-hellenic deity as the Knossos tablets show.4 We may thus conclude with reasonable confidence that the domestic side of Minoan religion is firmly rooted in the Early Minoan period and continued on unbroken into the age of the Palaces. A similar situation obtains with the second and less dramatic class of evidence, the libation table 169 and other stones with a ring of little hollows round the edge (pp. 23of.). Tables of offerings are now known to begin in EM times and are used throughout the whole Minoan period. Two other objects which may well have had a religious function are the bull figurines, 71 and 72, the latter of which was a rhyton. On the analogy of later bull's head figurines, such as that from the Little Palace at Knossos, ours would have been for pouring libations, perhaps pro- pitiatory to a chthonic power. Conch shells (Appendix VII) may have been used as trumpets, but their contexts gave no evidence of any religious connexion. 4. SOCIAL ORGANIZATION The economic and architectural arrangements of the settlement invite some speculation on the social organization of the inhabitants. (a) Division of labour. Food production and specialized crafts occupied much of the people's time. Pottery and possibly textile manufacture obviously occurred on a considerable scale and were skilled operations. It may be that they were carried out by groups of specialists, from the first extraction of clay earth or fulling and dyeing materials through to the finished products. These specialist groups, possibly working full time, would have been supported by separate groups of food producers, responsible for crop and herd maintenance. Many people must certainly have been engaged on carrying water up to the site, probably in the multitudes of jugs which were so common a pottery form. Some inhabitants must have travelled (cf. below on external relations) . But to what extent all these activities were separate divisions of labour, we do not know. (b) Social structure. The layout of the settlement is in the form of a single, large building complex (save possibly the separate North Building 1) divided by three long, narrow passages. There is no suggestion of individual, self-contained houses. The presence of store-rooms, kitchens, work-rooms and probably living-rooms (in the southern area) suggests that the settlement was thought of as a single unit with different parts having different functions.

Any one who studies the plan or visits the site will see that the complex, spreading over the summit of the hill, is certainly a village settlement, a proto-Gournia, and not a neatly defined house like those of Middle Minoan Vasilike or of the Late Minoan period. A settlement, then, in the form of a single large complex without separately defined houses suggests a social organization based on a single large unit, a clan or tribe living communally and perhaps not differentiated into individual families, and quite without any apparent chief or ruler.2 Just such a social organization is strongly suggested by the Early Minoan burial evidence, always communal, never with individual graves. The circular tombs of the Mesara imply no differentiation in social structure. Dr Branigan has suggested that the use of more than one communal tomb at one cemetery at the same time seems to imply more than one clan or large individual group in the relevant settlement.3 This hypothesis seems thoroughly acceptable and I would emphasize the communal aspect of the tombs, each used by a clan or group with apparently undifferentiated members all buried together. The settle- ment architecture of Myrtos seems to provide for such a social organization a good parallel among the living. (c) Population. The population of the settlement can only be estimated very approximately. The site occupies about 1250 sq. m., with nearly a hundred small rooms or areas. During the excavations about twenty-five people were at work. A number much above four times this figure would have made the place crowded. If one makes the assumption that the population lived in the settlement, or at any rate not permanently outside it, then a figure of about 100- 120 seems most likely. There could not have been more if any vestige of comfort was to be maintained. 5. EXTERNAL RELATIONS The evidence for external relations is very slight indeed. Obsidian certainly reached the site in unworked lumps, as the cores imply (Appendix VIII). Whether Myrtiots brought it directly from Melos or from an intermediate site like Mochlos, where there are vast numbers of frag- ments, or whether others brought it we do not know. Nevertheless external contacts of some kind are implied. This is certainly the case with one of the stone vases, 210, which may well have come from Mochlos itself; very probably the other two were also imports to the settlement, since there was no evidence for stone vase manufacture. The Period I dagger, 9, with its copper alloyed with lead (Appendix IX), was almost certainly not made at Myrtos but brought from elsewhere. The nearest lead sources are in the Asterousia mountains near Lebena, south of the Mesara. The dagger may well have come from that region, possibly even brought by one of the initial settlers. The other metal object, the chisel, 102, was probably an import too, possibly from the Mesara or the Cyclades. To what extent, if any, pottery was imported we shall be unable to say until spectographic analysis has determined adequate groups for the period and the region. But classic mottled Vasilike ware did not begin at Myrtos and the fine jugs, goblets and bowls in the final destruction deposits have such close parallels at Vasilike itself4 where the ware began earlier, that it would be no surprise to learn that a load of such pots had come to 1 Dr Keith Branigan has thus described it, when it was partially excavated; Foundations of Palatial Crete (1970) 48-9. 2 The contemporary House-on-the-Hill-Top at Vasilike was certainly another such large, single unit.

Four vases, the Period I burnished bowl fragment (p. ιοί), P38, P397 and P487 may well be imports in that each is unique among all the ceramic material from the excavations. A burner may have gone from Myrtos to Marathokephalon (see p. 122). With objects coming into the settlement it is highly likely that things were being given or sent in exchange. Pottery is one possibility and the two distinctive 'Myrtos Ware5 jugs at Sphoungaras and Palaikastro in EM II contexts (p. 133) may have come from our site. Textiles are another possibility. The evidence suggests they were being made in some quantity, but we have no means of knowing if they were for export or home use only. The general picture is that there were definite external relations, but the surviving evidence suggests they were slight. We may well guess that there were in fact far more. 6. REASONS FOR THE FOUNDATION OF THE SETTLEMENT Now that the material evidence of the settlement has been summarized we may consider why it was founded. The date, at the beginning of Early Minoan II, and the wider context of the foundation are discussed in Chapter VII, but it may be noted here that Myrtos is one of a whole series of new east Cretan settlements established at this time. The ultimate cause may have been an expansion of population from the well-developed EM I groups in the north central or south central regions of the island. East Crete offered many suitable coastal sites with adjacent fertile land and the Myrtos region may have been particularly suitable because of an absence of extensive evergreen forest (see Appendix II). Why the site was established on Fournou Korifi, 66 metres directly above the shore, is more problematical. All paths of access are steep and there is now no water in or near the buildings, and it is extremely unlikely that there ever was (cf. Appendix I). Defence was probably relevant since the site is confined to the summit of the hill and the outer wall, where it survives, is continuous save for the two entrances. Of these 64 may have been protected by a bastion, 62, and towers may have been located at the south-west angle. But the outer wall is only the usual 0.40-0.50 metres thick and the settlement would not appear to have been immune from any really serious attack. It seems that defence provides only a partial explanation for the foundation. Another reason may well have been economic, namely a suitable site for the production of textiles. This was certainly a main activity in the settlement and a hill-top location with good winds for drying cloth may have been appreciated. The hill-top location of the Hellenistic dyeworks on the Rachi at Isthmia near Corinth provides a close parallel (see p. 263, n. 3). However, it is equally possible that other factors no longer known determined the choice of site. Nevertheless agriculture, stock-raising and the manufacture of pottery cannot have been among these factors, since any site in the vicinity would equally well have enabled these activities to be carried out.</page><page sequence="293">CHAPTER VII. CHRONOLOGY, HISTORY AND SETTLE- MENT PATTERN Two periods have been distinguished in the history of the settlement. Period I is known from the unburnt, stratified level below Room 27, pure levels and deposits in Rooms 36-40, 48-51 and South-East Pits 61-62, together with good, but not pure material in Room 28 and else- where. The main distinguishing characteristics are ceramic : (a) buff-surfaced wares very much more common than dark painted; (b) hatched decoration, especially in triangles, and other varied patterns common on the buff-surfaced wares; (c) fine light grey burnished pottery, especially shallow open bowls and stemmed goblets; (d) no Vasilike mottled ware; (e) jug handles with a raised band round the centre; (f) an orange/brown variety of cooking pot ware with prominent white grits. Period II is known from the numerous final destruction deposits of the settlement, usually burnt, and is characterized by (a) much Vasilike mottled ware ; (b) much red, brown or dark painted ware, including imitation Vasilike ware; (c) red or brown painted and burnished ware (like Vasilike ware, but not mottled) ; (d) about a dozen vases with red or dark painted surfaces and added white painted decoration, usually simple chevrons ; (e) a few dark-on-light painted vases; (f) a class of fine large amphorae with a rib below the rim and painted trickle decoration. Pithoi, cooking pots and baking plates are common to both periods. The two periods are quite distinct both by their contexts and ceramic content. The former is called Early Minoan II A, the latter EM IIB. The justification of this terminology is founded in the ceramic relation of our settlement to other sites, that is in its relative chronology. Relative Chronology The key sites with pure or stratified deposits normally assigned to EM II are Knossos, Lebena, Palaikastro and Vasilike, to which Myrtos must now be added. It will be convenient to take the eastern sites first, outline their EM chronology and then relate them to Knossos and Lebena. Vasilike. Seager distinguished three main EM levels.1 The first (Seager's Periods I- II) was characterized by fine grey burnished and incised ware, classic Vasilike mottled ware, and dark on light painted (including hatched) ware. In the building level above (Seager's Period III), the House-on-the-Hill-Top, mottled ware was predominant if not exclusive. In the next main period (Seager's Period IV) dark painted ware with white decoration gradually superseded the mottled ware. This last Period is EM III and the material has many parallels with other white- on-dark painted deposits in east Crete. The first two main periods can be called EM IIA and EM IIB. We see at once that, save for the presence of mottled ware in the first main period, these two periods correspond closely with our two periods at Myrtos. The destructions at the end of EM II at each site must have taken place about the same time since both were characterized by a few white-on-black pieces among the many mottled and dark painted wares.2 Palaikastro. The lower of the stratified deposits in Block Delta 323 did not contain Vasilike 1 Vasilike II 1 13-14. The Table published here in 1907 must still be regarded as the most fundamental statement of the stratigraphical basis of the Early Minoan period which has yet been printed. 2 Seager, Vasilike I 213-14, 217; Vasilike II 116. 3 Dawkins, BSA 10 (1903-4) 199-200. 269</page><page sequence="294">27O MYRTOS ware. On the evidence of a jug with white concentric semicircles on the red ground (the classic motif of EM IIA fine grey incised ware) this deposit is probably EM II A rather than just EM II. At a higher level but not directly over the deposit was material of a different character, namely predominant Vasilike ware with dark on light painted ware jugs. This then is EM IIB, in terms of Vasilike and Myrtos. The earliest Palaikastro ossuary1 contained a fine grey im- pressed and incised pyxis and incised stone vessels. This seems then to be a pure EM IIA deposit on the fine grey ware evidence of Vasilike and Myrtos. Ossuary II was also built in EM II and since it contained a good deposit of complete Vasilike ware vases (absent in Ossuary I and the lowest pocket in Delta 32) it probably began in EM IIB. Knossos. The stratigraphical excavations of Mr Sinclair Hood from 1957-61 revealed several EM floors north of the Royal Road and on the south front of the Palace.2 The earliest on the north side of the Royal Road (Floors VI and V) produced dark-on-light painted pottery, including hatched triangles, with some grey ware and a little Vasilike ware. In the floor levels on the south front of the Palace the grey ware had ceased, dark-on-light painted and a little Vasilike ware continued. This situation at Knossos corresponds quite well with our EM IIA and Β in the east, save that dark-on-light painted was always more common than Vasilike ware outside the eastern region. The EM II floor deposits published by Evans3 may well be EM IIA, with a hatched triangle jug like those of Vasilike« and Myrtos and a hatched painted, shallow bowl. There was Vasilike ware, as in Mr Hood's earliest floor level. New excavations below the West Court have revealed part of another building which may also be EM IIA on the evidence of a fine dark-on-light bowl.5 The preceding EM I period at Knossos is best attested by the rich well deposit cleared by Mr Hood6 with much pattern-burnished pottery, round-bottomed, buff-surfaced jugs and no Vasilike, fine grey burnished or hatched painted wares. Lebena. At Lebena, the major site in the south for stratigraphy and quantity of complete EM vases, yet again firm evidence emerges for two phases within EM II. Tomb II was built in EM I and contained in the lowest level the rich deposit of EM I vases. Above this level came a mixed stratum in which many fine grey incised ware vases first appeared in the deposit. Against Tomb II a new tomb, IIA, was built. This contained two levels separated by a layer of sand. The lower level, EM II, contained Vasilike, red wash, and dark-on-light painted and dark wash vases, but no incised fine grey ware. In contrast with the rich deposit in the adjacent tomb this absence of fine grey ware (and the presence of Vasilike ware, etc.) suggests that Tomb IIA was built in EM IIB, just like Ossuary II at Palaikastro. It continued to MM I, the date of the material in the upper level. 7 The relative chronology of EM II is summarized in the Table.8 EM II has links with the EG II Keros-Syros culture of the Cyclades.9 The relative chronology can be strengthened further since EM IIA dark-on-light ware with hatched triangles should be approximately contemporary with a whole class of similarly decorated vases in the Keros- Syros culture.10 1 Bosanquet, BSA 8 (190 1-2) 290-1.

The archaeological evidence for the end of EM II is a complex matter but it suggests that a date of c. 2170 b.c. is roughly correct.1 The date of the foundation of the settlement and the beginning of EM II can only be estimated very approximately. The EM I period begins around 2900 b.c.2 The material from the well at Knossos, the Pyrgos and Kyparissi Caves3 and Lebena tomb II (see above, 270, n. 7) shows that the period is substantial. This was certainly the case with EM II also, with its two clear periods. The transition from EM I to II probably occurred c. 2600/2500 b.c. Our settlement was not the only one founded at this time. Although it has not previously been painted out there is very little evidence for EM I settlement in the whole of east Crete. 1 I have deliberately refrained from setting out the de- tailed evidence here, chiefly Egyptian scarabs and imitated Egyptian stone vase types in Crete, since it is discussed in full in The Early Bronze Age of Crete (see p. 270, n. 8). See also Kr.Chron. Γ θ (1965) 34 for the scarabs; Minoan Stone Vases (1969)2-3, 71-2, 74-6, 105-6 for the stone vases and imita- tions.

Cadogan in 1970) was founded in EM II or EM III.2 It is clear that the eastern part of the island was substantially populated for the first time only at the beginning of this period;3 in other words there were major movements of people into the region at this time. Coastal or inland sites with easy access were settled. The origins of the new settlers are at present obscure, since Vasilike and fine grey burnished and incised wares are both quite new. Earlier population groups abound in the north and south central region of the island and fragments like our P42 and P45 may possibly be a develop- ment of the EM I Pyrgos chalices with incised and burnished stems. But this is scanty evidence, and there is nothing to suggest that Vasilike Ware evolves out of EM I pottery. The classic EM II wares, however, are certainly later than those of EM I on the evidence of Knossos and Lebena noted above, but they seem as new in the centre as in the east of the island. On the other hand the EM II dark-on-light painted jugs and bowls could easily have developed from EM I painted wares like those of the Kyparissi Cave and Lebena Tomb II, basal level. These sites, like the rich Pyrgos cave and the Krasi circular tomb, continue as burial places from EM I into II. It may then be tentatively suggested that the eastern region of Crete was extensively settled in EM II from the north and south central regions, where the vigorous beginnings in EM I gave rise to a great expansion in the size and number of sites in the next period. The EM II painted wares probably evolved from those of EM I, fine grey ware may have evolved from EM I grey/black Pyrgos wares (cf. our Period I goblets, P36-P45), though it soon became a highly distinct pottery, while Vasilike ware may have been invented by the new, eastern settlers, very possibly at the name site where it occurs as early as anywhere else and in quantity. Easy access to the Myrtos region from the Mesara and centre of the island could be gained along the southern foothill valleys below the Lasithi range, or, easier still, by sea along the coast. The prominence of fine grey and hatched dark-on-light wares and of simple little clay figurines in our Period I deposits and in the tombs of Koumasa is suggestive.4 On a wider scale the settlement takes its place beside contemporary sites like Aghios Kosmas, Askitario, Eutresis, Lerna III, Poliochni, Troy II and the Chalandriane settlement on Syros, providing new evidence for the first urban stage in Aegean civilization. Crete has not offered anything substantial for this revolutionary phase in the development of Aegean settle- ments since Seager's excavations at Vasilike nearly seventy years ago. Our results may seem to have justified the efforts and the Minoan contribution is again clear. 1 EM I sherd fill below Tomb V, Seager, Mochlos 7, 42, 92. 2 A hillock covered by white earth stands about 400 m. NNW of our Fournou Korifi settlement and about 200 m. beyond the Circular Building 96 on the plateau. This hillock was also occupied in EM II since it produced a few sherds typical of our Period II, collected by Dr Keith Branigan. These included part of a Vasilike ware flaring bowl (cf. Bowls Type 5C) with one of three little feet pre- served. This feature was very rare in the settlement, but a fragment of such a footed bowl occurred in the fill of North Rubbish Area 2. Copper-bearing pebbles were also picked up. See p. 263, n. 6. 3 A.

The nearest EM I site to Fournou Korifi is the Ano Souvloto cave north-west of the village of Mythoi, itself on the western slopes of the large Myrtos- Malles valley. See Faure, BCH 89 (1965) 36.

THE PHYSICAL GEOGRAPHY OF THE MYRTOS REGION: A PRELIMINARY APPRAISAL BY M. WAGSTAFF ι . Present conditions THE SITE The Early Minoan II settlement was built on the top and upper slopes of the highest of four oval-shaped knolls (66.3 m. above sea level) which rise above the southern end of Fournou Korifi ridge (Fig. 109), some 3.5 km. east of the modern village of Myrtos. On the summit of three knolls slabs of beachrock occur sporadically, as discontinuous capping. The settlement hill is capped all over with this material and slabs lie south-west of the site on the cliff top. The rock is formed of sand grains cemented by calcite and contains numerous mollusc shells. Similar deposits have been described from other parts of the south coast of Crete and, on the basis of their molluscan fauna, assigned to the Tyrrhenian phase ( ? Tyrrhenian I) of the Pleistocene period.1 Between the knolls the ridge has an almost flat surface cut across white or grey (? Pliocene) marls (kouskouras) at about 51 m. above sea level. From the flat area the marls gradually slope upwards to the north. Loose pebbles are strewn over the lower parts of this slope, evidently sorted downhill by surface wash. Irregular patches of thinly layered gypsum occur to the north-west and north-east. Gravels and gypsum gradually give way to conglomerate blocks which have broken away from the main mass of the conglomerate forming high ground (c. 80.0 m.) at the north end of the ridge. A deep gully separates the ridge from rising ground to the north. Fournou Korifi has extremely steep slopes (c. 30-35 degrees) . The southern slopes, in which strata of beachrock are visible, fall almost directly to a narrow sand beach, but the western and eastern slopes grade into the apparently flat floors of small plains called Tourli (or Troulli), to the east, and Sarikampos, to the west. These open directly onto the sea and, lying about the mouths of streams leading from the interior, have roughly semicircular shapes. Stream channels are about 2 m. deep and lined with small, discontinuous gravel terraces. Several gullies cut down to them from Fournou Korifi. Most radiate from the flat area between the knolls, into which they appear to be actively cutting back. This development seems largely responsible for the almost total lack of soil cover here, though a thin soil is found under pines on the high north- western slopes and patchily beneath scrub on the conglomerates. SITUATION Fournou Korifi lies amidst a complicated assemblage of similar marl ridges capped with beach- rock in a zone about 1 km. wide stretching along the coast for about 1 1 km., from near Ierapetra to within 2 km. of the Myrtos river (Fig. no). Few ridges are over 100 m. high and all of them have broadly concave slopes below their caps. The seaward edges are cut by discontinuous benches. The highest is about 34 m. above sea level but others are found at about 20 and 10 m. Each is littered with unconsolidated beach-like deposits. Some ridges bear a thin, lightly 1 Boekshoten, 'Some Geological Observations on the Coasts of Crete', Geologie en Mijnbouw 42 (1963) 241-7. 273</page><page sequence="298">274 MYRTOS .

Man-made terraces follow the contours on many slopes and retain a depth of similar soil which is evidently suitable for cultiva- tion. The ridges are separated by valleys, containing fertile alluvial soils, and numerous gullies, some reaching the sea by steep descents. Surface flow is seasonal but water can be reached all year round by sinking wells into the valley floors. These are used for small-scale irrigation in addition to domestic purposes. Conglomerates are found north of the marl zone and, like the marls into which they grade, appear to have been laid down in Mio-Pliocene times as a result of the progressive denudation of the Lasithi massif, which lies to the north-west. The conglomerates are deltaic deposits, consisting principally of well-rounded limestone and sandstone pebbles. Their soils are poorly developed. North of Fournou Korifi, in a large area around Anatole and as far north as Kala- maf ka (Fig. no), the conglomerates have been uplifted into an asymmetrical anticline orientated roughly south-west to north-east. In it small detached horsts (areas raised above their surround- ings, which have been depressed by faulting) of Tripolitza limestone have been caught.1 Slopes 1 Bonnefort, 'Note sur la morphologie du massif du Lasithi', Bulletin de V Association de Géographes français Nos. 334-5 (1965) 27-35·</page><page sequence="299">PHYSICAL GEOGRAPHY 275 ίο ^ oVíí; o^ ο otVy- 1 4-$J&amp;Jn 7n^!^ ° ° ° ° ° ° ° ° ίο ο o^ o o /AL^J^/yr ] I ^T~*S%&gt;3°"" °f ° ° ° KSlam°avkaO ° ' ° ° ° ° iV' I /Or-'/I IkL I I I Np'Malles ° ° ·. ##° ° ° Λ ο ο ο ο vj-&gt; 1 -*- - ' il ' ,^Υι ' Ι , ' lly » ο ο ο #·· % ο o„«. ίο / ο ο ο ο ο ο ο ο ο ο ο vj-&gt; ο &lt;'&lt;/i^JTT ο 'Κ - il f "^&gt;L· 1 , Tlfe ο o ° ο o ίο _Γ?

A region of wild and broken terrain, fronted by white cliffs of marl and gypsum, stretches westwards from about 2 km. east of the Myrtos river. Its principal components are limestones and flysch, but extensive areas of serpentine occur west of Terza and all around Mournies, and out- crops of chlorite and steatite are found in the Sarakina valley below Malles.1 In the same valley copper-bearing rocks occur at Mythoi, as also at Kaloyeroi in the region to the east.2 Heavy folding is apparent, predominantly in a west-north-west to east-south-east direction, and a great deal of faulting has taken place. Between Mt. Aphendes Christos (2 141 m.) and the coast, numerous basins afford opportunities for cultivation, as do alluvial deposits along the Myrtos river. This difficult terrain and complicated mixture of rocks resulted from the thrusting of one mass of material over another by a combination of recumbent anticlinal folding and thrust faulting associated with the Alpine orogeny of Tertiary times. It formed part of a vast system of folds covering southern Greece in a series of arcs around an old rigid block, represented in fragmentary form today by the Cyclades and southern Attica. Much of the overthrust material of this Olonos nappe, so called after a mountain in the northern Peloponnesos, has been eroded away in Crete to form the conglomerates mentioned earlier but, according to Bonnefort (see p. 274, n. 1), it once covered the entire Lasithi massif. The region described above stretches roughly from Viannos in the west to Ierapetra in the east. Within it some 32 Minoan sites have so far been located.3 All of them, including that 1 Cf.

This pattern shows a closer relationship between settlement and cultivated land than that established for eastern Crete, where 18 of the 30 sites known in 1939 were shown to lie on or near alluvial deposits or within valleys cut in schist.1 The Fournou Korifi settlement, however, occupies a ridge of ( ?) Pliocene marls. The situation may recur in Crete and has parallels in the Peloponnesos and central Macedonia where similar deposits were extensively settled in prehistoric times.2 All the Minoan settlements studied in eastern Crete were shown to lie below the 400 m. contour, and today about 62.7% of all com- munities and municipalities in the island are located below the same level.3 As far as can be determined by plotting the Viannos-Myrtos sites on the topographical maps available to the public, the Fournou Korifi settlement and 8 others in its region are similarly located, but the majority, 21, lie roughly between 400 and 600 m.4 Even if allowance is made for undiscovered settlements above 600 m.,5 significance may be given to this prehistoric zonation by the alti- tudinal limit for olive cultivation, 600-800 m.,6 which Creutzberg considered generally critical for permanent settlement in the island, where modern subsistence is based on the wheat-vine- olive triad.7 CLIMATE The nearest meteorological station to Fournou Korifi is at Ierapetra, about 1 1 km. due east. Temperature data (supplied by the Greek Meteorological Service; Fig. in) show that the region is warm all the year round (annual average 2O.i°C). January and February are the coldest months (12.90 and i3.i°C respectively) and July and August the hottest (28.4o and 28.2°C). Although there is an extreme range of average monthly temperatures of i5.5°C, high winter humidity reduces the difference between the two seasons, especially as experienced physiologically (Fig. 112). Average annual precipitation for the 31 years for which records are available is 529.7 mm. (Fig. 113). The inter-annual variability during the 24 years for which annual totals are com- parable was 38.9%,8 nearly as great as for inland stations in Egypt and Syria.9 Fortunately, there is a strong probability that the annual total will exceed 240.0 mm., the minimum which Perrin de Brichambaut and Wallen judged necessary for regular cereal cultivation in the Near East using dry-farming methods. Most precipitation is received in the coolest part of the year, between October-November and February-March (Fig. 114). It falls as sudden, heavy downpours of rain on an average of 9.6 rain-days per month (Fig. 115) and is brought by warm, often dust-laden winds from the 1 Lehmann, 'Die Siedlungsraüme Ostkretas in Wandel Zeiten', Geographische Zeitschrift 45 (1939) 212-28. 2 French, Index of Prehistoric Sites in Central Macedonia (1965.

But none are above 770 m. (Kato Syme). It is clearly the quality and usability of the land up to this height which dictates permanent settlement, as with the 21 Minoan sites above 400 m. 5 For a Middle Minoan stone vase from Kato Syme (770 m.) see Warren, Minoan Stone Vases (1969) 39. 6 Polunin and Huxley, Flowers of the Mediterranean (1965) 3. 7 Creutzberg, Die landlichen Siedlungen der Insel Kreta', in F.

Rain is brought to the north coast of Crete by northerly winds at the same season. After crossing the crests of the Lasithi massif these reach the south coast as drying föhns, sweeping down the mountain slopes in fierce gusts which are hazardous to shipping. They bring much dust and hazy skies. Such conditions may last two or three days and are particularly frequent in spring, though the dominance of a northerly wind pattern over the Aegean basin means that they are not uncom- mon in summer. The period April to October is markedly arid (Fig. 114), with the only rainfall brought by an occasional thunderstorm in late summer (average of 1.9 rain-days per month for the period, Fig. 115). Winds are generally northerly but periods of scorching southerlies occur. 2. Towards a reconstruction of conditions during the Early Minoan II Period, c. 2600-21 70 B.C. THE SETTLEMENT AND ITS SITE The remains of the Early Minoan II settlement suggest that it was originally a complex of rooms similar to the 'closed3 settlements with irregular or circular outlines which Creutzburg recognized as typical of eastern Crete in modern times. Creutzburg related the development of such cellular structures to the need to promote protection against heat and glare, which appear extreme and tend to dominate life in summer. Similar climatic circumstances might then have been a factor in the layout of this Early Minoan settlement. The southern side of the settlement is now at least 17 or 18 m. from the cliffs bounding the seaward edge of Fournou Korifi ridge. Most of its eastern side, however, is only 1 to 2.5 m. back from the top of steep slopes falling to the plain of Tourli, whilst a long narrow building at the north-east corner stands immediately on the edge of the ridge. Its only apparent exit was eastwards, probably indicating that at this point the site was once more extensive. Close proximity to the eastern edge of the ridge points to the same conclusion for it is unlikely, on such potentially unstable material as marl, that a settlement would have been built so near to precipitous slopes. Backward erosion of the site therefore seems to be indicated and would be a direct result of the gradually rising sea level discussed below. Unfortunately, the amount of ground lost cannot even be estimated. Although little soil now survives on the Fournou Korifi ridge, its occurrence on neighbouring features indicates that it was once found here too. The greatest depth may originally have been found on the flat area between the knolls. Clearance of the original vegetation, followed by cultivation, exposed the soil to winter rains. A large amount of material must have been lost annually. After a few years only a thin powdery layer of recently weathered marl would have been left, as now. Such a surface is unstable. In Cyprus a single storm has been sufficient to remove 25 mm. skin of similar material from a wide area.2 Thin soils existing under pines on the north-west slopes of the ridge may have survived from Early Minoan times but it is more likely that they developed after the abandonment of the settlement. A similar secondary development may have been in progress on the flat area of the ridge until it was ploughed during World War II. Rainfall considerably higher than average in 1944, 1945 and 1946 may have been sufficient not only to remove any new soil but also to strip 1 Naval Intelligence Division.

Existing gullies were probably deepened and new ones started in the same period. The ridge top may have been the main area cultivated from the settlement in Early Minoan times. Some activity probably took place in the neighbouring plains also and on the tops and slopes of adjacent ridges, many of which are terraced, unlike Fournou Korifi itself. SEA LEVEL Mention has been made of the beach-like deposits lying on natural terraces cut into many of the marl ridges in the vicinity of Fournou Korifi. These have not been subjected to detailed investi- gation but they seem to indicate sea level changes, and most probably date from the later phases of the Pleistocene. Interpretation, however, is complicated by the instability of the island. Not only is it subject to frequent earthquakes, as outlined by Evans in the Palace of Minos (1928), but it is also reported to have undergone major tilting during the 6th century a.D., when the eastern end of the island may have been depressed and the west uplifted.1 One of the three main theories of world- wide sea level change since the Quaternary era seems to offer some help in trying to establish the local level of the sea in Early Minoan II times. Curray2 has argued that sea level has been steadily rising rather than standing still or oscillating about its present level during the last 5000 years as the other theories maintain. He has been strongly supported by Jelgersmas in a paper reviewing the theories and the available evidence. Curray's graph of the probable rise indicates that c. 2500 b.c. world-wide sea level may have been about 3 m. lower than now. Conformable evidence is available from a variety of sites in the southern Aegean, but not from Crete itself. It suggests a rise of sea level of about 1-2 m. since Hellenistic times.4 The tectonic instability of the region means that such figures must be treated with extreme caution but it is possible that c. 2500 b.c. sea level was about 3 m. lower off Fournou Korifi than at present. CLIMATE Butzer has argued that a number of Vth Dynasty reliefs indicate that there was a relatively wet phase of climate in Egypt c. 3000-2350 b.c.5 The reliefs show wild animals characteristic of African savanna regions against open, undulating desert sands studded with tree-size fig- mulberries and acacias as well as desert shrubs. He was able to support his case by citing the evidence of fig-mulberry {Ficus sycomorus) and acacia roots found in prehistoric habitation contexts in the Western Desert. Drier conditions are believed to be attested from about 2350 b.c. since before the close of the Vlth Dynasty the Nile failed to innundate the peripheries of its flood plain which were covered by blown sand. It should be pointed out, though, that the Nile rises in East Africa and that changes in its flood level must reflect changes in the rainfall well away from Egypt. Evidence for climatic change over the rest of the Near East is diffuse and much of it poorly dated.6 Butzer, however, has attempted to collate the material into a coherent sequence.7 1 Allbaugh, op. cit.

If his con- clusions can be extended as far as Crete, the Early Minoan II settlement on Fournou Korifi would have flourished {c. 2600-2170 b.c.) under less extreme conditions than those prevailing today. However, crude comparisons of the extent of aridity in Turkey 1 and annual precipitation in Crete over the period 1928-46 suggest that variations between at least two parts of the Near East are far from being in phase. It would be hazardous, therefore, to say that conditions in Early Minoan Crete were the same as those prevailing elsewhere. There is little direct evidence for the period of climatic change from mainland Greece, parts of which are nearer to Fournou Korifi than Egypt. Pollen diagrams from Epirus and Macedonia lack detail whilst the fullest one, from Osmanaga Lagoon near Pylos in the Peloponnesos, does not begin until c. 2000 b.c., though it shows that conditions then were similar to those of the present (see p. 281, n. 6). Again it is hazardous to apply these findings to the Myrtos area some 400 km. to the south-east, but they may perhaps indicate that climatic conditions were much the same in Early Minoan times as now. In general this would agree with conclusions based on Butzer's findings. WATER SUPPLY A supply of domestic water is essential for the permanent occupation of any settlement and since textiles were being produced, perhaps in some quantity, at Fournou Korifi additional amounts would probably have been needed for washing and possibly dying the wool. No peren- nial supply of water is now available on the ridge. Marl makes its availability in the past un- likely, too. At the present the nearest water sources are wells in the plains below the ridge. In winter these are supplemented by surface flow in streams. Erosion of the ridge has probably lowered the local water-table but it is unlikely that the Early Minoan II village could have drawn upon any other sources, unless there were springs at the contact of the marls and con- glomerates. Rainwater may have been stored but no cisterns have been found in the settle- ment, though a basin cut into the marls and built round like a well head lay just over 100 m. north-west of it and may have stored a modest amount of water. However, it is by no means unusual for settlements to be some distance away from their domestic water supply,2 and half a kilometre is all that is involved here. Washing and dying would probably have been carried out at the sources because of the distance and volume of water required. 1 Erinç, 'Climatic types and the Variation of Moisture Regions in Turkey', Geographical Review 40 (1950) 224-35. 2 Allbaugh, op. cit. (p. 276, n. 3) 47, reports one village in his sample with no water except that brought from a neigh- bouring village over the mountain. In the Mani peninsula of the Peloponnesos the villages of Kelepha, Krioneri and Skutari are each 10-15 minutes walking distance from their supplies (i.e., half a kilometre or more). Exo Nymphi is about 3.5 km. north of the nearest spring, at Kourno, but is dependent upon stored rainwater, like most Maniate settle- ments and many villages in Crete (Allbaugh, op. cit. 46 and 519; Table A 58).</page><page sequence="307">APPENDIX II. THE VEGETATION OF THE MYRTOS REGION BY O. RACKHAM i. THE ENVIRONMENTS OF THE MYRTOS REGION (a) General topography The Myrtos region (Fig. 1 16) is defined for this study by a radius of 6 km. from the excavation site at Fournou Korifi. Besides Myrtos itself, it includes the large villages of Anatoli, Mournies, and Mythi, and a number of smaller settlements. About a third of the land area is under some form of cultivation. From the crumbling cliffs of the inhospitable coast, wild and confused ranges of hills rise into the interior. The excavation site lies on a seaward spur of one of the hills. The hills near the sea, although rugged (Kolekto reaches a height of 300 m. at only 500 m. from the sea) are of soft limestones, marls, conglomerates, and calcareous sandstones. 2-3 km. inland is a transitional zone marked in the Anatoli area by several small basalt plugs of bizarre shapes intruded through the soft calcareous rocks; in the Mournies area, on the other hand, substantial outcrops of serpentine and other metamorphic rocks occur without interrupting the general relief. Further inland still, the massive hard limestone of the Dictaean mountains rises in abrupt ridges and spurs to reach 2148 m. in Mount Dhikte, 14 km. inland. Several valleys drain this wild terrain. The largest, that of the Sarakino (Myrtos) river, is some 15 km. long, the smallest less than 1 km. Towards the sea they broaden into small alluvial plains which, with the western tip of the Hierapetra plain, are the only flat areas in the region. The largest plain, at Myrtos, is 2 km. west of Fournou Korifi, but two others, Troulli and Sarikampos, are on either side of the excavation hill. Although the country as a whole faces south, the confused topography provides slopes of all aspects. There are frequent precipices, especially in the basalt and hard limestone, and occa- sional narrow gorges and clefts. In summer there is no surface water; even the Sarakino loses itself in the gravel. But much water is collected for irrigation and domestic supplies, and it is likely that there would otherwise be a few perennial streams and springs. Most of the land is covered by scrub of various kinds. Near the sea the scrub is scattered and there are large areas without bushes. Further inland, scrub becomes more continuous, and pine trees, which lurk on the north-facing slopes of the seaward hills, move to other aspects and line the hilltops. In the north of the region the pines are joined by other trees and there are scattered tracts of more regular woodland. The seaward plains are highly cultivated with early tomatoes, which grow during the winter rains, and with bananas, citrus fruit, and other trees, which are partly irrigated. Olive groves are extensive in parts of the Myrtos valley and the Hierapetra plain, and scattered among the hills. Arable is restricted to small areas of reasonably flat land among villages and to tiny alluvial pockets among the hills. The boundaries of cultivation are often indefinite, and ruined terraces and derelict carob trees show where farming has receded. 283</page><page sequence="308">2Ö4 MYRTOS Δ ρ2^|β ο ' TIP ' 5 δ 2001 νν î Malles Λ S R, s %™ ' γ·97 / / { ry } u' is ) ' ; / Mythi Y , / ' is ί' //ÍÍRhL*.'

The records are discontinuous and it is difficult to reconcile the different sources. Reference to Walter &amp; Lieth (1964) shows that Hierapetra, with its very concentrated rainfall and six months of intense drought, has a more seasonal climate than anywhere else in Mediterranean Europe and closely resembles the drier parts of Palestine. There is no systematic information on the differences between Myrtos and Hierapetra, which is 1 1 km. away in much more level terrain. Climatic features will be reviewed in descending order of their probable importance for vegetation. Frost is exceptionally rare and severe frost unknown. The lowest recorded air temperature at Hierapetra is +i.o°C. At Myrtos there was a slight frost in 1968 but it is likely that this affected only the frost hollows of the small plains. Frost probably sets the altitudinal limit for many susceptible plants (e.g., the olive, which does not grow above 600 m. in the region).</page><page sequence="309">VEGETATION 285 Table i.

December) suggests that most rain falls as heavy storms, in which case on most sites much of it will run off and be lost to plants. Air temperature data for Hierapetra are summarized in Fig. 117. It is one of the warmest places in Europe throughout the year: plant growth is seldom limited by low temperatures. No useful systematic data on humidity exist. Field observations in July 1968 showed Fournou Korifi to be appreciably warmer than Hierapetra and extremely arid. Air temperature often exceeded 38°C and once reached 44i°C, while relative humidity fell as low as 20%. I am assured that these severe conditions are by no means unusual. On wind, such information as exists (Fig. 118) suggests that it is strong and very seasonal. The summer maximum, which includes the hot dry sirocco, is the more important. There is no evidence of any serious Treeze-drying' by continental winter winds. No data exist on solar radiation; I am told that the cloudless days of July 1968 were typical of the dry season. (c) Soils Several factors restrict the development of soils in the Myrtos area. The calcareous rocks weather to unstable materials which are easily washed away with the concentrated rainfall and in- complete plant cover. Stabilizing humus is not readily available: the vegetation produces comparatively little litter, which rapidly disappears, apparently by oxidation during the warm winters. Only under pines and inside Pistacia bushes is there a slight accumulation of surface humus. Over most of the area, sheet erosion on slopes and repeated silt deposition in hollows keep soils in a very immature state, with tenuous rendzinas1 and large tracts of unaltered rock. Deeper alluvial soils have developed in the cultivated plains and other flat surfaces with re- stricted silting. Only on the Mournies serpentine is there a stable water-retaining clay, at least 1 m. thick and highly cultivated. Numerous pH measurements were made with a Pye meter on soils in situ or freshly collected. Those in the Myrtos area were within the surprisingly narrow and high range pH 7.1-8.4. The absence of low values is a further consequence of the failure of humus to accumulate. The highest values, all near the sea, suggest the influence of salt spray. 1 Shallow immature soils formed directly from limestone. These examples resemble the Balearic 'xerorendzinas' of Klinge &amp; Mella (1959).</page><page sequence="311">VEGETATION 287 Ο Metres 5°° ./ &lt;^^ ~~~""~ Fournou Korifî Road - - - Closed pine woodland 1 1 *i Î Track - - - Cultivated land ("including olive groves) '' ','.['.'.

Blank areas are bare ground. Soft Limestone, south-east facing slope of about 30o. Type I is a rather variable community of dense bushes up to 2 m. high, dominated by some combination of carob,1 wild olive, Pistacia lentiscus, and Calicotome villosa. Herbs are relatively few, mainly tall grasses and other tall perennials. This is the only cclosed' scrub type of the four (i.e., without gaps between the bushes), and appears to be the least drought-tolerant, being confined to gullies, illuvial hollows, and north-facing slopes. Type II is much the commonest. The typical evergreens are Pistacia lentiscus, forming charac- teristic domed bushes up to 4 m. in diameter and 80 cm. high, and the much less frequent taller and narrower Juniperus phoenicea. The other shrubs are small and grey. Grasses and spring annuals such as Hippocrepis unisiliquosa are prominent. This is a strikingly 'open' community with less than half the ground covered by shrubs and much of the remainder bare (Fig. 120). But underground it is a closed plant community; the Pistacia bushes (as seen in a road cutting) have enormous root systems extending between as well as under the bushes. Scrub type III, transitional between II and IV, occurs mainly on somewhat deeper soils on level ground near the sea. It is even more open than type II, with very widely spaced Pistacia bushes and big tufts of the coarse esparto grass. The curious green leafless shrubby Convolvulus doryenium is characteristic. Type IV is dominated by Lygeum and the silvery shrub Atriplex halimus. Not seen more than 400 m. from the sea; probably a halophytic community influenced by salt spray. Fragments of stream-side communities, requiring ground- water throughout the year, occur in the Myrtos plain, but were not seen in Troulli or Sarikampo. Typical woody plants are Platanus orientalis L. (plane tree), Myrtus communis L. (myrtle), Nerium oleander L. (oleander), and Vitex agnus-castus L. (chaste tree). There are many characteristic herbs. 1 Probably not indigenous; see later.</page><page sequence="314">2gO MYRTOS Further inland are scattered patches of tall evergreen maquis 3-5 m. high. The dominant shrub is Quercus cocci/era L. (Kermès oak) ; the nearest place where this was found is on basalt some 4 km. away. Q,. ^ex L. (holm oak) does not occur in the district. (b) Woodland The only woodland tree around Fournou Korifi is the Cretan pine.1 The closed woodlands occur mainly on north-facing slopes (Fig. 1 19) and are patchy even there; they grade into areas with scattered pines among scrub. The woods appear to be uneven-aged; they show no sign of management and little of exploitation. Trees are usually small, 5-10 m. high or even less, with trunks up to 25 cm. diameter. The sparse tree canopy often covers less than 50% of the ground. Undergrowth is accordingly dense; it resembles type I or II scrub, but with abundant juniper. Among isolated pines, there is a similar range of sizes, but a greater proportion of saplings less than 10 years old. Pine woods are progressively more abundant further inland ; in the igneous zone they are sometimes mixed with other trees such as the deciduous wild pear Pyrus amygdaliformis Vill. and may have shrubby undergrowth of Quercus cocci/era. Tournefort (171 7) found an evergreen woodland of the oaks (λ, cocci/era and Q. ilex and the maple Acer sempervirens L. {A. orientale auct.) above Malles in 1700. About 4 km*, of this remark- able wood still exist in the Selakano valley at 900-1 700 m. altitude. Quercus ilex can no longer be found, but the giant Kermès oaks2 still grow from the limestone pavement and scree, with Acer monspessulanum L. as well as A. sempervirens. Crete is famous for its woods of cypress, Cupressus sempervirens L. ; in this region there are only a few isolated trees in the Malles basin. (c) Cultivation and ex-cultivation Cereals (mainly barley and oats) are now confined to parts of the plains and to good land else- where. On soft limestone slopes, including Fournou Korifi, there are extensive derelict terraces, said to have been last ploughed up in the wet years of World War II. The terraces themselves date from some earlier cultivation phase : the walls contain large carob trees and scrub species not found in ex-arable. Recently abandoned arable passes through a stage with numerous annuals such as Stipa tortilis Desf, Ononis viscosa, and various thistles.3 A later stage is dominated by Coridothymus capitatus, often forming a dense stand to the exclusion of other shrubs (but not of annuals). This stage apparently lasts for many years, the most rapid change being the growth of oc- casional pines from wind-blown seed. The normal scrub species invade very slowly, usually from terrace walls. On the excavation site itself, shrubs such as Cistus salvifolius and Helichrysum siculum suggest longer abandonment than elsewhere. Olive and carob groves (almonds and figs above 600 m.) form another type of semi-cultiva- tion. The wild olive is an important scrub species, but the carob, although usually supposed to be native to Crete, is nearly always planted around Myrtos. When not in regular groves, it is generally associated with cultivation; the trees are all old and do not regenerate, although numerous unsuccessful seedlings are produced. Following the usual Mediterranean practice, the ground under olives and carobs is regularly ploughed. Olive and especially carob growing is in 1 Usually supposed (e.g., Flora Europaea, 1964) to be the mainly Anatolian Pinus brutia Ten. Trees in the Myrtos area have some of the characters of the closely related P. halepensis Miller (Aleppo pine) . 2 Trunk diameter up to 3 m.; annual-ring evidence suggests an age of at least 1000 years. 3 This community strongly resembles the steppe-like Stipa grassland on the plateau headlands of Theophilon and Tsitsina (see Fig. 116), which appears to be much more stable although it too may be ex-arable.</page><page sequence="315">VEGETATION 2gi decline. Many of the outlying groves are neglected, the ground vegetation resembling the different stages of abandoned arable. (d) Minor plant communities Dense beds of the giant reed Arundo donax L. cover much of the Hierapetra plain. There are smaller stands in the other plains including Myrtos and Troulli, and occasional plants inland. These reed-beds may be planted. The cut reeds are an important substitute for timber. Other vegetation types include rudimentary sand-dunes at various points along the coast; the unstable vegetation of eroding sea-cliffs, sometimes dominated by the Cretan endemic Ebenus cretica L.; and the savagely spiny vegetation of roadsides and other disturbed areas.

(e) Relation to other systems of vegetational units Table 3 shows the probable relation of each of the plant communities to (i) the Balkan vegeta- tion types recognized by Turrill (1929), (ii) the Western Mediterranean phytosociological framework as exemplified by de Bolos &amp; Molinier (1958) for Majorca (and only approximately applicable to the eastern Mediterranean), and (iii) the provisional Cretan phytosociological framework of Zohary &amp; Orshan (1965). More exact phytosociological analysis of Myrtos vegetation was limited by the time of year and the invisibility of many early flowering plants. 3. FACTORS LIMITING THE SUCCESSION OF VEGETATION It is generally supposed that the climax vegetation around most parts of the Mediterranean is evergreen forest, and that scrub, grassland, etc., result either from destruction of forest by logging, grazing, and burning, or from succession on former farmland. The unusual aridity of</page><page sequence="316">292 MYRTOS the Myrtos region, even for Crete1, suggests that the scarcity of closed forest might be climatic rather than artificial ; a question which is, of course, very important in relation to early settle- ment. Comparatively little grazing appears to go on in the region at present. It is possible that in winter itinerant flocks may do some damage, but little evidence of cropped bushes and trees could be found. Only in the mountains is there more intensive grazing, but even this fails to prevent the slow regeneration of the Selakano woods. Considering the scarcity of timber and firewood, it is remarkable how little woodland or scrub is cut. No evidence of recent bush fires could be found; much of the vegetation is probably too discontinuous to burn. Although the woody vegetation of the Myrtos region may have been reduced to its present state by human activities in the past, the prima facie evidence is therefore that such activities do not now limit its future development. Limiting factors must be sought in the climate and soil. We start by noting that the fast-growing trees of the district, e.g., the white mulberry, plane, and tamarisk, grow (or are planted) in places where they are likely to be within reach of ground water. The exception is the olive, to be discussed later. The mean annual rainfall at Hierapetra is rather low, and in some runs of years exceptionally low. The concentration of rain, with the low retention of most of the soils, increases runoff and reduces storage within reach of roots. In the dry season, there is an exceptionally severe com- bination of high air temperature, low humidity, long periods of sunshine, and strong winds, all of which tend to increase evaporation. At least at times, the demands on a plant's water supply may be greater at Myrtos than anywhere else in Europe. In addition, the temperature of its leaves may exceed by several degrees an already high air temperature. Drying up and over- heating2 can both kill or permanently damage the plant, or, if less severe but prolonged, impair its growth rate and make it less able to compete with its neighbours or to repair damage done by grazing animals. None of the available trees evades these problems by dormancy, although a few shrubs, such as the mallow Lavatera bryoniifolia Miller (L. unguiculata Desf.), are summer- deciduous. Leaf temperature is important not only for its direct effect on growth but as a guide to 'transpiration' or the evaporation of water. The difference between leaf and air temperature is a measure of the balance between the heating effect of sunlight and infra-red radiation and cooling by transpiration. Plants have a degree of control over their transpiration and can con- serve water by closing their stomata, but at the cost of an immediate reduction of growth and an increased risk of over-heating. Leaf temperature excess was measured with thermocouple needles (Rackham, 1965) on some of the more important scrub species near Fournou Korifi in June and July 1968. Radiant energy, air temperature, and wind were also measured and transpiration was estimated from these data (cf. Rackham, 1966; Gates, 1962). Most species were losing water rapidly and with little restriction. Leaf temperatures were kept generally below 4O°C, so that growth was possible, even if restricted ; but there was a risk of running out of water later in the summer. Pistacia lentiscus, for instance, was evaporating the equivalent of a layer of water 7 mm. thick daily. The total annual rainfall would suffice for not more than about 10 weeks' transpiration at this rate even if it were all available to the plant. The enormous root system of Pistacia in open scrub (Fig. 120) catches water falling between the bushes as well as on them, and extends many metres deep. This multiplies the available water at the cost of diverting most of the plant's 1 The local flora includes such semi-desert species as Aristidia ascensionis (Table 2), a grass widespread in the dry sub-tropics which just reaches the most arid parts of Europe and is very local in south-east Crete (Rechinger, 1943b). 2 The effects of excessive temperatures on growth have been studied in the field by Hadfield (1968).</page><page sequence="317">VEGETATION 293 growth into the root system ; which may be the main reason why Pistacia, although potentially a small tree, is generally a low bush with very small annual increment. Pinus brutia had a leaf temperature up to 4°C below air temperature, and must have been evaporating at least twice as fast as Pistacia (in terms of ground under the tree). Gindel (1964, 1968) showed that Pinus halepensis forests in the Negev transpired and grew rapidly in the early summer. When the soil moisture was exhausted growth ceased and the trees endured the desiccation and high temperatures of the rest of the dry season. The Myrtos pines probably behave in a similar way. The Negev pines are more successful in forming forests than those of Myrtos, perhaps because the Negev, although it has less than half the rainfall of Myrtos, is comparatively humid in the dry season. Gindel shows that the dormant tree absorbs con- siderable quantities of dew; at Myrtos, with its low atmospheric humidity and lack of tempera- ture inversions owing to the land-wind at night, dew appears to be out of the question for most of the dry season. The cultivated olive1 is the only tree to maintain a high growth rate on arid south aspects, where when young it puts on several millimetres thickness of wood annually as well as pro- ducing a crop. The reasons for this are uncertain but a contributory factor is the light-coloured leaf surface (found in many Cretan shrubs, including Atriplex halimus, but in no other tree) which gets rid of radiant heat by reflexion without expending water and thus keeps the leaf temperature down. This physiological evidence therefore supports the view that tree growth reaches its climatic limit at Myrtos and that human activities are not at present the main factor limiting the de- velopment of vegetation. 4. CHANGES IN VEGETATION AND LAND USE IN THE LAST 500 YEARS To reconstruct the ancient vegetation of the area it is necessary first to allow for alterations in historic times, particularly the drastic changes of the last hundred years. Detailed written records of Crete are available from the 15th century onwards. (a) Settlement Boschini's atlas of Crete (1651) contains a view of 'Spiaggia di Mirto' with no buildings in the Myrtos plain save a chapel of CS. Antonio' on the site of the present parish church. Coronelli's map (1690) has no villages on the coast west of Hierapetra. Spratt's map (1865, surveyed 1851- 3) and the Admiralty chart of 1872 show a settlement of 'Muertos' about 1 km. inland, but no villages on the coast. Myrtos does not appear in Pashley's list of villages (1837). There can be little doubt that the village of Myrtos dates from the later 19th century. This agrees with local tradition and with the contrast between the spacious street grid of Myrtos and the labyrinthine hill villages. The same is probably true of the other coastal settlements. Previously the valley had not been entirely deserted : Boschini shows several guardie (apparently coastguard posts2), and Coronelli labels the bay 'Simopesca', meaning perhaps the fishing cove of the inland Syme. But it may have been the decline of piracy in the 19th century which en- abled it to be permanently settled: travellers from Buondelmonte (c. 141 5, published 1897) to 1 The wild olive is found in natural vegetation only on north aspects. 2 Gf. Pococke (1745) II 266. U</page><page sequence="318">294 MYRTOS Pashley mention raids by corsairs as a regular hazard of life in Crete, and Hutchinson (1962, 35) points out the relation between piracy and coastal settlement. (b) Agriculture Settlement in the coastal belt must have been associated with the establishment, or at least the expansion, of farming in the plains. The evidence of annual rings shows all the present olive groves, and some of the carobs, to be less than a century old, although ancient olive trees exist inland. The previous vegetation of the well- watered coastal plains was undoubtedly the stream- side scrub or woodland of plane, myrtle, oleander, etc. Boschini depicts numerous trees in the Myrtos plain, but unfortunately his trees all look alike. This plant community is mentioned picturesquely by Spratt, but has now almost disappeared, though it lives on in the place-name and there is a local tradition of large myrtle trees. The terraces on the easier hillsides may result from arable reclamation by the new settle- ments. The extension of arable and olive growing may have led to a reduction of grazing. In other Mediterranean lands, e.g., Majorca (Knoche, 1923), southern France (Walter, 1968), and the Croatian coast (local information), grazing has declined severely in the last 200 years. There are some indications of a similar decline in Crete as a whole.1 This may be related to the increase of the pine. (c) Advance of the pine There are no old pine trees in the Myrtos region. The age-structure of the present pine stands suggests that the tree arrived in the area about 1850 and has been increasing slowly ever since. The recent increase of Pinus brutia in Crete, paralleled by that of P. halepensis in many Mediter- ranean countries, is attested by documentary evidence, although its cause is uncertain. Buondel- monti, on his extensive and well-documented travels, records pines2 on 'Zeffirum promun- torium' (probably Cape Goudhoura in the far east) and in the Kritsa area. There is a strong indication that pines were sufficiently local to call for special mention. Similarly Belon (1555) mentions cpins sauuages', along with other conifers, among the specialities of the White Moun- tains and the south side of Ida. Boschini's view of Myrtos shows the surrounding hills quite treeless.3 The 17th-, 18th-, and early 19th-century travellers seldom refer to pines; as late as 1864, Edward Lear's water-colour landscapes of many parts of Crete show none. The cumulative effect of this evidence is that the Cretan pine used to be restricted to a few localities,4 whence it has spread to many parts of the island within the past 200 years. This explains why at Myrtos there is no associated ground flora; the undergrowth in pine woods is merely what remains of the pre-existing scrub. 5. SOME CONJECTURES ON THE PREHISTORIC VEGETATION OF THE AREA The vegetation history of Crete is little known. With its basic soils, oxidizing climate, and lack 1 Raulin (i860) states that there were 600,000 sheep and goats on the island in 1837. Allbaugh (1953) gives figures from which the total can be estimated at 200,000 sheep and 180,000 goats. 2 Buondelmonti is careful about his trees, particularly conifers. The identification appears reliable : 'zappinis ... a quibus pix non módica extraitur'. 3 Although the quality ot the engraving is poor, many oi Boschini's other plates show (unidentifiable) trees on hills. 4 The place-name Pefkos, in the mountains 1 2 km. from Fournou Korifi, suggests such a locality. Goronelli (1690) appears to have it as Tefeo', a probable misprint for Pefco.</page><page sequence="319">VEGETATION 295 of lakes, it is unlikely that it will produce a pollen diagram (except perhaps from a cave). The few pollen diagrams of Greece are too far distant to be of much help. The vegetation of Myrtos in the middle ages can be reconstructed with some confidence : uncultivated, but perhaps grazed, hills without pines and almost treeless but with scrub much as now; seaward plains with woodland or dense scrub of myrtles and planes in place of the modern cultivation. We shall see how the evidence for earlier periods requires this picture to be modified. Unfortunately we do not yet know the ecological relationships of the later Bronze Age settlement at Pyrgos or the Roman settlements at Myrtos and Kharakas (Hood, Warren, &amp; Cadogan, 1964). (a) Evidence of plant and animal remains The excavation at Fournou Korifi provided remains or impressions of: Barley and wheat. Vine leaves, pips and ? skins of grapes. Stone of cultivated olive ; olive wood, with evidence of pruning. Quercus (almost certainly) ilex. Pinus ? brutia in small quantity. Reeds (probably Phragmites communis) as support for clay roofs. Bones mainly caprine, but some cattle and pigs (Appendix VI). The evidence of charcoal morphology and anatomy is discussed in Appendix III. The material remains indicate a well-developed, relatively unspecialized, farming com- munity. The climate permitted the growth of oak and was probably slightly less arid than it is now, but was at least as variable from year to year. There was a shortage of timber leading to the structural use of olive prunings and reeds. Pine, though present, cannot have been abundant in the vegetation. Had it been available in quantity, it would surely have been preferred in carpentry, being straighter and more easily worked than oak and olive. (b) Evidence of written sources The classical authors, chiefly Strabo and Theophrastus, give little topographical information on Cretan vegetation. There are numerous references to trees and woods, but Crete is not listed among the timber-producing regions of Greece1 or the countries producing shipbuilding tim- ber.2 The island as a whole appears to have been much the same in classical times as when Buondelmonti described it, with rather more mountain woodland than it has now, much less pine in the lowlands, and a much better development of stream-side and alluvial communities, fens, and lakes than at present. The vegetation pattern of Crete as a whole was probably established in pre-classical times. A slight indication of possible prehistoric vegetation changes comes from Theophrastus's men- tion of the cypress as the chief tree of Crete, which suggests that much of the woodland may have been secondary, 3 following drastic logging, or the retreat of agriculture, at some earlier period. 1 Theophr.

Theophrastus III. i. 6).</page><page sequence="320">296 MYRTOS (c) Phytosociological arguments The phytosociological argument (presented in a modified form by Zohary &amp; Orshan, 1965) regards each of the plant associations as related to, and historically derived from, a climax woodland. Associations belonging to the Quercion Mas, such as the scrub with Quercus coccifera, are held to be derived from an evergreen forest dominated by Q. ilex and Q,. cocci/era. The pre- sence (as in the Mournies area) of deciduous trees such as Pyrus amygdaliformis suggests that in the past there were areas of deciduous Quercus pubescens woodland. Logging, grazing, and burn- ing are supposed to have degraded these forests to the present scrub. In particular, fire is sup- posed to increase the proportion of the resistant Q,. coccifera at the expense of other oaks. The origin of the Ceratonio-Pistacion creticum, comprising much of the oakless scrub com- munities at Myrtos, is less clearly defined. De Bolos &amp; Molinier (1958) derive comparable communities in Majorca from a Ceratonia-Olea woodland which is either a stage in the degrada- tion of evergreen oakwood or a climax in areas too dry for oaks. These arguments are based on the circumstantial interpretation of existing vegetation more often than on historical or stratigraphical facts. Consequently they should be used mainly for filling gaps in more direct evidence. (d) Interpretation and reconstruction The chief remaining unknown factors in reconstructing the landscape of Myrtos in 2500 b.c. are erosion and deposition and alterations in the level of land and sea. Judgement on erosion and deposition (which are related to climatic change) must wait until geomorphological studies such as that of Creutzburg (i960) have been related stratigraphically to archaeologically datable deposits. Direct evidence of the fluctuations of land and sea is hard to come by owing to tectonic movements which vitiate extrapolations from other sites. The presence of Phragmites (ecologi- cally more demanding than Arundo) implies permanent fresh or brackish water or wet ground. Unless the reeds came from a distance, part of the coastal plains must have been lagoons, later filled with silt or submerged by falling land level. We must picture Bronze Age Myrtos as surrounded by low interrupted evergreen woodlands dominated by Quercus ilex (the phytosociological argument being vindicated by actual remains) . On south-facing slopes this would give way to a more scrubby woodland probably dominated by wild olive,1 or Juniperus phoenicea. Much of this more easily cleared (and more inflammable) woodland would have been turned into arable, pasture, vineyards, and olive groves, the last possibly grafted on native wild olives. Enough of the oakwoods remained within reach to pro- vide a proportion of the timber (and possibly acorns for the pigs, as in modern Majorca). Pine, not readily available, perhaps grew on the hard limestone. The coastal plains would have had lagoons with reed-beds. The remainder of these plains would probably be less suitable for agriculture because, although well-watered, their myrtle and plane woods would be difficult to destroy. Given the increased rainfall, the crops would succeed in most years, but there must have been years of disaster. We may imaginatively complete the scene with a few trees of the curious endemic Cretan date palm, Phoenix theophrasti Greuter, which still grows in a few similar coastal localities and may be the palmier recorded by Raulin in the Kalamavkianos valley just outside the Myrtos region (Theophrastus ;2 Raulin, 1859; Hood, Warren, &amp; Cadogan, 1964; Greuter, 1967). Its dates are said to be uneatable, but might have been stomached in drought years. 1 Although phytosociologists accompany the olive with the carob, I reject the latter as not indigenous to the region. 2 Inquiry into Plants II. vi. 9.</page><page sequence="321">VEGETATION 297 (e) Plants usable in the woollen trade The district (and Crete as a whole) is not rich in known dye plants. The most abundant is Quercus coccifera, host of the cochineal insect. Anchusa tinctoria L. is widespread in northern Crete (Rechinger 1943a). The phycos mentioned by Pliny1 as used in Crete for dyeing is probably the litmus lichen Roccella fucoides (Dicks.) Vain., now rare. A woollen industry needs a source of alkali for de-greasing the wool. Salsola kali, a plant traditionally used for this purpose in many parts of the world, grows in abundance on the un- stable cliffs just below Fournou Korifi. Either the fresh or the dead plant, incinerated and the ashes mixed with water, produced a solution of pH 1 1.3- 1 1.9, which is sufficient for the pur- pose. Acknowledgements I am indebted to Dr P.

CHARCOAL (a) Introduction The material consisted of 18 collections of charcoal from various parts of the site. Collections contained from four pieces to several score; it was seldom possible to find any pieces that joined. In some cases the whole collection was examined; otherwise a sample of at least 10 pieces was taken, including all the larger pieces and some of the smaller. The charcoals, broken if necessary to get suitable faces, were examined as opaque objects with a stereomicroscope. An annular fluorescent illuminator proved an ideal light source. Most cellular details could be seen at χ 50 magnification. I am indebted to Dr P. Echlin and Cam- bridge Scientific Instruments for comparing the finer details of charcoal and modern olive wood in the Stereoscan scanning electron microscope. (b) Identification of species Many adequate books and keys exist which make it a straightforward matter to identify the common commercial timbers from the cellular structure of their charcoals. Archaeological charcoals are often complicated by the presence of species other than timber trees and of branches, roots, etc., as well as wood from the trunk. The Mediterranean region contains a large number of possible trees and shrubs, few of them adequately described, and some of them extremely variable. It is thus very fortunate that the Myrtos material can be classified into only three types, all of which can be identified with reasonable certainty, although a full explanation of the variation would require a major study of modern Cretan woods. (1) Olive type (PI. 80). Consisting of vessels, fibres, parenchyma, and rays. Diffuse porous or semi-ring-porous. Vessels angular, small to medium (22-50 μ diam.), often in radial rows of 2-6. Parenchyma usually forming a sheath 1-2 cells thick around each vessel or chain of vessels. Fibres forming a general matrix. Rays mainly multiseriate, a few uniseriate, seldom more than 3 cells wide and 1 2 high ; highly heterogeneous, typically with procumbent cells forming the body of the ray, erect cells in its wings, and a transitional row of cubical cells, but the pro- portions variable and one cell type often missing. The description applies to most pieces of this type, but the proportions of the different elements vary enormously: rays, for instance, range from less than 10% of the total volume to more than 95%· Where growth rings are present, the vessels are larger and slightly more numerous in the early wood ; but rings are often indistinct and many large pieces have no trace of them. The extreme 'degenerate' variant consists almost entirely of thick- walled parenchyma (enlarged ray tissue) with occasional straggling fibres and very few vessels or none : although it has little in common with the normal structure, intermediate types occur and occasionally the two are found in the same piece. 299</page><page sequence="324">300 MYRTOS This is certainly olive, Olea europaea L. The typical structure agrees with the description in Metcalfe &amp; Chalk1 and it and some of the variants are closely paralleled by modern olive wood from Myrtos. Paliurus Spina-Christi Miller (not nowadays found in Crete) resembles olive in many respects but lacks multiseriate rays. It is not yet possible to explain all the variation in terms of different parts of the tree or to distinguish wild and cultivated olive. In modern wood, however, the 'degenerate' structure occurs in the callus-like tissue arising round the stump of a broken-off branch; it is definitely associated with the type of injury that occurs in pruning. (2) Oak type. Consisting of vessels, fibres, parenchyma, and rays. Diffuse porous or semi-ring-porous. Vessels round or elliptical, small to large (16-100 μ diam.), usually solitary. Parenchyma sometimes in tracts associated with vessels, but often indistinguishable from the matrix of fibres. Rays uniseriate and multiseriate in about equal numbers. Multiseriates very broad and rather low (typically 130x600 μ); often aggregate, subdivided by plates of fibres; slightly heterogeneous, with procumbent cells forming the body of the ray and a sheath of wider and shorter cells. Uniseriate rays of sheath cells only. Divided into two fairly uniform sub-types, A and B; A has the large vessels (50-100 μ) which Β lacks. Growth rings vary in distinctness and are differentiated by changes in the frequency of vessels and density of fibres. The only available genus with this ray structure is oak (plane somewhat resembles sub-type Β but lacks the numerous uniseriates) . The very wide aggregate rays and absence of well-defined pore rings and parenchyma bands makes an evergreen oak almost certain : sub-type A is somewhat less definite in these respects than B. The possible species are Quercus ilex L. and Q,. cocci/era L. Q. ilex is well known2 and concordant with the charcoal specimens. The anatomy of Q^. cocci/era appears to be unexplored. Branches of both were obtained from Cambridge University Botanic Gardens. Q. ilex agreed with the charcoals; but Q. cocci/era, unusually for an evergreen oak, differed in its numerous tangential bands of parenchyma and absence of multiseriate rays. We conclude (subject to a study of the variation of wood anatomy in Cretan oaks) that sub- type Β is Q. ilex, and sub-type A is probably a different part of the same tree. (3) Pine type. Typical coniferous structure of tracheids and rays, plus longitudinal and radial resin ducts. Growth rings very prominent; late-wood rather sharply differentiated, its tracheids flattened but thin- walled. Longitudinal resin ducts mainly in the middle of the growth rings; epithelial cells thin- walled and torn. Ordinary rays about 6 cells high; ray-tracheids little differentiated from parenchyma. Fusiform rays with small uniseriate wings; ray resin duct occupying whole width of ray, epithelial cells thin-walled. Little variation. Since this type was found in only one collection, the possibility arises that it might come from outside Crete; the commoner conifers which might find their way to the island must therefore be considered in addition to native species. The presence of resin ducts conclusively rules out cypress and other European conifers except pine, spruce, and larch. The last two are excluded by the structure of the longitudinal ducts and the thin-walled late-wood tracheids. Among pines, the species cannot be determined with certainty, especially as little is known of the range of anatomical variation in Mediterranean pines. Many of the commoner European species, e.g., Pinus sylvestris, P. pinea, and most of the P. nigra complex, are apparently ruled out by one 1 G. R. Metcalfe and L. Chalk, Anatomy of the Dicotyledons (Oxford, 1950). 2 F. W.Jane, The Structure of Wood (London, 1956).</page><page sequence="325">CHARCOAL AND PLASTER IMPRESSIONS 3OI feature or another of their anatomy. The modern pines of the Myrtos area, of uncertain taxo- nomic status, are morphologically intermediate between P. halepensis Miller and P. brutia Ten., although their wood structure has not been studied. The charcoal turns out to be anatomically intermediate between the last two species as described by Greguss.1 The charcoal is thus consistent with what we know of modern Cretan pine ; but certain non- Cretan pines such as P. marítima cannot be distinguished on the evidence available. (c) Proportions of wood types Table 1 shows the number of pieces of each wood type expressed as a percentage of each collec- tion. There is little to be said for using any more refined measure of frequency than this, since the fragments examined are a small, and probably non-random, sample of the wood from which the charcoal came.

The great majority is clearly olive, found in 16 of the 18 collections and forming the whole of 13. Oak occurred in four collections, two from the same room, and pine once. (d) Ecological inferences The most economical hypothesis is that all the timber is local, although the pine could be accounted for by a driftwood tree (an imported artefact is less likely since a branch was present as well as the trunk). Some tentative inferences can be made about the sizes and growth rates of the trees involved. Unfortunately the charcoal fragments are small (out of some 250 pieces examined, only four had a width in the radial direction of more than 3 cm.) and seldom represent more than a small part of the cross-section of the stem. Most of the pine material is from a tree (perhaps only one) at least 12 cm. in diameter. The growth rings are almost certainly annual. Their widths range from 0.5 to 5.8 mm., varying irregularly from year to year (Fig. 121a), presumably because of variable weather; the average width, about 2 mm., is typical for pines at Myrtos at the present day. Some pieces have much narrower rings which nevertheless respond to seasonal fluctuations (Fig. 121b) ; these probably come from branches of 2-5 cm. diameter.</page><page sequence="327">CHARCOAL AND PLASTER IMPRESSIONS 303 The oak material is mainly from trunks 6-8 cm. or more in diameter. Growth rings vary in structure and especially in width (Fig. 121c). It is possible that the rings are not all annual; some might be the 'false rings' produced in oaks by checks to growth during the season. Whether this is so or not, the performance of oak is very sensitive to differences of weather from year to year. Some charcoal is from branches about 2^ cm. in diameter, with much narrower but equally sensitive rings (Fig. 12 id). The olive material is more complex. Most pieces which have growth rings come from stems about 5-8 cm. in diameter. The rings in the middle of the stem are irregular but generally wide; they become narrower and more uniform towards the outside (Fig. 121e, f). Such a growth pattern is determined mainly by internal factors rather than by weather. The stem grows fast in the first few years, reaches maturity very early, and thereafter grows slowly; it is responsive to seasonal weather when young but 'complacent' when mature. This type of growth is common in stems produced by artificial coppicing, pollarding, or pruning. Olive charcoal without distinct growth rings presumably comes from other parts of the tree. The proportion of degenerate material is remarkably high, even allowing for possible differen- tial preservation; such a concentration of wound-stimulated tissue is a further indication of pruning. Most of the olive thus appears to consist of poles and prunings from cultivated pollards rather than from wild trees which had not previously been cut. The presence of oak suggests that the climate was slightly less arid than it is now, though the frequent very narrow rings suggest that the tree was near its climatic limit. The interannual variation, especially in rainfall, was evidently large. Good dendrochronological sequences should therefore be possible in principle, although none of the present material contains a sufficiently long series of rings. (e) Archaeological inferences None of the pieces examined showed positive evidence of a worked face. Most of the charcoal appears to be from roof timbers. This is presumed to be the case (Table 1) where it occurs high in the destruction layer or there are other specific indications (e.g., it occurs inside a burnt pithos) . Many of the other collections may include roof timber, although in some cases the position in which they were found suggests that they may come from specific fittings. It is unlikely that there is much firewood: it is to be expected that a much wider range of local trees and shrubs would have been used as fuel, and many of the rooms are too small to have contained fires. Presumed roof timber consists of branches and 'degenerate' olive wood in addition to oak and olive poles. This suggests that the roofs had at least two layers of timbers: joists of oak and probably olive and pine laid at intervals from wall to wall, with branches and scrap wood laid across them on top. The upper layer would enable fewer joists to be used, and would also be necessary to provide a level surface for the reeds and plaster, since the oak and olive joists would certainly be crooked and need packing. The scarcity of structural timber at Fournou Korifi is remarkable in comparison with the almost contemporary Vasiliki* which had heavy timbers in the walls as well as the roofs. Much of the Myrtos timber is olive, a very unsatisfactory wood compared to oak and pine. The absence of large timbers is not conclusive since they would probably have escaped complete charring and been lost by decay. Nevertheless, the small rooms, and the stone piers and pro- jecting walls which divide up the larger ones, strongly suggest that the roofing of large spans had to be avoided at considerable cost in inconvenience. The largest minimum span of a room in 1 Seager, Vasilike I 209-10.</page><page sequence="328">304 MYRTOS which charcoal was found is 2.5 m., and some were only 1.2 m. across. This indicates that suit- able timber was lacking rather than skill in carpentry. 2. PLASTER IMPRESSIONS Many of the pieces of roof plaster were found with impressions of the material which they rested on. In most cases this consists of reeds (as apparently at Vasiliki). The leaf-sheaths and occasionally the leaf-blades are visible (PI. 82!)), but not the stems or ligules. The possible species are Arundo donax L. and Phragmites communis Trin., both of which are very variable and by no means easy to separate on the evidence available. Arundo, now common along this coast, is usually said to be introduced; Phragmites, whose nearest known station is near Ayios Nikolaos on the north coast, is probably native. Modern Cretan material of both was compared with the impressions. The size (3-12 mm. diameter) agrees better with Phragmites than with Arundo. The absence of stem impressions agrees with Phragmites, since Arundo usually has part of its stem exposed. Other features, e.g., the frequency of ends of leaf-sheaths, are in- conclusive. A characteristic feature of the impressions, the occurrence of alternate large and small ridges, is only rarely found in Arundo and could not be matched in Phragmites. On balance, the reeds were probably Phragmites. This suggests that Arundo was not available. Phragmites is much weaker and would not have bridged gaps of more than a few cm. between the underlying timbers. An impression of a pole about 3.2 cm. in diameter was found, probably one of the upper layer of timbers : it had no surface detail. Finally there was a roughly rectangular impression, about 4 χ 10 cm., made by a nearly flat surface with numerous short shallow grooves, about 3 χ ' mm., in irregular lines. This is tenta- tively identified as the barked surface of part of a large Quercus ilex log with its rows of multi- seriate ray ends. Acknowledgements I am most grateful to Dr P. M. Warren for valuable discussion; to Dr D. M. Dixon and Dr Sylvia Haslam for discussing reed identification; and to Dr Warren and Mr R. Younger for supplying reference specimens.</page><page sequence="329">APPENDIX IV. THE PLASTERS BY M. A. S. GAMERON The excavations produced abundant evidence for the lime-plastering of walls and ceilings or roofs, and, to a lesser extent, of floors and benches, throughout the site. Evidently many plastered walls were given a monochrome wash of dark red paint as a 'finish' ; some evidence was found for the painting of external wall-faces, and even for redecoration. The function of the wall- plasters was primarily constructional, providing smooth and protective coverings to the walls even though these were in some cases very carefully built of stone. The plasters from Myrtos 'Fournou Korifi' confirm and, particularly on technical aspects, amplify our knowledge of EM II wall-plastering and painting hitherto based on study of the plasters from contemporary settlements at Vasiliki and Knossos. The following notes principally concern the wall- and roof-plasters from Myrtos, their composition and physical characteristics, their distribution on the site, their construction and uses. A brief attempt is then made to place EM II wall decoration in the wider context of mural painting in the North Balkans, East Mediterranean and Near East in Late Neolithic and Early Bronze times (c. 9000-2200 b.c.). Finally, the results of chemical and microscope examinations of eight plaster specimens from Myrtos are appended.1 Measurements are in centimetres unless otherwise stated. THE WALL-PLASTERS (PL 81; specimens 1-6) (a) Composition and distribution The materials for the wall-plasters, as for the other classes of plaster in use at this site, were gathered locally and consist mostly of lime (about 63.0%, on re-calculation as calcium car- bonate) with some admixture of silica (about 30.0%), grit and other aggregate, and binding materials such as chaff or hair, now decomposed but attested by 'negative' impressions in the plaster-body (PI. 81 A, left). The wall-plasters are readily indentifiable by their thin depth in cross-section, from 0.6 to about 3.2 or, rarely, a little more; by their medium to fine-grained composition and softish - even friable - texture; and by their painted and sometimes slightly polished surfaces. By contrast, the roofing-plasters are always unpainted and unpolished, and they are much thicker, more coarsely grained and considerably harder. In colour the wall- plasters range from a light pinkish sandy hue to ashy grey (perhaps affected by the fire which destroyed the site) . The relatively high percentage of calcium carbonate and the low percentage of silica and alumina in the Myrtos plasters would seem to account for their relative softness as compared with EM II examples from Vasiliki and Knossos, with only about 40.0% calcium carbonate and 1 It is a pleasure to thank my friends, Dr Warren, for in- (Newcastle upon Tyne), for his expert examination of the vitations to visit Myrtos in 1967 and 1968, to study the specimens, for his generous allocation of time during a busy plaster material and help work on the pottery, and for period to carry out this work, and for his patient explanation supplying the specimens for scientific analysis, and Mr of the scientific results.

Analysis of the painted specimens shows that iron earth pigments supplied the red colour applied to the surfaces of the wall-plasters. This colour may have been prepared perhaps by those producing colouring materials for the pottery and dyeing industries on the site. Only a red or brownish red paint is certainly attested, and a particularly well-painted piece is shown at PL 81B. Other colours derived from earth pigments, possibly including yellow ochres, may have been used occasionally, as, for example, a light fawn colour on the surface of the fragment at PL 8 1 A, right, and on specimen 4. Painted wall-plasters were found in Rooms 17, 53, 54, 60, 79, 80 and Passages 64 and 65. Important evidence for the decoration of external wall-faces came to light in Passage 64, whose east and west wall-faces preserved in situ towards the southern end areas of red painted plaster. Specimen 3 was painted and came from the South Paved Way 93, outside Room 80 and the 1 Heaton, Journal of the Royal Institute of British Architects 18 (1911)698. 2 Further on the divisions of labour at Myrtos, see Warren, ILN 17 February 1968, 26, and 8 February 1969, 27; also p. 266 above. The ILN reports also make reference to the painted wall-plasters at this site. 3 These may have been 'sow-kilns', circular in plan and constructed from alternating layers of wood and limestone to a height of several feet. The wood was allowed to burn for days until the limestone had become reduced to a caustic powdery state. No stone or other enclosures were necessary. Indeed, no stone or brick-built lime-kilns are known in Crete before the Roman period.</page><page sequence="331">THE PLASTERS 307 south-west corner of Room 79. The find place of this piece suggests that external walls of the settlement were plastered. Definitive evidence came from the west wall of Area 26, the west face of which, namely the outer wall of the settlement, was covered with rather coarse plaster, for 34 cm. down from the preserved top. Unpainted wall-plasters turned up in Area 26, Rooms 54, 57, 77, 79-80 and Passage 65, and also in situ over a large part of the west wall of Room 19 (PI. 13B). Here there was a horizontal impression along the lower border of the plaster, as if it had been set over a low wooden base- board or laid to the level of an earth floor (other evidence for which could not be discerned) ; in addition, the extent of the plaster here best suggested that the house walls would originally have been entirely covered with a plaster coating. Another unpainted fragment, with a curved moulding along one axis and there reaching a maximum depth of 3.2 cm. (PL 81D), possibly provides further evidence for the plastering of outside walls since this kind of moulding and a greater depth of plaster are characteristic features where the plaster turns an outside corner formed by two adjacent walls (Fig. 122D). (b) Construction and painting methods These can be described only in very general terms. Over the bare faces of the mud-and-rubble or stone walls was laid a coat of plaster, varying in depth from less than 1.0 to about 2.0 cm., but rarely more. Occasionally on top of this came a second plaster layer, similar in composition to the first but usually a little thinner - and sometimes no more than a mere wafer-thin layer or cintonaco', some 3 mm. deep (as in PI. 81 A). The plaster surface was then given a monochrome wash of paint or left unpainted. Presumably the paint was applied with a brush - by Egyptian analogy, a bunch of feathers, perhaps, or a reed with its end softened by chewing or by beating with a stone; some such means of applying the paint is suggested by the appearance of lighter and darker parallel striations on the surface of the piece at PI. 81 A; specimens 4 and 6, with small markings or scratches on their surfaces, suggest the plaster may have been smoothed out with a float or trowel before painting. Finally, the painted surfaces were lightly polished, a pro- cess which gives them a slight sheen and also makes them more uniform, and harder - and therefore more water- or damp-proof.1 For a fine example, from Room 79, illustrating all aspects of construction see chapter V No. 233 and Fig. 107 No. 233. Specimen 3 indicates that painted redecorations of walls were occasionally carried out. The main body of plaster was given a wash of red paint, clearly visible in section ; above this a further layer of plaster, some 3 mm. thick, was added at a later stage and the new surface was likewise painted red (Fig. 123). Apparently we have here the earliest instance yet known for the painted redecoration of a wall in any Aegean Bronze Age settlement. The occurrence of two washes of paint on this piece brings us to another technical point, namely, the interpretation of a succes- sion of red and unpainted layers superimposed on the main plaster body of the specimen No. 1 (PL 81C).

On one side of the fragment, the layers have dried out and horizontal splits appear separating the layers into pairs of red and unpainted levels : the splits occur below the un- painted layers, to the surface of each of which a red layer adheres firmly. With the exception of the seventh down, the layers are so thin that they can be counted as little more than washes. The red layers certainly contain iron pigment, but they present neither the usual deep red colour nor the 'skin-like' appearance of the paints on other examples - they are light brown and doubt- fully 'painted' layers. What interpretation is to be put on this extraordinary sequence of layers is quite uncertain : one explanation may be that the wall-decorator, for unknown reasons, began 2.5™ r SURFACg =.'&gt;/- -r OT-Swmf- ■ 7- "■?"■«■{' ^ - ~~*~" 9 W? ^ /'"/'////// Ν ^ - II yyy.Hm &amp;°iy *?////, ^.. fig. 1 24 Diagrammatic sketch of plaster specimen 1 indicating layer structure as seen in cross- section. by building up the surface-level of the plaster with six 'red' and unpainted wafer-thin layers, the thicker seventh layer possibly being intended as a finished 'painted' surface : but then he changed his mind or realized the existing surface was not up to the required level or else was flawed in some way, and so he added another six layers in the same manner. Whatever the right explana- tion, the fragment bears witness to a remarkable care in brushwork ! Somewhat similar pieces, but with fewer layers, turned up in Rooms 52-54. Whether the paints were applied whilst the plasters were still soft and malleable (cbuon fresco' painting) or when they had dried out ('tempera' painting) is also uncertain. Possibly a painting method akin to 'tempera' was employed since the paints are film-like and penetrate into the plaster no more than about 0.2 mm. Moreover, there is a clear line of demarcation between definite 'skins' of paint and plasters. On the other hand, it is difficult to explain how the paints were made to adhere so firmly to the plaster, unless a 'fresco' method was used. The exact painting method adopted at Myrtos is, however, best left an open question.1 Reference has already been made to practical reasons for painting the walls, but the possi- bility should not be overlooked that some elementary artistic ornamentation may have been attempted, by contrasting painted with unpainted areas. No patterns of any kind were found, and no use was made of black or white paints although these were included in the 'palette' of the EM II pot-painter. The popularity of red paint in the EM II mural decoration at Myrtos, Vasiliki and Knossos may be the result of easy local collection of the pigment, easy preparation in large quantities, and adherence to a traditional use of this colour for decorative purposes in 1 The classification of the Minoan painting process, whether as 'buon fresco', 'fresco secco' or 'tempera', is much disputed by the experts.</page><page sequence="333">THE PLASTERS 309 general since earliest Neolithic times; but other explanations for its seemingly exclusive use could be put forward, as, for example, a belief in magical properties of the pigment.1 CEILING OR ROOF-PLASTERS (PL 82; specimens nos. 7 and 8) (a) Composition and distribution These consist of very thick layers (8.5 to 16.5 and more in depth) of rather more coarsely grained, sun-baked lime (about 63.5%, as CaCo3), mixed with silica (about 31.2%), aggregate and binding materials - grit, tiny stream-pebbles, pottery chips, occasional large and small stones, chaff and fibrous material. A beach-pebble, some 13.0 in diameter and nearly 4.0 thick, was found embedded in the lower part of the exceptionally thick fragment seen at PI. 82 A. These plasters are very hard, cement-like in texture, and noticeably pinkish-sandy in colour. The upper surfaces are roughly flattened, but the undersides show impressions of reeds or boughs used to support the heavy overlying plaster layers (PI. 82 B, D). Fragments of roof-plasters were widely distributed over the site, turning up in the fill of most rooms. (b) Construction and functions The construction of roofs and ceilings (cf. Appendix III) was basically simple, and made easier by the small size of the rooms. Boughs or thin tree-trunks, about 3.0-5.0 in diameter to judge from the impression in the fragment at PI. 82C, spanned the wall-tops at intervals; cross-wise over these were laid two or more layers of reeds cut from nearby stream-beds (PI. 82 B, D). On top of the reeds one or more thick layers of plaster were spread and left to bake hard in the sun: presumably this work was carried out in the late spring or summer months. This method of roof- construction implies flat or only slightly sloping roofs - sloping just enough to drain off rain- water. A diagrammatic sketch of the roof-construction is given in Fig. 122. This method of building roofs appears in Crete in earliest Neolithic times and throughout the Minoan Age ; in- deed it is still employed in outlying districts of Crete today.2 Two types of roof-plasters seem identifiable at Myrtos : (A) those of a single layer, usually between 8.0 and 1 1 .0 in depth, and (B) those of two layers reaching together not less than 1 7.0 in depth and quite probably more (examples worn). Type A, illustrated here at PI. 82 B, D, was sufficiently deep to provide a good weather-proof covering, but this was possibly the limit of its function. Type B, on the other hand, illustrated at PI. 82C, with a thick additional layer, may have served a further purpose in that it seems designed to support a considerable weight. The depth of plaster suggests type Β was made to be walked upon, either as the floor of an upper room or as a true roof-plaster but one which could stand the weight of heavy objects stored on it or that of adults who would doubtless have used such roofs to lay out grain, fishing-nets, and so on, to dry in the sun. Type A, however, is doubtfully thick enough to have borne such weights and so may 1 Cf. G. Singer, Ε. J. Holmyard and A. R.

Type A is much more frequent than type B. FLOOR-PLASTER Earth-impacted floors are the norm at Myrtos; but south of the kitchen 57 a floor was exposed consisting of an unpainted lime plaster similar in colour, composition (but purer) and hardness to the roof-plasters. It was laid directly over the earth, without any key. The analysis of a speci- men of this, No. 9, is given below. Notes on Mural Decoration in the Ancient Near East (c. 9000-2200 b.c.) As far as we know, wall-painting began in Crete in EM II (c. 2600-2200 b.c.) in the town-sites'at Knossos, Vasiliki and Myrtos Tournou Korifi', and perhaps elsewhere as indicated by surface- finds of similar plasters at EM II Hagios Onouphrios near Mesonisi (Amari region) and on the Maes fig. 125 Distribution of Early Minoan II wall plasters. 1 : Knossos, houses on north and south sides of later palace. 2: Vasilike, House on the Hill-top. 3: Myrtos, Fournou Korifi. 4: Hagios Onouphrios, near Mesonisi (surface find) . 5 : Mt. Edhikte, east of Mokhos (surface find) . hill Edhikte east of Mokhos (map, Fig. 125).1 At Knossos, however, unpainted wall-plasters go back to the early phase of the Middle Neolithic period (c. 4000 b.c.) and, in view of this, it is reasonable to suppose that Knossos may have been the first Cretan site to attempt painted mural decoration.2 Elsewhere in the Aegean area, only the 'House of the Tiles' at Lerna in the Péloponnèse has yet produced wall-plasters of early date (EH II = EM II) and these were apparently unpainted. There are technical differences in construction and decoration between 1 J. D. S. Pendlebury, The Archaeology of Crete (1939) 76, for plasters from A. Onouphrios and Edhikte. 2 Knossos, early Middle Neolithic, House A, wall-plaster of clay found in situ on the interior walls (Evans, BSA 59 (1964) 174 and PI. 38, 1). A gap in the sequence of plasters follows in the Late Neolithic, but extremely few houses of the period have been excavated (those at Knossos being near the surface of the Central Court of the Palace and therefore somewhat disturbed). Unpainted plasters have been found in a firm EM I context in a well recently dug at Knossos (excav. record - Palace Well, p. 34, small-find 20, level 18). A possible black painted mud-plaster fragment comes from an EM II house (Floor VI) near the Royal Road (RR/North Trench LA, level 113; cat. no. RR/'6i/ small-find 370) ; of interest because this is the only known instance of a colour other than red used on plaster in EM II Crete, some ochrous washes ( ? paint) at Myrtos excepted.</page><page sequence="335">THE PLASTERS 3II the Lerna and Cretan plasters, enough to indicate separate origins for this type of work - or at least no direct connection.1 Possibly the Lerna plasters present a development or off-shoot of techniques mastered in earlier times in the North Balkans or further afield in central Europe. 'Reserved' plaster wall- faces are encountered in Periods I- II at Azmak in Bulgaria (c. 5th-early 4th millennia b.c.), in the 4th millennium at Grossgartach in Germany and at Kökenydomb in Hungary, and later in Bulgaria at Karanovo, Period VI (c. 3500-3000 b.c.). Simple geometrical and rectilinear pat- terns in red and white turn up at Azmak (Eneolithic IV) and at Karanovo in the 4th millen- nium.2 The plasters at these sites, as at Lerna, were made from mud or clay with little, if any, admixture of lime. Early polychrome representations on walls of human, animal, textile and abstract subjects are known from Anatolia, Iraq and Mesopotamia, for the most part executed on mud-plasters with thin gypsum or lime whitewashes on their surfaces, the painting being carried out in { tempera'. The exceptional wall-paintings of human and animal subjects from levels III to VIII at Çatal Hüyük in Turkey (c. 6500-5700 b.c.) were depicted on lime-plasters with mud undercoats; red linear patterns from Houses 2-5 at near-by Can Hasan (Layer 2B; destroyed c. 4750 b.c.) were similarly executed although here the white upper coat may have been of clay. Leopards and human figures (common at Çatal Hüyük) appear once more in the temple at Tell Uqair in Iraqon white washed mud-plasters (c. 4000-3300 b.c.).3 Other sites in the Near East have revealed red painted walls : Jericho (c. 6000 b.c.), Teleilat el Ghassul in Jordan (c. 4000 b.c.), and Uruk, Eridu and Tepe Gawra in Iraq (c. 3300-3100 b.c.). But, earliest of all, the Palestinian Natufian houses of about 9000 b.c. had plastered, red painted and polished wall- faces.4 In Egypt, wall-painting in 'tempera' on gypsum or mud-plasters in imitation of textile motifs is attested by Illrd Dynasty tombs; and by the beginning of the following Dynasty (c. 2600 b.c. or slightly later) a sophisticated style of polychrome pictorial representation had come into existence (e.g. the well-known feeding geese from Meidûn) . Seen against this background-picture of considerable artistic progress in wall-painting among the older civilizations bordering the East Mediterranean, the achievements of EM II wall- painting in Crete are modest. With no sure evidence for patterned or pictorial ornamentation, Crete's greatest achievement in this field lay in a certain technical mastery of materials, notably in the use of a lime-plaster such as was rarely employed elsewhere at the time. Only, it seems, at Çatal Hüyük some three or four thousand years earlier, and perhaps at Khafaje in Mesopotamia (where a lime-kiln dating at latest to 2500 b.c. has been found5), were somewhat similar lime plasters manufactured. In Crete some 500 years elapsed before the first pictorial and 1 At Lerna the surface of the plaster undercoat was marked with wavy grooves, as if executed with a comb-like instru- ment, so as to provide a good key for the upper plaster layer: the latter was fashioned into rectilinear panels by means of horizontal and vertical grooves. These seem quite un-Minoan features, relating rather - if at all - to the geo- metric and linear patterns incised with the finger in the mud-plasters of Period II at Azmak in southern Bulgaria (cf. η. 2, for réf.).

Indeed, the idea of mural decoration in Early Minoan Crete, if inspired or brought in from outside the island, would appear to have originated from an area where only the most elementary form of wall-painting was known. But the sim- plicity of EM II wall-painting and its slow development as an art thereafter are equally consis- tent with a local invention of the craft on the island itself - quite independently of progress elsewhere; in that case, Knossos probably has the best claim to its invention in view of its long history in wall-plastering. Once initiated, however, wall-painting in Crete continued without a break until LM IIIB times (c. 1 300-1 200 b.c.) as now seems indicated by recent discoveries at Chania. But some features of later Minoan paintings had become established practice in EM II: among these, we may include the widespread use of lime-plasters, the widespread painted decoration of walls throughout settlement habitations, the application of lime-plasters in one or two layers (later over mud-plaster backings), the occasional use of a slip or 'intonaco', and the popularity of dark red paint. From these humble beginnings there eventually emerged a pictorial art which became the crowning glory of Minoan Palatial and domestic architecture. THE PLASTER SAMPLES The following notes are based on the work of Mr W. A. Campbell of the Department of Inorganic Chemistry at the University of Newcastle-upon-Tyne; some explanatory comments and excavation data have, however, been added. Mr Campbell notes : The plasters have been examined by low power microscope, tested for iron in the pig- ments, and analysed for calcium and silica. The calcium figure has been recalculated for calcium carbonate (on comparison with loss in weight at iooo°C) for ease of comparison with Heaton's results. The specimens are essentially lime-plasters, carbonated by natural processes, and con- taining quantities of silica as sand or larger aggregate. One specimen (no. 8) contains fibrous strands (wool, hair or possibly fine plant roots) in the base mix. Where red and uncoloured layers are detectable, the sample has been taken to include both - with the result that the calcium carbonate figure is lowered owing to the presence of iron in the red layers. Iron in the pigments was detected as prussian blue, calcium as oxalate after soda fusion. The results of six analysed samples and of two others (nos. 4 and 6) submitted for surface examination only are given in the following Table : Specimen Original Silica Calcium carbonate Ferric oxide number location (SiO2) (CaCo3) (Fe2 O3) 1 Wall 28.4% 56.0% 14.0% 2 Wall 30.8 63.2 (painted) 3 Wall 29.4 63.2 4.1 4 Wall Scratches from plasterer's float ?

These results are particularly interesting on comparison with tests carried out by Noel Heaton, Sir Arthur Evans' scientist assistant, who analysed one EM II sample from Vasiliki and another sample of LM II date from Knossos {Journal of the Royal Institute of British Architects 18 (191 1 ) 698 and 699 respectively) : EM II sample : Calcium oxide (lime) 24.90 Magnesium oxide 2.24 Soluble in hydrochloric Carbon dioxide 16.80 acid (61.57%) Iron and alumina !7-23 Sulphuric anhydride 0.37 Soluble silica 0.03 Insoluble in hydrochloric Insoluble silica 37·29 acid (38.43%) Alumina, etc. 1.14 Carbonate of lime, about 40% ; silica, nearly 40% ; the rest, alumina.

From these figures - if, indeed, the very small number of samples for comparison is meaningful - it is clear that the Myrtos wall-plasters (to which class both Heaton's examples belong) have only one-half the silica/alumina content of the Vasiliki sample, but about half as much again (c. 60% as against c. 40%) of calcium carbonate. This perhaps indicates that regional variations in the chemical compositions of EM II plasters should now be expected: Heaton's tests of EM II plasters from Vasiliki and Knossos appeared to give closely similar results from which the im- pression might be gained that plasters of this date might generally have been more uniform in their chemical make-up. But the Myrtos plasters stand in character almost half-way between Heaton's Vasiliki and his much later Knossian samples: the analyses from Myrtos therefore warn against basing chronological inferences for the dating of wall-paintings on the results of chemical analyses - at least until many more samples of all periods have been analysed. The differences in chemical composition of plasters of the same date but from different sites may arise from many factors, notably, varying geological deposits, and differing practices of various local groups of wall-plasterers and painters. The analyses carried out on the present series of wall-plasters have confirmed the impressions of the excavators, noted at the time of digging, that the Myrtos examples are softer and more</page><page sequence="338">314 MYRTOS friable than the plasters from Vasilike, and therefore different in chemical character.

The results of sample no. 9 underline the general chemical uniformity of all the Myrtos samples analysed (see above Table) ; and the relationship between the chemical character of different classes of plaster (wall, roof, floor) and their differing physical properties (colour, hardness, etc.) demands further examination, for the scientific tests have not in the present cases produced significantly different results (no. 1, with a high Fe2O3 percentage excepted, for the reasons already given) . catalogue of samples (excavation data) 1.

THE PLANT REMAINS BY JANE M. RENFREW The excavations at Myrtos yielded several categories of plant remains which shed valuable light on the agricultural economy of this Early Minoan settlement. They comprise finds of car- bonized grape pips, stalks and skins, the uncarbonized stone of an olive, and impressions of a grape leaf and of cereal husks in coarse pottery and plaster. i. Grape Remains Perhaps the most interesting finds are those of the grape remains. They come from two deposits : Sample ι consists chiefly of carbonized grape pips and comes from Room 90 (p. 84) ; Sample 2 which is much larger and comprises pips, stalks and empty grape skins was found inside a pithos, P605, in Room 80. The grape pips in both these samples are notably small in size and roughly triangular in out- line (see PI. 83A) : they give the appearance of coming from unripe fruit. In both samples the state of preservation is rather poor so that the finer morphological details may not always be apparent. Occasional seeds also occur which are much more rounded in appearance, and well above the average size of the grape pips from this site : these I would suggest come from fully ripened grapes. The following measurements were obtained from the pips in Sample 1 : Length Breadth Thickness Length of Stalk 4.0 3.0 2.5 0.5 mm. 4.2 3.2 2.5 0.7 mm. 4.0 2.5 1.5 0.5 mm. 5.0 3.0 2.5 1.0 mm. (Note the greater length and length of stalk in the last of these measured pips) . Out of the sixty-eight measurable grape pips in Sample 2, only fifteen had lengths of 4.0 mm. or over. The largest pip in this deposit measured L. 5.0, B. 3.5, T. 3.0 mm. The average measure- ments and the size range for the pips in Sample 2 are as follows : Length Breadth Thickness average 3.4 2.3 1.9 mm. maximum 5.0 3.5 3.0 mm. minimum 2.5 2.0 1.5 mm. The question arises as to whether these are the pips of wild or cultivated grapes, and the answer is made more difficult to establish by the fact that they appear to be immature. Stummer* pointed out that the pips of the wild Vitis silvestris were small, short and broad with short stalks, whereas those of V. vinifera, the cultivated grape, were narrower in relation to their length and 1 A. Stummer, 'Zur Urgeschichte der Rebe und des Weinbaues', Mitteilungen der Anthropologischen Gesellschaft in Wien 41 (191 1) 284-6. 315</page><page sequence="340">3l6 MYRTOS had longer stalks. The length/breadth ratio of the wild form lies between 54-82 with a peak around 64-5 whereas the cultivated form has a length/breadth index 44-75 with a peak around 55. The length/breadth indices of these Myrtos pips lie between 67 and 80 in Sample 2 and the largest pip in Sample I has a L/B index of 60. This would suggest that we are concerned with the upper range of the overlap between these indices - and possibly with the wild form at the extreme limit of the Myrtos measurements. But it must be remembered that the Myrtos pips seem to be immature, and that an increase in their length and breadth on maturity would possibly place them well inside the index range of the cultivated form. The suspicion that we are in fact dealing with cultivated grapes is given weight by the find in Sample 2 of a number of grape stalks (see PL 83B). The stalks of bunches of wild grapes are stout, and the grapes tend to separate from the stalks when picked, even when fully ripe; on the other hand the stalks of the cultivated grape are more slender and will break easily from the bunch when the fruit is picked. This appears to have been the case at Myrtos. It is interesting to note that Logothetis1 does not indicate any wild vines growing in Crete today, and may be they were only found truly wild in the north Aegean even in Early Minoan times. The find of empty grape skins in quantity associated with these pips and stalks is also intrigu- ing and rather unusual. Two interpretations are possible: that they are remains of raisins which accidentally became carbonized, or that they are the residues of wine-making. The fact that the skins appear to be pressed and empty, even of pips, would favour the latter interpretation (see PL 83C) and I would suggest that we are concerned here with the preparation of wine. The use of immature grapes would not matter so much for this purpose, but would be distinctly odd in the case of raisins. The pressed skins of grapes are used in the early stages of fermentation of wine since the wine yeast Saccharomyces ellipsoideus is usually present, naturally, in the 'bloom' on the grape skin. Red and white wines are distinguished by the presence or absence of antho- cyanin pigments in the grape skins, and whether the skins are present during the early stages of fermentation.2 The final evidence for the presence of vines in the vicinity of the site comes in the form of the impression of a vine leaf on the base of a lekane (see Chapter V No. 232), PL 83D. The use of vine leaves for standing clay vessels on during their manufacture is attested from several Bronze Age sites in the Aegean: there is one good example of a vine leaf impression on the base of a small bowl from Chalandriani Syros, now in the Fitzwilliam Museum, Cambridge; two examples from Naxos are illustrated by Zervos3 and the impression of grape leaves was found on the clay sealing of a Mycenaean jar from Menelaion near Sparta.4 2. Olive Stone The stone of an olive was found in the south-west corner of Area 2, just above the rock (see p. 23). It is not carbonized but appears to have been preserved by a form of fossilization and has lost the roughness of surface usually found on fresh olive stones. It is approximately round in cross-section and over twice as long as it is thick, with a pointed apex and more rounded base. The surface is coarsely grooved and this seems to be more noticeable in the region of the base. It measures L. 12.6 mm.; Th. 5.8 mm. (Fig. 126). 1 B.

On the basis of its length alone it would appear to be the stone of a cultivated olive: Buschani in describing the modern wild olives in Turkey gives the following measurements for their uncarbonized stones, length 8.0-10.4 mm., thickness 4.8-6.4 mm.

Olive stones, and whole olives too, are recorded from other sites in Crete belonging to the Minoan period, but they have not been reported from Early Minoan levels before, save for 'olive seeds' from the EM I-MM I communal tomb II at Lebena, Yerokambos.s At Phaistos^ an olive stone was found in a pithos in Magazine LVIIIc (Middle Minoan II), at Kato Zakro Platon found about 45 whole olives in waterlogged conditions in a well off room XLI in the Palace? (Late Minoan IB). Olive stones are also reported to have been found in an LM III tomb at Lilianas near Phaistos, from the Caravanserai at Knossos,9 where Evans records olive stones and carbonized olives found in the Spring Chamber, and from Palaikastro.10 This find from Myrtos suggests that we must now accept that the cultivation of the olive, which played an extremely important part in the economy of the later phases of the Minoan civilization, began in the Early Bronze age, if not before. The find from Myrtos is at present the earliest known anywhere (save possibly for the Lachish specimen) for the cultivated olive. 3. Cereals Evidence for cereal cultivation at Myrtos comes from impressions in mud plaster. It appears that this plaster was mixed with straw and chaff- perhaps sweepings from the threshing floor. Amongst these parts of the lemmas and glumes of hulled barley can be distinguished. In one case the triplet of spikelets at the rachis internode of hulled six-row barley, Hordeum vulgäre L., was found (plaster sample fallen into P629, Room 82). See sketch inset.

THE FAUNA BYM.R.JARMAN The collection of animal bones from Myrtos was examined in the field in 1968, further speci- mens being studied in the museum at Agios Nikolaos in 1969. The sample of bones was extremely small, totalling approximately 300 specimens (see Table 1 ) . Two factors may have contributed to this scarcity of material. The situation of the site, on top of a cliff overlooking the sea, would have invited an easy solution to the problem of disposal of refuse, which could have been thrown down onto the beach. Furthermore, as is well known, sandy deposits preserve bone poorly, and indeed such bone as was recovered was generally in an exceptionally poor state of preserva- tion. It seems likely that both these factors contributed to the paucity of bones from the site. Table ι . Species Representation 0/ /o 0/ /o Number Identifiable Sheep/Goat 121 90.3 Pig 1 1 8.2 Cattle 2 1.5 Unidentifiable 167 - Total 301 1 00.0 In view of this there is little to gain from attempting an elaborate statistical or metrical analysis of the material. Certain features may be inferred, however, if the data is accepted at face value. Caprines are in overwhelming numerical predominance (see Table 1), and it can hardly be doubted that this predominance reflects a genuine economic situation in spite of the limitations inherent in a sample of this size. The presence of pigs and cattle is certainly demon- strated though they are uncommon. A single claw of a small, crab-like crustacean occurred (not included in Table 1) indicating some measure of marine exploitation. It is worth noting that scarce though they were, there is evidence that the bones were not distributed randomly throughout the site. There were conspicuously fewer bones from the northern half of the site than from the southern half, Room 10 accounting for almost all the bones (23) north of the central area. If the average number of bones per unit area of the site is calculated it is found that they were four times as frequent in the southern than in the northern half. In particular the north-west area contained very few bones, an area equal to about 30% of the entire excavated site providing only three bones or 1% of the total sample. Rooms 37-40 in the centre area contained 23 bones (mostly Period I in date), while to the south Rooms 57, 66 and 91 all had high concentrations (23, 51 and 30 bones respectively). It is obvious that any attempt at reconstruction of man-animal relationships at Myrtos must 318</page><page sequence="343">THE FAUNA 319 be tentative. Nevertheless, certain points should be mentioned. The very low percentage of cattle accords well with the present (and probably the Minoan) environment, which is un- favourable to cattle husbandry. Cattle are infrequent in the area at the present day. The mean annual rainfall of the area is about 495 mm. (cf. Appendices I- II), but nearly all of this is concentrated in the winter, from October to March. In such a situation the problem of produc- ing adequate summer fodder for a large cattle population would be all but insuperable without sophisticated means of importing foodstuffs. The presence of cattle at all may indicate the maintenance of a minimum number of animals for use as draught animals, and it should not be forgotten that cows, as well as oxen, are often used for draught, and that they possess the added advantage of milk production. The small numbers of pigs may indicate that the inhabitants of Myrtos had achieved a favour- able balance of population to resources. The advantages of pigs in situations of high human population pressure are well known, and their apparent scarcity suggests that such a situation did not exist at Myrtos. If one makes the assumption that epiphyseal fusion in the Myrtos pigs took place at a comparable age to that of modern pigs, it can be shown that most (6 out of 9) specimens came certainly from individuals under &lt;z' years old, while 8 out of 9 could have done so. The rate of population increase in pigs is very high, and most of the young individuals born in a year are surplus to the needs of herd maintenance. Pigs thus constitute a source of readily available and quickly replenished animal protein, and this potential seems to have been exploited at Myrtos. The high percentage of caprines suggests their great economic importance. The few measure- ments which could be taken show that the animals were of similar size to sheep of the same period at Knossos, where sheep also constitute a large part of the faunal assemblage. The goats from Knossos are generally larger than the sheep, although the size ranges overlap. Only five bones from Myrtos permitted a distinction between sheep and goat, all five being sheep. This, in addition to the metrical data, suggests that most of the caprine specimens from Myrtos are likely to be sheep, though the possibility cannot be excluded that a few goats were present. Making the assumption that most, if not all, of the caprine specimens are in fact sheep, two main possibilities arise concerning their exploitation. Apart from their value as a source of meat, sheep can be bred for wool. It is unlikely that they would have been kept purely for dairy products, as the milk yield is not high ; milk, however, is likely to have been exploited as a by- product of some other economic process. The osteological data from Myrtos does not allow a certain choice to be made between the other two possibilities, but there are indications which make possible the hypothesis that the sheep at Myrtos were primarily bred for wool. One of the commonly used criteria by which domestication has been recognized is the extraction from animal populations by man of an age-biased surplus. It is argued that if man is able to control his animals to a large extent, he will be able to cull from the herd all those young animals which, in any year's crop, may be surplus to the requirements of herd maintenance. In any herd the majority of young males constitute such a surplus, as may a certain number of females if the herd is not required to increase. So, if meat production is the object, we may expect that a large percentage of the animals represented in the archaeological sample will be immature individuals. If, however, wool production is of importance, the maximum number of animals would be maintained in order to increase the crop, only those animals being slaughtered which raised the sheep population above the optimum in relation to available natural resources. In this situation we would expect a low percentage of immature animals. The data from Myrtos will not extend to unequivocal results, but the percentage of immature specimens is not as high as might be expected were the prime utilization of the sheep as a source</page><page sequence="344">320 MYRTOS of meat. The seven caprine teeth in the collection are all permanent rather than deciduous, and are in a worn condition, and the majority of the limb bones are fused. It must be admitted here that it is possible that a community may prefer well-matured meat, and that such a situation could be difficult to distinguish from one in which wool, rather than meat, were the important crop. The Myrtos osteological data does not allow the exclusion of such a hypothesis, but the alternative, that the sheep were bred partly for wool, is as likely.</page><page sequence="345">APPENDIX VII. THE SHELLS BY N. J. SHAGKLETON Unfortunately the writer of this appendix was not able to work on the site of Myrtos. However, all the shells found during excavation were preserved and were examined in the museum of Ag. Nikolaos during short visits in 1967 and 1969. It should be remarked at once that the total number of shells examined was relatively small - only just over three hundred. By contrast, the Neolithic site of Saliagos1 yielded some twenty thousand shells, and even so it was estimated that shellfish only comprised about 1 % of the protein diet of the prehistoric inhabitants.

All the shell records are contained in Table 1 . It will be seen that by far the most abundant genus is Patella, which makes up about 70% of all the shells (PL 84c, lower row). Practically all are P. coerulea. It appears highly likely that these shells represent food refuse. The quantity represented is very small; however, this may only be the result of the fact that the inhabitants lived in a tidy fashion, and that the area excavated does not include food refuse pits. Fig. 127 contains a histogram of the size (largest diameter) of a random selection of the limpets; it is notable that they are on the whole small. Whether this is a reflection of the size of limpets eaten, or merely of the fact that the smaller ones are more likely to be overlooked in the sweeping up, one cannot tell. At any rate, with the second alternative in mind it would be foolish to speculate on the implication of the first. Table 2.

In most early sites, the inhabitants appear to have eaten limpets and top-shells (Monodonta turbinata) indiscriminately, the reason being that both occupy the same ecological habitat and so are conveniently collected together.1 Here, we have only recorded 3 shells of the latter; this 1 At Saliagos the top-shell was the commonest species gathered after limpets (Shackleton in Evans and Renfrew, op. cit., 1 3 1-2). At Neolithic Khirokitia top-shells formed over 90% of the assemblage (G. L. Wilkins, in P. Dikaios, Khirokitia (1953) 438).</page><page sequence="348">324 MYRTOS surely implies a selectivity on the part of the inhabitants (it is remarkable how selective the Minoans at Knossos are observed to be in the matter of shellfish consumption, by contrast with their Neolithic precursors). It appears, then, that the inhabitants of ancient Myrtos ate limpets but no other shellfish. The Patella shells are not specially localized in the settlement save for those in Rooms 37-39, Period I levels. These rooms and the surface levels over them contained 30% of all Patellas. That the next most abundant shells should be conches and cowries is in itself most remarkable. It is also curious that none of the conch fragments show any sign of having been worked. At Knossos conch was certainly worked, and we know that in the latest phase of the Saliagos Neolithic occupation conch shells was already used for ccut to shape5 spoons. One might con- sider the possibility that this was another source of food; the Cretans today are certainly aware of their edibility. However, the distribution of the fragments is not easily explained if this is the case. Of the 27 conch fragments and whole conches, 23 (about 85%) are not associated with a single limpet. By contrast, only 13% of limpets are not associated with another of the same species. Clearly the two groups have entirely different distribution patterns over the site, suggesting that if the limpets represent food refuse, the conches do not. Furthermore, an ex- amination of the whole conches shows that of these at least 2 were certainly not collected with a living animal inside, since there are bryozoan encrustations on the inside surfaces. One of the whole conches has sufficient of the end broken off to enable it to be sounded as a trumpet (Period I level below Room 28) (PL 84D, right). There is also a faint trace of what could be red pigment on the shell. Another (Area 30, south-west corner) has a hole broken in the side, near the tip. Unfortunately the shell is too badly damaged to sound, but it is not im- possible that this was also used as a trumpet (side-blown). Each of these 2 shells is from a Period I context. The other 2 conches (PL 84D, left) are in such a condition that it is not possible to draw any conclusions regarding their former use, though in neither case is their use as trumpets excluded. Like the conches, the cowries (PL 84C, middle row) have a distribution pattern quite different from that of the limpets. Of the 25, only 6 are associated with any limpets, whereas if they had the same distribution one would expect only about 3 to occur without limpets. On the other hand, they clearly do not simply occur at random ; the occurrence of 3 together in the southern 'pot cupboard' in Room 80 would be extremely unlikely were cowries distributed at random over the site. Eight cowries came from surface contexts in the central and southern areas. This may be compared with the 21 (10%) of limpets from surface levels; it is a curious feature whose true explanation may elude us. We have already drawn attention to the fact that food refuse is rather scarce at this site; that is to say, we are not examining a rubbish dump. It is possible either that such food refuse as we do find is the bits 'swept under the carpet', shells that fell between the stones of the floor, into nooks and crannies, and so on, or that it represents the remains of the terminal occupation. In the latter case it would either represent the remains of the inhabitants who deserted the village, or were driven out, or else it might be the relics of subsequent fisher- men or goatherds who simply sheltered for the odd meal in what would already have been burnt ruins. The rather distinctive distribution of limpets over the site does not seem consistent with this last suggestion. If either of the first two possibilities is correct, then the limpets give us evidence of the rooms used for eating. In either case, the shells were probably left on the floor. The fact that the cowries are now found dominantly at a higher level suggests either that they were initially physically higher in the buildings - on the roofs, on shelves, decorating the walls, or else that the upper</page><page sequence="349">THE SHELLS 325 levels are by and large representative of some particular part of the settlement at the highest part of the hill from which material has now washed down over the rest of the site. The discovery of 4 cowries together in the cpot cupboard' in Room 80 is particularly fascinat- ing. These must surely have been intentionally put in a particular place, in contrast to most shells which happen to have been left around. This in turn supports to some extent the sugges- tion that the distribution of the cowries may be due to their having been physically higher in the rooms, on shelves and so on, than the limpets. The remainder of the shells comprise a group of 24 examples from five different species all rather similar in habitat and size, and 16 others. The group to be considered together consist of the following (number of specimens in brackets) : Thais haemastoma (1); Cymatium parthenopium (4); Tonna galea (1); Cassidaria echinophora (10) and Murex trunculus (6) . Only a quarter were associated with limpets ; this suggests that they were not eaten. Like cowries, most of these species are not common, and certainly if they had been collected indiscriminately then there would have been more Murex in comparison with the other rarer species. Most appear, even where they are now broken, to have been collected in good condition ; this may mean that they were collected alive, or simply that they were collected on the beach by reasonably discerning persons. In either case, they were probably selected for their variety, that is for aesthetic reasons. The fact that there are only 8 small bivalves (7 Glycimeris, 1 Venerupis) may be a reflection of the type of coastline, such as an absence of sandy beaches in the immediate vicinity. On the other hand such species may simply not have interested those collecting. Three of these 8 are associated with reasonable numbers of limpets, and there seems a possibility that those which are present are food refuse. Two of the Glycimeris shells appear to have been utilized. It is possible, therefore, that the association of this species with limpets is related to their use as eating implements rather than to their being eaten themselves. If, as we surmise, there were no sandy beaches near by, then it is unlikely that even one or two would have been brought home to eat; on the other hand, their habitat may well have been close enough that the shells were available for collection as spoons or scrapers. In addition there is 1 Dentalium sp., 2 Cerithium vulgatum, 1 Columbella rústica, and 2 fragments of Spondylus gaederopus. Of these, one can say little other than to repeat that perhaps the range of species is greater than one would expect if chance alone were responsible for their presence in the deposits. The only point to remark upon is that one of the Spondylus fragments is the only shell to show definite evidence of having been worked (the conch 'trumpet' mentioned above happens to be broken in such a way that the writer can sound it rather loudly, but there is in fact no evidence either that a Minoan intentionally broke the end, or that he discovered its sonority). Unfortunately, this Spondylus fragment is badly burnt, but there is no doubt that it is Spondylus and that it is worked. It is part of the hinge end of an upper valve, worked as if it were part of a so-called bracelet. The preserved length is about 30 mm., and the cross-section about 1 1 mm. by 10 mm. The provenance is Room 83, north-east corner. The other fragment came from Room 57. Finally, we may remark that among the shells examined were a few fossils. At first, these were assumed to be present by chance, since fossiliferous rock is close by the site. However, one cannot exclude the possibility that the occupants collected fossils as well as shells. Certainly a variety of different species in elegant condition were present. γ</page><page sequence="350">APPENDIX VIII. THE OBSIDIAN BY M. R. JARMAN One hundred and eighty-one specimens of obsidian and 2 of a greyish green chert were re- covered. The industry was evidently aimed primarily at the production of fine parallel-sided blades, which form about 70% of the assemblage (see Table 1). The rest of the industry consists largely of unretouched flakes and chips, only two cores being found. Table i.

It seems likely that the flakes were in the main a by-product of blade-production, being primary or secondary core-preparation flakes. In particular there occur several examples of core-preparation flakes of the lame à crête type com- mon in blade industries from the Upper Palaeolithic onwards. However, a few flakes had been retouched or utilized, and some may have been struck specifically for use as tools. Of the two cores one is a worked-out blade core from Room 60, the other being either intended for the production of flakes or an unfinished blade core. The existence of the cores, and the presence of 13 specimens retaining surface cortex indicates that the material was imported to the site in a raw, unfinished condition. With a total of only 26 retouched pieces it is unlikely that any regular tool types would emerge. The retouch itself is very varied (including abrupt blunting retouch, semi-abrupt retouch, and flat or invasive retouch), and its function appeared to be more to effect minor changes in the outline of the tool than the manufacture of well-defined forms. The single excep- tion to this (see Fig. 128 No. 35) is a small blade-section which shows deliberate truncation and a concave retouched edge. This appears to be best explained as an element of composite tool, but its precise function is not evident from the available data. Fig. 128 and PL 84B show a selection of the pieces recovered. The obsidian was far more evenly distributed over the site than the bone, although again there is some evidence that the north, and particularly the north-west corner, had fewer pieces per unit area than other parts of the site. Here an area approximately 30% of the total excavated 326</page><page sequence="351">THE OBSIDIAN 327 area contained only 10% of the obsidian. The only notable concentration occurred in Rooms 37-40. Here there were 24 pieces, of which 1 1 came from pure Period I levels, 2 from Period II, 6 from mixed I- II and 5 from surface levels. The Period I levels in these rooms were the only instance in which a high concentration of obsidian and bone coincided, there being no apparent pattern of association elsewhere on the site. 1 till y II 2 c ' IGk) f 1 1 J H / 7 9 10 12 fig. 128 Typical specimens of obsidian. 1: Room 57, floor. 2: Areas 68-69, fill. 3: Areas 68-69, fill. 4: Surface over Room 60. 5: Room 20, floor. 6: Surface over Rooms 88-92. 7: Area 26, vase deposit. 8 : Surface over Rooms 27 and 28- Area 31.9: Site surface. 10 : Room 20, floor. 11: Room 18, vase deposit. 12: Room 17, destruction fill. 13: Room 57, vase deposit. 14: Room 76. 15: Room 60, vase deposit. 16: Surface over Rooms 52-53. 17: Room 79, vase deposit, north end. 18: Room 57, vase deposit. 19: Surface over Rooms 41-43. 20: Room 91, vase deposit. 21: Room 49, level on bedrock (Period I). 22: Room 54, destruction fill. 23: North Rubbish Area 2. 24: Surface over North Rubbish Areas 2-3. 25: Room 38, north end (Period I) . 26 : Area 30, pit in bedrock (Period I) . 27 : Cell 9, fill. 28 : Surface over Rooms 37-41 . 29 : Room 79, destruction fill in centre. 30 : Surface over Rooms 1 9-20. 3 1 : Room 29 and Area 30, fill. 32: Rooms 41-43, fill. 33: Room 80, destruction deposit in centre. 34: Below Room 28 (Period I) . 35 : Room 34, fill.</page><page sequence="352">328 MYRTOS il y I iß ^ ' 'l' ι f il 2° ^ ρ w 'w 4/ 19 17 18 21 22 23 24 i I . ! -i ! uV S· y !j' U | 26 27 28 25 ï-it fPl ί!"Π] i"O"i UJ J Ï30 3r 32 ÍD1 B'iïll mi (U U ï i W El 35 33 34</page><page sequence="353">APPENDIX IX. ELECTRON MIGROPROBE METAL ANALYSIS BY ELIZABETH A. SLATER The analyses were made on a small sample of the dagger (Chapter V, No. 9) from the Period I, Early Minoan IIA level below Room 28. The sample consisted mainly of corrosion product with a section of metal about 1 mm. thick in the centre. The corrosion product was analysed on an X-ray spectograph with the result : copper 37.2%, sulphur 0.7%, silicon 3.2%, lead 3.02%, bismuth 0.01%. Tin, zinc, nickel, silver and arsenic were not detected. The limit of detection varies for each element but it can be assumed that if elements had been present in concentrations greater than 0.01% they would have been detected. But analysis of corrosion product is not very useful, since several elements, e.g., tin, tend to be leached out and their presence or absence is not significant. The silicon was presumably picked up during smelting. An analysis was made of the inner metal, on an electron microprobe, in three different regions, with the results in percentages : 1 2 3 Cu 82.3 82.6 82.8 Copper Si 4.8 2.7 4.9 Silicone Pb 3.2 2.7 2.9 Lead Zn 1.8 1.7 1.45 Zinc Sn 1.4 1.6 2.1 Tin Ni 1.4 1.4 ι. ο Nickel As - - - Arsenic The percentage of tin is not sufficiently high to indicate conclusively that it was added intentionally. As the sample was so thin some elements may have been partially or fully corroded or leached out and so this analysis may be not a true composition of the original material. The microstructure of the metal was not sufficiently good for any indication of the method of manufacture of the dagger, e.g., whether the edge had been hammered after casting. 329</page><page sequence="354">APPENDIX X. CHROMATOGRAPHY ANALYSES FOR LIPIDS IN CLAY BY D. BOWYER The purpose of these analyses was to identify any lipids or fats which might have soaked into the interior bases of vases, and thus to gain information about the original contents. Method. The fragments of pottery were first weighed and then pulverized with a pestle and mortar. The powder was then extracted with a lipid solvent, chloroform : methanol :: 2 : 1, for 1 hour at room temperature. Afterwards the powder was filtered off, the extract washed with 0.9% saline to remove unwanted inorganic ions and the lipid-containing chloroform phase evaporated to a small volume. The total lipid was then determined with a micro-balance and approximate amounts separated by thin-layer chromatography in order to establish the component fractions. In the thin-layer chromatography procedure the lipid solution is spotted on to a thin layer of silicic acid on a microscope slide and then a solvent of petroleum rdiethyl- ether : ethyl acetate : acetic acid : : 90 : 5 : 3 : 2 is allowed to ascend the plate. The solvent is then dried off and the separated lipids are made visible by charring them with concentrated sul- phuric acid. Results. The first two samples were from the interior bases of the lekane, P532, and the pithos, P635. The lipid weights per 10 grams of dry material were: P532 0.644 mg. P635 0.512 mg. These weights are probably not significantly different. The thin-layer chromatography plates showed the lipids indicated in the chart. P 532 P 635 Jg£ HYDROCARBONS ^Ë ^^ CHOLESTEROL· &lt;==&gt; BSTERS - - TRIGLYCERtDES - - FREE FATTY ACIDS FREE CHOLESTEROL ^^ PHOSPHOLIOIDS £==5 From this we may conclude that the tub, P532, contained much more cholesterol and cholesterol esters than did the pithos, P635. These two components are characteristically of animal origin ( ? wool) . The triglycéride component, which occurs in both animal and vegetable fat stores, was similar in both. It therefore seems that the tub was connected with animal and not with vegetable fats. Ten other samples were analysed, from P83 (amphora), P333 (cooking pot), P528 (lekane), P565 (piriform jar), P566 (piriform jar), P669 (spouted jar/teapot). One of the samples from 330</page><page sequence="355">CHROMATOGRAPHY ANALYSES FOR LIPIDS IN CLAY 331 P669 was a fragment of the handle, which was unlikely to have a bearing on the interior con- tents and thus acted as a control. In every sample hydrocarbons, triglycérides and free fatty acids were separated. Free cholesterol was not present. They may have contained a little cholesterol ester, but in the absence of free cholesterol this is doubtful. From these ten analyses with uniform results it may be concluded that there is no evidence to make the distinction that some pots were used for olive oil (which might have shown a lot of triglycérides) and others for dyeing or washing wools (which might have contained a lot of cholesterol). The absence of cholesterol and the presence of triglycérides might suggest that the pots were all connected with vegetable and were not connected with animal fats, but it is more likely that these results are indeterminate and that the lipids have been lost or degraded with the passage of time. The fact that the lipid content of the handle fragment from P669 was not different from that of the body confirms this negative conclusion. On the other hand the positive evidence for the animal contents of the tub, P532, holds good.</page><page sequence="356">APPENDICES XI AND XII. FIRING TEMPERATURES AND CLAY ANALYSES Appendices XI and XII are concerned with these questions. The fourteen samples were the same in each case, i.e., each of the fourteen sample sherds was broken in two, one half being submitted to Mr Barron, the other to Dr Astbury. Thus the presence of kaolinate in sample 13 (Appendix XII) suggests that Mr Barron's figure of &lt;88o°C for the firing ofthat sherd can be further reduced to &lt;5OO°C since kaolinite decomposes at about this temperature.1 The fourteen samples belong to all the main pottery fabrics classified in Chapter IV, p. 94f, as follows : 1. Period I cooking pot fabric, orange/brown with prominent white grits. Fabric 8. 2. Vasilike ware (classic). Fabric 1. 3. Fine grey burnished ware. Fabric 7. 4. Thin orange with tiny white grits, from piriform jar P586. Fabric 6. 5. Thin orange with tiny white grits, from piriform jar P565. Fabric 6. 6. Pure fabric, red/brown painted and burnished. Fabric 1. 7. Hard orange/buff with dark and white grits ; buff slip. Myrtos ware jug fragment. Fabric 2. 8. Fine, sandy, orange/brown with small white grits, from amphora P79. Fabric 3. 9. Hard, grey to orange, with dark and white grits; fragment of black painted jug. Fabric 2. 10. Pithos fabric, coarse, brown to deep pink, with grits; buff slip with dark trickle decoration. From pithos, P640. Fabric 4. 11. Fragment of cooking pot, P335. Fabric 5. 12. Greyish to orange/buff, with grits; red-dark painted. Fabric 2. 13. Fragment of baking plate (cooking pot fabric), Pi 15. Fabric 5. 14. Fine, pure, very pale buff. Fabric 9. Two interesting points emerge. (1) Mr Barron's conclusions 3-6 (see below) are in agreement with the author's analysis of fabrics (p. 94f.). (2) The unidentified mineral in Appendix XII Nos. 4, 5 and 8 distinguishes these samples from all the others. This is neatly confirmed by the fabric analysis (p. 95) since all three samples are of thin, orange fabric with tiny white grits and its similar but thicker variant, amphora fabric. These are quite distinct visually from the other fabrics. Since this '8.3Â fabric' is used for the largest vessels, amphorae, it is most probable that a local clay bed was being employed. As most, if not all the vessels in the other fabrics must be local it is thus clear that at least two distinct beds were exploited by the Myrtos potters. 1 M. S.

Temperature in pottery is a factor inseparably linked with time and at least partially connected with firing atmosphere. A potter fires his ware until it is 'done'. In other terms a higher temperature for a shorter time can, in some degree, produce the same result as the reverse, and a reduced, or partially reduced pot is less porous than an oxidized one. 2. Primitive kilns must have been very uneven in temperature and measuring devices largely subjective; the prevailing atmosphere also would vary in different parts of the kiln so pieces would vary considerably even when intended to be the same. 3. On some sherds, particularly thick ones, there is evidence that the surface of the ware is fired higher than the core, i.e., very quick (flash firing) at the end. The only approach to the problem available to me is based on a hypothesis that porosity of the ware declines as 'degree of firing5 increases, that is that 'sintering' or partial melting of the ware takes place in a greater degree the higher /longer the ware is fired. So if one can determine the point at which the porosity of the ware begins to decline one can assume that it was not fired above that point. This method, however, presents several snags : (a) Repeated firings may falsify results - see ι above. (b) Clays normally show little perceptible change in this respect between temps, of 6oo° and 9OO°C. The onset of the glassy phase, due to the interaction of fluxes (potash, soda, lime, magnesia) and alumina and silica in the clay, is very sluggish up to this point. Since all the samples are unfused, i.e., fired apparently lower than the point where this begins, changes in porosity may be very slight and beyond my detection. (c) As mentioned above the atmosphere in which the pot was fired makes a great difference to porosity. In solid fuel kilns the kiln atmosphere will vary with each 'baiting' of fuel from smoky reduction, through a neutral phase to oxidizing. The predominating atmosphere will be a matter of skilful manipulation on the part of the firer and the final stages will be critical. An oxidized or reduced condition only becomes stabilized when a fair degree of melting has taken place, which is not the case here (except possibly where pigments are concerned) . In refiring the sherds one is almost bound to upset this degree of reduction factor, which makes it difficult to determine a final weight from which to calculate porosity. (d) The sherds during their history will have been used and will have been exposed to weather and have absorbed soluble matter. Some of this will wash out on soaking and some will have been rendered insoluble by chemical processes and will remain in the ware or on its surface. Such matter is likely to be alkaline and to act as a flux in refiring, increasing the degree of sintering. (This proved to be very much the case, as can be seen by the losses in weight on initial soaking and the much higher degree of fusion on the old broken edges compared with the fresh breaks.)</page><page sequence="358">334 MYRTOs Method Adopted ι . The sherds were broken in two, one half being kept for comparison and to test for the shrinkage that accompanies sintering by refitting the pieces together. 2. A small portion of each was carefully crumbled, the powder being examined under a strong glass to determine where tempering substances had been used. 3. The test fragment was then weighed (original dry weight). 4. Soaked in several changes of water for some days to wash out solubles. 5. Carefully wiped and weighed (original saturated weight). 6. Dried thoroughly and weighed (washed weight) . 7. Percentage solubles calculated, percentage porosity calculated on washed weight. 8. They were then fired five times, to 7100, 880o, 940o, 1050o and ii2O°C. The firings took approx. 4 hours to minimize 'time sintering' and were strictly oxidizing. Temperatures were measured by seger cones rather than pyrometer, a time-temperature measurement. 9. At each stage the sherds were (a) visually examined for changes and fitted to the control sherds (b) weighed dry (c) soaked in water for 24 hours and weighed (d) percentage porosity determined. 10. Percentage loss in weight from washed weight to final weight was also calculated. The interpretation of these results has given me much thought, mainly because of the complica- tions mentioned above. I have expressed them as a Porosity Curve based on the dry weight at 7ΐο°0 (Fig. 129). My conclusions about firing temperatures, where I have any, are given under the reports on the individual samples. The dramatic decline in porosity in most cases between 1050 and 1 120 is to be expected as these clays are by their colour high lime clays and are consequently sure to melt suddenly.2 SAMPLE FIRING TEMPERATURES 7io°C 88o°C 94o°C io5o°C ii2o°C 2 27.5 26.0 25.8 25.5 4.8 3 23.0 21.5 21.8 21.8 6.8 ν 5 ιΊ·5 19-3 i8.8 17.1 2.8 g 4 14.5 18.0 18.0 18.0 4.2 g ι 13.5 15.3 h 6 23.5 18.8 19.1 18.7 6.7 g 7 20.5 20.5 20.6 19.6 0.6 »j 8 15.8 15.8 15.9 15.9 6.4 g 14 23.0 23.0 23.0 23.0 5.5 S ΙΟ I9.8 I9.3 I9.O I9.O 2.8 à 12 17.8 17.5 16.8 16.8 5.9 w 9 16.8 16.8 15.8 14.8 2.8 11 12.9 12.7 12.0 11. ο ΐ·5 13 12.8 ΐΐ·9 ii.g 9.2 1.5 Percentage porosities of samples in relation to firing temperatures.

None of these sherds were fired above iooo°C and some were considerably lower than this. 9 out of 14 were probably fired below 88o°C. 2. All showed some loss of weight on firing in an oxidized atmosphere (up to 11%). This might be taken to indicate the degree of reduction they received in firing, either deliberate or accidental. 3. Nos. 3 and 14 are I think identical except that 3 is more reduced. 4. Nos. 7 and 10 are the same clay though 7 shows more refined technique. 5. Nos. 9 and 12 are also very similar. 6. Nos. 11 and 13 are the same body. Sample 1 Fragment of cooking pot jar from Room 60, fill. Fabric. Seems very soft fired; interior still almost clay and not oxidized, grey core; white grains. Visual test of crushed sample. Very soft, clay matrix fine and silky. About 20% large, sharp pearly- white granules ^ to ^ inch; these resist crushing. Because of original washing (at excavation) in diluted hydrochloric acid the granules on the surface of the sherd had dissolved, leaving cavities. Since they resisted crushing in the test they are probably marble rather than calcite. Fired 7 io° Grey core almost disappeared, warmer colour and harder. Fits control piece. 88o° Uniformly brown-red. Fits. Some pieces flow off on water impact so reweigh. 940o Complete disintegration of sample on exposure to air; white granules now powdery, clearly lime in some form, probably marble. Conclusions. The use of the marble would be to improve the drying properties of large pieces but would make firing very risky. Firing temperature. It would appear that this piece was fired very quickly (in the final stages at least the surface reaching something over 8oo°) and oxidized, the core being cooler and not having time to burn clean. Sample 2 Fragment of Vasilike ware, probably jug, from surface over Rooms 79-80. Red and black pigment on exterior surface, black appears applied over red. Pigments smooth and glossy, burnished or slightly vitreous. Interior very soft and powdery. Fabric. Very smooth texture, buff-pink, no tempering material evident. Some scum on old fractures. Fired 7100 Cleaner, pinker, black pigment turning red. Fits. 88o° As above, black now quite red. Fits. 940o No change. 1 050o Now harder. Appears to have swelled slightly. 1 1200 Hard and shrunken; surface, except new fracture, brown and vitreous and cracking. Conclusions. To judge by the high loss in weight and the behaviour of the pigments this appears to have had the reduction/oxidization treatment that produces the black/red iron mutation. Firing temperature. The results give no definite indication except not above 10500. Softness of fabric and behaviour of pigments indicates a temperature of around 8oo° as most likely.</page><page sequence="361">FIRING TEMPERATURES 337 Sample 3 Rim fragment of fine grey ware bowl, from fill in South-East Yard 63.

Still fits. 11200 Old surfaces fused and brown, new breaks still cream but much harder. Shrunk. Conclusions. Made of a very clean or deliberately refined clay with no tempering evident. Slight decline in porosity suggests this was fired about 850o and reduced. Sample 4 Fragment of piriform jar (P586). Thinly potted. Warm orange on inside, greyer on outside suggesting some reduction in last stages of firing. Fabric. Thin orange with tiny white grains. Fired. 7100, 880o, 940o, 1050o No apparent change in appearance or size. 11200. Fused, dark brown, white grains more prominent. Conclusions. The harder substance combined with comparatively low porosity from the outset seems to indicate higher firing. 5, 8, 9, 11 and 13 share this characteristic. Say iooo°± or -50. Sample 5 Fragment of piriform jar (P565). Similar to 4 in form and fabric but white grains smaller and has red-brown pigment on outer surface. Fired. 7io°-iO5O° No change except brown gradually disappears. Conclusions as for 4. Sample 6 Fragment of jug, red painted and burnished, from Passage 65. Fabric. Refined buff-pink, evenly fired, rather soft, no evidence of tempering but a few spots of ochre show in new fracture; also small irregular air pockets. Old fractures very weathered; the whole except the slip very csulphated' Shiny red slip on outside, evidently burnished. Fired 7 io°, 88o° Unaltered 940o Sulphuring much increased including new break. 1 050o No further change. 11200 Fused brown surface, the red slip less so. A further fracture shows the salts responsible largely for this since interior is grey yellow and only semi-fused. Conclusions. Drop in porosity to 88o° indicates a firing temperature below 88o°. The pigmented surface has, and still does act as an effective waterproofing layer. This is in many respects like No. 2 but was rather higher fired and contained even higher combustibles; more reduced.</page><page sequence="362">338 MYRTOS Sample 7 Fragment of Myrtos ware jug, 4-7 mm. thick, from surface over Passage 65.

Conclusions. Though porosity remains nearly constant up to 10500, change in appearance of tempering at 88o° suggests it was fired rather lower than this. Sample 11 Fragment of cooking pot jar (P335). Fabric. Red-brown with very coarse fracture, but no tempering discernible; could contain 'grog'. Surface treated with denser material of similar colour. Fired 88o° Warmer colour. 940o Harder than control fragment but no shrinkage. 1 050o Signs of fusion. 1 1200 Completely fused. Conclusions.

APPENDIX XII EXAMINATION OF POTTERY SHERDS BY X-RAY POWDER PHOTOGRAPHS BY N. F. ASTBURY Constituents detected : Sample 1 Quartz, mica, calcite, felspar. Sample 2 Quartz, mica, felspar, a little diopside, a very little haematite. Sample 3 Quartz, diopside, felspar. Sample 4 Quartz, much felspar, diopside, haematite, unidentified mineral. Sample 5 Quartz, much felspar, diopside, haematite, mica, unidentified mineral. Sample 6 Quartz, felspar, a little calcite, mica. Sample 7 Quartz, felspar, diopside, haematite, a very little mica. Sample 8 Quartz, much felspar, haematite, unidentified mineral, possibly a little diopside. Sample 9 Quartz, felspar, haematite, diopside, possibly a little calcite. Sample 10 Quartz, felspar, diopside, haematite. Sample 1 1 Quartz, felspar, mica, haematite, a little diopside. Sample 12 Quartz, felspar, diopside, a little haematite, a little calcite. Sample 13 Quartz, felspar, mica, calcite, a little kaolinite, a little haematite. Sample 14 Quartz, felspar, diopside. Diopside, CaO.MgO.2SiO2, forms a series of solid solutions with Clinoenstatite, MgO.SiO2, and in several of the above samples the constituent described as diopside may well be such a solid solution. It has probably formed during firing. Samples 4, 5 and 8 each contain a large amount of felspar and each shows an extra diffraction line at 8.3 À not present in any of the other powder photographs. In an effort to identify the mineral indicated by this line the Microscope Department were asked to examine and compare samples 4 and 10. Unfortunately their report, below, does not elucidate the problem. Report from Microscope Department Sample 4 Large grains of quartz and plagioclase in iron-rich matrix. Matrix contains biotite. Biotite does not have a diffraction line at 8.3 A. Such mica flakes may show up clearly against the background under the microscope, whilst still being quite insufficient in total percentage to show on an X-ray powder photograph. Sample 10 Finer-textured body with fewer large grains than sample 4. Large grains of quartz,</page><page sequence="365">EXAMINATION OF POTTERY BY X-RAY 34I flint, felspar, acid intermediate rock, and material containing spinel and plagioclase, possibly slag or basic rock. Biotite detected in matrix but not in such large amounts as in sample 4. The presence of calcite may be misleading in trying to determine the firing temperature. It decomposes at 62O°C, but it may have been deposited in the pottery during the years it has been buried in the ground. The quartz pattern was very strong from all samples. The presence of mica and felspar indicate that the firing or calcination temperature has been low. Some micas decompose in the temperature range 75O-iooo°C, but biotite may persist to noo°C.</page><page sequence="366">APPENDIX XIII. FRAGMENTS OF A HUMAN CRANIUM BY E. SUNDERLAND AND R. A. CARTWRIGHT The fragments were found in the destruction debris in Room 89 of the settlement and dated to circa 2200 b.c. No other human skeletal remains were discovered. The bones comprise the following: (a) considerable portions of the occipital, including the posterior margin of the foramen magnum; (b) the right mastoid and temporal including most of the external auditory meatus; (c) a large portion of the right parietal eminence. Miscellaneous small fragments of other parts of the posterior cranial vault were found, seven with both cranial tables, four with the inner table only and three with the outer table only. The diploe was of normal appearance. The bones were distorted by the heat of the fire which destroyed Myrtos and thus measure- ments of individual bones are liable to considerable error. Because of this and the very frag- mentary nature of the finds it is impossible to obtain cranial measurements such as head length and head breadth or to estimate the cephalic index or cranial capacity. No frontal region of the cranium was found nor any of the left parietal-temporal region. These are probably the bones of a young adult male, who, estimating by suture obliterations, was probably in his twenties or thirties. The error in age estimations by suture obliteration is of the order of ± 10 years. The bones had come apart at the sutures in many cases, clearly indicat- ing that they had yet to fuse together. The following features are diagnostic of a young adult male: (a) there is a low projection of the mastoid process below the base of the cranium; (b) the inion is clearly visible and rugged; (c) the nuchal area has a strongly sculptured effect. 342</page><page sequence="367">APPENDIX XIV. THERMOLUMINESGENT DATING OF SHERDS BY S. FLEMING The fine-grain method1 was applied to seven sherds from the following contexts: (i) Room 79, north end, at top of burnt destruction level, 0.24 m. above floor. (2 and 3) Room 80, north- west corner, in heavily burnt earth of destruction level, 0.07 m. above floor. (4) Room 79, north end, burnt destruction level. (5) Room 79, central area, burnt destruction level. (6) As (4). (7) Room 79, central area, burnt destruction level.

Thus none of the ages above carries less than an error of ±8% (i.e. ±350 years), with the environment contributing at least 22% of the radiation received by the pottery in all cases. Only in the case of sherd 107 a 3 is the environment be- lieved to contribute more than 25% of the sherd's total radiation dose (36% in practice) and, reasonably, this sherd seems to be somewhat discordant in TL age compared to the remainder. Further, the inclusion method2 applied to the quartz content of one sherd (107 a 1 ) yielded an age of 2400 b.c., consistent with the result tabulated above, giving some support for the laboratory estimates of environmental dose-level used for the Myrtos site. Comment (P. Warren) Although the ±8%, ±350 years, possibility of error must sound a full note of caution, Dr Fleming's preferred ages will be seen to relate well to the length of life of the settlement, c. 2600-2170 b.c., proposed archaeologically in Chapter VII above. The fact that all the dates of the samples cluster within this period, and in six cases out of seven within our Period II, (archaeo- logically c. 2400-2200 b.c.), is encouraging. The samples were all from final destruction contexts (archaeologically c. 2200-2170 b.c.) in Rooms 79 and 80 and were almost certainly all from pots made at some time within Period II. Further encouragement is given by the 2400 b.c. date of No. 1, calculated by the quartz inclusion method. In summary the dates, averaging 2373 b.c. for the group, fit well with the calibrated radiocarbon dates and suggest a terminus ante quern of 2 1 70 b.c. or earlier for the destruction of the settlement. 1 D.

Details of sample contexts: (a) Burnt earth, decayed mud brick, plaster and stones. 1. 40-1. 50 m. below surface, 0.30-0.40 m. above floor of Room 76. (b) On the burnt floor of Room 76, 1.80 m. below surface, (c) In heavily burnt level, just above the bedrock floor near the north wall of Room 80, north-east of the central structure, 1.05 m. below surface, (d) The circular building 96 on the plain north-west of the settlement may well be Minoan (see p. 90) but the sample, in burnt light grey earth on the floor (0.22 m. below the preserved surface down in the structure), is clearly recent, perhaps from a fire a shepherd lit here, (e) Burnt level on the floor of Room 32, towards the centre of the room, (f) Heavily burnt context in Room 22; the sample was inside the pithos, P599. Apart from Q-954 the samples were probably from fallen roof timbers or twigs, though O-95O and 0,-951 may well have been the remains of a ladder leading up out of Room 76 (see p. 67). When the necessary dendrochronological calibrations are made2 the true or historical age ranges of the Minoan samples are : C-14 date b.c.

To make allowance for the standard deviation in the radiocarbon dates conversion (on 5568 half-life) has been done on the upper and lower limits of the B.P. dates (e.g. on 3890 and 3725 for Q7950) and the maximum historical age range is thus calculated. 344</page><page sequence="369">RADIOCARBON DATES 345 Three comments are appropriate: (i) the radiocarbon dates show good internal consistency as a group, giving confidence in the results. (2) The historical age ranges after calibration like- wise show good conformity with the archaeological date for the main period of the settlement (our Period II, Early Minoan IIB, c. 2400-2170 b.c.) in the destruction debris of which the carbonized wood lay. Q;953 must have been older wood, though the sample still falls within the full estimated age of the settlement (Early Minoan II, c. 2600-2170 b.c.). (3) The calibrated dates also agree suitably with the thermoluminescent results (Appendix XIV) in suggesting a final destruction not later than and probably rather before 2150 b.c., marking the end of EM II (cf. p. 271).

Q-1004 was from the north-east corner of Room 27 by the paving slabs in the burnt level which overlay the unburnt EM IIA level on the bedrock (see above, p. 39). The sample was 0.50 m. below the modern surface. After calibration the approximate date ranges are : C-14 date b.c. Historical age range b.c. Q-952 2222±7O 2960-2570 0^1004 2036+80 2760-2420 Comment. These two dates confirm the chronology based on the earlier samples. Six different final destruction contexts (Rooms 22, 27, 32, 76, 79 and 80) have produced seven consistent dates within a C-14 range of 2292-1770 b.c. at one standard deviation (average 2023 b.c.) and 2960-2150 b.c. after calibration. The two new dates come at the top end of the age range and strengthen our conclusion that the date of the final destruction of the settlement ( = end of Early Minoan II) lies before (perhaps at least fifty years before) 2150 b.c. 1 For all samples except Q-950 and Q-953 see V.
