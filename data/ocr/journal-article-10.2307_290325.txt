Anyone who wishes to study Homer's portrayal of the gods, or the religious implications of the Homeric text, must begin by considering the relation in which the Olympian scenes stand to other parts of the poems. Much has been written about these scenes, for they concern the historian of religion and of philosophy as well as the student of literature. I do not now propose to explore this whole mass of disputation, but only to examine one type of hypothesis, in which the Olympian scenes are assumed to be (1) consciously satirical or doctrinal, (2) connected with the skepticism of Ionian philosophy, (3) distinguishable from other, earlier parts of the text in which the gods are objects of reverent faith, (4) useful to the higher critic in his attempts to identify the work of different poets in different periods. For several reasons, the studies of Finsler, Wilamowitz, and Murray particularly invite examination. They are outstanding examples of the criticism which seeks to connect the analysis of the poems with hypothetical stages in the evolution of religious thought. The interpretations they offer of the Olympian scenes are bound up with elaborate theories of composition; and these theories, coming from men so distinguished, have been received by Hellenists with a respect which I think they do not merit. Even in a field in which subjectivity has long held sway, they are notable examples of subjective reasoning, impressive warn- ings of the mental myopia that our preconceptions may induce even in those of us who are most acute and most sincere. The views of Finsler and of Wilamowitz are rejected by Nilsson on the general grounds that the Olympian scenes, 1 The Mycenaean Origin of Greek Mythology (Berkeley, 1932), pp. 223-228; Homer and Mycenae (London, 1933), p. 267. 257</page><page sequence="2">GEORGE M. CALHOUN. which ex hypothesi are relatively late, "fill a very large part" of E, which ex hypothesi is early, and that we may well doubt the validity of theories leading to conclusions so diverse. For others than devotees of the higher criticism, this will suffice.2 But Nilsson's objection regarding E is met, formally, both by Finsler's contention that the Olympian scenes in " early" books were inserted by the Iliasdichter and, in a very different way, by Wilamowitz' flat assertion that the gods of E are quite unlike the gods of the later books. And the higher critics are entirely justified, from their own point of view, in declining to entertain the objection that no two of them agree, for, on the day on which they shall agree, the higher criticism will have ceased to be. We must therefore test these theories by examining the Homeric passages on which they are based. In so doing we shall perhaps find out why three so eminent critics, starting from identical data, come to conclusions so dissimilar. I have elsewhere pointed out how certain preconceptions in regard to Homeric style and composition tend to vitiate inquiries into the genesis of the poems.3 The critic assumes an "early" period of perfection in style and artistic economy, in which, usually, " Homer" is put, and later periods of bad taste, faulty construction, feeble imitation, in which the diaskeuast, imitator, interpolator, continuator, is everywhere rampant. He further assumes that we are again in an era of faultless taste and uner- ring critical sagacity, and ends by attributing to " Homer " what he himself finds good. Now the prevailing theories in regard to the Homeric portrayal of the gods will be found to involve, quite often, assumptions of very much this type. We assume an " early " period of simple faith and sincere religious feeling in which poets sing of the gods with reverence or exalt them as benevolent rulers of the cosmos, and subsequent periods of iconoclastic skepticism-usually a concomitant of the Ionian philosophy-in which "later " poets scoff and jeer at the deities 2 Cf. James Duffy, "Leaf's Theory of the Gods in the Menis and Expansions of the Iliad," Class. Jour., XXXII (1936), pp. 6 f. 3 "Homeric Repetitions," U. of Calif. Publ. Class. Phil., XII, 1 (1933), p. 23. Cf. Nilsson, Homer and Mycenae, p. 52: " Some scholars seem to have the idea that the poets of the earliest poems were the only geniuses and that poetry was continually deteriorating. This identify- ing of old and good, of recent and inferior, is, of course, questionable." 258</page><page sequence="3">THE HIGHER CRITICISM ON OLYMPUS. of earlier generations, until finally we come to times when reli- gious feeling and the power of song have sunk to their lowest ebb.4 Here is a sort of Saturn complex, which sees everywhere progressive deterioration from a Golden Age. Finsler believes he finds in the Iliad two distinct stages. In the earlier, the Olympian state does not exist and the gods act independently; they are regarded with reverence and with faith in their goodness and justice toward mankind. In the later stage, " Homer " has created the Gotterstaat and introduced the typical Olympian scenes; he hates and fears the cruel and selfish gods, and loves and pities humanity; the Olympians are not burlesqued, but rather represented as grim and terrible, though there are occasional touches of humor.5 Homer is "der erste griechische Philosoph mit durchdachter Weltanschauung"; 6 in the portions of the Iliad he composed, "an Stelle eines ganzlich undogmatischen Glaubens ist ein pessimistisches philosophisches System getreten." 7 Using this hypothetical difference between earlier and later conceptions of the gods as a primary criterion, Finsler proceeds to identify the work of " Homer," the Iliasdichter, and to elaborate his own theories of composition. His method includes the usual futilities of the higher criticism; it starts from the postulate that 'This hypothetical progress is traced by W. Nestle, "Die Anfiinge einer Gitterburleske bei Homer," N. Jahrb. kl. Alt., XV (1905), pp. 161-182. Here will be found in general outline ideas later developed by Wilamowitz. Nestle's warning that what seems comic or grotesque to us may not have seemed so to the poet's contemporaries (p. 163) has been too little heeded. In an interesting study by Paul Meyer, Die G6tterwelt Homers (Gittingen, 1907), is found the same general idea, though the aspects of the gods are differently conceived; from objects of superstitious terror, of which there is little trace in Homer, they become in the later parts of the Iliad and the Odyssey (i. e., the Olym- pian scenes) little more than men and women, virtually Romanfiguren. Meyer does not go farther in theories of composition than the assump- tion that the Olympian scenes are " late"; his ideas are diametrically opposed to Finsler's belief that the later parts show fear and hatred of cruel and powerful gods. 6 Die olympischen Szenen der Ilias (Bern, 1906) passim, and especially pp. 54, 18-22, 26 f., 36 f.

CALHOUN. differences are ipso facto the work of different hands, and facts which do not suit the general theory of composition are brought into conformity by the familiar devices of Ueberarbeitung, Inter- polationen, Ueberreste, usw.8 At times Finsler is so obsessed by his theories that he simply fails to see what stands in his text. For example, in his discussion of N-O, all passages that seem to him to imply the wrath of Achilles, the promise to Thetis, or the command to the gods in O to keep out of the battle are got out of the way by pronouncing them additions made by the Ilias- dichter to an original "einfache und sch6ne Erzahlung" in which Poseidon made no particular effort to conceal his move- ments from Zeus, but went about helping the Achaeans in the independent manner characteristic of the earlier stage (Szenen, pp. 15-23). After noting in N 8 f. an allusion to the command in ( (evidently intercalated by the Iliasdichter), Finsler goes on (p. 15), "Aber dieses Verbotes wird im folgenden nicht gedacht. Poseidon entsteigt dem Meere, offenbar ganz unbekiim- mert darum, ob Zeus ihn sehe oder nicht." In this assertion he is simply flatly contradicting the statement of the Homeric text. The poet's account of Poseidon's coming starts with the formula ov' aXaoaKo7r1'v eXe, which is always used in Homer of alertness to grasp an opportunity (cf. 0 285; K 515; H 135). This is followed almost immediately by the explicit statement that Poseidon, from where he sat, had a clear view of Ida (Ev0ev yap Ecatvreo 7rraa /Lev IS&amp;) as well as of the Trojan plain. In such a context the words aVTLKa 8' E opeos KaTE/,TErTO seem to say quite plainly that the god, in an access of rage (xparepcs eveuE'aara), started for the battle just as soon as he saw that Zeus was looking the other way and the coast was clear. I think it would not occur to anyone, reading these lines without preconceptions, 8 Finsler disapproves (Szenen, p. 8) of the way in which "Unitarier und andere" get rid of difficulties by calling them interpolations; his own method is to say that lines which do not accord with his scheme are "insertions" (e. g., loc. cit., "Also sind die Verse 60-62, die sich auf die Gesandtschaft beziehen, in einen friiheren Zusammenhang eingesetzt, der nichts von ihr wusste."), or, conversely, survivals (e.g., pp. 20 f., "In dieser Partie ist die alte Fassung durch den Dichter der Apate iiberarbeitet. Denn der Rechtsstandpunkt . . . stammen aus einem ganz andern Gedankenkreis, als die Apate ihn bietet."), or (p. 28) "Spuren einer tiefgehenden Ueberarbeitung . . . iber dessen Urheber ich jedoch nichts aussagen kann." 260</page><page sequence="5">THE HIGHER CRITICISM ON OLYMPUS. to understand them otherwise. But they will need to be re- written in very different language-or attributed to the Ueberar- beitung of the Iliasdichter along with 8 f., 352 f., 356 f., etc.- before we can accept the view that we have here an early stratum in which the command of ? is unknown. To take another example, not immediately related to the Olympian scenes, Finsler's theory of an independent Patrocleia (Szenen, pp. 5-11) starts from the remarkable (auffallend) cir- cumstance that Patroclus, on returning from the visit to Nestor, says not a word about the desperate plight of the Achaeans. Here again, he is simply disregarding or overlooking what the poet has told us repeatedly, that Achilles had been standing by the stern of his ship watching the course of the battle (A 600 f.) and knew perfectly well, even before he sent Patroclus to ask after Machaon, that the Achaeans were in a desperate situation. In fact, Finsler's words, " Die Not ist also ausserordentlich gross," are so closely paralleled by Achilles's words to Patroclus in A 610, Xpe yap tKaVETaL OVK7ET aveKTOs, that a higher critic would be tempted to credit the latter to an Ueberarbeiter who had read Olympische Szenen. In short, what Finsler found so remarkable that it could be explained only on the theory of an independent Patrocleia, is that Patroclus does not begin by telling Achilles precisely what Achilles had just told Patroclus when he sent him on the errand to Nestor. And when Finsler goes on "Erst II 124 sieht Achilleus das Schiff des Protesilaos aufflammen," again implying, as his theory demands, that Achilles is unaware of the desperate situation, he is ignoring not only A 600-610 but also II 17 f., 65-79, which make it abundantly clear that Achilles continued to look and listen to the turmoil and the din of battle during the absence of Patroclus. If he saw the flame " erst II 124," it is because the ship was not set afire until line 122. Finsler's theories keep him even from seeing that Troov yap aXos/ pep/r3Kev 'AXatovs (22), almost the first words Patroclus utters, are precisely what he is so astonished not to find. They sum up well enough the desperate plight of the Achaeans and are followed, very properly, by an account of what Achilles had not been able to see for himself, that is, the wound- ing of the major champions in the fighting on the plain. What he had just seen going on before his eyes, what he had heard for himself (II 76-79), the final assault on the camp which brings 261</page><page sequence="6">GEORGE M. CALHOUN. Hector to the ship of Protesilaus (O 379-746), is omitted, and very properly. Had the poet inserted at this point what Finsler demands, namely, a recapitulation of the closing scenes in O, the higher critics would have lost no time in striking it out, with gleeful ferocity, as the work of the awkward interpolator. Fins- ler's argument on these two passages is, I believe, a fair example of his method, which consistently neglects plain statements in the text. The value of such exercises I leave to the reader. We may note here, for future reference, that Finsler puts the work of the Iliasdichter, that is, the composition of the Iliad, at about 700 B. C., and the composition of the Odyssey a century later.9 Murray has already three stages of religion before he has come to the " latest" parts of the Iliad, and his discussion of the col- lapse of " Homeric theology " under the assaults of " the Milesian spirit" illustrates very well the sort of conclusion to which the critic ultimately will come if he starts from the general assump- tion of early faith and later skepticism.10 Murray thinks " one can notice three distinct stages ": the primitive stage of uncriti- cal belief, a middle stage of expurgation and humanizing, and, thirdly, " the late Ionian stage." This last is imbued with "the Milesian spirit," with "a kind of half-licentious humour," . .. "a mocking, half-licentious, Boccaccio-like spirit, already at work in the later, and not the very latest, parts of the Iliad." As typical instances he selects the Theomachy and the Ato darar. His theory of composition is nearer to Lachmann's than to the "kernel" hypotheses; he holds (p. 307) that various songs or lays already in existence were stitched together by rhapsodes. He is thus under no necessity of fitting portions of the text into a progressive scheme of composition, as do Finsler and Wilamowitz. It is his belief that the poems were "' worked up" into their present shape in the latter part of the sixth cen- tury, probably by Cynaethus.11 The theories of Wilamowitz, as expounded in Die Ilias und Homer, are somewhat complicated. For him " Homer " is pre- eminently the poet of A and the Atos aw7raT-" Durchweg eigene 9 Homer, I1 (1924), p. 66. 10 G.

Erfindung oder doch Gestaltung geben A, die Gotterszenen NO, X*.I 12 " Homer" incorporated with more or less modification a series of earlier poems, including a short epic rAE, the nucleus of which is the aristeia of Diomede; numerous later additions to the Homeric poem by different hands brought the Iliad gradually to its present proportions. In distinguishing these various strata, Wilamowitz constantly relies upon differences which he thinks he detects in the presentation of the gods. These he regards as a most valuable criterion. He traces a process of development from an earlier Ionian viewpoint in E 13 to the fully perfected Olympian phantasy of " Homer," and again a progressive degeneration which eventuates in the " plumpe Erhabenheit" of the Theomachy-"vom ? gar nicht zu reden." 14 We note that E is attributed to the early eighth century, the work of Homer to about 750 B. C., and O-the latest stratum and the worst-to a rhapsode of the seventh cen- tury, probably a younger contemporary of Archilochus and Terpander.'5 For Wilamowitz the differences on which he based his theories of composition were real. They will be real for all who accept his premises, and for others not; each critic will have to form his own opinion as to their validity. The fundamental weakness of his method, in my own opinion, lies in the arbitrary selection of minor differences, which often are quite incidental, or even trivial, and the arbitrary adoption of the explanations that accord with his theories of composition, without any considera- tion of others at least equally tenable. I have chosen as illustra- tions two arguments sufficiently typical and sufficiently impor- tant in the theories of composition advanced in Die Ilias und Homer to be specially noted by Tieche in his favorable summary of the book.16 12 U. von Wilamowitz-Moellendorff, Die Ilias und Homer (Berlin, 1920), p. 514; cf. pp. 316 ff. 13 Ibid., p. 285: "Wir miissen unsern Standpunkt in dem Ionien des friihen achten Jahrhunderts nehmen." 14 These conclusions are developed in Chapter 14 (pp. 284-293) and summed up with additional observations at the start of Chapter 16 (pp. 316 f.). 15 Ibid., pp. 57 f. 1 In Finsler's Homer, I1 (1924), p. 186. 263</page><page sequence="8">GEORGE M. CALHOUN. In attempting to distinguish between the work of the Ilias- dichter and that of the poet of ST, Wilamowitz relies upon the difference he sees between the portrayal of Hephaestus in A, where he is "komische Figur," and in X, where he "humpelt nicht, sondern hat sich zauberhafte Stiitzen verfertigt. Die Charis hat er wohl zur Frau bekommen, weil dem Hypnos im X eine solche Frau versprochen wird." 17 Now, one might take these statements at their face value and yet might very properly ask whether they have anything at all to do with the problem of authorship, for we cannot expect the poet to tell everything he knows about Hephaestus every time the god is mentioned. How- ever, their value goes down with startling rapidity as we read the text to which they relate. They are found to be in part a simple blunder, in part mere conjecture, and the rest trivial enough; none of them can be taken as indicating a difference of authorship without disregarding certain rather obvious con- siderations that are highly pertinent. The touch of comedy so felicitous in A would unquestionably be out of place in S, in the prelude to the forging of the arms. The magic attendants, like the marvelous tripods, are part of the emphasis upon Hephaes- tus' supernatural power and divine skill of which the artistic purpose should be clear to anyone.18 Charis enters naturally enough into the reception of Thetis in the abode of Hephaestus, but I can conceive of no reason why she should have been men- tioned in A; the guess that she was suggested by S 267 ff. involves a favorite fallacy of the higher criticism, the assumption that the poet here has nothing upon which to draw for his scene except what has appeared in " earlier " parts of the Iliad. There is left Hephaestus' limp, the assertion that in S " Hephaistos humpelt nicht," which clearly is felt to be quite important. Let us grant, for the sake of argument, that such a difference would be highly significant; the fatal flaw is that it does not exist. The statement that Hephaestus does not limp in ' is Wilamo- witz', not the poet's, and what the poet says is the exact reverse. 17 Die Ilias und Homer, pp. 317 f. s1 2 373-379. The scene, with its dignified portrayal of Hephaestus and the insistence on his superhuman skill, is a prelude to the forging of the armor and contributes to the general effect of magnificence; this would have been sadly marred by the "schalkhafter Unterton" which for Wilamowitz is the peculiar mark of the Iliasdichter. 264</page><page sequence="9">THE HIGHER CRITICISM ON OLYMPUS. He says, as plainly as words can say, not once, but twice, He- phaestus "got up limping" (S 410 f., avearr / XwXXeWvv) and "came out limping" (E 416 f., fij 8 Ov'pate / WXevowv). This may seem to be, and in a way is, a trivial point, not worthy to be so labored. But it is the sort of thing that is too often found in this type of criticism to be always passed over without remark. Here Wilamowitz has made it a pivotal point in an argument which the weight of his authority is likely to erect into a con- clusive demonstration. Again, Wilamowitz stresses the difference he feels between the Hera of the little epic rAE, " die wildeste Feindin der Troer" (p. 285), in whom " der Grimm, mit dem sie die Troer verfolgt, ist derselbe in der Heraklessage" (p. 287), and the gentler Hera portrayed by the poet of A and the raTrrr, that is, by " Homer." " Seinen Olympiern, selbst der Hera, kann man das Geliiste, Priamos und die Troer roh zu verschlingen (A 35), nicht mehr zutrauen" (p. 317).

[A 34-36] It is as if, in a work of modern fiction, someone should say to a girl, "You'ld like to scratch her eyes out, wouldn't you? " and we should solemnly infer that the person addressed was conceived as a savage and furious character. Or as if we should argue from Xenophon's Ka W ,uov Se KarTa,aydv (Anab. iv. 8. 14) that his soldiers were cannibals. And Wilamowitz' lively interest in Hera's "Wildheit" in A seems to have blinded him to the singular likeness which this Zeus who amuses himself by stirring up Hera and Athena bears to the Zeus of A and the aTrarrl and, I should say, to the Zeus of episodes which Wilamowitz regards as among the latest and the worst, the Zeus who challenges the other gods to a tug of war (? 18-27), who taunts and threatens Hera and Athena after their fruitless sally (? 446-456), who ends the battle of the gods on a note of merriment (&lt;4 508). The two points I have discussed are not mere lapses in detail, unfairly chosen to discredit an argument otherwise sound and weighty, but are organic and fairly representative. Here we 265</page><page sequence="10">GEORGE M. CALHOUN. have typical higher criticism, and the mildest judgment that can be passed is that it is largely subjective, the form only of criticism, devoid of the substance. The inconsistencies and reciprocal contradictions of these attempts at analysis are obvious and show how precarious are subjective criteria.19 We may for example glance again at the judgments of these three critics on the Atos a-rdrT-. For Wilamo- witz this is the type and essence of " Homer's " most characteris- tic work; the glaring difference between its gods and the archaic gods of rAE or the later conception of divinity found in ST, to say nothing of ? and the unspeakable Theomachy, is the key- stone of the edifice of theory he rears in Die Ilias und Homer. Finsler, starting from suggestions originally made by Wilamo- witz, judges very differently: " Dass der Dichter der Apate mit dem des Gottergesprachs in A identisch sei, kann keinem Zweifel mehr unterliegen " (Szenen, p. 21) ; " Wenden wir uns nunmehr zum Beginn des 0 und der Ausfahrt der Gottinnen, so leuchtet die Ahnlichkeit mit den bereits behandelten olympischen Szenen von selbst ein " (ib., p. 30); " Ihr (Thetis') Besuch bei Hephais- tos (S) atmet Stil und Geist der iibrigen olympischen Szenen" (ib., p. 54). In other words, Finsler finds the authentic handi- work of the Dichter der Apate in parts of the Iliad that for Wilamowitz are either early and archaic or among the latest and worst. When Murray couples the araml, that gem from the hand of the Iliasdichter, with the Theomachy as typical of the Ionian or Milesian spirit, it seems that diversity of judgment has reached its limit. Hard as it is to reconcile the various analytical theories with one another, it is still harder to bring them into accord with what has been learned from the study of mythologies other than the Greek. In those instances in which the cultural background of mythology or religion is definitely known we find uniformly that naive, grotesque elements appear at a very primitive level 19 Finsler and Wilamowitz agree in calling the Iliasdichter "Homer," but they do not agree in regard to the portions of the text which are " Homer's" work, the stage he represents in the development of the poem, the time in which he flourished, or his attitude toward the immortals. Their theories and Murray's have little in common except the fundamental assumption of Ionian influence. 266</page><page sequence="11">THE HIGHER CRITICISM ON OLYMPUS. and are in no way incompatible with devout religious feeling.20 This offers no difficulty if we regard the Olympian scenes as made up in part of primitive myth and folk-tale, retold with a certain humor and sense of the ridiculous, primarily for the entertainment of the listener. But we are confronted by a very different problem when we adopt the view that they are intro- duced for the express purpose of satirizing the gods. No one, I believe, maintains that the motifs of these episodes were newly invented by the " Ionian minstrels " who are held to have intro- duced them into the poems, or denies that the portrayal of the gods is in large part that of primitive myth and folk-tale. Yet, if these tales were not a part of the poems in their hypothetical earlier, purer form, how shall we account for their absence? They existed, and must have been generally known, since so much of their content bears the stamp of popular story; we have no recourse other than to assume that the earlier poets sup- pressed them, that the naive, grotesque elements of myth were intentionally excluded from the poems until a generation of rationalizing skeptics introduced them deliberately with satirical intent. But this will involve a further assumption-to my thinking very dubious-that recitation of the poems was re- stricted to audiences of the elite, who in the earlier period felt somewhat as Mr. Murray and we about divinity. Thus the poems become the expression of an enlightened minority which first keeps the gods inviolate from any grotesquerie of popular belief or tale and afterwards attacks them on the score of just this popular belief. All this seems to me very improbable, but it is implied in the theories we are discussing. Unless some such assumptions as these can be established, or it can be shown that the content of the Olympian scenes was newly invented by 20 For a general summary of the facts with references to special studies, see the article "Mythology" in the Encyclopedia Britannica, ed. 11, by Andrew Lang; for a fuller discussion, Myth, Ritual and Religion (London, 1887) by the same author. More recent studies have made additions to the data without materially altering their general character or impairing the value of Lang's conclusions in regard to the conflict between religion and myth, between the mood of "earnest con- templation and submission" and the mood of "playful and erratic fancy," both of them "present, and in conflict, through the whole religious history of the human race." 267</page><page sequence="12">GEORGE M. CALHOUN. the " Ionian minstrels," the evidence for the belief that the poems once existed without these scenes is exactly nil. There is also a matter of chronology to be considered. We have no evidence for anything that can be thought of as phi- losophy or science before Thales, early in the sixth century, and even Thales is a somewhat dim figure. The first definite evi- dence of a skeptical and rationalistic attitude toward the gods relates to Xenophanes and brings us to the late sixth and early fifth centuries.21 This would fit Murray's theories well enough, but Wilamowitz puts his " Homer," author of the typical Olympian scenes, in the middle of the eighth century; 22 Fins- ler, at its end. That means we are asked to believe that " der ionische Geist der kiinftigen Wissenschaft, aber auch der Frei- geisterei," dominated epic poetry a century or a century and a half before it left any record even in tradition. This is of course theoretically possible and it may be the true explanation, but we are not justified in adopting it uncritically. We must consider whether it accords with our primary data-the Homeric text and the fragments of the early philosophers-better than other hypotheses. We have fortunately in Xenophanes a first-hand witness to the relations between the Ionian philosophy and the epic at a comparatively early time. Gods, myths, and poetry are his subject in two passages: 7ravTa OEol ave'r)Kav '"Or,pos O' 'Huoios Te, vLVEv )Kav OAL77pO ou'Oa 7rap avOpwCrrotcLv ovELcea Kat /ioyogs 'TTV, CKX7rTeLV OAItxcve?V TE Kat aAAA-Xovs araTCev?V.

[Diels, H-Cr. fr. 1, 13-14, 19-24]. The same line of thought runs through both passages. Curi- ously enough, the lines to which Xenophanes owes much of his fame, the attack upon " Homeric theology," seem to be directed against the very episodes in Homer which are assumed to be the expression of Ionian philosophy.23 Nothing stands out more clearly in these fragments than the author's feeling that he is assailing an ancient, traditional way of thinking, typical of vulgar legend and popular belief. To his mind, the convivial should hymn the deity with reverent words and pure; the con- versation, even inter pocula, should be kept to nobler themes than the " antiquated fictions" of the epic poets. If such passages as these mean anything, they mean that Xenophanes thought of the gods of myth in Homer or in Hesiod, and of such matters as make up a large part of the Olympian scenes, as hoary survivals. The last line of the quotation suggests that the more reverent attitude, which for our theorists is the earlier, would have seemed to him worthy of his own times. His testi- 23 In the familiar reference to Homer and Hesiod (Diels, fr. 11) the general delinquency of the gods is exemplified by thievery, adultery, and deceit. Deceit suggests at once the dCrard?, and adultery the lay of Ares and Aphrodite; thievery is one of the chief accomplishments of Hermes, who twice is spoken of in Olympian scenes in connections which suggest the familiar folk tale motif of the Master Thief (E 390; Q 24). Of course Xenophanes had in mind much besides the Iliad and Odyssey (e. g., the Hymn to Hermes), and probably much not now extant; but it is significant that the apposite illustrations of his statements, insofar as they are found in the Homeric text, are found in the Olympian scenes or in the characterizations of the gods which these scenes imply. The "violent discords" (rairam ao(fe6avdas) of fr. 1, 23, also, may be illustrated from the Olympian scenes as well as from Hesiod (Diels can hardly be right in interpreting "tobenden Burger- zwist," since the passage as a whole evidently refers to ancient myths.). In short, the lines which drew the Ionian skeptic's fire are plainly just the lines which modern critics attribute to Ionian skepticism. 269</page><page sequence="14">GEORGE M. CALHOUN. mony is quite incompatible, in my opinion, with the theories we are discussing. Another significant fact is the complete absence from the Homeric poems of that speculative curiosity regarding origins, sources, causes, that apparently was the breath of life to the Ionian philosopher. The urge to know whence, why, and how speaks out repeatedly in even the few lines that have survived from Xenophanes, and Xenophanes is believed to have been less inter- ested in physical speculation than his predecessors.24 In all the Homeric text there is scarcely a hint of any such curiosity; for all we are told, the poet simply accepted man and the universe as he found them, and portrayed them as he saw them, without in- quiring whence and why they were.25 It is not our task at present to ask why this is so; we have only to note the implica- tions for our problem. If late Ionian poets, imbued with the spirit of natural science and rationalistic philosophies, had so great a part in producing the poems that they inserted long episodes and many briefer allusions in which the gods are con- sciously held up to the scorn of the enlightened listener, it is truly remarkable that they did not allow a single one of these absorbing queries, not the faintest hint of their intellectual curiosity, to creep in among the hundreds of lines with which 2 Although Xenophanes was perhaps less of a scientist than the Milesians and more of a social reformer, as Burnet maintains (op. cit., p. 36), there can be no doubt of his restless curiosity regarding the nature and origins of deity and of the physical world. For examples of his speculations on physical problems, cf. Diels, frs. 27-30, 32, 33. 25 On this point the testimony of T. D. Seymour is the more valuable from being quite objective. See Life in the Homeric Age (New York, 1907), p. 45: "The Homeric poems contain no cosmogony or theogony. The poet gives no indication of his beliefs with regard to the creation of the world or about previous races of men and gods." Ibid., p. 394: "The poems assume and report them (the gods) as simply existing, without any question as to the past. The poems show little interest in the origin or even the early history of either men or gods." The con- trast between Homer and Xenophanes may be illustrated by fr. 30, cited by Schol. Genav. on b, 195 ff. In ( 196 f. the poet is merely telling us in the grand manner that Oceanus is the first and greatest of rivers and even so is immeasurably inferior to Zeus; in fr. 30 Xenophanes is attempting an explanation of physical phenomena. The difference reminds us of Aristotle's remark, Poetics 1447 b 16 oveSv ae KoLVOSV enTv 'O/inpP KIat 'Et7reocKXe T7rXqiv rT eirpov. 270</page><page sequence="15">THE HIGHER CRITICISM ON OLYMPUS. they are thus credited. It is equally remarkable that there is not in Homer even a trace of the rationalizing explanations of various divinities that were apparently a particular predilection of Xenophanes.26 These anomalies must be reasonably accounted for before we can entertain the theory that the Olympian scenes are the work of irreligious Ionian minstrels. Still another difficulty is the juxtaposition or even fusing of passages we are asked to regard as Ionian scoffing and those which clearly express a simple faith in the existence and supreme power of the gods. For example, the thunderstorm at the close of H is separated by only a few lines from the colloquy between Zeus and Poseidon regarding the wall, and immediately precedes the gathering of the gods in E. These are typical Olympian scenes and have been under suspicion since first the higher criticism began; they present the fussy Poseidon, the blustering Zeus, the pert Athena, all conceived in what Gilbert Murray rather sadly calls " the Milesian spirit." Now are we to believe that a skeptical Ionian minstrel went to the trouble of working these episodes into the poem, in order to satirize the gods, and yet did not take the trouble to modify or remove the trifling bit of earlier, more devout feeling that intervenes? The lines are 7ravvvX0og 8E urLv KaKa /uyEEro urT71Tera ZEVS oayep8aXEa KTV7rEtWv TroVS O XXopoyv 8eo jp't- otvov 8' EK eTrdawv Xaa8ts3 XCOV, ov8s TrL 'T\7 7TpLv 7rTEELV, 7rpLv XcEfaL V7repLevEC KpovvIwL [H 478-481]. These certainly mar the "Ionian" effect,27 and nothing would have been simpler than to leave them out, or, if the irreligious minstrel must have a thunderstorm at this point, to edit them into accord with more enlightened notions of meteorology. The Theomachy, we are told, is one of the latest and worst of the episodes introduced for the purpose of making the gods appear ridiculous, and Murray takes it as one of the two best examples of the irreligious spirit. The minstrel who inserted it presum- 28 Cf. Burnet, op. cit., p. 35; Diels, fr. 32 and A39 =Aetius, ii, 18, 1. This rationalizing and allegorizing of the Homeric gods, for which Theagenes was particularly known, seems to be the earliest reaction of philosophy. 27 This resembles the passages in which Meyer (op. cit., p. 24) sees traces of primitive fear of the gods (supra, n. 4). 271</page><page sequence="16">GEORGE M. CALHOUN. ably composed the lines which are its introduction, the sonorous lines acclaimed in the treatise On the Sublime. Whatever may be the impression they make on us as poetry, it is difficult to believe that they were composed or inserted by a scoffer whose principal motive was the desire to ridicule the gods. Are we further to account for the tone of the five lines which conclude the lay of Ares and Aphrodite by pronouncing them a figment of Murray's fourth stage, a last touch added by way of palinode to save the trouble of expurgation, a drop of holy water to exorcise the Milesian spirit? The attempt to assign the reverent and the ridiculous to different strata will lead us into the full tide of a Heraclitean flux.28 In general, the attempts to peel off a layer of the poems dis- tinguished by its skeptical Ionian color are a flagrant example of petitio principii. Like so many similar attempts, they assume the truth of what they have to prove; they adopt the one explana- tion that suits the thesis and ignore others, equally tenable and often far simpler. By their postulates, they deny to a poet the right to vary his mood even while he ranges over the whole vast field of life and feeling; they would require him to reshape all the diverse material that he drew from various sources into dull conformity with a single guiding idea. Their premises would make a Chaucer or a Shakespeare into a schizophrenic, and would demand two or three authors for the Earthly Paradise. They are about as intelligent as would be the assumption that in a mosaic the tesserae of different colors must have been set by different hands. Sincere adherence of supposedly competent Hellenists to this sort of pseudo-criticism would be quite inexplicable did we not know that through many academic generations the first article of faith instilled into the incipient Homerist has been that the poems are conglomerate, heterogeneous masses which must be analyzed into their component parts-and can be, since it is 28 In a study of "The Literary Necessity of Anthropomorphism," Class. Jour. XXXII (1936), p. 25, A. C. Schlesinger pertinently remarks that " humorous anthropomorphism" depends for its effect upon the contrast between the greatness of the gods as they were conceived in religion and "the humanity of their remarks and actions" in the Olympian scenes. 272</page><page sequence="17">THE HIGHER CRITICISM ON OLYMPUS. assumed, in simple faith and without inquiry, that differences between parts of the poems must be the work of different poets. The urge to dissect is accentuated, I believe, in the particular instances under consideration, by a fundamental divergence of ancient and modern feeling which throws into unduly high relief those aspects of the Olympians that are grotesque or ridiculous; it is as if a carving designed for the half-light of an ancient temple should be viewed under the glare of a modern arc. The pre- conceptions that flow from our own inherited notions of divinity lead us to look upon the higher and nobler aspects of the gods as fundamental; we are offended by anything that is not in harmony with these aspects, and hence are inclined to give it an importance it could not possibly have had for Homeric audi- ences. Could we fully divest ourselves of these preconceptions and put ourselves in the place of the poet's audience, we should, I believe, take the naive and grotesque very much as a matter of course; this, rather than the higher conception, is the natural, typical, fundamental element. We cannot believe that the Hellenes who looked upon Praxiteles' noble portrayal of Hermes in the fourth century were at all disturbed by the rude herms that stood at every doorway and crossroad. Yet were we to apply here the sort of a priori reasoning that seems to govern the study of Homer's gods, we should regard the Hermes of Olympia as an original noble conception and explain the herms as satirical expressions of a later, rationalizing spirit. Critics who hold that the Olympian scenes are an expression of Ionian irreligion may properly be required to explain: (1) how and why this admittedly primitive material was suppressed in hypothetical early versions of the poems; (2) why tradition made Thales the first philosopher if rationalism and skepticism were in fact so advanced in the eighth century as to invade the epic in the form of elaborate conscious satire; (3) the curious anomaly that Xenophanes attacks just those passages that are ascribed to Ionian skepticism; (4) the complete absence from the Olympian scenes of the rationalistic curiosity that is typical of early Ionian philosophy; (5) the presence in these scenes or in their immediate contexts of passages which imply a simple faith and reverence. Until these explanations shall be forth- coming, we shall be well advised to adhere to the simpler view 2 273</page><page sequence="18">GEORGE M.
