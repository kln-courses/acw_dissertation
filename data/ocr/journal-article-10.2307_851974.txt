<plain_text><page sequence="1">Book Reviews 423 Bohlman's last chapter, "Folk Music in the Modern World," offers the Middle Eastern marketplace, with its quantity and diversity of peoples, musics, and processes, as a metaphor for the variety of folk music in the modern world. Why not for all music? Is the concept "folk music" still viable, if it ever was? I think so, though if I did not, I am not sure that this book would convert me. And, of course, the older definitions of folk music that we in the academy would revise or discard are alive and well-in the hands of the self- conscious performers and audiences fueling modern folk music revivals. This book is thorough and bold. It is not for everyone. I used it as a supplementary text in a course mixing undergraduate and graduate students recently. The better graduate students profited from reading it; others in the class found Bohlman's ornate prose difficult, even impenetrable. I expect to consult my copy frequently, both for its excellent bibliography and as a thesaurus of ideas about folk music. It is a significant contribution to the study of folk music and its historiography, and should find a place on many an academic's bookshelf. Chris Goertzen The University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill Sounding Forms: African Musical Instruments. Edited by MARIE-THERESE BRINCARD. New York: The American Federation of Arts, 1989. 208 pp., photos, illustrations. This compilation of 215 interesting photos of decorated instruments and ten articles written by distinguished scholars is a catalog for a special exhibition of African musical instruments as "art objects" which was presented in 1989 and 1990 in four museums in the U.S.A. and Paris. More than sixty lenders, museums and private collections contributed to this remarkable exhibition, with objects of the highest value measured by the prices they would secure on the international art market. An exhibition of this kind, presenting musical instruments as sculpture, might therefore be appreciated by a wide public. On the other hand, the experts- ethnomusicologists, organologists and anthropologists-should expect some answers to crucial questions such as the cultural meaning of the decorations that mark these objects as outstanding compared with the vast majority of non-decorated instruments. This catalog focuses on African musical instru- ments as art objects, or more precisely, as art-historical objects. While these objects are discussed by the authors of the articles from different angles, the catalog section consists simply of photographs, a description of decorative elements, and some quite general remarks on their meaning. In her introductory article "Sounding Forms," Brincard summarizes some aspects of looking at a decorated musical instrument more as an art</page><page sequence="2">424 Ethnomusicology, Fall 1991 object than a sound-producing tool. She mentions Chauvet's Musique negre (1929), the typological works of Laurenty and Olga Boone, which are merely descriptive, and that of Maes who tried to catch the symbolic meaning of instrumental decorations: "But Maes performs the indispensable service of raising the sculptural element of African musical instruments to a status worthy of art-historical examination" (p.16). It is interesting that the only African scholar quoted by Brincard, Dr. Omibiye-Obidike (University of Ibadan, Nigeria) opposes this standpoint. "[Mrs.] Omibiye-Obidike con- cludes that the very notion of a work of art is a purely Western one, since in Africa an instrument's use will determine the choice of specific objects and motifs to be placed on it. Aesthetic criteria and analyses are thus at best misplaced and at worst merely ethnocentric" (p.16). Thus, for Omibiye- Obidike what is defined as a work of art is a matter of a (quite subjective) starting point (for instance, "the excellent execution" of a carving), and of Zeitgeist. The greater the price, the more it becomes an art object. This disagreement becomes more clear when Brincard castigates her African colleague: "Omibiye-Obidike does not seem to take into consideration, or perhaps consciously rejects, the studies of the past twenty years that have focused on aesthetic craftsmanship, as well as shed light on the African sense of producing a beautiful object" (p.16). What Obidike clearly wanted to point out is that a musical instrument in Africa never had been an art object. There is no doubt that many of these instruments made with extraordinary skill and imaginative intuition fascinate us, as they did their former owners-kings, rulers, or just musicians. But what is even more fascinating to us as ethnomusicologists is the role these decorations played-what they ex- pressed within the systems of tradition, beliefs, society, culture, environment and worldview. Brincard regrets that up to now musicologists and organologists seemingly showed little interest in the decorations of musical instruments. The reason for this seeming ambivalence is surprisingly simple. In my experience, these objects come almost without exception into private and museum collections without any detailed information. In most cases the collectors were neither interested nor capable of researching background informations. Knowledge of foreign cultures-called "primitive" at the time when most of the objects were collected-was very poor, as is the documentation in the museums where these objects now reside. If Curt Sachs had had access to more information about the role and meaning of the decorative elements of those instruments described in his works he would have discussed them more extensively. (One correction must be made concerning his work mentioned on p.19: Geist und Werden der Musikinstrumente was written by Sachs alone, and not co-authored by Erich Moritz von Hornbostel.)</page><page sequence="3">Book Reviews 425 The second contribution, "The Aesthetic Dimensions of African Musical Instruments," by J. H. Kwabena Nketia, goes beyond a mere descriptive approach. As an African musicologist Nketia is not looking for "art objects" but for cultural insights: What the worldview of instrument-makers and their communities establishes is twofold. First, it underlines the intimate emotional and sometimes spiritual attachment of musicians to their instruments, which influences their personal attitudes and aesthetic responses to them, and which leads instrument-makers and players to personify instruments .... Second, it accounts for the tendency to regard some instruments as 'entities' with inherent vitality (analogous to that of a silent inactive person), which is made manifest when they are sounded; such vitality may be symbolized by a full human figure, the figure of a human head, or other suggestive images attached to musical instruments .... Unlike other objects, musical instruments have multiple dimensions of meaning, for what gives them their own distinctive significance as cultural objects is both what they symbolize and the individual and group sentiments they generate (pp.23-24). What a contrast this viewpoint offers to the article following by Bertil Soderberg on "African Musical Instruments and their Decorations" (first published in Arts d'Afrique Noire 1977)! It is simply a general description of visual phenomena. Even the contribution "Anthropomorphism, Zoomorphism, and Abstraction in the Musical Instruments of Central Africa" byJ-S. Laurenty is only a pale reflection of his former works on this topic. "African Harps: Construction, Decoration, and Sound" by Sue Carole DeVale provides us with a general survey of types, decorations, and sound qualities. I am happy to see that when dealing with instruments of the kora type the term "harp lute" has been discarded, and is now replaced by the term "bridge harp." Nevertheless within the catalogue section (p.90) one finds exactly the same type of instrument coming even from the same culture (Senufo) in one case named "harp," and in the other "harp-lute." Due to its restricted length another general article "African Mbira as Musical Icons" by Cynthia E. Schmidt can only hint at some aspects of decorated lamellaphones. However, reference is made to the exhibited objects. Articles which are deliberately limited to a specific region or single type of instrument are of course more profound, informative, and contain more "African" answers to the questions mentioned above. To this category belong "Body and Voice: Kongo Figurative Musical Instruments" by Robert Farris Thompson, "Slit Gongs in the Cameroon Grassfields: Sights and Sounds of Beauty and Power" by Christraud M. Geary, "Master Drums from Akan Popular Bands" by Doran H. Ross, and "A Nuna Flute: Attribution and Meaning" by Christopher D. Roy, all well known specialists in their fields. The descriptive catalog was written mainly by Christine Mullen Kreamer, Marie-Th6erse Brincard, Wendy Schonfeld, and Arthur P. Bourgois. It consists of the sections: Chordophones/Harps, Zithers; Membranophones/</page><page sequence="4">426 Ethnomusicology, Fall 1991 Drums; Idiophones/Slit Gongs, Mbira, Bells, Rattles; Aerophones/Horns, Whistles; and "Resonances in Form," the depiction of instruments and players as sculptures or decorations. Brincard and her co-workers are to be congratulated for the arduous task of bringing together so many exciting objects from different collections. The beautifully produced catalog provides a valuable basis for further studies on African musical instruments. One would hope that such studies would try to show how instruments, as parts of a holistic system of sounding culture, can be more than just "sound- producing objects." Artur Simon Department of Ethnomusicology, Ethnographical Museum, Berlin Selected Musical Terms of Non-Western Cultures: A Notebook- Glossary. By WALTER KAUFMANN. Detroit Studies in Music Bibliography, No. 65. Warren, MI: Harmonie Park Press, 1990. x, 806 p., tables, glossary, bibliography. $75.00. Despite the rapidly growing number of publications on music around the globe, the number of reference works in ethnomusicology, particularly those going beyond the listing and description of musical instruments, remains quite small. This substantial volume contains many thousands of entries for terms pertaining to music and dance of Africa, Asia, and Oceania. In addition to organological terms, the work contains terms for genres, theoretical aspects of melody and rhythm (scales, formal structures, and so on), and even names of individual pieces. The terms are arranged in alphabetical order, with no subdivisions by region or musical category. Each entry identifies the culture area(s) in which the term is used and provides a definition which, in all but a few cases, consists of a brief phrase or two. For most terms the author also provides reference to one or two of his 321 sources, from which he presumably derived his definitions. Explaining in the Preface the provenance of this work from his own "jottings" over a period of fifty years, he warns: "By no means does this notebook claim to be a complete dictionary of musical terms, but as it proved useful to me during the past years, I hope that as a 'Notizbuch' and Glossary it may be of some use to scholars interested in non-Western terms if they wish to obtain quickly brief information by consulting a one-volume work." (p. ix) Because of the variety of sources on which he drew, he has included what he calls "dialectical and other distorted forms" whose spelling may vary from that preferred in other theoretical writings. Yet the work is rather consistent</page></plain_text>
