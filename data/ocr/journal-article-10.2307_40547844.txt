<plain_text><page sequence="1">Via Veneto Papers by Ennio Flaiano (Translated by John Satriano) Ennio Flaiano was born in 1910 in Pescara, Italy. He studied architecture, but later turned to journalism and film criticism, contributing regularly to // Mondo and Corriere della Sera. In 1947, with the publication of his first novel, Tempo di uccidere, he won the Premio Strega. He dedicated much of his time afterwards to the cinema, collaborating with Fellini as co-writer of the films La Strada, Nights of Cabiria, La Dolce Vita, Juliet of the Spirits and 8'/2, among others. He also published a volume of stories and satirical pieces: Diario notturno (1956), which was followed by Una e una notte (1959). Il gioco e il massacro (1970), which contains the short novels Oh Bombay! and Melampus, won the Premio Campione. Flaiano died in 1972, in Rome. The volumes La solitu- dine del satiro (1973), Autobiografia del blu di Prussia (1974) and Diario degli errori (1976) were published posthumously by Rizzoli. These notes were written at various moments and are not here in chronological order. What I wanted to recollect is a street, a film, an old poet: totally different things that are with little clarity mixed up with one another, not only in memory, but also in a diary. The jumps from one time to another have, then, a reason of their own.</page><page sequence="2">Via Veneto Papers 37 June 1958 I am working, with Fellini and Tullio Pinelli, dusting off an old idea of ours for a film, the one about the young man from the provinces who comes to Rome to become a journalist. Fellini wants to adapt the idea to the present day, to paint a picture of this "café society" of ours, which frolics between eroticism, alienation, bore- dom and improvident well-being. It is a society which, now that the terrors of the cold war are in the past (and perhaps even as a reaction to them) flourishes a bit everywhere. But here in Rome, by a mixing together of the sacred and the profane, of the old and the new, by the arrival of foreigners en masse, because of the cinema, it introduces us to characters who are more aggressive, subtropical. The film will have La Dolce Vita as its title and we have yet to write a single line of it. Vaguely, we're taking notes and going to the different places around town to refresh our memories. In just these last few years Rome has expanded outwards, blown itself out of proportion, gotten rich. Scandals explode with all the violence of summer storms. The people live out in the open. They sniff the air, they study, they invade the restaurants, the movie theaters, the streets, they leave their cars in those very same piazzas which once upon a time enchanted us for their architectural splendor, and which now resemble parking lots. One of our locations will, perforce, have to be Via Veneto, which is becoming more and more festive all the time; and this evening I took a walk there on purpose, wanting to see it as clearly as possible. How changed it is from '50, when I used to go there on foot every morning, crossing Villa Borghese, and stop at Rossetti's bookstore with Napolitano, Bartoli, Saffi, Brancati, Maccari and the poet Cardarelli. The air was clean, the traffic was light (Bran- cati used to go by bicycle), from the bakery shop came an odor of hot brioches. There was a gay, rustic animation all about. Journal- ists and writers were sitting down having an aperitif, the painters didn't have wholesalers yet, the people were doing less flying way up to the sky. At the barbershop I used to run into Mario Soldati, and he used to say to me: "I'm writing a novel." Amazing how a street can change! Now that summer is coming on it jumps at your eyes that this is no longer a street, but a beach. The cafés, which overflow onto the sidewalks - how many are there? six? seven? - have, each one of them, a different type of</page><page sequence="3">38 ENNIO FLAIANO umbrella for their tables, the same kind that the seaside establish- ments at Ostia have: and they aren't just street umbrellas, but big, gaudy party umbrellas. Some have tassels and straw festoons, like the ones from the Hawaiian islands, others hearken to the Offen- bach of Vie Parisienne, to the Grand Exposition, to the People's Progress. On every table are little flags, of the nations participating in the festival. On the street itself, automobiles glide to the theater like gondo- las, with little jerks, and the public takes in the fresh air and moves up and down with the false confidence of chorus singers and the indolence of seaweed. Our destiny remains then in the sea. We are so fond of this idea that we have adapted it in the only way that our laziness will accept it, by transforming streets into seaside resorts, by elaborat- ing a seaside style for houses, for automobiles, for attire and, finally, for citizens themselves, who have the appearance of being - and at heart they are - just so many bathers in the sea. Even the conversations are from the seaside: baroque and jocular; and they are concerned with a reality that is exclusively gastro-sensual. The only thing missing: no one is splashing himself or playing with a beach ball. December 1961 It is difficult these days to get to Via Veneto at all; and it is also useless, it looks like another city. Round about for a kilometer, it's impossible to find a spot to leave the car. I reach it on foot and count four Christmas trees along the way. The season's greetings are written in English. Snow, which paralyzes the city for a week when it falls, is evoked in the shop windows by flakes of cotton on the merchandise that's displayed behind the glass. There are stuffed animals a meter high in the bars and pastry shops: this is that American anthropomorphism which is asserting itself in the middle classes, with its animal ' 'friends of man" and other such similar friends of man: goats, fawns, sheriff cats, mice with little aprons, dwarves. Leaving a tobacco shop I'm struck by a curious sight. A girl is standing in front of the Café de Paris and on her head she is wearing a hat in the shape of a Christmas tree. Working a switch which she has in her pocket, she turns the little colored lights in her hat on and off. Poor girl, she's pouting, disillusioned, like a little</page><page sequence="4">Via Veneto Papers 39 child who, at the masked ball for little children, suddenly bursts out crying. And the photographers who are bivouacked day and night in front of the café look at her with a mixture of compassion and peevishness. Perhaps if some actor of note should pass by, or maybe Fellini, they could try to work her into the picture. "I don't know," a photographer says to me. "Maybe if somebody slapped her across the face ... If it isn't dramatic, we won't take a picture of it." The girl has crossed the ocean to attempt, in the climate of la dolce vita, a career as an actress, and now she is standing in front of the Café de Paris turning her little colored lights on and off. Why is her gimmick unacceptable? What does the public want? Nothing? April 1952 Every morning, the poet Cardarelli goes and seats himself in the only armchair in Rossetti's bookstore, and is a positive hin- drance to trade with his witticisms and even more with his gloomy silences, which leave the customers ill at ease. Rossetti has an air of not being offended by it, even of enjoying himself. Yesterday a young woman writer came in and set herself to browsing through a pile of books, making comments all the while which betrayed, a little, her nervousness and also her desire to make herself noticed by the poet. Picking up the works of Goethe published by Sansoni, she murmured: "Oh my God, now it's Goethe. How boring!" Cardarelli, who seemed to have fallen asleep, in the sudden silence that ensued, said, almost to himself, "It may be, Signora, that you're confusing him with Golden Gate" (which is a pastry shop on the same street). Today, sparkling with joy, another lady came in and asked Rossetti: "Do you have Le Diable au corps? I just saw the movie and now I want to read the book." And Cardarelli, astonished: "What an intense intellectual liveliness you possess, Signora." Then a young poet came in who, with a thousand com- pliments, begged him to recommend him to a certain magazine where he might have a chance of getting his poems published. He handed him one, assuring him first that it wasn't cheap stuff, no mere trifle. Cardarelli put on his eyeglasses, drawing them out from the bottom depths of his overcoat, and read the poem with his forehead wrinkled, as if he were reading a telegram. And finally: "But this is good stuff in the extreme, the kind of stuff they should</page><page sequence="5">40 ENNIO FLAIANO put in La Fiera Letteraria. " Then, it suddenly dawning on him that he himself is the director of La Fiera Letteraria, he started to laugh silently to himself, until his right eye began to fill up with tears. June 1958 One of the first scenes of the film ought to be the one in which the young provincial goes up to Via Veneto on foot, without a penny in his pocket, but overcome by the glamor of the crowd, which is his hope - because, in the warmth of his gratitude for the city he has already conquered, the protagonist believes that that crowd is a guarantee of life, of love and also an hypothesis of freedom. Happy faces, laughing mouths, pomp, elegance, noncha- lance, a woman who looks at him and smiles. And the cafés, where he will even find a friend, a promise of work, a loan! The reality is better, in a certain sense: more chilling. The cafés on the street have all been renovated and in such a showy way that one thinks immediately of their winter solitude when their gaiety will no longer be utilized and, like a Luna-Park in the rain, will inspire instead a feeling of melancholy. The ugly decorations on the inside are wonderful interpreters of our thirst for pomp, and the Café - ancient bulwark of the bourgeoisie - has become the showplace of the furniture maker. The couches lined with leather and velvet have disappeared. The deaf and venerable waiters and the tables of marble you could draw on, all gone. Now, the cafés seem like alcoves, pagodas, nursing homes, family tombs. April 1952 Things are starting to get spoiled. They are making the flower beds along Via Veneto with a great rim of cement. The ones they had before weren't good enough. Mino Maccari is indignant and tries to pass himself off as a minister, to see if he can talk the laborers into stopping their work. It doesn't come off. Afterwards, he makes me a proposal - to start a journal together, which we will call either Disagreeable Man or Dotard Illustrated. We sit down. He lapses into a few sudden and disconcerting silences during which it seems he wants to say something important. Who can tell? Then, all of a sudden, he starts to laugh. "Last night, I was thinking for some time about myself, trying to put together a philosophy of my life. Everything I was able to understand about</page><page sequence="6">Via Veneto Papers 41 myself I wrote on this little piece of paper. Here, read it." This is what was written there: "1) I don't know whom not to believe in. 2) I have a few ideas, but they are confused ideas. 3) I was looking for employment, instead, I found work. 4) I have a family I have to support. 5) I try very hard to understand, but, in the end, I don't understand anything." June 1958 So we've decided that the film will begin with the young provincial going to a nightclub. He is already well placed, he is making a living. He is one of those journalists who is the product of a civilization of sensationalism, that is, he reports scandals, the boners that other people commit. He allows himself to be adopted by this same society which he despises. He is complacent about renouncing his original ideals, which now seem to him, not only wearisome, but also useless. Towards midnight. The crowd from the movie theaters has settled in, and at some tables the talk is about the cinema: the only discussion (along with comparative makes of automobiles) that reveals a difference of taste and opinion. Towards three, it's all over. The big umbrellas are empty. The last friends of the night are met (almost always DeFeo, sometimes Carlo Levi, with his benevo- lent air of a country doctor), and it ends up at last in front of the newspaper stand, the only tranquil harbor for our nocturnal lunacy, the immense newsstand full of books and newspapers which always stays open, like a beacon shining back and forth . . . This one or that scrutinizes the sky to see if tomorrow will bring fair weather or not ... At the end of my walk home, on the edge of the sidewalk I found a conch. July 1959 At a table of the Caffè Rosati, in one of those rapid presenta- tions in which nothing can be understood, but which make one smile. I recognized an American lady - dry, tanned by the sun, slender, with something coleopteric in her eyes and in her iridescent green dress. Such was the impression that a friend of mine clarified for me - with that tone of gravity that redeems the gossipiness of certain stories - when he told me that every year this lady, for three months, with her husband's complete approval, takes a vaca-</page><page sequence="7">42 ENNIO FLAIANO tion for sexual fun and recreation to France and Italy. It seems that her psychoanalyst ordered her to do it. The woman, accordingly, picks out her men supported by the faith she has in getting healed. In her purse, she carries a little camera and with this she takes pictures front and rear of her subjects, preferably nude. One makes documents as best one can. By now she has an archive, which is perhaps useful to her for warding off boredom in the winter months when the cure is in a state of suspended animation. But personally I think that this archive of hers represents the tribute she pays to that modern day cult which makes a photographer out of every tourist, preoccupied with collecting evidence of his own exist- ence (by having proof of his having existed). June 1958 A society as troubled as ours, which expresses its frigid will to live more by showing itself off than by truly enjoying life, deserves to have petulant photographers taking pictures of it. Via Veneto has been invaded by these photographers. And our film will have one of its own, the indivisible companion of the protagonist. Fellini has very clearly realized this character in his head. He is acquainted with the real life model: a reporter for a news agency, about whom he tells me a story which is reasonably atrocious. This fellow had been sent to the funeral of a well known person who had been the victim of a terrible accident - in order to take pictures of the weeping widow. But, out of inattentiveness, the film was exposed to light, and the photographs didn't turn out. The director of the news agency said to him: "Make shift however you can. And in two hours, either bring me the widow weeping or I'll fire you and see to it you never find work again." Our reporter, therefore, dashed to the house of the widow and there found her just returned from the cemetary, still in her widow's weeds, and wandering from one room to another in a daze of grief and exhaustion. To be brief: he told the widow that if he failed to photograph her weeping he would lose his position and with his position the hope he had of getting married, because he had recently gotten engaged. The poor lady wanted to chase him away: figure that, after having wept so seriously and for such a long time, she wasn't in the mood for comedy. But at this point, the photographer gets down on his knees, begins to exhort her not to ruin him, to be kind, to cry for a</page><page sequence="8">Via Veneto Papers 43 minute, even to pretend! - only an instant to take her picture. He succeeds. Once the noose of compassion falls around her neck, the poor widow ends up getting photographed weeping on the matri- monial bed, at the writing desk of her husband, in the front room, in the kitchen. Now we will have to give this photographer an exemplary name, because the right name helps a great deal and indicates that the character will "live on." These semantic affinities between characters and their names drove Flaubert to despair. It took him two years, for example, to find Madame Bovary's first name, Emma. For this photographer of ours we don't know what to make up until, coming across that golden little book of George Gissing's entitled By the Ionian Sea we find the prestigious name of "Paparazzo." The photographer will be called Paparazzo. He will never know how to wear this honorable name (of a hotel keeper from Calabria, about whom Gissing speaks with gratitude and admiration). But names have a destiny of their own. May 1952 It sometimes seems strange that Cardarelli chose Via Veneto of all places to live out the last years of his life. If there is one street anywhere which can't help but be distasteful to him, it certainly has to be this one. At the time of our first friendship, he never used to leave the Corso district - the shops of Piazza del Popolo, the restaurants of Via del Gambero. His most audacious destination of an evening was Tito Magri's, a Tuscan wineshop on Via Capo, and now, look at him on Via Veneto, in fact, in the best section, near Porta Pinciana, among the crowd of grand hotels, the whistles of doormen hailing taxis, the film extras who are woking in Quo Vadis? and letting their beards grow. Today, he was out in the sun and he had an air of approving everything, like the old emigrant who has made his fortune and come back to his village. Actually, as far as money is concerned, he succeeds in putting together enough to pay for a pensione and a male nurse. But he has the self assurance that comes when one believes himself to be rich. As for love of his true homeland, he has given vent to all that in his books, and there can hardly be much more left in him. He knows that this is the last stopping place.</page><page sequence="9">44 ENNIO FLAIANO July 1958 I ran into an old film extra who for years now, in the midst of this historical-biblical-mythological rebirth of our cinematography, has been passing from one film to another without even changing his make-up. He is a wise man of Thebes, an arcon of Athens, a counselor to the court of Pharoah, a priest of Babylonia. In Crete, he is a labyrinth guard, on Olympus he is Saturn, in Galilee an apostle. He asks me for a small loan. I ask him: "Aren't you working?" He extends his arms, desolately. "I might be a Senator, but in September!" May 1952 I remember having run into Cardarelli in Piazza Cavour imme- diately after the war - all by himself, reduced to despair by the long solitude he had undergone and happy to have returned, that very day, to Rome. He was counting on the help of a few friends and especially Velso Mucci's, who was preparing an essay for the new edition of Prologhi. I remember that we sat on the edge of a fountain at the Palace of Justice; and that he started to resume little by little, together with his calm, his old black humor. "It won't be long now I'll die." "Nonsense. Right Away?" "I'd like to die here, at once, but without doing it on purpose," and he was smiling. A few days before Bruno Barilli had stopped in front of the Caffè Greco. He opened up one side of his duffel-coat and showed me a little roll of twine: "It's the rope I'm going to go hang myself with." And that's how these two poets began life again in those marvelous post-war days, which were open to everyone's hopes, feeling in the situation at hand that they were destroyed, by an outcome that they had themselves earnestly sought. Now Barilli is dead (like a great lord, asking for a comb); and Cardarelli spends his days along Via Veneto. There is something to meditate upon in his choice, a kind of challenge to the rules of the game, which require the old elephant to go and hide himself far away, in order to die. This poet, however, loves to show himself, to impose his presence, having an air about him of spoiling the fun for everyone else. September 1958 In three months, at the sea, we have finished writing La Dolce Vita, and now we're running into the usual problems. The producer</page><page sequence="10">Via Veneto Papers 45 refuses to do the film. He has given the script to four or five critics and now they are looking at us desolately and shaking their heads: the story is rambling, false, pessimistic, insolent: the public wants a little hope. "No," Eliot said somewhere, "the public only wants a little striptease, but what counts is that we get away with taking it off someone else's shoulders, without his noticing it." It's almost midnight, and, passing through Via Veneto, I see Cardarelli all by himself, sitting at the last table of the Caffè Strega. "They haven't come to pick me up," he says. He seems like a giant who has lost all his friends and missed the bus. The door- man who has the task of accompanying him home towards eight must have forgotten about him. In fact, he arrives a little later and puts on a little comedy of surprise: "What's this? No, still here? But I thought ..." They go through the gate slowly, rocking back and forth, at an angle, like two decadent epicureans after a night's revelry. At times it seems to me that there is a connection between Cardarelli and the protagonist of our rejected story. A connection which falls apart immediately. Cardarelli also came to Rome, extremely young and poor, from his native town, to be a journalist. At times, when he was in a confidential mood, he used to talk about his first steps in Umbertine Rome as a reporter for Avanti! He wrote about everything, furiously. Murders interested him, ritual bloodlettings, tragedies of passion. He signed himself Simonetto, Calandrino, Calibano! Then, suddenly, an illness, a long confinement in the same hospital ward where his father had died. The furor of youth vanishes, he becomes another, he looks inside of himself, discovers poetry, he makes it his morality and begins to write all over again. His first prose works are already perfect. Re-reading them today, almost prudently and perhaps with the unconscious hope of finding them old, I become aware that if there is an old man here, it isn't he. A great deal older and wrinkled are these literary troupiers who play clownish games with success . . .1 myself feel very much older. June 1962 Via Veneto - more and more unrecognizable, swept away by its own fame, abandoned to tourists, easy encounters and to cine- matography. The "intellectuals" have followed the painters to</page><page sequence="11">46 ENNIO FLAIANO Piazza del Popolo, topographically protected from the assaults of fashion by its ample spaces, by the absence of large hotels in the vicinity, by its few cafés. They no longer come to Via Veneto in the evening, but, rather, in the afternoon, to the presentations of new books, and not always even then. Three or four times a week, new books are presented at Golden Gate or at Einaudi's book store. Everyone is writing. Whoever isn't writing is collecting material. If the miracle of culture keeps progressing the way it's progressing, we will have a writer for every hundred inhabitants. Women - certain women - prove especially implacable. Listen, it's obvious: there can't be a bacchanal without Bacchantes. I have a feminine manuscript here on the table that I should be reading just to pass sentence on it, but I'm not doing it. I already know what's in store for me: tumid, sentimental, sexual, autobio- graphical adventures. For this sort of woman writing a novel means to tell badly the very things which she succeeded so well in hiding when she did them. July 1957 I took a long roundabout walk to avoid Cardarelli. I was in a hurry and so I committed this little act of cowardice, but others of his friends do the same thing. At about eight in the morning, Cardarelli descends from his pensione, which is over the Caffè Strega, and sits at the first table of the café itself, in front of the portal of the house. The waiters don't mind; they're happy because they know that he is a great poet and that he won the Premio Strega in 1948. They explain this to those clients who are a little curious to know who that gentleman is over there sitting with his overcoat and hat on at the very height of the dog days. A strange illness, that chills his legs, obliges Cardarelli to put on his entire wardrobe each time he leaves his house, when he has to abandon the stove to which he is practically attached. The waiters, in short, respect him, and the owner of the café has made it a rule to charge him very low prices, which would seem ridiculous to anyone else but which don't disturb Cardarelli in the least, because he doesn't know the price of anything and is perhaps convinced that the prices are the same in the other cafés too. Cardarelli is there for the entire day, keeping to a precise schedule: from eight till one; then, interval for lunch, one hour;</page><page sequence="12">Via Veneto Papers 47 and then, two till eight. At eight, he retires to his room, gets into bed and begins his titanic struggles with insomnia, which abandons him at dawn. Amerigo Bartoli gave me a drawing today which shows Car- darelli at the café together with the doorman of his building, the same one who goes to get him in the morning and who brings him back in the evening. Oftentimes the doorman sits modestly beside the poet, and he also looks out on that same animated coming and going, upon the swarms of pretty girls. Bartoli's drawing shows Cardarelli and the doorman who, by mistake, have exchanged headgear. The doorman has the poet's fedora and the poet the doorman's berretto. Bartoli's friendship with Cardarelli is long standing; the two of them love each other; but without excluding a few blows. For example, Bartoli, talking about Cardarelli, says that he is "the greatest dying poet in the world." A few days later a lady, who comes from his province, stops to greet Cardarelli, and asks: "And Bartoli? How's Bartoli doing?" Desolately, the poet responds: "He's not growing, Signora, he's not growing!" And continuing to allude to the painter's diminutive stature, he adds: "At night, he's nervous, he can't sleep, and he paces back and forth underneath his bed." Nevertheless, Cardarelli does nothing but watch out the corner of his eyes for Bartoli's arrival, in a frenzy if he's late. But no sooner does he see him appear at the corner of Via Sardegna, he turns his head in the opposite direction, like a lover who has decided to break off a romance, and pretends not to see him. Today I was a witness at this little interview: "Cardarelli, what do you think about prizes for literature?" "Don't ask me stupid questions." "All right, are you against prizes for literature then?" "If it's a questions of a gift, no. If it's a question of a judgement, yes. I find it indecent that several writers should get together to pass judgement on the work of another writer. But be that as it may ... if you want to properly award prizes to the best writers, then every so often you have to cudgel one or two of the worst." "But what about the great prizes? The Nobel Prize, for exam- ple?"</page><page sequence="13">48 ENNIO FLAIANO 'The great prizes are never given to the writer. They're given to his readers. Poor beggars, if they deserve them." 4 'Have you decided whom to vote for in this year's Premio Strega?" "Yes, but I haven't read anything of 'his.' I would take ..." "What, never? Is he that trustworthy?" "No. These votes are cast with a certain contempt." Evening descends upon Via Veneto with an uneasy quickness. During certain silences in the traffic you can hear the sparrows of Villa Borghese in flocks, flying in the air before settling down on the tops of the pine trees. I was sitting at the café and I was intent upon divining the arrival of night in the face and in the eyes of Cardarelli, as you can sometimes succeed in divining it in a lake, and a profound melancholy came over me as a result, almost as if that face reflected my own, and my lost day, rendered more dis- tressing by the certainty of another day and then another on this street without exits. Out of inattentiveness, and in order to say one of those model sentences that have come to characterize a boring conversation, Raffaella Pellizzi, who was sitting next to Cardarelli, said with a sigh, "Ed é subito sera." Cardarelli shook his head, and murmured: "What a profound concept. And how pleasing it must be." These are the only moments when he can be seen smiling. He would like to go on but he hasn't the will for it; he hasn't the will for anything, not even to die. September 1957 Fashionable success is obtained with publicity and is paid for by prostituting oneself to the crowd. Success doesn't change by inverting the order of factors. Perhaps it becomes more lasting, through "suffering." Success obtained with merit and paid for with indifference annoys the gross public and, for some time now, everybody else too. Today an elegant lady, who imitates the speech of a certain temperamental actress (she always performs in her undergarments), said, talking about a music magazine with which she was involved: "Extremely interesting. I laughed so hard I p in my pants." And she doesn't even lower her voice, inasmuch as we're on Via Veneto. The gentleman who is with her adds politely and</page><page sequence="14">Via Veneto Papers 49 with the air of someone who keeps himself up to date: "But, my dear, you should have your urine psychoanalyzed." A society like this no longer has a need for anything: it knows as much as will suffice to keep it refined and à la mode: and it has a certain faith in vulgarity as a means of defense against anything that surpasses its interests. May 1955 Raffaella Pellizzi has decided to put a little order into Car- darelli's life; and she has begun by tidying up his room. She was telling me today that while she was clearing off his work table (where he hasn't sat in months), among an absurd heap of books, bottles, notebooks, letters that he hadn't sent, letters that he had received and never opened, among old scarves and medicines of every description she found eight fountain pens and six pair of scissors. The drawer of the night table was open and filled with books that ascended like a tottering tower, and among the books were the slippers whose disappearance the poet had, for some time, been lamenting. She found no work of his, neither books nor manuscripts. Cardarelli no longer writes. For years now. He doesn't even like anyone to speak to him about poetry or literature. They have lost their value, like dead things, refuse. They leave him gasping for air, and if the conversation happens to fall that way, it's almost as if he were biting into a fruit full of ashes. His body survives his spirit. He puts up with surviving grudgingly, perhaps seeking in life the extremity of degradation, curious to see how far the spirit that sustains him can, at the same time, corrupt his body, with the stoic implacability of someone who observes: "I told you so." On these sunny mornings, Via Veneto sparkles with a beauty that is a little offensive, opulent, tenderly crowned with the green of the few careless trees that punctuate the flower beds, among the continuous flow of automobiles, the indolent promenade, the som- nolent bliss of the people who are sitting at the tables of the cafés. This is the hour in which the ladies go in and out of the shops, the hour in which journalists run into each other and ask: "What are you up to?" The morning mist is dissolving under a glorious sun that pushes the clouds towards the west. It is still the hour in which you keep asking yourself whether today isn't the day to have lunch</page><page sequence="15">50 ENNIO FLAIANO with your friends, and then to decide that such isn't the case. We are acquainted with the afternoon that will result, careless, empty, and then back to the city. Better to stay here. Today a photographer, who works for a French magazine, begged me to pose for him. He had me sit at a table and asked me to speak and act naturally. Someone stopped to observe the scene, which was, for me, a source of burning shame. And all the while, the photographer jumping from one spot to another, looking at the sun, adjusting his lens. I begged him to spare me an extended torture and he took me under the arm, pushing me towards Villa Borghese, where we would be able to continue unobserved. Lean- ing against the trunk of a tree and under the continuous gaze of the photographer, I felt a hand on my shoulder and heard a voice saying to me: "Ah, hah, I caught you by surprise!" I turned around and there was a certain man whose name I am never quite able to remember; and so, there we stood: I, with a silly smile on my face, he, shaking his head back and forth, and the photogra- pher saying: "Wonderful, move just a little, just like that, wonder- ful." November 1958 "Oh, how marvelous to feel you're profoundly intelligent, to wax mawkish about Sex, to remain indifferent towards women . . . To respond to every inquiry, to always have an opinion, to sign petitions, to explain the situation . . . Oh, how wonderful to be oriented with fleeting fashion, to be continuously remade in the image and likeness of mass culture ... to swear upon commercial art, to repeat that Industry is beautiful, and to end the day with the crack of a pistol." We were crooning in this way, Fellini and I, driving down Via Veneto when a traffic guard blew his whistle and had us pull over next to the sidewalk. We had gone through a red light - fine: 3,000 lire. "I don't have a dime," Fellini said, "but I can make you out a check." The guard looked at us severely. "One second," Fellini continued. "You seem to know who this man is. Let's do it like this. You lend us five thousand lire, we pay the fine and we'll come back tomorrow, same time, same place, and give you back the five thousand." Inasmuch as the guard was looking at us without understanding, Fellini repeated the proposition: "What can you</page><page sequence="16">Via Veneto Papers 51 lose? If we pay the fine, you'll make a good showing with your superiors and we'll even be able to get a little gasoline. If you don't want to give us a loan, what happens instead? We can't pay." "I don't have five thousand lire," said the guard. "Come on, let's not make jokes," Fellini said. "Do you expect us to believe that you've never committed an offense? Come on, give us a break." The guard looked at us, shaking his head all the time, then, sighing, said: "Go, go." It seems certain that his film will never be made. Even so, Fellini never gets tired thinking about it and spends all of his time talking to actors, choosing types, sending out telegrams, getting acquainted with the equivocal underbrush of Via Veneto and its surroundings. He wants to project the image of an unreal Rome, to reconstruct everything, or to concede that little to reality which is already unreal in itself: Trevi Fountain, Saint Peter's, the Roman countryside. July 1957 The people don't walk to their destinations. They promenade, grazing the tables, lingering, as if they were in the piazza of a little town in the middle of a feast day. The people at the tables fix their eyes on the stream of people that flows by on the sidewalks, while the passersby fix their eyes on the animated banks of the cafés. It's as if everybody were tacitly acquainted with one another, a criss- cross of sweet and foggy glances, which hide - at this hour, what else could it be? - an erotic appraisement. I'm sitting at a table with Ivella, who never gets tired of watching. She has just come back from America, and forgotten all about this crowd. Finally she bursts out: "What makes me furious is that the Italians are all different from one another. It isn't a race. It's a collection! Just look! Just look!" March 1961 "What are you working on that's good? Cinema?" "No, I'm writing a comedy." "That's interesting. Would it be inconvenient if I asked you to tell me a little bit about the plot, the problem, the theme?" "Not at all. In short, it's about this." (He pauses.) "Listen . . . everyone is made to believe that in the future, Man, hand in hand</page><page sequence="17">52 ENNIO FLAIANO with the increase in population, will be increasingly more alone, especially in the big cities. Increasingly more alone, restrained increasingly by inhibitions, by laws, by reciprocal control, by the tyranny of machines, by the necessity of success, by the enigma of the future, by the terror of a war. And then, one day, even art will end, in the same way that love will end." "Very interesting." "But in a backward province somewhere, in some sort of depressed zone, the one and the other are still alive, love and art. The people are a little ashamed, especially about love. It's so provincial! 'But besides that,' they say, justifying themselves, 'what can you do, here, in this little town with four cats?' So they cultivate art and love. They write terrible books, they paint, and, in the wee hours of the night, when they're just getting home, they play electronic music, which, by this time, is extremely superannu- ated, in fact, it's been completely forgotten by the rest of the world. And then, resigned and in their own backward way, they also make love." "Yes, it's really interesting. What then?" "Elsewhere, in the big cities, where poetry, painting and music have become by this time forms of applied art (art is something with which one dresses oneself), there are other problems for these unhappy societies to worry about: the correct utilization of time, the removal of slums, complete safety, diet . . . Pornography (in literature and the movies) enjoys a period of success - because everyone reads about and looks at things that he doesn't want or that he simply can no longer do. The protagonist of my comedy, who lives in one of these cities, is constrained to betake himself to that little provincial town I was just telling you about. There, he has a girl cousin, who candidly confesses to him that she spends all of her time painting and making love. Our friend feels a great deal of pity for her, he tries to find a way to cure her. To be brief, it ends up that he also starts painting and making love. He discovers that certainty is in uncertainty, repose in struggle, etc. He discovers, by and by, a 'backward' woman who takes him back, first, to love and then, to art. But one day, he thinks: These two activities will end up by giving me nothing but troubles. He leaves his little cousin and goes back to the city, where, naturally, he kills himself." "Very interesting. And when will this comedy of yours be</page><page sequence="18">Via Veneto Papers 53 finished?" "Never." September 1954 Barilli, Brancati ... it seems that death is going by alphabeti- cal order. It wouldn't surprise me. I've always imagined death as a hard-headed school-teacher, who scours his attendance sheet in order to call upon those students who are least prepared. Now, Vitaliano Brancati. A few evenings ago I ran into him as he was leaving his favorite café - in a hurry. We hardly even greet each other, then he feels the need to come right back and, shaking my hand, says: "I'll be gone before long and I'm not sure that we'll see each other again. I wanted to say good-bye." I answered back with a few words, joking. He was going to Torino, to perform . . Now we're at a freight station, in front of a wagon with a casket on top. We are almost all here, all of his night-time friends, the faces a little faded by the scirocco. Someone speaks and eulogizes Brancati, the man and writer. Cardarelli is also there, immersed in his cape with the fur collar. When it's over, we go away like thieves after a job that has turned out badly, surreptitiously, avoiding comments, while two porters throw wreaths and clusters of flowers into the wagon and close it up. March 1960 Is another reality at all necessary? Isn't this rosy Roman reality sufficient? Certainly, it is hard to live and be judged in a city where the only industry of note is cinema. One ends up by believing that life is a mere function of cinema. The photographic eye makes us in its own image and likeness. One sees reality as a reflection of that which lives and palpitates on the screen. A dog bites his tail, and ends up finding it quite tasty. The night is calm. Converstions can be heard that go like this: "In other words, you don't like cinema." "No, I like it. I even respect it. I make use of it. I am even something of a slave to it, as I am to all modern comforts. But cinema isn't art or, rather, it is an edible art, which satisfies hunger for the moment. The trouble is that it pretends to portray reality. So, the best film moves me for a year perhaps, for three, ten, then it reveals its limits, its true nature, the emotional necessities that</page><page sequence="19">54 ENNIO FLAIANO produced it ... Then, that reality which the film believed it was fixing forever is rendered clumsy, absolutely incomprehensible by time. The best film challenges a generation and then becomes a document, unbeknownst to itself. It looks at this street, these people. Shoots them just as they are: today, the result will satisfy you, in ten years you will find it all old, in twenty ridiculous, in fifty you will shout: what a wonderful document! Moral: every dramatic film slowly sets out to be comical." 44 And do the directors know these things?" "Yes. I think so. They know." A long pause, during which the two friends watch the people who are passing by, and are watched in their turn, for the purpose of a summary erotic evaluation. "Let's see how far we understand each other. What, according to you, is a director?" "In the exceptional cases, the director is an artist, a supernu- merary poet, who is never sure that he won't lose his post. The true poet, the true artist, advancing in years, getting older, improves his production, thjns it out, refines it, frees it from the dregs, enriches its spirit. This is possible because he works by himself and for himself: and his experience with life is fatally carrying him to newer and newer mysteries. A director on the other hand declines after a certain age, because his art has an immediate need for public approval, the basis for which has, in the meantime, changed. That reality, which he believes he is portraying, no longer works. It's finished. It no longer has customers. The problem arises: at what age does it become necessary to kill a good director?" "Look. There's DeFeo, Ercule Patti, Arbasino and Carlo Levi. Let's go over there and join them." September 1954 Cardarelli spoke to me at length about a cinematographic project of his. He would like to write, or he would like someone to write, a film about 1911. "Of course," he adds, "he would have to do research; but I have that year in front of my eyes, just like a film. It's the fiftieth anniversary of National Unity and in Rome they're preparing grandiose festivities: the International Exposition of Valle Giulia, the Regional Ethnographic Show . . . The monu-</page><page sequence="20">Via Veneto Papers 55 ment to Victor Emanuele is dedicated, the Ponte Victor Emanuele, the Palace of Justice, in short, everywhere, the chintziest architec- ture imaginable. The Zoological Gardens are also dedicated. Pincio and Villa Borghese are joined together, the Capitoline palaces are joined together with galleries of papier-maché . . . And again with papier-maché they built a pavilion in Piazza Colonna, where today a gallery stands. There were cafés, restaurants, a nickelodeon. Here, on Via Veneto, the Excelsior was dedicated. Where we're sitting now, there was a dairy. Zuloaga, Franz von Stuck, Mes- trovic, Sartorio, Michetti, Klimt, Sergent and a number of other pompieroni were in their triumph in Valle Giulia. It is the apotheosis and the liquidation of the whole of European pom- pierismo, the triumph of papier-maché and floral decorated cement. Can't such a film be done that includes all these tri- umphs?" "Yes, very interesting. But, look ..." "And add that all these festivities are playing to the empty air, because the French newspapers are spreading the word that there is cholera in Rome. Every protest is useless. No one is coming to Rome. The deficit is enormous. Our patriotic melancholies begin precisely because the festivities are a failure. An extremely squalid summer goes by and in autumn war breaks out with Libya. Another series of disasters began. Can't a film be done about blundered triumphs and disasters?" "Cardarelli, that's just what we're doing." December 1960 Every so often I still find someone who, more or less beating around the bush, reproaches me for having collaborated in the portrayal of Rome, in La Dolce Vita, as a bilge of vice. Strange, because I think just the opposite. I would like to answer these people with the words of my friend Frassineti: "There is a kind of madness which consists in losing everything, except reason." In other words: Is it my fault if Vice in Rome quickly becomes rational and utilitarian? And my fault if, when it isn't fed by passion, it becomes simply an exterior fact, a costume, a source of satisfaction, a fashion? It seems to me that one of the reasons, perhaps the principal</page><page sequence="21">56 ENNIO FLAIANO reason, that keeps Rome from being a city of great vices is the affable familiarity of its nature, even when it's a question of corruption. This character derives from its being an agglomeration of big towns, tending to grow more horrible towards the periphery, all gathered around the nucleus of the ancient city - towns inhab- ited by first or second generation emigrants who have preserved their provincial habits and customs. So, in Rome, every great "vice" takes on the trappings of a pastime which becomes boring once the first novelty of it wears off. When it comes to vices, no one is a harder case than the provincial: they don't agree with him very well, and he ends up by finding them all ridiculous and dispensable, without even taking into consideration that they are bad for the health. The Vice capitals of the world have their fame solidly based on alcohol, on drugs, on violence, on great passion and, above all, on Remorse, that is, upon the reflections of the ultimate ends of Sin. In Rome, today, no one drinks except with his meal. To run into a drunk on the streets in the middle of the night is becoming more and more unlikely. In some bar on the periphery you may run into him, but look at him even there: he isn't making an uproar, he's not threatening anyone, he's not being kicked out the door like a sack of potatoes: instead, he's discussing soccer surrounded by a group of ironic young men, and that's how they will round out their evening. In the bars of the center, in the bars of Via Veneto, we know who drinks liquor ostentatiously. There are perhaps a hundred people altogether: and with time, they become objects of admiration because they reveal a familiarity with travel, with the European way of life. Rather than corrupted by vice, they consider themselves privileged - they enjoy the esteem of the barmen, and every dispute which involves either alcohol or the usages of the bel mondo is deferred to their judgement. The other customers drink coffee, orangeade and even milk. In many people, the indecisive- ness they experience when ordering assumes desperate dimensions until they finally find enough courage to say to the waiter, in a profound whisper that reveals an equally profound absence of vices: "A coffee . . . with a little . . . milk." And when the waiter goes away, they call him back to remind him: "Cold! Make sure the milk is cold!" Now these ¡people are not abstemious because they have decided to wage war on Evil or because they don't have</page><page sequence="22">Via Veneto Papers 57 money: they are abstemious because they haven't anything to for- get and they want to remain lucid, rational - yes, to abandon themselves to vice, but to keep one eye open at the same time. Drugs have also had a very unlucky time of it. They hearken back to the other post-war era; and, for that reason, they're ridicu- lous-and the few adepts of the sect joke about their weakness. Finally, the Roman doesn't need to feel that he is different from that which he is, to exalt himself; he admires himself enough already, he always wears his best clothes when he goes for a walk, he takes in everything, he considers himself unsurpassable in at least two principal activities of the spirit: film criticism and auto- mobile criticism. These two are more than sufficient to assuage the ambitions of his particular Super-Ego. If you see two young men talking at the same time in front of this very café at two o'clock in the morning you can almost bet money on it that they are taking turns explaining why Ingmar Bergman is already a director who is behind the times and which of his too many films is sincerely stupid or theatrical. If, instead, you see a little group of young men loitering like gangsters around an automobile and you fear for the people inside, don't be alarmed: those young men are discussing the velocity, the pick-up, the gasoline mileage of this model com- pared to its predecessor. If another young man happens to come by with a new utilitarian model and announces that he just bought it, all of his friends will weakly lift themselves out of their armchairs to take a look at this utilitarian 'machine', which they are already extremely well acquainted with, just to comfort their friend by giving it their approval. And you will see young men, who wouldn't exert themselves for anything in the world, wearing themselves out testing the clutch, slamming the doors to listen for rattles, opening the hood to look underneath. We were talking about drugs. Certainly, they would have a better time of it if Romans could buy them without any risk, just for the sake of novelty. And if their wives and mothers would do their shopping for them, because when it's a question of price, they're the only ones in the family who know how to shop wisely. Then, in the pharmacies, cocaine would be sold in "family sizes," and everyone would have a bit of white powder on his necktie; perhaps in the exact spot where now, after dinner, they all have a bit of talcum. The poet of this society remains forever Petrolini:</page><page sequence="23">58 ENNIO FLAIANO "Rina/lei per me la cocaina/se la prende a colazione/ pensando a Gastone."* May 1962 Here's something that will make Mario Soldati happy. I saw his novels and his latest volume of poems, Le canzonette, displayed in the shop window of his barber on Via Veneto. Though it isn't exactly the barber who is displaying them (you can't have every- thing in life, Mario). This is what happened: the old barber retired from business and gave the place up to an editor from Milan, who transformed the "shop" into a bookstore, nay, into an exposition of books. In place of locations, behold Arpiño, Butor, Tobino, Soldati. For my part, I was touched. I used to come here too, to get my hair cut, and Tennessee Williams must have come here as well, because he mentions it in The Roman Spring of Mrs. Stone. The interior design was in the solid style of Ducrot 1920, in mahagony and marble. Now, it being a question of Via Veneto, the architect knew very well how to give the same tone to the decor that all the other stores are taking on. And so, it seems to me that this is the only bookstore in the world that is well furnished with mirrors, and which resembles in its parts a beauty salon. The industry of culture reaches out to a new public which is sensitive to cadeau and wrapping paper. But perhaps in this way it does a good job of expressing two vicious characteristics of our contemporary litera- ture: autobiography and vanity. Back at home, I spent the evening reading Le canzonette, and finally I think I began to understand why Soldati left Rome once and for all: because the city had begun to appear to him like a good natured demon, accommodating and rational, which was crushing his idea of sin into pulp: that is, like the worst of demons. December 1960 (continuation and end) Great passions, great errors? The Roman doesn't commit great errors and doesn't forgive them in others. He who exagger- ates is "a fanatic." Rome doesn't have a court of miracles. It doesn't have hobos in any distressing number; the beggars have all * Roughly: "Lorainne / she to me a dose of cocaine / She takes it with her toast and honey / thinking about Gastone."</page><page sequence="24">Via Veneto Papers 59 become parking lot attendants, and it's more difficult to get into that profession than it is to get into the notary public's. Even along the periphery, the sub-proletariat aspires to "redemption," to sta- ble employment and, in the absence of anything better, it impresses its enterprises with a seasonal rhythm: in winter, automobile theft, in spring, purse snatching, in summer, hub-caps and spare tires. It takes imagination to find this sort of existence arduous and violent. Perhaps Rome lacks compulsive gamblers, rebels, "broken lances," failed idealists, the contemptuous of money, who add salt to a society. It lacks false messiahs, unpublished poets (everybody publishes something), gloomy visionaries, mad speculators, Sun- day painters, sidewalk philosophers: they wouldn't have a public. It lacks, in other words, great sinners. On the contrary, sin, which is, clearly, par excellence, carnal sin, is its only real diversion. How much drama and remorse can it possibly stir up? Rather, it will stir up memories and regrets in the old and new plans and new hopes in the young, who are always disposed to them. Certainly, pederasty has its active participants and sympathiz- ers, but there are also a great many mercenaries, a species of manual laborers; and, these days, even the rural districts are con- tributing their fair share. It doesn't provoke great spiritual commo- tion, only gossip and an occasional horror story for the newspapers. The "responsible" pederasts have this defect: they are singularly, almost all of them, very nice, quick-witted, intelligent, attracted by the arts, studious; put them together, and they remind you of gypsies and alpini, who, whenever they're in a group, immediately start to sing in harmony or to speak in dialect: unbear- able. What other vices do we have in this dolcissima Roma of ours? Literature? But the Roman literati are models of every virtue, not excluding a healthy exhibitionism. And in what other hamlet have prizes for literature taken on such a modest and familiar tone as in Rome, where the prizes are awarded right in the house? And where else do there exist the fine organized excursions on the order of "One day in Capri, blue grotto included," which bring the Reader together with a Writer of his choice, offering him his book, plus a cold lunch, all for the mere sum of 3,000 lire, wine not included? And where else can anyone, whoever he is, establish an award and give it time and time again to whatever writer is easiest for him to</page><page sequence="25">60 ENNIO FLAIANO read, assured thereby of the comprehension of all the interested parties? And then there's always prostitution. But the appearances which this activity has to keep up are so exhaustingly hypocritical that, in the end, it winds up being work pure and simple, a source of revenue for certain families, an increment to tourism, to the little businesses they have, their little mortgaged shops, security for their old age and something to keep the pimps occupied: something that can be more interesting to an economist than to a moralist. When it's all added up, behold, a serene panorama, dominated by reason. The only great attraction that's left is Sex which is, par excellence, La Donna, Woman. But this inclination of the Roman towards Woman never takes on the aspect of a ruinous vice, or of passion. Sex is a comfort, even, vaguely, para- familiar. Last sum- mer, Lily Niagara came to Rome to put on a strip-show. After four days, in the place where she was working, they were coming in with reduced tickets from Enal. * March 1962 Today, towards seven, the cafés along Via Veneto were almost deserted and the basement of Einaudi's bookstore was chock-full of critics and writers who had come from every quarter of the city, and even from other cities, for the presentation of Giorgio Bas- sani' s new novel to the public. The presenting of new books in this fashion, the way kings used to stand on their balconies and present the newly born crown prince to the crowd, is recent: a few years ago it would have heaped ridicule on an author; today it is accepted as a form of deliberate persuasion, a postulate of mass culture. Five writers, who have already read the novel while it was in proofs, have put together a eulogy. Most acclaim it. Others, with closed teeth, admit that the novel is beautiful, well written, but not prob- lematical, nay, it's constructed from memory. Proust is cited. Soldati even cites himself. Leaving through the crowd, which resembles the ones in the catacombs, someone blows the first short- sighted epigram of the evening at my ears: "Isn't it lovely / to live in a country / where Proust is exchanged for Bassani?" * Ente Nazionale Assistenza Lavoratori: Workman's compensation board (transla- tor's note).</page><page sequence="26">Via Veneto Papers 61 April 1959 Whenever he's invited to some official party or other, Car- darelli borrows his evening dress (a tuxedo) from the waiter of the Caffè Strega. His last outing was yesterday, April 25, to Villa Madama. He was invited to a dinner in honor of a writer who had won the Penna d'Oro. Cardarelli himself also won a prize recently, the Torre, which is given fairly often, and almost to everybody, in a restaurant close to the Campidoglio. At the moment in which they gave him his silver bull he was happy, but the next day he was quite crestfallen when the doorman, whom he had sent off to see what he could get for that pound or so of silver, returned almost immedi- ately. It wasn't silver. I accompanied Cardarelli up to his room. The stench was unbearable. I opened the window which looks out onto one of those dark, viscid courtyards, inhabited by cats, with a little cess- pool at the bottom. Here, Via Veneto is only a facade. Scarcely do you enter these old houses than the old Rome of narrow portals, of dark stairways, of the corridors with an odor of cabbage and must grabs you by the throat. Once upon a time, towards the end of the century, the gardens of the Ludovisi and of the Boncompagni were here - the tree-lined avenues, the vineyards, the little woods decked out with statues. The formulators of the urban plan didn't like that stuff though (and they still don't like it) and decided that Via Veneto (then it was called Via dei Cappuccini) would be the central street in a district of housing for the people. The quarter of the rich bourgeoisie, of the high officers of State, of the conquering Piedmontese, would be, instead, the Esquiline. "Nunc licet Exquiliis habitare salubribus ..." Accordingly, they made Piazza Vittorio Emanuele with porticos, immense buildings, balconies and caryatids, like the ones in Turin. Along Via dei Cappuccini they put up tenements. Then, with time, as in a quadrille, rich and poor changed places: the poor went into the houses of the rich and Via Veneto became the fashionable street. It filled up with hotels, with cafés ... But here in this courtyard you get the feeling that every- thing started out badly. The poet's room is narrow, with a room for the toilet fitted up in the corner. His table is a state of precarious order. "I don't have anything anymore," Cardarelli says with a hint of pleasure. I only see two photographs, groups of friends from his faraway youth. Next to his window, the stove. Cardarelli</page><page sequence="27">62 ENNIO FLAIANO sits on the bed, with his greatcoat on, like an emigrant who is waiting for the ship's departure, or like an earthquake victim who, sitting on the only piece of furniture that he has left, in this way implies that he is the possessor of it, and who won't abandon it because he doesn't want to see it carried away. May 1959 It had to be two o'clock in the morning, but there was a reflected light from the clouds, which were flying low. Via Veneto was deserted, as if sleeping before it was time. The houses, with their squalid facades, which all the advertising in the world will never succeed in cheering up, were quiet; their lights were spent. I heard a sound of drums coming from Porta Pinciana and behold! a parade issuing from the fornices. Leading it were a dozen major- ettes, with bare legs and white suspenders. They were beating on their drums, and a tall, long-legged girl was twirling a baton and catching it in mid-air. Behind them - smiling, responding to the greetings of an invisible crowd - came a group of people who seemed, little by little, to recognize their surroundings: poets and writers, a few painters. An old man, who was being carried on somebody's shoulders and being swarmed about like a saint in a procession, was protesting amiably to his admirers. * 'Please, you crazy people. What are you doing anyway? I just want to get down," and he was tottering back and forth, from one side to another. I saw Sandro Penna who made me a sign of greeting, almost excusing himself at the same time for having to go on. He would be back, later. Sinisgalli was driving a graceful little jalopy in which all his manuscripts and drawings - a few more unpub- lished than not - were displayed behind the windshields. I saw Bassani with his arm around Alberto Moravia, and Goffredo Bellonci between Alberto Ar basino and Italo Cal vino: they were singing. Mario Soldati was imitating himself, running from one group to another and reciting a few lines of his poetry: * 'About life I am learning the meaning, / how bitter and how hard it can be: / wisdom is got only by suff'ring, / much too late, alas, does one see The street, meanwhile, was filling up with people all of a sudden - as when the guests are admitted in the plays of Labiche: tourists, waiters getting off their shifts, cab drivers just beginning</page><page sequence="28">Via Veneto Papers 63 theirs, abusive parking lot attendants, married couples coming out of the movie houses discussing Antonioni, photographers, tall, gangly Americans, entire jet crews, bourgeois students, girls with tangled hair, young men with high collars, prostitutes, pimps, robbers and swindlers, all coming out in swarms from the side streets. All were applauding, without knowing for what or for whom. At the wheel of his 1937 Fiat 500, the poet Juan Rudolfo Wilcock was declaiming his immortal verses: "Every morning at dawning, this light of violets / sends up a fragrance in the immobile little gardens / turns back from the roofs of the first cars it encounters / and lights the broken glass scattered among the flow- ers." I didn't see Pasolini. Where was Pasolini? Could his bashful- ness have kept him at home? No, he was coming too, in the middle of a group of young poets and calm, haughty directors. They were following swarms of young girls, actors, actresses, directors, the juries of literary prizes, worker- writers, worker-painters, worker- critics, pleasant faces, misanthropes, sons of celebrities, wives of painters, all mixed up in a gay procession. Flowers were raining down from above. "Where are you going?" I shouted to Defeo, who was walking along the sidewalk, keeping himself a little out of sight. He answered with a vague gesture. Running, I found myself once more at the head of the parade, which all of a sudden had come to a halt. In the middle of the street was a man and he was making a sign with his hand that he wanted to speak. It was Cardarelli. With his voice a little hoarse and sweet, he was saying: "Friends. I have asked you for too much, and you have given me too little. It has been a marriage of conven- ience and incompatibility. We have not understood each other and we have not corresponded. We have suffered so much being together! But now we must go our separate ways." In the first echelon of the parade, someone asked: "But who is he? What does he want?" Cardarelli was going on: "But you don't know what it is that's good and useful to life. Your word doesn't bear witness. What do your silences say? There is no system in your silences or in your words . . ." "Down in front!" someone shouted "You don't know that words, if they have any value at all, have it only by virtue of their implications ..."</page><page sequence="29">64 ENNIO FLAIANO "Enough! Music, let's get going again: Long live culture!" "Your measure is poor of liberty and avaricious of hope ..." 4 * Away! Cuckold! Police!" "You can't imagine all the double bottoms, the black spells, the discretions of intelligence there are among men!" "Silence! Beat the drums! Continue!" "We have shared a conscience without horizons. Every moment has covered and exhausted its continuity. On every new occasion, whenever we have separated, we have dried up and become threatening. And now it's time for us to bid each other farewell." The parade at this point started to move on again, squawking and clamoring. And at this point I woke up. June 1962 I am reading Gli inganni, by Sandro DeFeo. The story takes place in Rome, in a single day. Perhaps on account of something pressing and worrisome in the narrative, it is like a gust of wind that carries dust, leaves, waste paper and even some precious and imponderable material, our own life, our useless illusions, an effort of years, a love for a city which is unique and which leaves one loving it and despising it, according to the humors and the specta- cles it has to offer. The true Rome is in shadow, it covers itself with years and becomes a landscape of the memory, a part of ourselves: the most secret and unique part, from which a certain salvation can come to us. The other Rome can irritate us, but it reveals too much of its complacent game to become really dangerous. One ends up laughing at it. On page 121 and following, DeFeo speaks of Via Veneto for example: "So tonight it's Via Veneto. The spectacle of a charnel house under a green marquee is exactly what it is, but undoubtedly my nerves have been scraped by the wind and have made me exaggerate its obscenity and its grotesqueness. If I had the strength to do whatever, I would start to laugh, the way I laugh when I read the stories of the Marquis De Sade, where the author is excessively pressing his hand ..." The green marquee ... I forgot all about the new addition: the big umbrellas of the café tables have disappeared from Via Veneto, those very umbrellas which gave it the air of a beach.
