<plain_text><page sequence="1">SODASAMANGALA The Sixteen Auspicious Symbols Representing the Male and the Female Principles in Early Medieval Sinhalese Art T. B.Karunaratne Parti Introduction The group of symbols known as sodasamangala, the Sixteen Auspicious Symbols, though not so popular as the astamangala, the Eight Auspicious Symbols, is occasionally referred to in inscriptions and in Sinhalese literature of the Polonnaruva period and later. In the Ruvanvâlisly a slab inscription of Queen Kalyânavafi (12th century A. C.) it is said that the queen on hearing the various ceremonies performed by ancient kings like Dutthagâmanï and others in honour of the Mahâthûpa, caused many offerings to be made to the stüpa and had the solosmangala (Skt. sodasamangala) drawn with five y alas of rice.1 Vidyacakravarti in his Butsarana says that on the occasion the Buddha preached the First Sermon, the gods drew solosmangala with pearls which they scooped out from the depths of the ocean.2 Two centuries later Saddharmâlankâraya refers to solosmangala along with atamangala (Skt. astamangala).3 It is said that Gotha-Imbara, one of the paladins of king Dutthagâmanï was once enjoying the bounty of Bacchus, and, on this occasion, as one aspect of the revelry, damsels carried various decorative elements among which were atamangalas and solosmangalasd Again in Anagatavamsa (14th cent. A. C.) which gives an account of the future Buddha Maitreya, it is said that on the occasion he would be attaining Enlightenment, the gods would be carrying objects such as chatras (parasols), cámaras (flywhisks) atamangala and solosmangala.5 The astamangala plays an important role in more or less all Bali rituals, whereas its extended version solosmangala is rarely mentioned. In the Bali ritual called Devolmangallaya, along with atamangala the solosmangala is also mentioned, and as usual in such rituals, they are to be drawn with grains of rice spread on a mat or on the floor.6 The fact that solosmangala is mentioned along with the atamangala indicates that the two groups are intimately connected. In fact, Rasavahinl7 in which the story of Gotha-Imbara is found, refers to only the auspicious artefacts</page><page sequence="2">80 (nânâmangala vidhâne), whereas Saddharmâlankâraya of a later date, where the Sinhala version of the story appears, adds both atamangala and solosmangala as well. However, these references to solosmangala in inscriptions and in Sinhala literature show that the sodasamangala was well-known to the Sinhalese at least from about the 12th century A. C. to about the 14th century. Nevertheless, none of the above-mentioned texts states what these sixteen objects are. On the other hand elsewhere I have tentatively identified the contents of a garbhapdtra [GP (C)] from Bunnâhapola in Kurunagala District, as containing the remnants of a sodasamangala (Sinh. solosmangala).8 In the meantime Vaijayanta Tantra a Sanskrit treatise on arts, crafts, rituals and iconography of the Palanetary divinities, was published in 1984.9 This unique work which seems to have been well-known to the ancient craftsmen of Sri Lanka, gives a wealth of information on sodasamangala and many other subjects of cultural and sociological import. The purpose of this paper is to identify and determine the symbols that constitute sodasamangala as reflected in literary as well as archaeological sources, and assess their symbolic content. SODASAMANGALA Literary Evidence As already stated,, although the term sodasamangala (Sinh. solosmangala) the Sixteen Auspicious Objects, has been referred to in medieval Sinhalese inscriptions and literature, until the publication of Vaijayanta Tantra in 1984, there was no detailed account of this group of symbols. Vaijayanta Tantra not only mentions what these sixteen objects are, but also other details such as the respective directions, various divinities and Sages associated with them but also their specific use in art, architecture and ritual. In fact Vaijayanta Tantra gives four separate accounts of the sodasamangala of which three are more or less identical.10 All four accounts give certain information which enrich our knowledge of not only the sodasamangala but also that of the kindred group of symbols astamangala. For convenience of reference to the four sodasamangalas mentioned in Vaijayanta Tantra the following abréviations SM (A), SM (B), SM (C) and SM (D) will be employed. The designations of the symbols given within parentheses are the Sinhala equivalents mentioned in the gloss (sannaya)." The SM (A) mentions the sixteen objects in the following order: ( 1 ) srivatsa (sirivasa), (2) naga {ata) - elephant, (3) vdladhi (valvidund) - fly whisk, (4) kürma - tortoise, (5) ankusa (akusssa) - elephant goad, (6) vajraka {vajraudhaya) - the adamantine weapon, (7) mina (matsya) - fish, (8) kunta (kuntaya) - spear, (9) nandi (nañdavata) - nandydvarta or svastika, (10) kuthdra {keteriya) - hatchet, (11) vesthana {basdavelu - should be badavelu),12 - bhadrapitha or the auspicious seat, (12) asvattha</page><page sequence="3">81 (bo-gasa) - the Bodhi Tree, (13) sankha (sakaya) - conch shell, (14) chaityapotha (agaya, sitivatiya) - lamp mounted on apost, (15) ghatayudha (pürnakumbhaya) - filled pot and (16) dhvaja (dhvajaya) - flag.13 This account of sodasamangala specifically mentions that in alter nate order (i. e., the odd numbers in the list) half of these symbols form the 'standard' astamangala. Thus the following symbols (i) srïvatsa, (ii) vdladhi or cámara, (iii) ankusa, (iv) miria,-(y) nandi or svastika, (vi) vesthana or bhadrapitha, (vii) sankha, and (viii) ghatayudha are the well known astamangala of the ancient Sinhalese14 [See Appendix II, (A)]. The fact that this particular group of eight auspicious symbols has been specifically mentioned as 'the astamangala' implying that it is the standard astamangala and the remaining eight auspicious symbols are not on a par with it, is rather intriguing. Since this 'standard astamangala' has been extensively used in art, architecture and rituals of the Sinhalese, and that it had been known to them in one form or other for over 1700 years,15 the Sinhalese seem to have considered it as the generally accepted form of astamangala,16 As it will be shown in the following pages, it plays a very important role in the sodasamangala as well. The other group of eight symbols, on the other hand, had been mentioned only in Vaijayanta Tantra and apparently it had not been depicted in plastic form. However, it is quite evident that this latter group of eight symbols is also auspicious in nature and without any hesitation it too can be definitly considered as astamangala in every sense of the word. In order to distinguish the two groups, in this paper the so-called 'standard astamangala' will be henceforth referred to as 'astamangala-/' whereas the other will be referred to as ' astamangala II'. Ány other variations will be indicated as deemed suitable. The SM (B) mentions the same list of sodasamangala with slight variations in the designations of the symbols (See Table I and Appendix II (B). This account gives other details such as the divinities whose emblems (Skt. âyudha, Sinh. avi) these symbols are; the trees or the groves, their abodes; and their appropriate food, flowers and directions.17 SM (C) too mentions the same list of sodasamangala. Here again some terms are misspelt and in certain instances variations of the terms are given. How ever, as to the identity of the objects there is not the slightest doubt. This account mentions the sages (Rsis) who are associated with the symbols. It is said that these sages, who are the custodians of the sixteen suspicious symbols, presented them to the divinités concerned18 (see Table I and Appendix II-C). Like the SM (A), the SM (D) too mentions only the sixteen symbols. However, in this instance the designations of some of the symbols considerebly differ from those of SM (A), SM (B) and SM (C). The order of occurrence of the symbols and their respective directions, which are uniform in the other three accounts, also differ. Thus the list of SM (D) as</page><page sequence="4">82 Table I Analysis of Sodasamangala Accounts in Vaijayanta Tantra Sodasamangala (A, B &amp; C) Directionss Graha Divinities Rsis SM (D) 01.

SM (D) adds, that, beginning with the ankusa in the eastern direction, the remaining symbols should be depicted in the order of occurrence mentioned above.19 The Vaijayanta Tantra account of the SM (D) is highly corrupted and is evidently a distorted version of the text. As in the case of SM (A) this sodasamangala too has been referred to as consisting of two groups of astamangalas (dvaustau) which means that the astamangala-I is an essential component of the sodasamangala as well. But an examination of the symbols of sodasamangala shows that bhadrapitha, one of the sym bols of astamangala-I is missing from this account of sodasamangala. None of the new terms mentioned therein can be considered as referring to this symbol, This further confirms the defective nature, of this sodasamangala. Of the sixteen symbols only eleven symbols are identical with those referred to in SM (A), SM (B) and SM (C). Of the designations of the remaining five symbols only two symbols can, with a certain degree of probability, be associated with two of the newly introduced symbols (see Table I and Appendix II - D). For instance the first part of the term 'g aja válaka' may be counted as a reference to 'mattebha' or 'karindra' both meaning 'elephant' (gaja), although in the gloss, the compound word gaja vdlaka has been defined as a club (gado) having the likeness of the tail of an elephant. The gloss explains 'reha' as a flame, which can be considered as a reference to 'caityapotha,' the lamp. Since the bhadrapitha of the ancient Sinhalese astamangala (i.e. AM-I) had the likeness of a tripod,20 perhaps 'trisülaka' may be an erroneous reference to this symbol. If 'khadga' has been used in place of kuthdra (both are weapons), the occurrence of candra alone has to be explained. Evidently this word has to be coupled with 'asvattha'. Between these two terms candra (moon) and asvattha (Bodhi Tree), there seems to be no connection whatsoever. This however, does not mean that SM (D) is a variant form of sodasamangala. For all intents and purposes this sodasamangala may be considered as a defective one. Nevertheless, reference to symbols such as gadd (club), khadga (sword), trisülaka (trident) and candra (moon) in the text as well as in the gloss, should not be disregarded altogether, for when we discuss the archaeological evi dence of sodasamangala some of these symbols come into the scene.

A conjectural reconstruction of the sodasamangala as described in Vaijayanta Tantra The Symbols of AM -I are those of the standard astamangala of the Sinhalese. The symbols of AM-II have been selected arbitrarily from Mediaeval Sinhalese art. The names of Divinities whose, emblems these symbols are, and the directions they are associated with, also have been indicated. The identification of the symbols, commencing from top most point in clockwise order is as follows: l.srivatsa, 2. karindra (elephant), 3. cámara (flywhisk), 4. Kürma (tortoise), 5. ankusa (goad), 6.

The Two Groups of Astamangala Astamangala I In the Vaijayanta Tantra account of sodasamangala, it is specifi cally stated that, of the two groups of astamangala it consists of, one is the ' Standard astamangala' ( AM-I) known to the Sinhalese from about the 3rd century A. C. to the modern times in varying degrees of transformation.21 The other half of sodasamangala consists of another group of Eight Auspicious Symbols (AM-II). Unlike the first group of astamangala this one has never been depicted in any form of plastic art. The astamangala-1 consists of the following eight symbols:- srivatsa, cámara, ankusa, matsya or matsyayugma, svastika, bhadrapitha, sankha and pürnakumbha. This astamangala had been known to the Sinhalese from about the 4th century A.C. Elsewhere I have shown that this particular group of astamangala (i.e. AM-I) has been depicted in art to represent two themes, namely (1) Sri theme and (2) Anavatapta theme.22 Astamangala depicting Sri theme One peculiar feature of this astamangala is that the symbols have been depicted in such a way that the resulting configuration represents the Sri theme. In this scheme the srivatsa denoting Sri, the Lotus Goddess, is the central symbol around which the remaining symbols are organised. For instance, in this device the cardinal symbol srivatsa is invariably placed above a pürnakumbha, the filled vessel from which a cluster of lotus shoots and lotus flowers issues forth. Thus, the srivatsa is represented as arising from a lotus pool. The remaining symbols are placed according to the whims and fancies of the artist in such a way that the whole composition maintains a sense of balance and proportion. The ivory seals recovered from the Northern âyâka of the Jetavana stupa in Aunuradhapura represent this category of astamangala23 (Fig. 3). Mânasàra, a Sanskrit manual of art and architecture, gives a vivid description of the order in which the Hindu version of this category of astamangala is to be represented. It is specifi cally stated that srivatsa should be represented in the centre and the filled vessel, pürnakumbha should be depicted below it (srlvatsam madhyame kuryát tasyádhah pürnakumbhakam)24 (Fig. 2). Since srivatsa, as I have already stated, is a symbol representing Sri (sirivacchanti siri angam), the Lotus Goddess, these astamangalas can be described as representing the Sri theme as sculptured on the gateways of Sanci and Bharhut stupas25 (Fig. 4). Astamangala depicting Anavatapta Theme The second category of this astamangala depicts the Anavatapta</page><page sequence="8">86 Fig. 2. A conjectural reconstruction of Mânâsara Astamangala Fig. 3. An ivory seal from Jetavana stupa (c. 3rd cert. A C)</page><page sequence="9">87 theme and in this context the very same eight symbols have been organised around a lotus rosette26 or a shallow depression27 in the following order: srlvatsa in the east, cámara in the south-east, ankusa in the south, matsya or matsyayugma in south-west, svastika in the west, bhadrapitha in the north-west, sankha in the north and pürnakumbha in the north-east (see Fig. 6 &amp; Appendix I). The lotus rosette or the shallow depression in these instances represents a lake. The finest example of this type of astamangala representing the Anavatapta theme is a large slab of stone recovered from the premises of Ruvanvalisaya.28 Here in addition to the eight auspicious symbols the four beasts associated with the mythical lake Anavatapta, namely elephants, bulls, horses and lions, a pair of each kind are repre sented as flanking srlvatsa in the east, ankusa in the south, svastika in the west and sankha in the north respectively29 (Fig. 5). One important feature of this symbolic representation of Anavatapta is that the srlvatsa has been represented as being flanked by two elephants with their trunks raised in the act of aspersing the symbol. As already stated srlvatsa is an aniconic representation of Sri, the Lotus Goddess. This motif can be considered as an aniconic representation of Gaja-LaksirTi form of Sri. In short the eastern outlet of Anavatapta represents Abhiseka Sri.30 This reminds us of the Siri-Kâlakanni Játaka where Siri in a contest with her antagonist Kalakanni has won the right to bathe at the eastern gate of Anavatapta.31 In other words, here the Anavatapta has been represented as the bathing place of Sri. The important thing is that this group of astamangala, whether it depicts the Sri theme as in the case of Jetavana astamangala seals or the Anavatapta theme as in the Ruvanvalisaya astamangala, Sri the Lotus Goddess is an essential feature in both the motifs. Eminent Indologists such as Ananda Coomaraswamy ,32 and Heinrich Zimmer,33 are unanimous in their opinion that Sri represents Prakrti, the matter or primordial substance-the Female Principle. Srlvatsa is now firmly established as the aniconic representation of Sri, and it is the central symbol of Astamangala I. This astamangala, whether it represents the Sri theme or the Anavatapta theme, is invariably associated with Sri and the mythical lake Anavatapta. In as much as Sri is the Primordial Mother Goddess, Anavatapta, the Lotus Lake is representative of the primordial waters, the place of origin of the Cosmic Lotus from which the world evoloved at the beginning of a world cycle (kalpa).M Both the goddess Sri as well as the mythical lake Anavatapta are representati ve of matter or substance, Prakrti. In short this astamangala forming one half of sodasamangala is Prakrti, the Female Principle. Since Prakrti, the Female Principle, is complementary to purusa, the Male Principle, the remaining half of sodasamangala, namely the astamangala II should logically represent Purusa, the Male Principle. On the basis of this hypothesis the astamangala II consisting of the eight auspicious symbols, mattebha - the elephant in rut, kürma - the tortoise, vajra - the adamantine weapon, kunta - the spear, kuthdra the hatchet, asvattha - the Bodhi Tree, caityapotha the lamp fixed to a post and dhvaja</page><page sequence="10">Fig. 4. A relief depicting Sri from Saflci - the standard, can be considered as repesenting Purusa, the Male Principle (see Figs. 1:2, 1:4, 1:6, 1:8, 1:10, 1:12, 1:14 &amp; 1:16). Astamangala II representing the Purusa As this group of eight auspicious symbols had not been a popular astamangala as such, no visual representation of it has been found.35 Hence, it is appropriate that we investigate the eight auspicious symbols individually as well as collectively, as regards their symbolic value, in order to assess their validity to represent the purusa element. Mattebha - the Elephant in rut In the accounts of sodasamangalas the elephant has been referred to by other designations such as karlndra,36 or naga.*1 SM (B) associates it with Mara38 the Evil One as well as Kama, the personification of lust. The sage Bhrgu is the custodian of this beast and he presented it to Mara.39 In</page><page sequence="11">%" ;.\/^x&gt; »••-•&gt;, *..»*• i .••'.•»« I " . . lv ' * I h'-: /'-•' \\^, '■'""••T-- ' « » • *,Y ' ',&gt;• i 11 &lt; * 1 * a "ÇHK -V ScML .«fe^ "v¡ ' &gt; i I * . : y.'.-. ^* » v ifi v TBK-7* d *;AM.ja£=E£zm 1 ;•*]■;•.

Kürma - the tortoise Kurma or its oceanic relative kàsyapa (Pâli, kacchapa) has not been mentioned in any other account of astamangala known so far. But Pali commentary on Mangala sutta mentions kacchapa as one of the auspicious objects considered worthy of being touched (muta mangala).41 According to some accounts 'kurma' is an archaic manifestation of the 'Lord of All Creatures' (Prajápati), who procreated the universe and its beings'. Later he became the kürma avatára of Visnu42 In some sculptures depicting Sri, she is shown as perched on a kalpavrksa issuing from the mouth of a tortoise.43 Kurma is considered the attribute of Visnu,44 and sage Vâsukhl presented it to that divinity. In a sodasamangala figure kürma is placed in between south and south-east45 (Fig. 1:4).</page><page sequence="12">90 Wd AS a Fig. 6. Perfecd form of Astamangala, from Valigama. Vajra - the Adamantine Weapon Vajra is the adamantine weapon of Indra. It is one of the powerful weapons mentioned in Pâli literature,46 and it is certainly the most popular among the Buddhists. The vajra is of special significance in Mahàyàna Buddhism, and iconographically as well as conceptually it is connected to satti the so-called 'triratna' symbol.47 By the time vajra as known to the Mahayanists came into vogue, satti in its classical form had disappeared from the scene.48 In fact by this time it had developed into two apparently diffferent forms, ( 1 ) as vajra of the Mahàyansits49 and (2) as a simple form of a spear among the Buddhists of Myanmar, Thailand and other South east Asian countries.50 In Sri Lanka too it seems to have assumed the form of a spear (kuntáyudha). However, by about the 6th or 7th century, on account of the Mahàyàna influence, the vajra too came into usage. The Vaijayanta Tantra associates vajra with Sakra (Indra) and according to the same authority it was presented to this deity by sage Panibhadra.51 It is represented in the subdirection south of south-east (Fig. 1:6).</page><page sequence="13">91 Fig. 7.

In other words, like vajra the term kunta is also related to the symbol generally referred to as triratna. However, by about the 7th century A. C. these two symbols (i.e.vajra and kunta) have been treated as two separate symbols. Vaijayanata Tantra associates kunta with Saudarana or Skanda whose weapon is sakti (Pâli, satti). The sage called Kusdnvita is the custodian of kunta and he presented it to Skanda.55 The Direction assigned to kunta in a sodasamangala is west of south-west (Fig. 1:8). Kuthara - the Hatchet Vaijayanta Tantra mentions kuthara as the emblem of Ganesa, the elephant headed god of the Hindus.56 He is the brother of Skanda. Symbols that could be identified as kuthdras are seen in some garlands consisting of symbols in place of beads, represented in a kalpavrksa figure on a stele from Sanci torana. The sage Parnadipa presented kuthara to Ganesha.57 The direction allocated to it in a sodasamangala is the sub direction west of north-west (Fig. 1:10). Asvattha - the Bodhi Tree Asvattha - also called 'Bodhyam' or Bodhivrksa is the emblem of Tejo Rsi or Mahàmuni - the Great Sage. Asvattha is usually described as a vanaspati, the lord of the forest, having five branches, four of which represent the four cardinal directions while the fifth pointing upward together with the main trunk represents the axis of the world.58 This form of the asvattha is a cosmic symbol. The sage called Bhàrgava presented it to Tojo Rsi referred to above. The asvattha has been assigned to the sub direction north of north-west.59 Caityapotha - the lamp fixed to a post Caityapotha, also called caityam or pradipa is a lamp fixed to a tall post described in Sinhalese as 'sitivatiya'. In all probability it is the same as dipayasti mentioned in association with sarvamangala,60 The lamp has been considered an auspicious symbol from time immemorial and its connection to agni the Fire God is evident. Votive lamps in metal as well as in terra cotta have been deposited in Relic chambers and garbhapdtras in ancient stupas.61 According to Vaijayanta Tantra this symbol has been attributed to Vâlmikl Muni, a present from sage Indra Rsi. Caityapotha is assigned to the sub-direction north of north-east62 (Fig. 1:14). Dhvaja - the Standard Dhvaja (Pali, dhaja) has been considered an auspicious object from the earliest stage of civilisation. Dhajagga sutta of Khuddaka Nikdya says</page><page sequence="15">93 that fear and excitement of those beholding the flags of divinities such as Indra, Varuna etc. will be dispelled.63 Dhvaja is very often conceived as a p\\\ax(stambha) with an emblem surmounting it. In Tibetan astamangalas dhvaja is one of the symbols.64 Among the auspicious signs adorning the soles of the feet of the Buddha dhaja and patdka (streamer) are also mentioned.65 In the sodasamangala the dhvaja is considered the emblem of Kama, the Indian god of love, in which case it is considered as consisting of the fish emblem (minadhvaja or makaradhvaja). The sage Krodhavrddhi who is the custodian of this emblem, presented it to Kama. In a sodasamangala figure the dhvaja should be depicted in the sub-direction east of north-east66 (Fig. 1:16). The afore mentioned astamangala II shows that, except for two symbols namely, mattebha (elephant) and kürma (tortoise) the remaining six objects are more or less objects traditionally associated with the axis mundi.67 The symbols vajra, kunta, asvattha and caityapotha clearly indicate this feature in no uncertain terms and all of them are convention ally accepted as the Male Principle - Purusa. The kuthara is a weapon closely connected to vajra. The elephant in this instance, the charge of Mara, the Evil One, is symbolic of lust and virility. The tortoise is an incarnation of Visnu and also symbolic of the procreative activity of Prajâpati,68 Thus, these eight symbols individually as well as collectively represent the Male Principle. However, this group of eight auspicious symbols, in contrast to the astamangala I which undoubtedly represents the Female Principle, appears to differ in a number of points. The astamangala I representing the Female Principle has srïvatsa the sign manual of Sri the Lotus Goddess as its centre piece. This is true of both versions of this astamangala, namely one representing the Sri theme and the other representing the Anavatapta theme. In the former instance the srïvatsa is specifically mentioned as occupying the Central position in the astamangala complex, while in the Anavatapta theme the srivatsa occu pies the eastern direction of Anavatapta lake. In this connection it must be mentioned that east is the most significant direction in Indian reckoning.69 Moreover, astamangalas depiciting the Anavatapta theme are centred around a lotus (padma, kamalâ) and the association of the latter with Sri or her sign manual sñvatsa is too well-known to be elatorated here, In a separate study on the question of the Male and the Female Principles in early Buddhist art I have shown that srïvatsa symbol itself represented the female Principle while satti (the so-called triratna symbol) and its transformation the vajra (yajira) represented the Male Principle.70 We have already shown that centred around srïvatsa a specific astamangala representing the Female Principle had come into vogue as early as the 3rd century A. C.71</page><page sequence="16">94 Now the question arises whether centred around satti/vajra an astamangala representing the Male Principle has ever been represented in early Buddhist art? In this connection it must be mentioned that although astamangala incorporating satti and vajra are known to have existed,72 there is no literary evidence to show that an astamangala specifically representing the Male Principle had been created. On the other hand astamangala II under consideration incorporates vajra as well as kunta (spear), both evolved out of satti which, in early Buddhist art, definitely represented the Male Principle - Purusa. However, in this instance there is no indication that either of these symbols took precedence over the other symbols. On the face value they seem to be of equal status and significance with the rest of the symbols, which, too, represent the Male Principle in their own right. Usually in the representation of Male and Female Principles in art, for example, satti and sirivaccha, the former is treated with greater importance as at Sânci and Bhârhut." On the other hand in the early art of Sri Lanka they have been treated more or less as equals.74 This position seems to have changed a little towards the latter half of the Anuradhapura period. For example in the sodasamangala under consideration the Astamangala I representing the Female Principle definitely occupies a more important position. The symbols of this astamangala occupy the eight chief directions, whereas the symbols of the Astamangala II have been relegated to the eight sub-sub-directions75 (Figs. 1:2 to 16 all even numbers). This is probably due to the fact that astamangala I representing Sri came into vogue as early as the 3rd century A. C. and survived till recent times, always with srivatsa as the leading symbol, representing the Female Principle.76 In contrast satti, although representing the Male Principle in the early Indian and Sinhalese art, apparently had not been represented in an astamangala specifically representing the Male Principle in the same way as srivatsa did. Of course there were astamangalas in which satti (the so called triratna) as well as srivatsa were incorporated. The earliest examples of Jainaastamangalas fall into this category77. These astamangalas in fact represent the biunity of the Male and Female Principles. As some authorities have pointed out the satti/'triratna ' disappeared from Indian art by about the 4th century A. C.78 and, as already pointed out, it was replaced either by the vajra of the Mahayanists or by the kuntdyudha of the Sinhalese79. In the sodasamangala as described in Vaijayanta Tantra the satti symbol appears in forms described above (Fig. 1:6 &amp; 1 ;8). In spite of these drawbacks, the vajra is both iconographically as well as conceptually the most appropriate symbol to represent the Male Principle or Purusa. In this connection it must be mentioned that Vaijayanta Tantra in certain instances refers to a ' vaj ras taman gala,'m an astamangala in which vajra is the leading symbol or, in its totality, represents the 'vajra'. In fact this</page><page sequence="17">95 designation ' vajrâstamangala ' befits astamangala II of the sodasamangala. In Buddhist art and literature vajra, as already stated, is a symbol associated with the Cakravartin or the Bodhisatva, especially in the form of Vajrasatvaand even with the Buddha himself, all of them Mahapurisas.u In short astamangala-II of sodasamangala represents the Male Principle, whereas the astamangala-1 represents the Female Principle. Since there is positive evidence, both literary and archaeological, that, in association with Sri, the Lotus Goddess and her sign manual srivatsa, an astamangala (i.e. AM-I) representing the Female Principle has .been employed in Sinhalese art from the third century A. C., it is logically feasible that centred around a vajra or one of its equivalents too, there should be an astamangala representing the Male Principle. What is presented in Vaijayanta tantra as the second half of the double astamangala (dvau astau) or sodasamangala, is this astamangala, which is complementary to AM-I. In conclusion it can be said that Vaijayanta Tantra provides a perfect example of two groups of astamangala, one representing the Female Principle (Prakrti) and the other representing the Male Principle (Purusa). In contrast to Sivalinga and the Yoni of the Hindus82 and Yang and Yin of the Chinese,83 two instances of representations of Principal Opposites in two ancient civilizations of the east, sodasamangala is a unique example, where two groups of Eight Auspicious Symbols have been collectively employed to express the same concept in Buddhist art of the Sinhalese.

In the consecration ceremonies of kings and gods the Sixteen Auspicious Symbols should be displayed. The divinities associated there with should be propitiated with appropriate oblations such as food, vehicles, etc. 2. The Sun (in the east) should be offered with Srîvatsa, yellow rice, three kinds of acrid condiments (trikatuka), a lotus flower, and leaves of the silk cotton tree; in the sub-direction north of south-east, the Mâradeva should be propitiated with the offerings of a figure of an Elephant in rut (mattebha), leaves of the sala tree and grey coloured rice; in the south-east Venus (Daityamantri, the teacher of the Titans), should be propitiated with nakkamdla leaves, new ghee rice and fly whisk (cámara); in the sub direction south of south-east Govindadeva (Visnu) should be propitiated by offering a figure of a tortoise (kürma), sacred kusa grass, lotus flower and rice mixed with honey. 3. The offerings suitable for Mars (Kuja or Ksitija - the offspring of the Earth), are red rice, ghee, goad (ankusa) and kadamba leaves in the south; in the sub-direction south of south-west, Sakra (Indra) should be offered Vajra, yugmadald leaves, jasmine flowers and white rice; in the intermediate direction south-east, Rdhu and Ketu (the Ascending and Descending Nodes of the Moon), should be offered the figure of the Double Fish (minadvanda), rice mixed with gingilli seed, 'ristagahana' leaves; this is the accepted practice; in the sub-direction of north of south west, Sauddrana (Skandha), should be offered the Spear (sakti), mango (cuta) leaves, lotus flower and ghee. 4.

Usually, the figures of the emblems, groves (i.e. tree), etc. are incorporated in an anthropomorphic representation. However, in rituals such as the consecration of a king, the divinities are not represented by anthropomorphic figures and the obla tions for them are placed in a particular space alloted to each divinity in a mandata plan. On such occasions a figure of the emblem, and a few leaves of the sacred tree are included among the other oblations offered to the deity. It is on account of this ritualistic tradition, that, although the text mentions a grove (vana) of specific trees, the gloss interprets vana as symbolically represented by a few leaves of the particular tree. Accord ingly, I have rendered 'vana' (grove) as 'leaves' in my translation as well. APPENDIX II (C) Sodasamangala - C 1. The srlvatsa is born lorne by the sage Krsnaveda, the majestic elephant by the sage Bhrgu, the flywhisk by the sage Nàrada and the figure of the tortoise by the (sage) Vàsukhi. 2. The sage Agasti (Kumbhamuni) holds the goad, the sage Panibhadra (?) the vajra, the sage Kapila the pair of fish and the great sage Kusànvita holds the spear. 3. The sage Akhila bears the nandyâvarta (svastika), the sage Parnadipa the hatchet, the sage Bhârgava the auspicious seat and the sage Mahàmuni the Bodi Tree (asvattha). 4. The sage Dharamuni bears the conch shell, the sage Indra the lamp mounted on a post, the sage Hema the pitcher and the sage Krodhavrddhi the standard. These are the sixteen objects. 5. These sixteen objects the sages have presented to the divinities concerned such as Sun (Bhânu). Similarly, the Brahmin holymen bear the sixteen objects. These sixteen auspicious objects should be done in gold. See Vaijayanta Tantra 14: 46-50. Comment: The Sanskrit Text SM-C and its Sinhala gloss as presented in Vaijayanta Tantra is defective. The names of some of the sages and the designations of some of the symbols have been mixed up and in some instances distorted, resulting in gross misinterpretation of the subject matter. The names of the custodian sages of the symbols of AM-I are</page><page sequence="21">99 available in Bali texts of the Sinhalese (see Sedaraman, 1964, pp. 93-101 and some Grahapanti of my collection of Bali Kavi) and I have collated them with Vaija.

Oh, (Prince) Skanda, all these should be measured by the length of the finger of the patron of the sacrifice. Listen, these will confer all glory and welfare on the patron of the sacrifice. Comment: The Sanskrit original and the Sinhala gloss are defective. See the text under Sodasamangala - D for further information. APPENDIX III Vaijayanta Among the Sanskrit manuals on arts, crafts, architecture and iconography, that were known to the ancient Sinhalese, Vaijayanta or Vaijayanta Tantraya is one of the most well-known. In contrast to other similar works, Vajayanta gives instruction on the making of articles for the use of royalty and other dignitaries. Ananda Coomaraswamy in his Mediaeval Sinhalese Art (1908, p. 67) says, "Vaijayantaya, a compen dium of instruction in the arts, containing, for example, a detailed description of the sixty-four kinds of jewels proper for gods, kings, and men, the design and quantity of gold required for each; measurements of</page><page sequence="22">.100 swords, thrones, dagobas etc." As a brief supplement to this succinct account, I wish to add that this text also gives details of making crowns, parasols, kalpavrksas, vessels and other utensils for daily use as well as for use in rituals. In the process it gives details of symbols such as astamangala, the Eight Auspicious Symbols, sodasamangala, the Sixteen Auspicious Symbols, and iconography of Planetary divinities (grahamandala), Solar Zodiac (rdsimandala), Lunar Zodiac or Constellations (saptavimsati naksatra). Hence, the designation ' Vaijayanta' which means the palace or flag of Indra, the king of the gods. The author of Vaijayanta is not known. It is probably a compilation by several authors, at different times. Accord ing to Professor Nandasena Mudiyanse, this was a work of the twelfth century or a century or two later. The book contains over 1929 verses in 21 chapters, and the last two chapters do not contain the Sinhala gloss (sannaya). The Sanskrit text is full of orthographical errors. This valuable text has not been translated into English as yet. According to Ananda Coomaraswamy (MSA : p. 209) Mudliyar E. R. Gooneratne had undertaken to translate it into English. About this venture nothing more is known. The Sinhala script text of Vaijayanta Tantraya has been edited by Nandasena Mudiyanse and published by the University of Kelaniya in 1984. NOTES 1.

The Sinhalese terra badavelu seems to be a substitute for Skt. vesthana, meaning that which is used in wrapping round (the waist) i.e. a belt or even a long piece of cloth. Sikhavalañda ha Sikhavalañda hâ Vinisa, edited by D. B. Jayatilalka (1934, p. 48) explains badavelu as bhadrapltha (auspicious seat). By the time Sinhala Bali texts were composed (c. 17th cent.) the writers as well as the performers of Bali rituals had forgotten the fact that the astamangala i. e. (AM-I) is incorporated in sodasamangala. Hence, they treated these terms as referring to two separate groups of figures. 13. Vaijayanta, Ch. Ill: 11-12; also see Appendix II A. 14. Karunaratne, T.

In all probability AM-II was created at a later date (c. 8th or 9th cent. A. C.) as the complementary astamangala to its older companion AM -1. Since AM -1 represents the Female Principle (Prakrti), it is imperative that an astamangala representing the Male Principle (Purusa) too, is a must. 36. Vaijayanta, Ch.

Likewise each symbol has a sage as its custodian and this sage presents the symbol to the divinity concerned. Thus each symbol is associated with à graha (seizer) divinity. These divinities and sages are intimately connected to the symbols. It is beyond the scope of this paper to-discuss this aspect. It will be attended to in a separate paper. 37. Vaijayanta, Ch.

The association of vajra with the Bodhisatva Vajrasatva is well-known. The Buddha's seat is very often referred to as vajrâsana and somtimes figures of vajra are depicted on it. Since Cakravartin-the Universal Monarch (Mahdpurisa) is virtually a Bodhisatva, it is reasonable to associate vajra with a Universal Monarch as well, although there is no literary support of it. However, it appears that the early kings seem to have used satti/ vajra as their symbol of regal authority. See my paper published in J RAS SL (NS), Vol. XXXII, pp 45-62. 82. Rao, T. A.
