In this summer of 2002, when drought is here and water is scarce, you open the floodgates and books on water pour out. There are fat books (Norris Hundley's revised and updated Great Thirst weighs in at 800 pages); there are thin books (Ricardo Petrella's The Water Manifesto at 135 pages takes the cake); there are broad books and narrow ones (Marq de Villiers' Water deals with the world and Jose A. Rivera's Acequia Culture limits itself to New Mexico community irrigation ditches). There's even a book on water books (David Cassuto's Dripping Dry). Almost all the authors of the books reviewed here pay homage to the famous remark attributed to Mark Twain: "Whiskey is for drinking and water for fighting." In his Introduction to the uneven collection of essays on water yoked together in Fluid Arguments, editor Char Miller proposes to re-work Twain to say that whiskey is for drinking and water for writing. Water shortages surely have helped produce this torrent of recent words. You don't have to be a demographer to know that a fixed amount of water divided by a growing world population means trouble. Every water lawyer knows that interest in water rights is inversely related to the amount of available water, year to year and season to season. But the flood of literature reflects a deeper malaise. We've lost whatever bearings we once had. Can any of these books help us find them? The revised and updated version of Norris Hundley's magisterial The Great Thirst, a classic history of California's century-long battle with water, brings the story to the end of the twentieth century. For the most part, Hundley relates the endless efforts of California promoters and their political allies to bring water from the few places where it naturally occurred—the Colorado River, the Owens River Valley, northern California, to name a few of the famous battlegrounds—to where it was needed to make the desert boom—most obviously Los Angeles. Most of Hundley's revisions and additions cover the efforts to deal with the environmental consequences of these basic water policies. He describes the CalFed efforts to deal with the threatened Sacramento River/Bay Area delta, the recent efforts of Los Angeles to make amends in the desiccated Owens River Valley, and the efforts of the U.S. Department of the Interior to wean Los Angeles from a longstanding over-reliance on the Colorado River. These new stories add a new dimension to the basic California tale that Hundley told so well in earlier editions. The Great Thirst remains basically a narrative history. It describes California's massive 100-year battle with too little water in too few places. In reporting on the efforts to correct that shortcoming in nature's economy, The Great Thirst lacks either the sharper point of view that, for</page><page sequence="3">Fall 2002] BOOK REVIEWS 971 example, a Donald Worster might give it or the detail that a more intimate history might provide. Catherine Mulholland provides some of the intimate detail in her new biography of her much-maligned grandfather, turn-of-the-century Los Angeles water czar William Mulholland. His granddaughter accuses Hundley of "trivializing" William Mulholland's accomplishment in bringing water hundreds of miles across mountains from the Owens River Valley to Los Angeles at the turn of the twentieth century. The endless detail provided in this beautifully written biography of a Dublin born, self-made, hydraulic engineer makes up in depth for whatever superficial treatment is required by Hundley's breadth. Catherine Mulholland blames real estate speculators Fred Eaton and J.B. Lippincott, her grandfather's water compatriots, for whatever political and financial shenanigans might have been involved in taking the Owens River to Los Angeles. The story she tells here paints her father as a brilliant engineer, capable of conceiving the mechanics of moving and storing water on a scale theretofore inconceivable in the west but not much concerned with the political or ecological consequences of the move. To hear her tell it so eloquently and in such detail, William Mulholland was the first of those heroic western hydraulic engineers, followed by Herbert Hoover, Raymond Hill, Floyd Dominy, and Steve Reynolds, among many others, who transformed the western landscape. Despite the differences between them, Hundley and Mulholland tell the same story. It's the story of moving water to an increasing number of people by means of increasing technological ingenuity, embodied in Mulholland, and often with unintended disastrous environmental consequences, finally acknowledged by Hundley. Craig Childs' popular The Secret Knowledge of Water reverses this basic approach. Beautifully written and intensely individualistic, The Secret Knowledge is really the story of one writer's effort to bring himself to desert water, not vice versa. Forbidding deserts have always inspired seers and Childs' descriptions of his repeated searches for water in the most unlikely locations, the barren terrain of southwestern Arizona's High Sonoran desert, the slot canyons that feed the Colorado River, are inspiring in their respect for scant water in secret places. Childs knows the difference between him and Hundley, between his search for water and Mulholland's gargantuan efforts to move it. Describing the telltale traces in the desert that led him to secret water, Childs writes, "I started calling these trails 'waterlines.' Waterlines are the opposite of canals, moving people to water rather than water to people." Close observation for its own sake is what gives this remarkable book its power.</page><page sequence="4">972 NATURAL RESOURCES JOURNAL [Vol. 42 Childs' beautiful descriptions of water in place sometimes are too anthropomorphic. "Walking and swimming into this flood-formed canyon," he reports, I was overwhelmed with the feeling that everything here was animated—my muscles, the rocks, the water. I felt as if I were moving through a live body, taking note of the intricate organs of the flow of blood, and of bones, as if they had grown here. At rare moments he also unconsciously evokes desert irrigation. When, for example, Childs explains that "(t)here are two easy ways to die in the desert: thirst and drowning," he is describing the desert farmers constant problem of too much or too little water and the mammoth irrigation district's concern with drainage and drought. Otherwise, there are almost no connections between Hundley's vision, even as revised, and Childs'. There is a gulf in between. A similar difference of scale separates other more political books on the political economy of today's water crisis. Ricardo Petrella's A Water Manifesto comes at the worldwide problem of water from the broadest level of generalization. Mario Soares, internationally recognized European leader and a founding member of the Portuguese socialist party, wrote the introduction to this short, elegant volume. His spirit shows through everywhere in Petrella's work, which has the heft, feel, and look of the manifesto that it is. Indeed, it is socialist political theory at its most eloquent that informs what Petrella admits is a brief for water change. Petrella is horrified by the prospects of both state and private ownership of basic water resources, but it is not entirely clear how he would correct these flaws. His plea for "international solidarity" and "communal sustainability" in the face of scarce, badly distributed water resources worldwide is likely to mean more to Europeans, steeped in deep socialist traditions, than to Americans, who have always relegated socialism to the fringes of our political life. Still, Petrella's central concerns are as terrifying as his basic solutions are appealing. The fact that 1.4 billion residents of the earth, mostly living in the still fast-growing urban slums of southeast Asia and Central and South America, lack access to sanitary water is cause for grave concern. It's just not clear how his general solutions would address the problem. A plea for solidarity probably would not get you far at the Bureau of Reclamation office in Salt Lake City or at a municipal office in Bogota. Curiously, Jose C. Rivera's Acequia Culture suggests that New Mexico's ancient community ditch associations might embody in microcosm the water polity that Petrella argues for around the globe. In</page><page sequence="5">Fall 2002] BOOK REVIEWS 973 Acequia Culture, Rivera, a public policy professor at the University of New Mexico, analyses the 450-year history of a hydraulic political institution established to deliver water through a shared point of diversion in order to maintain small, self-sufficient desert communities. The customs and traditions Rivera finds in New Mexico's 250 or so community irrigation ditches emphasize precisely the political values that Petrella says are needed worldwide. These community ditches, says Rivera, are democratic, communitarian, and committed to a self sustaining public use of water. To bolster his manifesto, Rivera assembles the actual governing documents of a few New Mexico community ditch organizations. Students of these remarkable New Mexico institutions will appreciate access to the documents. But, as Rivera himself admits, most acequia governance escaped formal written regulations. Besides the formal rules he appends to his book, he relies on oral tradition and secondary court testimony to describe basic governance practices. Whether written or oral, the evidence often doesn't go as far as Rivera needs it to in order to justify his claim that the ditches represent the path of the future. For example, the formal ditch rules deal primarily with maintenance of the common structures of the shared ditch, not the really vexing problem of how to distribute water among the so-called "parciantes" of each ditch. And when it comes to competition for limited common water between acequias on the same river, Rivera doesn't offer much help except to say that the ditches didn't use the dreaded prescriptions of the prior appropriation doctrine to apportion inevitable short supplies. As a result, Acequia Culture remains at best a wonderful description of an anachronistic southwestern institution that never reached far enough beyond its immediate and limited concerns to show us how the solidarity and participatory democracy espoused by Petrella might solve even watershed, let alone worldwide, water problems. Late in the book, Rivera suggests at least two broad doctrines of western water law—federal reserved water rights and the property guarantees of the 1848 Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo—to which the surviving community ditches could attach their claims. However, the fit between the doctrines and the ditches is attenuated at best and doesn't do much to connect the institutions and the wider world of which they are a small part. Some recent books have tried to stuff the gap with water essays from every source and on every subject. Char Miller's Fluid Arguments, for example, gathers a ragtag bunch of 16 essays from a conference and tries to make a book of them. Fluid Arguments presents the work of academic, institutional, and "public" historians. It looks as far back in time as fourteenth century Native American irrigation in Arizona's Gila</page><page sequence="6">974 NATURAL RESOURCES JOURNAL [Vol. 42 River Basin and as far forward as new water competition in the twenty first century. Its scope is broad enough to encompass dam building and cattle grazing as well as water use. There's something in this mix for everyone. The quality of the ingredients is mixed. Some of the essays are brilliant in their conception. For example, Daniel McCool's "Winters Comes Home to Roost" puts the current late twentieth-century round of negotiated, rather than litigated, Native American water rights settlements in the context of the nineteenth-century Native American land treaties and analyses the modern water settlements from that older perspective. (The essay just led to the 2002 publication of McCool's book Native Waters: Contemporary Indian Water Settlements and the Second Treaty Era.) And Donald Pisani's "The Dilemma of Indian Water Policy, 1887-1928" brilliantly explores the role of federal wage labor in the early efforts to convert Indians into irrigation farmers. Many of the other essays, however, especially those growing out of expert reports in relatively recent lawsuits, are flat in their approach and not very illuminating. Distended by the courtroom context that sired them, those essays never acquire a shape of their own. In his introduction to the volume, editor Char Miller tries to give the collection a pleasing form. But, as we all know, water reflects everything, and the image that it casts, like the contents of this collection, is no clearer than the muddled world itself. A couple of recent journalistic efforts present more coherent pictures. Marq de Villier's Water, for one, surveys the globe from the hardscrabble South African farm, where he grew up with his grandfather, to Nevada, where he reports on a visit to the Hoover Dam. The twin perspectives of participant and journalist give the book some of its confident charm. de Villier is well traveled and so is this book. A chapter on the inter-related hydrological problems of Canada, the United States, and Mexico follows a chapter on Eygpt's struggle to further control the Nile in the face of upstream demands by Sudan, Uganda, and Ethiopia. A chapter entitled "To Give a Dam" considers the problems posed by tall dams in the United States, the Middle East, and China. The portrait that emerges is rich in detail but occasional errors don't help de Villier's cause. For example, he simply gets wrong the misbegotten efforts of Canadian industrialist Maurice Strong to transfer groundwater rights from the western slope of Colorado, where he had purchased a magnificent and unpedigreed chunk of land, to the eastern slope where the Denver area was dying of thirst. In addition, de Villier's recipes for change, set out in his final chapter called "Solutions and Manifestos," lacks the bite that specific prescriptions for specific situations would give. In the end Water serves the same function as Marc</page><page sequence="7">Fall 2002] BOOK REVIEWS 975 Riesner's Cadillac Desert, a book Marc de Villier's often cites. Like Cadillac Desert, Water serves as a beacon to an old and growing problem and to a new and critical point of view. If Water is characterized by its breadth, then Elizabeth Grossman's Watershed: The Undamming of America is characterized by its sharp, relentless focus. This slim volume reports on the growing movement to remove the many small and large dams that have transformed American rivers. From North Carolina to California, from Maine and Montana to Florida, Grossman follows the efforts of citizen activists and a dedicated bunch of government officials, led by ex secretary of the Interior Bruce Babbitt, whom Grossman at one point calls "the Dam-Buster-in-Chief," to tear down dams and restore downstream rivers to pre-dam days. Most of the dams Grossman writes about are peripheral to the water worlds in which they operate, either because they play a relatively small role in a much larger constructed water contraption or because they dam rivers for purposes long-ago abandoned. These dams, like the dams of Maine and North Carolina and the tributary dams high on the streams of the Southern Cascades, are relatively easy marks. But Grossman reports as well on efforts to remove the Colorado River's Glen Canyon Dam, surely a more complicated and more important proposition. With respect to Glen Canyon, Grossman focuses on the late David Brower, long-time director of the Sierra Club. Brower allowed the Colorado River dam to go in in the late 1960s and regretted the choice until his dying days. Grossman reports on Brower's regrets. She yokes Brower together with Flagstaff doctor Richard Ingebretsen and his Glen Canyon Institute in describing a growing movement to "decommission" the dam, to empty Lake Powell, and to restore the Colorado River below to its pre-dam state. Students of the Colorado River and people who have devoted their lives to its management will surely complain—and rightly so—that Grossman fails either to appreciate or to understand the complicated role of the Glen Canyon dam in the apportionment of water among the Upper Basin States of the Upper Colorado River Compact (New Mexico, Colorado, Utah, Wyoming) and between those compacting States and the Lower Basin States (basically Arizona, California, and Nevada). But those cavils are beside Grossman's point in this book. Watershed: The Undamming of America is a brief against the tall dams and a paean to the growing movement to remove them. To those interested in the more complex problems of western water, the fact of Watershed's existence is as important as what it says. Proponents of the undamming of America's rivers now have their own book.</page><page sequence="8">976 NATURAL RESOURCES JOURNAL [Vol. 42 Ellen Wohl's short, elegant Virtual Rivers begins where Grossman's Watershed would like to end, in undammed, free flowing rivers. Wohl focuses on those portions of the rivers of the Colorado front range lying upstream of the massive dams that control and mediate downstream flows. In other words, the rivers that are the subjects of Wohl's work already have achieved the state of grace that Grossman advocates. Wohl shows us that the heaven of undammed, free flowing western rivers isn't quite the ecological paradise Grossman envisions. Wohl's analysis shows that even without dams most free-flowing western rivers have already been fundamentally altered. The fact of the matter, according to Wohl, is that even these relatively unconstrained upstream reaches still suffer from the ecological damage caused by the late nineteenth century. Ravaged by logging and manmade fires, the steep Rocky Mountains poured sediments into the streams and creeks below. The change in flows and sediment loads changed everything in and around the rivers. The response eventually was to quit logging, suppress fires, and "restore" the streams. The pendulum swung back, past the natural state to one where the streams were protected from their own processes. As Wohl shows, stream yields increased by 50 percent in the late nineteenth century and decreased by 30 percent in the late twentieth, all as a result of upland riparian land use choices. Boulder's Clear Creek may look better today than it did 100 years ago, she argues, but it may not be functioning as richly as it could. In Virtual Rivers, Wohl brings the new language of conservation biology and stream system geomorphology to the high mountain creeks she analyses. Consider this expansion by Wohl of the notion that, unlike modern architecture where form follows function, with rivers function follows form: Similarly river function may be considered at varying levels of detail. At its simplest the function of a river is to transport water and sediment. But living organisms in all their amazing variety and abundance have effectively colonized even the most minute and specialized niches within the stream channels so that it is appropriate to regard river function as including an ecosystem component. Just as the river impoverished in form may consist of a fairly uniform trench, so too may a river impoverished in function support a depauperate aquatic flora and fauna. Those lacking specialized knowledge of rivers may be misled only too easily into assuming that a river is functioning well because its general form appears as expected. (169)</page><page sequence="9">Fall 2002] BOOK REVIEWS 977 Given this point of view, it's hard to argue with Wohl's conclusion that many of the undammed sections of the Front Range mountains look attractive but are in fact biologically impoverished remnants of the river that existed before the nineteenth century. This conclusion will give pause to those who think the rivers have been "restored," because Wohl redefines the notion of "restoration." Indeed, as Daniel Cassuto argues in Dripping Dry: Literature, Politics and Water in the Desert Southwest, the real first battle in the coming war over western water may center not on dams and diversions, not on endangered species and endangered farmers, but on the words that we use to describe the underlying realities and issues. Cassuto is a former English professor and a current California environmental lawyer so he is ideally equipped for the task he undertakes in this interesting book: to explore the deepest myths westerners have expressed at various times about their relationship to scarce water. Cassuto is not so much interested in Ellen Wohl's ecological reality as he is interested in the mythic reality, and so he concentrates on the popular regional literature that deals with water. In Dripping Dry, Cassuto takes on Mary Austin's The Ford (1917), John Steinbeck's The Grapes of Wrath (1939), Edward Abbey's The Monkey Wrench Gang (1975), and Barbara Kingsolver's Animal Dreams (1990). To each of these regional classics Cassuto brings a not so interesting historical analysis and a much more striking literary one. His analytic approach is full of the talk of postmodern deconstructionist literary theory with its repeated emphasis on water as an "absent signifier" in Steinbeck and on the "faux potlatch" involved in Edward Abbey's clarion call to dam destruction. Using this approach, Cassuto analyses Austin's and Steinbeck's reliance on the myth of reclamation, Abbey's reliance on the myth of restoration, and Kingsolver's difficulties in moving beyond either. Off-putting as Cassuto's esoteric language of postmodern literary theory sometimes can be, it's still hard to resist Cassuto's basic argument that a central problem in the current dilemma over western water is rhetorical. We are moving, he suggests, from the language of reaction to something more positive, somehow embodied in the new myth of "sustainability." No one quite knows, he argues, what that new myth means. While we work it out, there will be many new, conflicting definitions. Those conflicts will produce both cacophony and awkward silence in the twenty-first century as we struggle to define a new myth about western water. I, for one, know just what Cassuto is talking about. In 2002, a year after most of the works here reviewed came out, the UNM Press published my High and Dry: The Texas/New Mexico Struggle for the Pecos River. The book tells the story of the inter-state battle between the two</page><page sequence="10">978 NATURAL RESOURCES JOURNAL [Vol. 42 states for control of the Pecos. As a lawyer I had been involved in that lawsuit for 10 years from the late 1970s on. I wrote the book between 1990 and 2000, in the last ten years of the interminable water war. My book really deals with legendary New Mexico State Engineer Steve Reynolds and his inability at the end of his long career to keep up with the many changes that were coming to western water law. A man who always had known what to say in any circumstance, Reynolds had finally been silenced, first by a judge who wouldn't let him speak and then by death. Like Reynolds at the end of his life, I found that I had nothing to say at the end of the book and when it came time to write the last chapter. I wanted to conclude with some real solutions to the awful problems created by Texas v. New Mexico, but I had none. I couldn't see a clear path ahead to some new Pecos River world. So instead of heading into that morass, I turned 90 degrees and headed off into my own confusion as a water lawyer and irrigation gardener. My last 10,000-word chapter expressed that personal confusion. The UNM Press published the book, last chapter and all, this summer, the driest of all in 100 years. High and Dry got good reviews, but the critics especially liked that "surprising" (as one reviewer politely called it) last chapter. And now, reviewing the water books of others, I know why. Having lived intimately with southwestern water for thirty years, I am confused about where we are and where we want to be. Such confusion reflects conflicting values, conflicted attitudes, many words, in lots of languages. Somewhere in that confusion lies the path to a new water myth for the desert southwest and the rest of the world. The torrent of words in a dry season, the flood of technical articles by economists exploring "sustainability," the plethora of new books this year mark this struggle to find a new language to describe our new situation. Write on.</page></plain_text>
